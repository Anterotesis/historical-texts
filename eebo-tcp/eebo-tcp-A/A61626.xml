            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> OF the <hi>Socinian</hi> way of interpreting Scripture. Of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty it leaves us in as to the main articles of Faith, manifested by an Exposition of <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. suitable to that way. The state of the Controversie in general concerning the sufferings of Christ for us. He did not suffer the same we should have done. The grand mistake in making punishments of the nature of Debts; the difference between them at large discovered, from the different reason and ends of them. The right of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in God, proved against <hi>Crellius,</hi> not to arise from meer dominion. The end of punishment not bare Compensation, as it is in debts; what punishment due to an injured person by the right of Nature; proper punishment a result of Laws. <hi>Crellius</hi> his great mistake about the end of Punishments. Not designed for satisfaction of Anger as it is a desire of Revenge. <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> vindicated against <hi>Crellius.</hi> The Magistrates interest in Punishment distinct from that of private persons. Of the Nature of Anger in God, and the satisfaction to be made to it. <hi>Crellius</hi> his great arguments against satisfaction depend on a false Notion of Gods anger. Of the ends of divine Punishments, and the different nature of them in this and and the future state. <hi>pag.</hi> 239</item>

                           <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The particular state of the Controversie, concerning the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ. The Concessions of our Adversaries. The debate reduced to two heads: The first concerning Christs sufferings, being a punishment for sin, entred upon. In what sense <hi>Crellius</hi> acknowledgeth the sins of men, to have been the impulsive cause of the death of Christ. The sufferings of Christ proved to be a punishment, from Scripture. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the phrase of bearing sins. Of the Scape-Goats bearing the sins of the people into the Wilderness. <hi>Grotius</hi> his sense of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. vindicated against <hi>Crellius</hi> and himself. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> never used for the taking away a thing by the destruction of it. <hi>Crellius</hi> his sense examined. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 11. vindicated. The argument from <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 17. answered. <hi>Grotius</hi> constant to himself in his notes on that place. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 5, 6, 7. cleared. Whether Christs death be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and whether that doth imply, that it was a punishment of sin? How far the punishment of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for their Fathers faults, are exemplary among men. The distinction of calamities and punishments, holds not here. That Gods hatred of sin could not be seen in the sufferings of Christ, unless they were a punishment of sin, proved against <hi>Crellius. Grotius</hi> his Arguments from Christ being made sin and a curse for us, defended. The liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty our Adversaries take in Changing the sense of words. The particles <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, being joyned to sins and relating to sufferings do imply those sufferings to be a punishment for sin. According to their way of interpreting Scripture, it had been impossible for our doctrine to be clearly expressed therein. <hi>pag.</hi> 265</item>
                        <item>
                           <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> The words of Scripture being at last acknowledged by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to make for us, the only pretence remaining is that our Doctrine is repugnant to reason. The debate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged upon point of reason: The grand difficulty enquired into, and manifested by our Adversaries concessions, not to lye in the greatness of Christs sufferings, or that our sins were the impulsive cause of them, or that it is impossible that one should be punished for anothers faults: or in all cases unjust: the cases wherein <hi>Crellius</hi> allows it, instanced.
<pb facs="tcp:97974:4"/>
From whence it is proved that he yields the main cause. The arguments propounded whereby he attempts to prove it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just for Christ to be punished for our sins. <hi>Crellius</hi> his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the justice of punishments examined. Of the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between desert and punishment. That a person by his own consent may be punished beyond the desert of his own actions. An answer to <hi>Crellius</hi> his Objections. What it is to suffer undeservedly, <hi>Crellius</hi> his mistake in the state of the question. The instances of Scripture considered. In what sense Children are punished for their Parents sins. <hi>Ezec.</hi> 18. 20. explained at large. Whether the guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed from the sufferings of an innocent person makes that punishment unjust or no? <hi>Crellius</hi> his shifts and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in this matter discovered. Why among men the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders are not freed in criminal matters though the sureties be punished. The release of the party depends on the terms of the sureties suffering, therefore deliverance not <hi>ipso facto.</hi> No necessity of such a translation in criminal, as is in pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary matters. <hi>pag.</hi> 295</item>

                           <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> The Death of Christ considered as an Expiatory Sacrifice for sin. What the expiation of sin was by the Sacrifices under the Law; twofold, Civil and Ritual. The Promises made to the Iews under the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> respected them as a People, and therefore must be temporal. The typical nature of Sacrifices asserted. A substitution in the Expiatory Sacrifices under the Law, proved from <hi>Lev.</hi> 17. 11. and the Concession of <hi>Crellius</hi> about the signification of <gap reason="foreign">

A substitution of Christ in our room proved from Christ being said to dye for us; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of that phrase considered. In what sense a Surro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Christ in our room is asserted by us. Our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by Christ proves a substitution. Of the true notion of Redemption: that explained, and proved against <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Crellius.</hi> No necessity of paying the price to him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains captive, where the captivity is not by force, but by sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Law.

                           <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The notion of a sacrifice belongs to the death of Christ, because of the Oblation made therein to God. <hi>Crellius</hi> his sense of Christs Oblation proposed. Against him it is proved, that the Priestly office of Christ had a primary respect to God, and not to us. Expiatory Sacrifices did divert the wrath of God. Christ not a bare Metaphorical High-Priest. <hi>Crellius</hi> destroys the Priesthood of Christ by confounding it with the exercise of his Regal Power. No proper expiation of sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Christ in Heaven, if <hi>Crellius</hi> his Doctrine be true, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 2. proves the death of Christ an Expiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and an Oblation to God. The Phrase of <hi>a sweet-smelling savour,</hi> belongs to Expiatory Sacrifices; <hi>Crellius</hi> his gross notion of it. His mistakes about the kinds of Sacrifices. Burnt-offerings were Expiatory Sacrifices both before and under the Law. A new distribution of sacrifices proposed. What influence the mactation of the Sacrifice had on Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The High-Priest only to slay the Sin-offering on the day of Atonement; from whence it is proved, that Christs Priesthood did not begin from his entrance into Heaven. The mactation in Expiatory Sacrifices no bare preparation to a Sacrifice, proved by the Iewish Laws, and the customs of other Nations. Whether Christs Oblation of himself once to God, were in Heaven, or on Earth? Of the proper notion of Oblations under the Levitical Law. Several things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from thence to our purpose. All things necessary to a legal Oblation, concur in the death of Christ: His entrance into Heaven hath no correspondency with it; if the blood of Christ were no sacrifice for sin. In Sin-offerings for the People, the whole was consumed; no eating of the Sacrifices allowed the Priests, but in those for private Persons. Christs exercise of Power in Heaven, in no sense an Oblation to God. <hi>Crellius,</hi> his sense repugnant to the circumstances of the places in dispute. Objections answered. <hi>pag.</hi> 329</item>

                           <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> That the effects of proper Expiatory Sacrifices belong to the death of Christ, which either respect the sin or the person. Of the true notion of expiation of sin, as attributed to Sacrifices. Of the importance of <gap reason="foreign">

The Iews notion of <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. The Sacrifices not bare conditions of pardon, nor expiated meerly as a slight part of obedience. Gods expiating sin, destroys not expiation by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. The importance of <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, relating to Sacrifices. Expiation attributed to the Sacrifice of Christ, in the same sense that it was to other Sacrifices: and from thence, and the places of Scripture which mention it, proved not to be meerly declarative. If it had been so, it had more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonged to his Resurrection than his death. The Death of Christ not taken Metonymically for all the Consequents of it; because of the peculiar effects of the death of Christ in Scripture, and because Expiation is attributed to him ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently to his entrance into Heaven. No distinction in Scripture of the effects of Christs entrance into Heaven from his sitting at the right hand of God. The effects of an Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifice, respecting the person, belong to the death of Christ, which are Atonement and Reconciliation. Of the signification of <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. The Reconciliation by Christs death, doth not meerly respect us, but God; why the latter less used in the New Testament. A twofold Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God mentioned in Scripture. <hi>Crellius</hi> his evasion answered. The Objections from Gods being reconciled in the sending his Son, and the inconsistency of the Freeness of Grace with the Doctrine of Satisfaction answered, and the whole concluded. <hi>pag.</hi> 355</item>

and esteemed by all that honour <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> Give me leave to express my Duty in an Address more agreeable to my own <hi>Profession,</hi> than some perhaps will think it is to Your <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Condition.</hi> Those I mean who measure their <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> by their contempt of <hi>Religion,</hi> and all that belong to it: Who know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Wit</hi> or <hi>Vertue</hi> beyond the <hi>Stage,</hi> or think the <hi>Leviathan</hi> contains in it the <hi>Whole Duty of Man.</hi> The utmost these Persons will allow us whose Honour and Imployment lyes in asserting the Truth of Religion, and perswading to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it, is, that we are men of a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> and speak for the things we are to live by. As though <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> were such contemptible <hi>Wares,</hi> as scarce any would enquire after, if it were not some mens <hi>Trade</hi> to put them off: and were of less force in themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:97974:7"/>
it is our <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them. Is it any disparagement to a Prince to have Subjects obliged to defend his Honour, and Servants to attend his Person? and must not what they say or do be at all minded, because their own Interest is joyned with his? Why then should <hi>Religion</hi> suffer in the esteem of any, because she hath servants of her own to defend her Cause? As if it had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes been a received <hi>Principle</hi> with mankind, that <hi>no man is to be trusted in his own Profession.</hi> According to this the <hi>Lawyers</hi> ought to preach, and the <hi>Divines</hi> plead <hi>Causes;</hi> because the one gets nothing by <hi>Divinity,</hi> nor the other by <hi>Law;</hi> the <hi>Merchant</hi> should visit <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,</hi> and the <hi>Physicians</hi> attend the <hi>Committees</hi> of <hi>Trade;</hi> because it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous trusting men in what they are most concerned to understand. When
<pb facs="tcp:97974:8"/>
once I see these persons for bear to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the <hi>Lawyers</hi> about setling their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, and <hi>Physicians</hi> for their health, meerly because they <hi>get</hi> by their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions,</hi> I shall then think it is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else besides a <hi>Pique</hi> at <hi>Religion,</hi> which makes them so ready to contemn whatever is said by us in behalf of it, because, forsooth, <hi>it is our Trade to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it.</hi> I wish it were theirs as much to practise it; and then we should not be troubled with removing these and such like prejudices against all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses of Religion, which are spoken and published by us. But in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which we conceive to be of so high concernment to Mankind, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire nothing may be considered besides the force of reason, and weight of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and surely none that own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be men, will despise that, by
<pb facs="tcp:97974:8"/>
whomsoever it is brought. It is not every ridiculous story, or vulgar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, or common infirmities, or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent opinions in smaller things, which ought to render Religion ridiculous, or make the Practice of it be thought mean and contemptible. But however they are resolved to think of Us, let not Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion suffer for our sakes. Indeed if they did as truly love Religion as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise us, we might then have reason to suspect our selves; but when we suffer meerly upon her account, we have cause to rejoyce in our dishonour; and ought to suspect our selves if such persons did speak well of Us.</p>

As though the infected air had been too kind and partial, and like <hi>Saul</hi> to the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> had <note place="margin">E</note> only destroyed <hi>the vile and refuse,</hi> and spared <hi>the greatest of the people;</hi> as though the grave had surfeited with the bodies of the dead, and were loth to go on in the execution of <hi>Gods</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure; he hath imployed a more furious Element, which

by its merciless and devouring flames might in a more lively <note place="margin">A</note> manner represent unto us the <hi>kindling</hi> of his <hi>wrath</hi> against us. And that by a <hi>Fire,</hi> which began with that violence, and spread with that horror, and raged with that sury, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued for so long a time with that irresistible force; that it might justly fill the beholders with confusion, the hearers of it with amasement, and all of us with a deep and humble sense of those sins which have brought down the judgements of <hi>God</hi> in so severe a manner in the midst of us.</p>
                  <p>For whatever arguments or reasons we can imagine that should compose the minds of men to a sense of their own or <note place="margin">B</note> others calamities, or excite them to an apprehension of the <hi>wrath of God</hi> as the cause of them, or quicken them to an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest supplication to him for mercy, they do all eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr in the sad occasion of this daies solemnity. For if either compassion would move, or fear awaken, or interest engage us to any of these, it is hard to conceive there should be an instance of a more efficacious nature, than that is which we this day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail; For who can behold the ruines of so great a City, and not have his bowels of compassion moved towards it?

                  <p>Who among all the Citizens of <hi>London</hi> could have been perswaded, but the day before the <hi>Fire</hi> brake out, nay when they saw the <hi>Flames</hi> for near a day together, that ever in four dayes time, not a fourth part of the City should be left stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?

Like Beasts of prey that had been chained up so long till they were hunger-bitten, when they once got loose they ran with that violence and greediness to their wayes of gain, as though nothing could ever satisfie them. But that which betrayed them to so much security, was their late deliverance from so sweeping a Judgement as the <hi>Plague</hi> had been to the City and Suburbs of it: they could by no means think, when they had all so lately escaped the <hi>Grave,</hi> that the City it self should be so near being buried in its own ruines; that the <hi>Fire</hi> which had missed their blood, should seize upon <note place="margin">B</note> their houses; that there should be no other way to purge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected air, but by the <hi>Flames</hi> of the whole City. Thus when the Mariners have newly escaped a wreck at Sea, the fears of which have a long time deprived them of their wonted rest, they think they may securely lye down and sleep, till it may be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther storm overtake and sink them. We see then there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther piety nor wisdom in so much security when a great danger is over, for we know not but that very security it self may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke <hi>God</hi> to send a greater. And no kind of Judgements are so dreadful and amazing, as those which come most unexpectly <note place="margin">C</note> upon men; for these betray the succours which reason offers, they insatuate mens councils, weaken their courage, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of that presence of mind which is necessary at such a time for their own and the publick interest. And there needs no more to let us know how severe such a Judgement must be, when it comes upon men in so sudden and unexpected a manner; but that is not all, for the severity of it lyes further,</p>

                     <note place="margin">C</note> do not, I am sure our <hi>sins</hi> may tell us, that these are but the fore-runners of greater calamities, in case there be not a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reformation of our selves. And although <hi>God</hi> may give us some intermissions of punishments, yet at last he may, as the <hi>Roman Consul</hi> expressed it, pay us <hi>intercalatae poenae usuram,</hi> that which may make amends for all his abatements, and give us full measure according to that of our sins, <hi>pressed down, shaken together, and running over.</hi> Which leads to the third parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Causes moving God to so much severity in his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> which are the greatness of the <hi>sins</hi> committed against him. So this <hi>Prophet</hi> tells us, that the true account of all <hi>Gods</hi> punishments is to be fetched from the <hi>sins</hi> of the <hi>people,</hi> Amos 1. 3. <hi>For three transgressions of</hi> Damascus, <hi>and for four I will not turn away the punishment thereof:</hi> so it is said of <hi>Gaza, v.</hi> 6. of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> v. 9. of <hi>Edom, v.</hi> 11. of <hi>Ammon, v. 13. Moab,</hi> ch. 2. 1. <hi>Iudah. v.</hi> 4. and at last <hi>Israel. v.</hi> 6. And it is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of every one of these, that when <hi>God</hi> threatens to punish them for the <hi>greatness</hi> of their <hi>iniquities,</hi> and the <hi>multitude</hi> of their <hi>transgressions,</hi> (which is generally supposed to be meant <note place="margin">E</note> by the <hi>three transgressions and the four)</hi> he doth particularly threaten to send a <hi>fire</hi> among them to consume the Houses and the Palaces of their Cities. So to <hi>Damascus,</hi> chap. 1. 4. to <hi>Gaza,</hi> v. 7. to <hi>Tyrus,</hi> v. 10. to <hi>Edom,</hi> v. 12. to <hi>Ammon,</hi> v. 14.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97974:16"/>
to <hi>Moab,</hi> ch. 2. v. 2. to <hi>Iudah,</hi> v. 5. <hi>I will send a fire upon</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, <note place="margin">A</note> 
                     <hi>and it shall devour the Palaces of</hi> Jerusalem: and <hi>Israel</hi> in the words of the text. This is a judgement then, which when it comes in its <hi>fury,</hi> gives us notice to how great a height our sins are risen; especially when it hath so many dreadful fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners, as it had in <hi>Israel,</hi> and hath had among our selves. When the <hi>red horse</hi> hath marched furiously before it all <hi>bloody</hi> with the <hi>effects</hi> of a <hi>Civil War,</hi> and the <hi>pale horse</hi> hath follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the other with <hi>Death</hi> upon his back, and the <hi>Grave</hi> at his heels, and after both these, those come, <hi>out of whose mouth issues fire, and smoak, and brimstone,</hi> it is then time for the <note place="margin">B</note> inhabitants of the earth, <hi>to repent of the work of their hands.</hi> But it is our great unhappiness, that we are apt to impute these great calamities to any thing rather than to our <hi>sins;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we hinder our selves from the true remedy, because we will not understand the cause of our distemper. Though <hi>God</hi> hath not sent <hi>Prophets</hi> among us, to tell us for such and such sins, I will send such and such judgements upon you, yet where we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the parallel between the <hi>sins</hi> and the <hi>punishments</hi> agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with what we find recorded in <hi>Scripture,</hi> we have reason to say, that those sins were not only the <hi>antecedents,</hi> but the <hi>causes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">C</note> of those punishments which followed after them. And that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the reason of punishment was not built upon any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar relation between <hi>God</hi> and the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> but upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons common to all mankind; yet with this difference, that the greater the mercies were which any people enjoyed, the sooner was the measure of their iniquities filled up, and the severer were the judgements when they came upon them. This our <hi>Prophet</hi> gives an account of, Chap. 3. 2. <hi>You only have I known of all the Nations of the earth, therefore will I punish you for your iniquities.</hi> So did <hi>God</hi> punish <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Damascus,</hi> as well <note place="margin">D</note> as <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Iudah;</hi> but his meaning is, he would punish them sooner, he would punish them more severely. I wish we could be brought once to consider what influence <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> hath upon the good of a Nation, if we did, we should not only live better our selves, but our <hi>Kingdom</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> might flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish more than otherwise we are like to see it do. Which is a truth hath been so universally received among the wise Men of all ages, that one of the <hi>Roman Historians,</hi> though of no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry severe life himself, yet imputes the decay of the <hi>Roman State,</hi> not to Chance or Fortune, or some unhidden causes (which <note place="margin">E</note> the <hi>Atheism</hi> of our Age would presently do) but to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral looseness of mens lives, and corruption of their manners.

                  <p>But it is not enough in general to declaim against our <hi>sins,</hi> but we must search out particularly those predominant vices, which by their <hi>boldness</hi> and <hi>frequency</hi> have provoked <hi>God</hi> thus to punish us; and as we have hitherto observed a parallel between the <hi>Iudgements</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> in this Chapter, <note place="margin">B</note> and our <hi>own:</hi> So I am afraid we shall find too sad a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel between <hi>their sins</hi> and <hi>ours</hi> too. Three sorts of <hi>sins</hi> are here spoken of in a peculiar manner, as the causes of their severe punishments, Their <hi>luxury and intemperance,</hi> their <hi>covetousness and oppression,</hi> and <hi>their contempt of God and his Laws,</hi> and I doubt we need not make a very exact <hi>scrutiny</hi> to find out these in a high degree among our selves: and I wish it were as easie to reform them, as to find them out.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Luxury and intemperance;</hi> that we meet with in the first verse, both in the compellation, <hi>Ye Kine of</hi> Bashan, and <note place="margin">C</note> in their behaviour, <hi>which say to their Masters, bring and let us drink. Ye Kine of</hi> Bashan, <hi>Loquitur ad Principes Israel &amp; Optimates quosque decem Tribuum,</hi> saith St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> he speaks to the <hi>Princes of</hi> Israel, <hi>and the chief of all the ten Tribes;</hi> Those which are fed in the richest pasturés, such as those of <hi>Bashan</hi> were. Who are more fully described by the <hi>Prophet</hi> in this sixth chapter. They are the men <hi>who are at ease in Sion,</hi> v. 1. <hi>they put far away from them the evil day,</hi> v. 3. <hi>they lye upon beds of Ivory, and stretch themselves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Couches, and eat the Lambs out of the flock, and the</hi>

The meaning of all which is, they minded nothing but ease, softness, and pleasure, but could not endure to hear of the calamities which were so near them. Nothing but mirth, and jollity, and riot, and feasting, and the evil consequences of these were to be seen or heard among them.

That he thought was title good enough for such who seemed to have <hi>souls</hi> for no other end, than the other had. And hath not that <hi>delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta insania,</hi> as St. <hi>Austin</hi> calls it, that soft and effeminate kind of madness taken possession of too many among us, whose birth and education designed them for more manly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?

But if this were only among some few persons, we hope the whole Nation would not suffer for their madness: for scarce any Age hath been so happy, but it hath had some <hi>Monsters</hi> in <hi>Morality</hi> as well as <hi>Nature.</hi> But I am afraid these vices are grown too <hi>Epidemical;</hi> not only in the <hi>City,</hi> but the <hi>Countries</hi> too; what mean else those fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <note place="margin">E</note> complaints (and I hope more general than the causes of them) that the houses of <hi>great men</hi> in too many places are so near being <hi>publick schools</hi> of <hi>debauchery,</hi> rather than of <hi>pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> where men shall not want instructers to teach

them to <hi>forget</hi> both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>themselves;</hi> wherein <hi>sobriety</hi> is <note place="margin">A</note> so far from being accounted a matter of <hi>honour,</hi> that the rules of the <hi>Persian</hi> civility are quite forgotten, and <hi>men</hi> are <hi>forced</hi> to <hi>unman</hi> themselves. I know nothing would tend more to the honour of our Nation, or the advantage of it, than if once these publick excesses were severely restrained, I do not mean so much by making new <hi>Laws,</hi> (for those generally do but exercise peoples Wits by finding out new evasions) but by executing old ones.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Covetousness and oppression.</hi> You see what these great men in <hi>Samaria</hi> did when they had any respite from their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, <note place="margin">B</note> and intemperance, then wo be to the poor who come in their way; <hi>Which oppress the poor, and crush the needy:</hi> v. 1. either by the hands of violence, or by those arts and devices which either their honesty or poverty have kept them from the knowledge of. And if there be not so much of open violence in our daies, the thanks are due to the care of our <hi>Magistrates,</hi> and the severity of our <hi>Laws,</hi> but it is hard to say whether ever any Age produced more studious and skilful to pervert the design of <hi>Laws,</hi> without breaking the letter of them, than this of ours hath done. Fraud and injustice is now managed with <note place="margin">C</note> a great deal of artifice and cunning; and he thinks himself no body in the understanding of the world, that cannot over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach his Brother, and not be discovered: or however in the multiplicity and obscurity of our <hi>Laws</hi> cannot find out some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in pretence at least to justifie his actions by.

they can laugh men out of their Estates, before they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt <note place="margin">A</note> to do it out of their hopes of an Eternal happiness. And I am sure it will be no comfort to them in another world, that they were accounted <hi>Wits</hi> for deriding those mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series which they then feel and smart under the severity of: it will be no <hi>mitigation</hi> of their <hi>flames</hi> that they go <hi>laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> into them; nor will they endure them the better because they would not believe them. But while this is so prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>humour</hi> among the vain men of this Age and Nation, what can we expect but that <hi>God</hi> should by remarkable and severe judgements, seek to make men more serious in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi>

                     <hi>Lactantius</hi> observes of the <hi>Romans, Nunquam Dei meminerunt, nisi dum in malis sunt, they seldom think of God, but when they are afraid of him.</hi> And there is <note place="margin">E</note> not only this reason as to particular persons why <hi>God</hi> should punish them, but there is a greater as to Communities, and Bodies of men; for although <hi>God</hi> suffers wicked men to escape punishment here, as he often doth; yet he is sure not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97974:19"/>
to do it in the life to come; but Communities of men can <note place="margin">A</note> never be punished but in this World; and therefore the Justice of <hi>God</hi> doth often discover it self in these common calamities, to keep the World in subjection to him, and to let men see that neither the <hi>multitude</hi> of their <hi>Associates,</hi> nor the <hi>depth</hi> of their <hi>designs,</hi> nor the <hi>subtilty</hi> of their <hi>Councils</hi> can secure them from the omnipotent arm of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Justice, when he hath determined <hi>to visit their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions with rods,</hi> and <hi>their iniquities with stripes.</hi> But when he doth all this, yet his <hi>loving kindness doth he not utterly take from them:</hi> for in the midst of all his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">B</note> he is pleased to remember mercy; of which we have a remarkable instance in the Text, for when <hi>God</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing Cities, yet <hi>he pluckt the Inhabitants as fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands out of the burning:</hi> and so I come from the <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>

us from that <hi>Lethargy</hi> and security we are in by our sins: but <note place="margin">A</note> let <hi>God</hi> take what course he pleases with us, we are the same incorrigible people still that ever we were. For we have cause enough for our mourning and lamentation this day, (if <hi>God</hi> had not sent new calamities upon us) that we were no better for those we had undergone before. We have surfeited with mercies, and grown sick of the kindness of Heaven to us, and when <hi>God</hi> hath made us smart for our fulness and wantonness, then we grew sullen and murmured and disputed against providence, and were willing to do any thing but repent of our sins, and reform our lives. <note place="margin">B</note> It is not many years since <hi>God</hi> blessed us with great and undeserved blessings, which we then thought our selves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thankful for; but if we had been really so, we should never have provoked him who bestowed those savours upon us in so great a degree as we have done since. Was this our requital to <hi>him</hi> for restoring our <hi>Soveraign,</hi> to <hi>rebel</hi> the more against Heaven? Was this our thankfulness, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the <hi>disorders</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> to bring them into our <hi>lives?</hi> Had we no other way of trying the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of <hi>Gods goodness</hi> to us, but by exercising his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">C</note> by our greater provocations? As though we had resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to let the world see, there could be a more unthankful and disobedient people than the <hi>Iews</hi> had been. Thus we sinned with as much security and confidence, as though we had blinded the eyes, or bribed the justice, or commanded the power of Heaven. When <hi>God</hi> of a sudden like one highly provoked drew forth the sword of his destroying <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi> and by it cut off so many thousands in the midst of us: Then we fell upon our knees, and begg'd the mercy of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that our Lives might be spared, that we might have <note place="margin">D</note> time to amend them: but no sooner did our fears abate, but our devotion did so too, we had soon forgotten the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises we made in the day of our distress, and I am afraid it is at this day too true of us which is said in the <hi>Revelations</hi> of those who had escaped the several plagues which so many had been destroyed by. <note n="a" place="margin">Rev. 9. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>And the rest of the men which were not killed by these Plagues, yet repented not of the work of their bands.</hi> For if we had not greedily suckt in again the poyson we had only laid down while we were begging for our lives, if we had not returned with as great fury and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence <note place="margin">E</note> as ever to our former lusts, the removing of one judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not been as it were only to make way for the coming on of another. For the <hi>grave</hi> seemed to close up her mouth, and <hi>death</hi> by degrees to withdraw himself, that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97974:20"/>
the <hi>Fire might</hi> come upon the <hi>Stage,</hi> to act its part too <note place="margin">A</note> in the <hi>Tragoedy</hi> our sins have made among us: and I pray <hi>God</hi> this may be the last <hi>Act</hi> of it. Let us not then provoke <hi>God</hi> to find out new methods of vengeance, and make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments upon us of what other unheard of severities may do for our cure. But let us rather meet <hi>God</hi> now by our repentance, and returning to him, by our serious humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our former sins, and our stedfast resolutions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn no more to the practice of them. That, that much more dangerous <hi>infection</hi> of our souls may be cured as well as that of our bodies, that the impure <hi>flames</hi> which burn <note place="margin">B</note> within may be extinguished, that all our <hi>luxuries</hi> may be retrenched, our debaucheries punished, our vanities taken away, our careless indifferency in Religion turned into a greater seriousness both in the profession and the practice of it. So will <hi>God</hi> make us a happy and prosperous, when he finds us a more righteous and holy Nation. So will <hi>God</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all your endeavours for the honour and interest of that people whom you represent. So may he add that other Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the rest of those you have deserved for your Countries good, to make you <hi>Repairers of the breaches of the City</hi> as <note place="margin">C</note> well as of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and <hi>Restorers of paths to dwell in:</hi> So may that <hi>City</hi> which now sits solitary like a <hi>Widow,</hi> have her tears wiped off, and her beauty and comeliness restored unto her. Yea, so may her present ruines, in which she now lies <hi>buried,</hi> be only the fore-runners of a more joyful <hi>resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> In which, though the <hi>body</hi> may remain the <hi>same,</hi> the <hi>qualities</hi> may be so altered, that its present desolation may be only the putting off its former inconveniences, weakness, and deformities, that it may rise with greater glory, strength and proportion: and to all her other qualities, may that of <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <hi>incorruption</hi> be added too, at least till the general Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I know your great <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> will take care, that those who have suffered by the ruines, may not likewise suffer by the rising of it, that the glory of the <hi>City</hi> may not be laid upon the <hi>tears</hi> of the <hi>Orphans</hi> and <hi>Widows,</hi> but that its foundations may be setled upon Justice and Piety. That there be no complaining in the Streets for want of Righteousness, nor in the City for want of <hi>Churches,</hi> nor in the <hi>Churches</hi> for want of a settled maintenance. That those who attend upon the service of <hi>God</hi> in them may never <note place="margin">E</note> be tempted to betray their Consciences to gain a livelihood, nor to comply with the factions humours of men, that they may be able to live among them. And thus when the City through the blessing of Heaven shall be built again, may it

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN <hi>God</hi> by his infinite Wisdom had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, <note place="margin">D</note> and by a power and goodness, as infinite as his Wisdom, had perfected the creation of the visible world, there seemed to be nothing wanting to the glory of it, but a creature endued with reason and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, which might comprehend the design of his wisdom, enjoy the benefits of his goodness, and employ it self in the celebration of his power. The Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings purely intellectual were too highly raised by their own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and creation, to be the <hi>Lords</hi> of this inferiour world: and <note place="margin">E</note> those whose natures could reach no higher than the objects of sense, were not capable of discovering the glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the great Creator: and therefore could not be the fit <hi>Instruments</hi> of his praise and service. But a conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97974:22"/>
of both these together was thought necessary to make up <note place="margin">A</note> such a sort of being, which might at once command this lower world, and be the servants of him who made it. Not as though this great fabrick of the world were meerly raised for man to please his fancy in the contemplation of it, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise his dominion over the creatures designed for his use and service: but that by frequent reflections on the author of his being, and the effects of his power and goodness he might be brought to the greatest love and admiration of him. So that the most natural part of <hi>Religion</hi> lyes in the grateful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements we owe to that excellent and supream Being, who <note place="margin">B</note> hath shewed so particular a kindness to man in the creation and Government of the world. Which was so great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible, that some have thought, it was not so much pride and affectation of a greater height, as envy at the felicity and power of mankind, which was the occasion of the fall of the <hi>Apostate spirits.</hi> But whether or no the state of man were occasion enough for the envy of the <hi>Spirits</hi> above; we are sure the kindness of Heaven was so great in it, as could not but lay an indispensable obligation on all mankind to perpetual gratitude and obedience. For it is as easie to suppose, that <note place="margin">C</note> affronts and injuries are the most suitable returns for the most obliging favours, that the first duty of a <hi>Child</hi> should be to destroy his Parents; that to be thankful for kindnesses re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, were to commit the unpardonable sin; as that man should receive his being and all the blessings which attend it from <hi>God,</hi> and not be bound to the most universal obedience to him.</p>
                  <p>And as the reflection on the author of his being, leads him to the acknowledgement of his duty towards <hi>God,</hi> so the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the design of it, will more easily acquaint him <note place="margin">D</note> with the nature of that duty which is expected from him. Had man been designed only to act a short part here in the world, all that had been required of him, had been only to express his thankfulness to <hi>God</hi> for his being, and the comforts of it: the using all means for the due preservation of himself; the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing beneath the dignity of humane nature, nothing injurious to those who were of the same nature with himself; but since he is designed for greater and nobler ends, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state, is but a state of tryal, in order to future happiness and misery; the reason of good and evil is not to be taken meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">E</note> from his present, but from the respect, which things have to that eternal state he is designed for. From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the differences of good and evil are rooted in the nature of our beings, and are the necessary consequents of our
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97974:22"/>
relation to <hi>God,</hi> and each other, and our expectations of a <note place="margin">A</note> future life. And therefore according to these measures, the estimation of men in the world hath been while they did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve any veneration for <hi>God</hi> or <hi>themselves.</hi> Wisdom and folly was not measured so much by the subtilty and curiosity of mens speculations, by the fineness of their thoughts, or the depth of their designs, as by their endeavours to uphold the dignity of mankind; by their piety and devotion towards <hi>God;</hi> by their sobriety and due Government of their actions; by the equality and justice, the charity and kindness of their dealings to one another. Wisdom was but another name for <note place="margin">B</note> goodness, and folly for sin; then it was a mans glory to be religious; and to be prophane and vitious, was to be base and mean: then there were no <hi>Gods</hi> worshipped because they were bad, nor any men disgraced because they were good. Then there were no <hi>Temples</hi> erected to the meanest passions of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, nor men became <hi>Idolaters</hi> to their own infirmities. Then to be betrayed into sin, was accounted weakness; to contrive it, dishonour and baseness; to justifie and defend it, infamy and reproach; to make a mock at it, a mark of the highest folly and incorrigibleness. So the Wise man in the words of the Text <note place="margin">C</note> assures us, that they are <hi>Fools,</hi> and those of the highest rank and degree of folly, <hi>who make a mock at sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is well for us in the Age we live in, that we have the judgement of former ages to appeal to, and of those persons in them whose reputation for wisdom is yet unquestionable. For otherwise we might be born down by that spightful enemy to all vertue and goodness, the impudence of such, who it is hard to say whether they shew it more in committing sin, or in defending it. Men whose manners are so bad, that scarce any thing can be imagined worse, unless it be the wit they <note place="margin">D</note> use to excuse them with. Such who take the measure of mans perfections downwards, and the nearer they approach to beasts, the more they think themselves to act like men. No wonder then, if among such as these the differences of good and evil be laughed at, and no sin be thought so unpardonable, as the thinking that there is any at all. Nay, the utmost they will allow in the description of Sin, is, that it is a thing that some live by declaiming against, and others cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the practice of.</p>
                  <p>But is the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>Scorners</hi> at last proved the only chair <note place="margin">E</note> of Infallibility? Must those be the standard of mankind, who seem to have little left of humane nature, but laughter and the shape of men? Do they think that we are all become such fools to take scoffs for arguments, and raillery for demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?

He knows nothing at all of goodness, that knows not <note place="margin">A</note> that it is much more easie to laugh at it, than to practise it; and it were worth the while <hi>to make a mock at sin,</hi> if the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so would make nothing of it. But the nature of things does not vary with the humours of men; sin becomes not at all the less dangerous because men have so little Wit to think it so; nor <hi>Religion</hi> the less excellent and advantagious to the world, because the greatest enemies of that are so much to themselves too, that they have learnt to despise it. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that scorns to be defended by such weapons whereby her enemies assault her, (nothing more unbecoming the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">B</note> of <hi>Religion,</hi> than to make it self cheap, by making others laugh) yet if they can but obtain so much of themselves to attend with patience to what is serious, there may be yet a possibility of perswading them, that no <hi>fools</hi> are so great as those who laugh themselves into misery, and none so certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do so, as those <hi>who make a mock at sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if our authority be too mean and contemptible to be relyed on, in a matter wherein they think us so much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (and so I hope we are to prevent the ruine of mens souls) we dare with confidence appeal to the general sense of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind <note place="margin">C</note> in the matter of our present debate. Let them name but any one person in all the monuments of former ages, to whom but the bare suspicion of Vice was not a diminution to an esteem that might otherwise have been great in the world. And if the bare suspicion would do so much among even the more rude and barbarous Nations, what would open and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed wickedness do among the more knowing and civil? Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature retains an abhorrency of sin, so far that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for men to have the same esteem of those who are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over to all manner of wickedness, though otherwise of <note place="margin">D</note> great sharpness of wit, and of such whose natural abilities may not exceed the other, but yet do govern their actions accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the strict rules of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> And the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sense of mankind cannot be by any thing better known, than by an universal consent of men, as to the ways where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they express their value and esteem of others. What they all agree on as the best character of a person worthy to be loved and honoured, we may well think is the most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to humane nature; and what is universally thought a disparagement to the highest accomplishments, ought to be <note place="margin">E</note> looked on as the disgrace and imperfection of it. Did ever any yet, though never so wicked and prosane themselves, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously commend another person for his rudeness and debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? Was any mans lust or intemperance ever reckoned among
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97974:23"/>
the Titles of his honour? Who ever yet raised <hi>Trophies</hi> to his <note place="margin">A</note> vices, or thought to perpetuate his memory by the glory of them? Where was it ever known, that sobriety and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, justice and charity were thought the marks of reproach and infamy? Who ever suffered in their reputation by being thought to be really good? Nay, it is so far from it, that the most wicked persons do inwardly esteem them whether they will or no. By which we see, that even in this lapsed and degenerate condition of mankind, it is only goodness which gains true honour and esteem, and nothing doth so ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually blast a growing reputation, as wickedness and <note place="margin">B</note> vice.</p>
                  <p>But if it be thus with the generality of men, who were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet thought to have too much partiality towards goodness, we may much more easily find it among those, who have had a better ground for the reputation of their wisdom, than the meer vogue of the people. He who was pronounced by the <hi>Heathen Oracle,</hi> to be the wisest among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was the person who brought down Philosophy from the obscure and uncertain speculations of Nature, and in all his discourses re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended Vertue as the truest wisdom. And he among the <note place="margin">C</note> 
                     <hi>Iews,</hi> whose <note n="a" place="margin">1 King. 4. 29, 30, 31.</note> 
                     <hi>soul was as large as the sand on the Sea shore, whose wisdom out-went that of all the persons of his own or future Ages,</hi> writes a Book on purpose to perswade men, that there is no real wisdom, but to fear God and keep his Commandments: that sin is the greatest folly, and the meaner apprehensions men have of it, the more they are infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by the temptations to it. But as there are degrees of sinning, so there are of folly in it. Some sin with a blushing countenance, and a trembling Conscience; they sin, but yet they are afraid to sin, but in the act of it they condemn them <note place="margin">D</note> selves for what they do; they sin, but with confusion in their faces, with horror in their minds, and an earthquake in their Consciences: though the condition of such persons be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and their unquietness shews the greatness of their folly, yet because these twitches of Conscience argue there are some quick touches left of the sense of good and evil, their case is not desperate, nor their condition incurable: But there are others who despise these as the reproach of the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Wickedness,</hi> because they are not yet attained to those heights of impiety which they glory in: such who have subdued their <note place="margin">E</note> Consciences much easier than others do their sins; who have almost worn out all the impressions of the <hi>work of the Law written in their hearts;</hi> who not only make a practice, but a boast of sin, and defend it with as much greediness as they
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97974:24"/>
commit it: these are the men, whose folly is manifest to all <note place="margin">A</note> men but themselves; and surely, since these are the men, whom <hi>Solomon</hi> in the words of the <hi>Text</hi> describes,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) By their character, as <hi>Fools,</hi> and,</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) By the instance of their folly, <hi>in making a mock at sin;</hi> We may have not only the liberty to use, but (1.) To prove, that Name of reproach to be due unto them; and (2.) To shew the reasonableness of fastning it upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they <hi>make a mock at sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I come more closely to pursue that, it will be necessary to consider another sense of these words caused by <note place="margin">B</note> the ambiguity of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Verb, which sometimes signifies to deride and scorn, sometimes to plead for, and excuse a thing with all the arts of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> (thence the word for <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick</hi> is derived from the Verb here used) according to which sense, it notes all the plausible pretences and subtle extenuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which wicked men use in defence of their evil actions. For as if men intended to make some recompence for the folly they betray in the acts of sin, by the wit they employ in the pleading for them, there is nothing they shew more industry and care in, than in endeavouring to baffle their own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, <note place="margin">C</note> and please themselves in their folly, till death and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal flames awaken them. That we may not therefore seem to beg all wicked men for <hi>Fool<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> till we have heard what they have to say for themselves, we shall first examine the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of their fairest Pleas for their evil actions, before we make good the particular impeachment of <hi>folly</hi> against them. There are three ways especially whereby they seek to justifie themselves; by laying the blame of all their evil actions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the fatal necessity of all events, the unavoidable frailty of humane nature, or the impossibility of keeping the <note place="margin">D</note> Laws of Heaven: But that none of these will serve to excuse them from the just imputation of <hi>folly,</hi> is our present business to discover.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The fatal necessity of all humane actions.</hi> Those who upon any other terms are unwilling enough to own either <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Providence,</hi> yet if they can but make these serve their turn to justifie their sins by, their quarrel against them then ceaseth, as being much more willing that <hi>God</hi> should bear the blame of their sins, than themselves. But yet the very fears of a <hi>Deity</hi> suggest so many dreadful thoughts of his <hi>Majesty, Iustice,</hi> and <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <hi>Power,</hi> that they are very well contented to have him wholly left out; and then to suppose Man to be a meer Engine, that is necessarily moved by such a train and series of causes, that there is no action how bad soever that is done by him, which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97974:24"/>
it was any more possible for him not to have done, than for <note place="margin">A</note> the fire not to burn when it pleases. If this be true, farewel all the differences of good and evil in mens actions; farewel all expectations of future rewards and punishments; <hi>Religion</hi> becomes but a meer name, and righteousness but an art to live by. But it is with this, as it is with the other arguments they use against <hi>Religion;</hi> there is something within, which checks and controlls them in what they say: and that inward remorse of Conscience, which such men sometimes feel in their evil actions (when conscience is forced to recoil by the foulness of them) doth effectually confute their own <hi>hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">B</note> and makes them not believe those actions to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for which they suffer so much in themselves because they knew they did them freely. Or is it as fatal for man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve himself free when he is not so, as it is for him to act when his choice is determined? but what <hi>series</hi> of causes is there that doth so necessarily impose upon the common sense of all mankind; It seems very strange, that man should have so little sense of his own interest to be still necessitated to the worst of actions, and yet torment himself with the thoughts that he did them freely. Or is it only the <hi>freedom of action,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">C</note> and not of <hi>choice,</hi> that men have an experience of within themselves? But surely, however men may subtilly dispute of the difference between these two, no man would ever believe himself to be free in what he does, unless he first thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be so, in what he determines? And if we suppose man to have as great a <hi>freedom of choice</hi> in all his evil actions (which is the liberty we are now speaking of) as any persons assert or contend for, we cannot suppose that he should have a greater experience of it, than now he hath. So that either it is impossible for man to know when his choice is free; or if <note place="margin">D</note> it may be known, the constant experience of all evil men in the world will testifie, that it is so now. Is it possible for the most intemperate person to believe, when the most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing temptations to lust or gluttony are presented to him, that no consideration whatever could restrain his appetite, or keep him from the satisfaction of his bruitish inclinations? Will not the sudden, though groundless apprehension of poyson in the Cup, make the Drunkards heart to ake, and hand to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to let fall the supposed fatal mixture in the midst of all his jollity and excess? How often have persons who have <note place="margin">E</note> designed the greatest mischief to the lives and fortunes of others, when all opportunities have fallen out beyond their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation for accomplishing their ends, through some sudden thoughts which have surprized them, almost in the very act,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97974:25"/>
been diverted from their intended purposes? Did ever any yet <note place="margin">A</note> imagine that the charms of beauty and allurements of lust were so irresistible, that if men knew before hand they should sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dye in the embraces of an adulterous bed, they could not yet withstand the temptations to it? If then some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are quite of another nature from all the objects which are presented to him, may quite hinder the force and efficacy of them upon the mind of man (as we see in <hi>Iosephs</hi> resisting the importunate Caresses of his Mistress) what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can there be to imagine that man is a meer <hi>machine</hi> moved only as outward objects determine him? And if the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations <note place="margin">B</note> of present fear and danger may divert men from the practice of evil actions, shall not the far more weighty consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of eternity have at least an equal, if not a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power and efficacy upon mens minds, to keep them from everlasting misery? Is an immortal soul and the eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of it so mean a thing in our esteem and value, that we will not deny our selves those sensual pleasures for the sake of that which we would renounce for some present danger? Are the flames of another world such painted fires, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve only to be laughed at, and not seriously considered by us? <note place="margin">C</note> Fond man! art thou only free to ruine and destroy thy self? a strange fatality indeed, when nothing but what is mean and trivial shall determine thy choice! when matters of the highest moment are therefore less regarded, because they are such. Hast thou no other plea for thy self, but that thy sins were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal? thou hast no reason then to believe but that thy misery shall be so too. But if thou ownest a <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure thy self that justice and righteousness are not meer <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>his Honour,</hi> but the real properties of his nature. And he who hath appointed the rewards and punishments of the great <note place="margin">D</note> day, will then call the sinner to account, not only for all his other sins, but for offering to lay the imputation of them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himself. For if the greatest abhorrency of mens evil ways, the rigour of his Laws, the severity of his judgements, the exactness of his justice, the greatest care used to reclaim men from their sins, and the highest assurance, that he is not the cause of their ruine, may be any vindication of the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>God</hi> now, and his justice in the life to come; we have the greatest reason to lay the blame of all our evil actions upon our selves, as to attribute the glory of all our good unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <note place="margin">E</note> alone.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The frailty of humane Nature:</hi> those who find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be free enough to do their souls mischief, and yet continue still in the doing of it, find nothing more ready to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:97974:25"/>
plead for themselves, than the unhappiness of mans compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">A</note> and the degenerate state of the world. If <hi>God</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed (they are ready to say) that man should lead a life free from sin, why did he confine the soul of man to a body so apt to taint and pollute it? But who art thou O man, that thus findest fault with thy Maker? Was not his kindness the greater, in not only giving thee a soul capable of enjoying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but such an habitation for it here, which by the curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its contrivance, the number and usefulness of its parts, might be a perpetual and domestick testimony of the wisdom of its <hi>Maker?</hi> Was not such a conjunction of soul and body <note place="margin">B</note> necessary for the exercise of that dominion which <hi>God</hi> design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man for, over the creatures endued only with sense and motion? And if we suppose this life to be a state of tryal in order to a better, (as in all reason we ought to do) what can be imagined more proper to such a state, than to have the soul constantly employed in the government of those sensual incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations which arise from the body? In the doing of which, the proper exercise of that vertue consists, which is made the condition of future happiness. Had it not been for such a composition, the difference could never have been seen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <note place="margin">C</note> good and bad men; <hi>i. e.</hi> between those who maintain the Empire of reason, assisted by the motives of <hi>Religion,</hi> over all the inferiour faculties, and such who dethrone their souls and make them slaves to every lust that will command them. And if men willingly subject themselves to that which they were born to rule, they have none to blame but themselves for it. Neither is it any excuse at all, that this, through the degeneracy of mankind, is grown the common custom of the world; unless that be in it self so great a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that there is no resisting the power of it. If <hi>God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> had commanded us to comply with all the customs of the world, and at the same time to be <hi>sober, righteous,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> we must have lived in another age than we live in, to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused these two commands from a palpable contradiction. But instead of this, he hath forewarned us of the danger of being led aside by the soft and easie compliances of the world; and if we are sensible of our own infirmities, (as we have all reason to be) he hath offered us the assistance of his <hi>Grace</hi> and of that <hi>Spirit</hi> of his, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Joh 4. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>which is greater than the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that is the World.</hi> He hath promised us those weapons <note place="margin">E</note> whereby we may withstand the <hi>torrent</hi> of wickedness in the world, with far greater success than the old <note n="b" place="margin">Nicol.

                     <hi>Gauls</hi> were wont to do in the inundations of their Country, whose custom was to be drowned with their arms in their hands. But it will
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:97974:26"/>
be the greater folly in us to be so, because we have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">A</note> sufficient means of resistance, but we understand the danger before hand. If we once forsake the strict rules of Religion and goodness, and are ready to yield our selves to whatever hath got retainers enough to set up for a custom, we may know where we begin, but we cannot where we shall make an end. For every fresh assault makes the breach wider, at which more enemies may come in still; so that when we find our selves under their power, we are contented for our own ease to call them <hi>Friends.</hi> Which is the unhappy consequence of too easie yielding at first, till at last the greatest slavery to sin <note place="margin">B</note> be accounted but good humour, and a gentile compliance with the fashions of the world. So that when men are perswaded, either through fear, or too great easiness to disuse that strict eye which they had before to their actions, it oft-times falls out with them, as it did with the Souldier in the <note n="a" place="margin">Geta in Appiano.</note> 
                     <hi>Roman History,</hi> who blinded his eye so long in the time of the Civil Wars, that when he would have used it again, he could not. And when custom hath by degrees taken away the sense of sin from their Consciences, they grow as hard as <hi>(b) Herodotus</hi> tells <note place="margin">(a) Herod. Thal v. Synes. de laude Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitii. <hi>p.</hi> 77.</note> us the heads of the old <hi>Egyptians</hi> were by the heat of the <note place="margin">C</note> Sun, that nothing would ever enter them. If men will with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> herd with the beasts of the field, no wonder if their reason departs from them, and by degrees they grow as savage as the company they keep. So powerful a thing is Custom to debauch Mankind, and so easily do the greatest vices by degrees obtain admission into the souls of men, under pretence of being retainers to the common <hi>infirmities</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature. Which is a <hi>phrase,</hi> through the power of self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flattery, and mens ignorance in the nature of moral actions, made to be of so large and comprehensive a sense that the most <note place="margin">D</note> wilful violations of the <hi>Laws</hi> of Heaven, and such which the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us do exclude from the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of it, do find (rather than make) friends enough to shelter themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>protection</hi> of them. But such a <hi>protection</hi> it is, which is neither allowed in the <hi>Court</hi> of Heaven, nor will ever se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the souls of men without a hearty and sincere repentance, from the <hi>arrest</hi> of divine justice; which when it comes to call the world to an account of their actions will make no defal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations at all for the power of custom, or common practice of the world. <note place="margin">E</note>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Impossibility of the Command, or rather of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it.</hi> When neither of the former pleas will effect their design, but notwithstanding the pretended <hi>necessity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions,</hi> and the more than pretended <hi>common practice
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:97974:26"/>
of the World,</hi> their Consciences still fly in their faces, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke <note place="margin">A</note> them sharply for their sins, then in a mighty rage and fury they charge <hi>God</hi> himself with <hi>Tyranny</hi> in laying impossible <hi>Laws</hi> upon the sons of men. But if we either consider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the command, or the promises which accompany it, or the large experience of the world to the contrary, we shall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily discover that this pretence is altogether as unreasonable as either of the foregoing. For what is it that <hi>God</hi> requires of men as the condition of their future happiness which in its own nature is judged impossible? Is it for men to <note n="a" place="margin">Tit. 2. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>live soberly, righteously and godly in this world?</hi> for that was the end of <note place="margin">B</note> Christian Religion to perswade men to do so: but who thinks it impossible to avoid the occasions of intemperance, not to defraud, or injure his neighbours, or to pay that reverence and sincere devotion to <hi>God</hi> which we owe unto him? <hi>Is it to do as we would be done by?</hi> yet that hath been judged by strangers to the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> a most exact measure of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conversation; Is it <hi>to maintain an universal kindness and good will to men?</hi> that indeed is the great excellency of our Religion, that it so strictly requires it; but if this be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, farewell all <hi>good nature</hi> in the world; and I suppose <note place="margin">C</note> few will own this charge, lest theirs be suspected. Is it <hi>to be patient under sufferings, moderate in our desires, circumspect in our actions, contented in all conditions?</hi> yet these are things which those have pretended to who never owned <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> and therefore surely they never thought them impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. Is it <hi>to be charitable to the poor, compassionate to those in misery?</hi> is it <hi>to be frequent in Prayer, to love God above all things, to forgive our enemies as we hope God will forgive us, to believe the Gospel, and be ready to suffer for the sake of Christ?</hi> There are very few among us but will say they do <note place="margin">D</note> all these things already, and therefore surely they do not think them impossible. The like answer I might give to all the other precepts of the <hi>Gospel</hi> till we come to the <hi>denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness and worldly lusts,</hi> and as to these too, if we charge men with them, they either deny their committing them, and then say they have kept the command; or if they confess it, they promise amendment for the future; but in neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect can they be said to think the command impossible. Thus we see their own mouths will condemn them when they charge <hi>God</hi> with laying impossible <hi>Laws</hi> on mankind. But if we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <note place="margin">E</note> further then into the judgements of those (who it may be never concerned themselves so much about the precepts of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> as to try whether they had any power to observe them or not); nay, if we yield them more (than, it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:97974:27"/>
may be, they are willing to enquire after, though they ought <note place="margin">A</note> to do it) <hi>viz.</hi> that without the <hi>assistance of divine grace,</hi> they can never do it: yet such is the unlimited nature of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodness and the exceeding riches of Gods Grace, that (knowing the weakness and degeneracy of humane Nature when he gave these commands to men) he makes a large and free offer of assistance to all those who are so sensible of their own infirmity as to beg it of him. And can men then say the command is impossible when he hath promised an assistance suitable to the nature of the duty and the infirmities of men? If it be acknowledged that some of the duties of <hi>Christianity</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">B</note> are very difficult to us now; let us consider by what means he hath sweetned the performance of them. Will not the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal of so excellent a reward, make us swallow some more than ordinary hardships that we might enjoy it? hath he not made use of the most obliging motives to perswade us to the practice of what he requires, by the infinite discovery of his own love, the death of his Son, and the promise of his Spirit? And what then is wanting, but only setting our selves to the serious obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of them, to make his commands not only not impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but easie to us? But our grand fault is, we make impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilities <note place="margin">C</note> our selves where we find none, and then we complain of them: we are first resolved not to practise the commands, and then nothing more easie than to find fault with them: we first pass sentence, and then examine evidences; first condemn, and then enquire into the merits of the Cause. Yet surely none of these things can be accounted impossible, which have been done by all those who have been sincere and hearty Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; and <hi>God</hi> forbid we should think all guilty of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, who have professed the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it to this day. Nay more than so, they have not <note place="margin">D</note> only done them, but professed to have that joy and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind in the doing of them, which they would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for all the pleasures and delights of the world. These were the men, who not only were patient, but rejoyced in suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; who accounted it their honour and glory to endure any thing for the sake of so excellent a Religion; who were so as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of a future happiness by it, that they valued Martyrdoms above Crowns and Scepters. But God be thanked, we may hope to come to Heaven on easier terms than these, or else ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others might never come thither, besides those who think <note place="margin">E</note> to make this a pretence for their sin, that now when with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and honour we may practise our Religion, the commands of it are thought impossible by them. Thus we have made good the general Charge here implyed against wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:97974:27"/>
men, in that they are called <hi>Fools,</hi> by examining the most <note place="margin">A</note> plausible pretences they bring for themselves.</p>
                  <p>I now come to the particular impeachment of their folly, because <hi>they make a mock at sin.</hi> And that I shall prove espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by two things: 1. Because this argues <hi>the highest degree of wickedness.</hi> 2. Because it betrays the <hi>greatest weakness of judgement and want of consideration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it argues <hi>the highest degree of wickedness.</hi> If to sin be folly, to make a mock at it is little short of madness. It is such a height of impiety, that few but those who are of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profligate consciences can attain to, without a long custom <note place="margin">B</note> in sinning. For Conscience is at first modest, and starts and boggles at the appearance of a great wickedness, till it be used to it and grown familiar with it. It is no such easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a man to get the mastery of his conscience; a great deal of force and violence must be used to ones self before he does it. The natural impressions of good and evil, the fears of a <hi>Deity,</hi> and the apprehensions of a future state are such curbs and checks in a sinners way, that he must first sin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self beyond all feeling of these, before he can attain to the <hi>seat</hi> of the <hi>scorners.</hi> And we may justly wonder how any should <note place="margin">C</note> ever come thither, when they must break through all that is ingenuous and modest, all that is vertuous and good, all that is tender and apprehensive in humane nature, before they can arrive at it. They must first deny a <hi>God,</hi> and despise an immortal soul, they must conquer their own reason, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel the <hi>Law written in their hearts,</hi> they must hate all that is serious, and yet soberly believe themselves to be no better <hi>than the beasts that perish,</hi> before men can come to make a <hi>scoff at religion,</hi> and a <hi>mock at sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And who now could ever imagine that in a Nation profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <hi>Christianity,</hi> among a people whose <hi>genius</hi> enclines them to civility and religion, yea among those who have the greatest advantages of behaviour and education, and who are to give the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>civility</hi> to the rest of the Nation, there should any be found who should deride religion, make sport with their own prosaneness, and make so light of nothing, as being damned? I come not here to accuse any, and least of all those who shew so much regard of <hi>religion</hi> as to be present in the places devoted to sacred purposes; but if there be any such here, whose consciences accuse themselves, for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees <note place="margin">E</note> of so great impiety; I beseech them by all that is dear and precious to them, by all that is sacred and serious, by the <hi>vows</hi> of their <hi>Baptism,</hi> and their <hi>participation</hi> of the <hi>Holy Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist,</hi> by all the kindness of Heaven which they either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy

                     <note place="margin">A</note> that they would now consider how great folly and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they betray in it, and what the dreadful consequence of it will be, if they do not timely repent of it. If it were a doubt (as I hope it is not among any here) whether the matters of <hi>Religion</hi> be true or no, they are surely things which ought to be seriously thought and spoken of. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no jesting matter to affront a <hi>God</hi> of infinite <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> (and he judges every wilful sinner to do so) nor can any one in his wits think it a thing not to be regarded, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be eternally happy or miserable. Methinks then among <note place="margin">B</note> persons of civility and honour, above all others, <hi>Religion</hi> might at least be treated with the respect and reverence due to the concernments of it; that it be not made the sport of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments, nor the common subject of <hi>Plays</hi> and <hi>Comedies.</hi> For is there nothing to trifle with, but <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>service?</hi> Is wit grown so <hi>schismatical</hi> and <hi>sacrilegious,</hi> that it can please it self with nothing but <hi>holy ground?</hi> Are prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and wit grown such inseparable companions, that none shall be allowed to pretend to the one, but such as dare be highly guilty of the other? Far be it from those who have <note place="margin">C</note> but the name of <hi>Christians,</hi> either to do these things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or to be pleased with them that do them: especially in such times as ours of late have been, when <hi>God</hi> hath used so many ways to make us serious if any thing would ever do it. If men had only slighted <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>made a mock at sin,</hi> when they had grown wanton through the abundance of peace and plenty, and saw no severities of <hi>Gods justice</hi> used upon such who did it; yet the fault had been so great, as might have done enough to have interrupted their peace and destroyed that <hi>plenty,</hi> which made them out of the greatness <note place="margin">D</note> of their pride and wantonness to kick against Heaven: but to do it in despight of all <hi>Gods</hi> judgements, to <hi>laugh in his face</hi> when <hi>his rod is upon our backs,</hi> when neither Pestilence nor Fire can make us more afraid of him, exceedingly aggravates the impiety, and makes it more unpardonable. When like the old <note n="a" place="margin">Tacit. de moribus Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> 
                     <hi>Germans we dance among naked swords,</hi> when men shall defie and reproach Heaven in the midst of a Cities ruines, and over the graves of those whom the arrows of the <hi>Almighty</hi> have heaped together, what can be thought of such but that nothing will make them serious, but eternal misery? <note place="margin">E</note> And are they so sure there is no such thing to be feared, that they never think of it, but when by their execrable oaths they call upon <hi>God to damn them,</hi> for fear he should not do it time enough for them? Thus while men abuse his patience, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:97974:28"/>
provoke his justice, while they trample upon his kindness, and <note place="margin">A</note> slight his severities, while they despise his Laws and mock at the breaches of them, what can be added more to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety? or what can be expected by such who are guilty of it, but that <hi>God</hi> should quickly discover their mighty folly by letting them see how much they have deceived themselves, since <note n="a" place="margin">Gal 6. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>God will not be mocked,</hi> but <note n="b" place="margin">Eph 5. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>because of these things the wrath of God will most certainly come upon the children of disobedience.</hi> Which leads to the second thing wherein this folly is seen.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Which is in <hi>the weakness of judgement and want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">B</note> which this betrays in men. <hi>Folly</hi> is the great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steadiness of the mind in the thoughts of what is good and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to be done. It were happy for many in the world, if none should suffer in their reputation for want of wisdom, but such whom nature or some violent distemper have wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the use of their reason and understandings: But wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom does not lye in the rambling imaginations of mens minds (for <hi>fools</hi> may think of the same things which wise men practice) but in a due consideration and choice of things which are most agreeable to the end they design, supposing the end <note place="margin">C</note> in the first place to be worthy a wise mans choice; for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not yet see why the end may not be chosen as well as the means, when there are many stand in competition for our choice, and men first deliberate, and then determine which is the fittest to be pursued. But when the actions of men discover, that either they understand or regard not the most excellent end of their beings, or do those things which direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cross and thwart their own designs, or else pursue those which are mean and ignoble in themselves, we need not any further evidence of their folly, than these things discover. <note place="margin">D</note>

                  <p>Now that those who <hi>make a mock at sin</hi> are guilty of all these, will appear; if we consider whom they provoke by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, whom they most injure, and upon what reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration they are moved to what they do.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Whom they provoke by their making a mock at sin;</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that there is a <hi>Governour</hi> of the world, who hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished <hi>Laws</hi> for us to be guided by, we may easily understand, whose honour and authority is reflected on, when the violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his <hi>Laws</hi> are made nothing of. For surely if they had a just esteem of his <hi>power</hi> and <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> they never durst <note place="margin">E</note> make so bold with him, as all those do who not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sin themselves, but laugh at the scrupulosity of those who dare not. When <hi>Dionysius</hi> changed <hi>Apollos</hi> Cloak, and took off the <hi>Golden Beard</hi> of <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> with those solemn jeers
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97974:29"/>
of the unsuitableness of the one to the Son of a beardless Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <note place="margin">A</note> and the much greater conveniency of a cheaper gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the other; it was a sign he stood not much in awe of the severity of their looks, nor had any dread at all of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their power. But although there be so infinite a dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the artificial <hi>Deities</hi> of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and the <hi>Majesty</hi> of him who made and governs the whole world; yet as little reverence to his power and authority is shewed by all such who dare affront him with such a mighty confidence, and bid the greatest defiance to his <hi>Laws</hi> by scoffing at them. What is there, the <hi>Soveraigns</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of the earth do more <note place="margin">B</note> justly resent, and express the highest indignation against, than to have their <hi>Laws</hi> despised, their persons affronted, and their authority contemned? And can we then imagine, that a <hi>God</hi> of infinite <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Majesty,</hi> the honour of whose <hi>Laws</hi> is as dear to him as his own is, should sit still unconcerned, when so many indignities are continually offered them, and never take any notice at all of them? It is true, his patience is not to be measured by our fretful and pevish natures, (and it is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for us all that it is not) he knows the sinner can never escape his power, and therefore bears the longer with him: <note place="margin">C</note> but yet his lenity is always joyned with his wisdom and justice, and the time is coming when patience it self shall be no more. Is it not then the highest madness and folly to provoke one whose power is infinitely greater than our own is, and from the severity of whose wrath we cannot secure our selves one minute of an hour? How knowest thou, O vain man, but that in the midst of all thy mirth and jollity, while thou art boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy sins, and thinkest thou canst never fill up fast enough the measure of thy iniquities, a sudden fit of an <hi>Apoplexy,</hi> or the breaking of an <hi>Aposteme,</hi> or any of the innumerable instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">D</note> of death, may dispatch thee hence, and consign thee into the hands of divine Justice?

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:97974:29"/>
Art thou then resolved to put all these things to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, <note place="margin">A</note> and live as securely as if the <hi>terrours</hi> of the <hi>Almighty</hi> were but the dreams of men awake, or the fancies of weak and distempered brains? But I had rather believe that in the heat and fury of thy lusts thou wouldst seem to others to think so, than thou either doest or canst perswade thy self to such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable folly. Is it not then far better to consult the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of thy mind here, and the eternal happiness of it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, by a serious repentance and speedy amendment of thy life, than to expose thy self for the sake of thy sensual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures to the sury of that <hi>God</hi> whose justice is infinite, and power <note place="margin">B</note> irresistible? Shall not <hi>the apprehension of his excellency make thee</hi> now <hi>asraid of him?</hi> Never then <hi>make</hi> any <hi>mock at sin</hi> more, unless thou art able <hi>to contend with the Almighty,</hi> or <hi>to dwell with everlasting burnings.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The folly of it is seen in considering <hi>whom the injury redounds to</hi> by mens making themselves so pleasant with their sins. Do they think by their rude attempts to dethrone the <hi>Majesty</hi> of Heaven, or by standing at the greatest defiance, to make him willing to come to terms of composition with them? Do they hope to slip beyond the bounds of his power, <note place="margin">C</note> by salling into nothing when they die, or to sue out <hi>prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in the Court of Heaven, to hinder the effects of <hi>Iustice</hi> there? Do they design to out-wit infinite Wisdom, or to find such flaws in <hi>Gods</hi> government of the World, that he shall be contented to let them go unpunished? All which imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations are alike vain and foolish, and only shew how easily wickedness baffles the reason of mankind, and makes them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hope or wish for the most impossible things than believe they shall ever be punished for their impieties. If the <hi>Apostate Spirits</hi> can by reason of their present restraint and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">D</note> of future punishments be as pleasant in beholding the <hi>follies</hi> of men as they are malicious to suggest them, it may be one of the greatest diversions of their misery, to see how active and witty men are in contriving their own ruine. To see with what greediness they catch at every bait that is offered them, and when they are swallowing the most deadly <hi>poyson,</hi> what arts they use to perswade themselves that it is a healthful poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. No doubt, nothing can more gratifie them than to see men sport themselves into their own destruction, and go down so pleasantly to Hell: when eternal flames become their first <note place="margin">E</note> awakeners, and then men begin to be wise, when it is too late to be so: when nothing but insupportable torments can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them that <hi>God</hi> was in earnest with them, that he would not always bear the affronts of evil men, and that those who
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:97974:30"/>
derided the miseries of another life, shall have leisure enough <note place="margin">A</note> to repent their folly, when their repentance shall only increase their sorrow without hopes of pardon by it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But if there were any present selicity, or any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advantage to be gained by this <hi>mocking at sin,</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing Religion, there would seem to be some kind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, though nothing of true reason for it. Yet that which heightens this folly to the highest degree in the last place is, that there can be no imaginable consideration thought on which might look like a <hi>plausible temptation</hi> to it. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man, when he hath defrauded his neighbour, and used <note place="margin">B</note> all kinds of arts to compass an Estate, hath the fulness of his baggs to answer for him, and whatever they may do in another world, he is sure they will do much in this. The voluptuous man hath the strong propensities of his Nature, the force of temptation which lies in the charms of beauty, to excuse his unlawful pleasures by. The ambitious man, hath the greatness of his mind, the advantage of authority, the examples of those who have been great before him, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of those who condemn him, to plead for the heights he aims at. But what is it which the person who despises Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">C</note> and laughs at every thing that is serious, proposes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as the reason of what he does? But alas! this were to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him to be much more serious than he is, if he did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound any thing to himself as the ground of his actions. But it may be a great kindness to others, though none to himself; I cannot imagine any, unless it may be, to make them thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful they are not arrived to that height of folly; or out of perfect good nature, lest they should take him to be wiser than he is. The <hi>Psalmists fool</hi> despises him as much as he does Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: for he only <hi>saith it in his heart, there is no God;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> but this though he dares not think there is none, yet shews him not near so much outward respect and reverence as the other does. Even the <hi>Atheist</hi> himself thinks him a <hi>Fool,</hi> and the greatest of all other, who believes a <hi>God,</hi> and yet affronts him and trifles with him. And although the <hi>Atheists folly</hi> be unaccountable, in resisting the clearest evidence of reason, yet so far he is to be commended for what he says, that if there be such a thing as <hi>Religion,</hi> men ought to be serious in it. So that of all hands the <hi>scoffer at Religion</hi> is looked on as one forsaken of that little reason, which might serve to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <note place="margin">E</note> a slender reputation of being above <hi>the beasts that perish:</hi> nay, therein his condition is worse than theirs, that as they understand not <hi>Religion,</hi> they shall never be punished for despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it: which such a person can never secure himself from,

For since he came to fulfil all the Prophesies which had gone before concerning him, and was himself the great Prophet foretold by all the rest, none might in humane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability have been judged more likely to have received and <note place="margin">E</note> honoured him, than those to whom the judgement of those things did peculiarly belong; and who were as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the truth of them as any else could be. Thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it might have been reasonably expected; and doubtless
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:97974:31"/>
it had been so, if interest and prejudice had not had a far more <note place="margin">A</note> absolute power and dominion over them, than they had over the rest of the people. If Miracles, and Prophesies, if Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Religion; nay, if the interest of another World could have prevailed over the interest of this among them; the <hi>Iewish Sanhedrin</hi> might have been some of the first Converts to Christianity, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> had been all Proselytes to Christ, and the Temple at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had been the first Christian Church. But to let us see with what a jealous eye Power and Interest looks on every thing that seems to offer at any disturbance of it, how much greater sway partiality and <note place="margin">B</note> prejudice hath upon the minds of men than true Reason and Religion; and how hard a matter it is to convince those who have no mind to be convinced; we find none more furious in their opposition to the person of Christ, none more obstinate in their infidelity as to his Doctrine, than those who were at that time in the greatest reputation among them for their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, wisdom, and knowledge. These are they, whom our Saviour, as often as he meets with, either checks for their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, or rebukes for their pride, or denounces woes against for their malice and hypocrisie: These are they who instead <note place="margin">C</note> of believing in Christ persecute him; instead of following him seek to destroy him: and that they might the better compass it, they reproach and defame him, as if he had been really as bad as themselves. And although the people might not presently believe what they said concerning him, yet that they might at least be kept in suspence by it, they endeavour to fasten the blackest calumnies upon him; and suit them with all imaginable arts to the tempers of those they had to deal with.</p>
                  <p>If any appeared zealous for the present peace and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note place="margin">D</note> of the Nation; and for paying the duty and obedience they owed to the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, which then governed them: to them he is represented as a factious and seditious person, as an enemy to <hi>Caesar,</hi> as one that intended to set up a Kingdom of his own, though to the ruine of his Country: That it was nothing but ambition and vain glory, which made him gather Disciples, and preach to multitudes; that none could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel what the dangerous consequences of such new Doctrines might be, if not timely suppressed, and the Author of them severely punished. Thus to the prudent and cautious, reason <note place="margin">E</note> of State is pretended as the ground of their enmity to Christ. But to those who were impatient of the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke, and watched for any opportunity to cast it off; they suggest the mighty improbabilities of ever obtaining any deliverance by a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97974:32"/>
person so mean and inconsiderable as our Saviour appeared <note place="margin">A</note> among them: and that surely God who delivered their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers of old from a bondage not greater than theirs, by a mighty hand and out-stretched arm, did never intend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of his people by one of obscure Parentage, mean Education, and of no interest in the wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To the great men, they need no more than bid them, behold the train of his followers, who being generally poor, the more numerous they were, the more mouths they might see open, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to devour the Estates of those who were above them. The Priests and Levites they bid consider what would become of <note place="margin">B</note> them all, if the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was abrogated, by which their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest was upheld; for if the Temple fell, it was impossible for them to stand. But the grand difficulty was among the people, who began to be possessed with so high an opinion of him by the greatness of his Miracles, the excellency of his Doctrine, and the innocency of his Conversation, that unless they could insinuate into their minds some effectual prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against these, all their other attempts were like to be vain and unsuccessful. If therefore they meet with any who were surprized by his Miracles, as well as ravished by his Doctrine; <note place="margin">C</note> when they saw him raise the dead, restore sight to the blind, cure the deaf and the lame, and cast out Devils out of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed persons, they tell them presently that these were the common arts of Impostors, and the practice of those who go about to deceive the people; that such things were easily done by the power of Magick, and assistance of the evil Spirits. If any were admirers of the Pharisaical rigours and austerities (as the people generally were) when mens Religion was mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by the sowerness of their countenances, the length of their Prayers, and the distance they kept from other persons; <note place="margin">D</note> these they bid especially beware of our Saviours Doctrine; for he condemned all zeal and devotion, all mortification and strictness of life, under the pretence of Pharisaical hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; that he sunk all Religion into short Prayers and dull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality; that his conversation was not among the persons of any reputation for piety, but among Publicans and Sinners; that nothing extraordinary appeared in his Life; that his actions were like other mens, and his company none of the best, and his behaviour among them with too great a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for a person who pretended to so high a degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. <note place="margin">E</note>

The only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which malice hath against the greatest Virtue, is, that the greater it is, the less it takes notice of all the petty arts which are used against it; and will not bring its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency so much into suspicion as to make any long Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies for it self. For, to a noble and generous spirit, assaulted <note place="margin">B</note> rather by noyse and clamour, than any solid reason or force of argument, neglect and disdain are the most proper weapons of defence: for where malice is only impertinent and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, a punctual answer seems next to a confession. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though innocency needs no defence as to it self, yet it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for all the advantages it hath of doing good to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that it appear to be what it really is; which cannot be done, unless its reputation be cleared from the malicious asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which are cast upon it. And from hence it was that our blessed Saviour, though he thought it not worth the while to <note place="margin">C</note> use the same diligence in the vindication of himself, which his enemies did in the defamation of him; yet when he saw it necessary in order to the reception of his Doctrine among the more ingenuous and tractable part of his auditors, he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the quickness of his replies, sometimes by the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denness and sharpness of his questions, and sometimes by the plain force of argument and reason, baffles his adversaries, so that though they were resolved not to be convinced, they thought it best for the time to be quiet. This was to let them see how easie it was for him to throw off their reproaches as <note place="margin">D</note> fast as their malice could invent them; and that it was as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for them by such weak attempts to obscure the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his innocency, as for the spots which Astonomers descern near the body of the Sun, ever to eclipse the light of it. So that all those thinner mists which envy and detraction raised at his first appearance, and those grosser vapours which arose from their open enmity when he came to a greater height, did but add a brighter lustre to his glory, when it was seen that notwithstanding all the machinations of his enemies, his innocency brake forth like the light, which shineth more and <note place="margin">E</note> more to the perfect day.</p>
                  <p>But it pleased God, for the tryal of mens minds so to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the matters of our Religion, that as they are never so clear, but men of obstinate and perverse spirits will find something
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:97974:33"/>
to cavil at; so they were never so dark and obscure in the most <note place="margin">A</note> difficult circumstances of them, but men of unprejudiced and ingenuous minds might find enough to satisfie themselves about them. Which is the main scope of our Saviour in the words of the Text, (and shall be of our present discourse upon them) <hi>but Wisdom is justified of all her Children.</hi> Where without any further Explication, by <hi>Wisdom</hi> we understand the method which God useth in order to the salvation of mankind; by the <hi>Children of Wisdom,</hi> all those who were willing to attain the end by the means which God affordeth, and by <hi>justifying,</hi> not only the bare approving it, but the declaring of that appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation <note place="margin">B</note> to the World by a just vindication of it from the cavils and exceptions of men. Although the words are capable of various senses, yet this is the most natural, and agreeable to the scope of what goes before. For there our Saviour speaks of the different ways wherein <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> and himself appeared among the <hi>Iews,</hi> in order to the same end, <hi>v.</hi> 33. For <hi>Iohn Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and ye say, he hath a Devil.</hi> A very severe Devil surely, and one of the strictest orders among them, that was so far from being cast out by fasting and prayer, that these were his continual <note place="margin">C</note> imployment! But what could we have sooner thought than that those persons who made the Devil the author of so much mortification and severity of live, should presently have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained Religion in a more free and pleasing humour; but this would not taken either, for <hi>the Son of Man comes eating and drinking;</hi> i. e. was remarkable for none of those rigours and austerities which they condemned in <hi>Iohn,</hi> and applauded in the <hi>Pharisees;</hi> and then presently they censure him, <hi>as a glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonous man, and a Wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and sinners,</hi> v. 34. i. e. the utmost excess that any course of life <note place="margin">D</note> was capable of they presently apply to those who had no other design in all their actions, than to recommend true piety and goodness to them. So impossible it was by any means which the wisdom of Heaven thought fit to use, to perswade them into any good opinion of the persons who brought the glad tidings of salvation to them: and therefore our Saviour, when he sees how refractory and perverse they were, in interpreting every thing to the worse, and sensuring the ways which infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wisdom thought fittest to reclaim them by, he tells them that it was nothing but malice and obstinacy which was the <note place="margin">E</note> cause of it; but if they were men of teachable spirits (who by an usual Hebraism are called the Children of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) they would see reason enough to admire, approve and justifie all the methods of divine Providence for the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97974:33"/>
good of Mankind. <hi>For Wisdom is justified of all her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which I mainly design to speak to from hence is, <hi>That although the wisest Contrivances of Heaven for the good of Mankind are lyable to the unjust cavils and exceptions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable men, yet there is enough to satisfie any teachable and ingenuous Minds concerning the wisdom of them.</hi> Before I come more particularly to examine those which concern our present subject, <hi>viz.</hi> the life and appearance of our Lord and Saviour, it will take very much off from the force of them, if we consider, that thus it hath always been, and supposing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <note place="margin">B</note> nature to be as it is, it is scarce conceivable that it should be otherwise. Not that it is necessary or reasonable it should be so at all, any more than it is necessary that men should act foolishly or inconsiderately; but as long as we must never expect to see all men either wise or pious, either to have a true judgement of things, or a love of Religion; so long we shall always find there will be some, who will be quarrelling with Religion when they have no mind to practise it. I speak not now of those who make a meer jest and scoff at Religion (of which our Age hath so many Instances) but of a sort of <note place="margin">C</note> men who are of a degree above the other, though far enough short of any true and solid wisdom; who yet are the more to be considered, because they seem to make a slender offer at reason in what they say. Some pretend they are not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfied with the particular ways of instituted Religion, any further than they are subservient to their present interest (which is the only God they worship) but to make all sure, the foundations even of Natural Religion it self cannot escape their cavils and exceptions. They have found out an <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> for those impressions of a Deity which are in <note place="margin">D</note> the hearts of men; and use their utmost arts to obscure, since they cannot extinguish those lively characters of the power, wisdom and goodness of God, which are every where to be seen in the large volume of the Creation. Religion is no more to them but an unaccountable fear; and the very notion of a spiritual substance (even of that without which we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know what a contradiction meant) is said to imply one. But if for quietness sake, and it may be to content their own minds as well as the World, they are willing to admit of a Deity, (which is a mighty concession from those who have so <note place="margin">E</note> much cause to be afraid of him) then to ease their minds of such troublesom companions as their fears are, they seek by all means to dispossess him of his Government of the World, by denying his Providence, and care of humane affairs. They
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:97974:34"/>
are contented he should be called an excellent Being, that <note place="margin">A</note> should do nothing, and therefore signifie nothing in the World; or rather, then he might be styled an Almighty <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> that is so fond of ease and pleasure, that the least thought of business would quite spoyl his happiness. Or if the activity of their own spirits may make them think that such an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Being may sometimes draw the Curtains and look abroad into the World, then every advantage which another hath got above them, and every cross accident which befalls themselves (which by the power of self-flattery most men have learnt to call the Prosperity of the wicked, and the sufferings of good <note place="margin">B</note> men) serve them for mighty charges against the justice of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence. Thus either God shall not govern the World at all, or if he do, it must be upon such terms as they please and approve of, or else they will erect an High Court of Justice upon him, and condemn the Sovereign of the World, because he could not please his discontented subjects. And as if he were indeed arraigned at such a bar, every weak, and peevish exception shall be cryed up for evidence; when the fullest and clearest vindications of him shall be scorned and contemned. But this doth not in the least argue the obnoxiousness of him <note place="margin">C</note> who is so accused, but the great injustice of those who dare pass sentence; where it is neither in their power to understand the reason of his actions, nor if it were, to call him in question for his proceedings with men. But so great is the pride and arrogance of humane Nature, that it loves to be condemning what it cannot comprehend; and there needs be no greater reason given concerning the many disputes in the world about Divine Providence, than that God is wise, and we are not, but would fain seem to be so. While men are in the dark they will be always quarrelling; and those who contend the most, <note place="margin">D</note> do it that they might seem to others to see, when they know themselves they do not. Nay, there is nothing so plain and evident, but the reason of some men is more apt to be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon in it, than their senses are; as it appeared in him who could not otherwise confute the Philosophers argument against motion, but by moving before him. So that we see the most certain things in the world are lyable to the cavils of men who imploy their wits to do it; and certainly those ought not to stagger mens faith in matters of the highest nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, which would not at all move them in other <note place="margin">E</note> things.</p>
                  <p>But at last it is acknowledged by the men who love to be called the men of wit in this Age of ours, that there is a God and Providence, a future state, and the differences of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:97974:34"/>
good and evil, but the Christian Religion they will see no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">A</note> reason to embrace than as it is the Religion of the State they live in. But if we demand what mighty reasons they are able to bring forth against a Religion so holy and innocent in its design, so agreeable to the Nature of God and Man, so well contrived for the advantages of this and another life, so fully attested to come from God by the Miracles wrought in confirmation of it, by the death of the Son of God, and of such multitudes of Martyrs, so certainly conveyed to us, by the unquestionable Tradition of all Ages since the first delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it; the utmost they can pretend against it is, that it is <note place="margin">B</note> built upon such an appearance of the Son of God which was too mean and contemptible, that the Doctrine of it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Civil Interests of men, and the design ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for the Reformation of the World. For the removal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of these cavils against our Religion, I shall shew,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That there were no circumstances in our Saviours appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or course of life, which were unbecoming the Son of God, and the design he came upon.</item>
                     <item>2. That the Doctrine delivered by him is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to the Civil Interests of the World, that it tends <note place="margin">C</note> highly to the preservation of them.</item>
                     <item>3 That the design he came upon was very agreeable to the Infinite Wisdom of God, and most effectual for the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For clearing the first of these, I shall consider, (1.) The Manner of our Saviours appearance. (2.) The Course of his Life; and what it was which his enemies did most object against him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Manner of our Saviours Appearance; which hath been always the great offence to the admirers of the pomp and <note place="margin">D</note> greatness of the World. For when they heard of the Son of God coming down from Heaven, and making his Progress in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this lower world, they could imagine nothing less, than that an innumerable company of Angels must have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatched before, to have prepared a place for his reception; that all the Soveraigns and Princes of the World must have been summoned to give their attendance and pay their homage to him: that their Scepters must have been immediately laid at his feet, and all the Kingdoms of the earth been united in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one universal Monarchy under the Empire of the Son of <note place="margin">E</note> God: That the Heavens should bow down at his presence to shew their obeysance to him, the Earth tremble and shake for fear at the near approaches of his Majesty; that all the Clouds should clap together in one universal Thunder, to welcome his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:97974:35"/>
appearance, and tell the Inhabitants of the World what cause <note place="margin">A</note> they had to fear him whom the Powers of the Heavens obey: that the Sea should run out of its wonted course with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and horror; and if it were possible, hide it self in the hollow places of the earth: that the Mountains should shrink in their heads, to fill up the vast places of the deep; so that all that should be fulfilled in a literal sense, which was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of the coming of the <hi>Messias,</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 3. 5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>That every Valley should be filled, and every Mountain and Hill brought low; the crooked made straight, and the rough ways smooth, and all flesh see the salvation of God.</hi> Yea, that the Sun for a <note place="margin">B</note> time should be darkned, and the Moon withdraw her light, to let the Nations of the Earth understand that a Glory infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater than theirs did now appear to the World. In a word, they could not imagine the Son of God could be born without the pangs and throws of the whole Creation; that it was as impossible for him to appear, as for the Sun in the Firmament to disappear, without the notice of the whole World. But when instead of all his pomp and grandeur he comes <hi>incognito</hi> into the World, instead of giving notice of his appearance to the Potentates of the Earth, he is only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovered <note place="margin">C</note> to a few silly Shepherds and three wise men of the East; instead of choosing either <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Hierusalem</hi> for the place of his Nativity, he is born at <hi>Bethleem</hi> a mean and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure Village: instead of the glorious and magnificent Palaces of the East or West, which were at that time so famous; he is brought forth in a Stable, where the Manger was his Cradle, and his Mother the only attendant about him: who was her self none of the great persons of the Court, nor of any fame in the Country; but was only rich in her Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and honourable in her Pedigree. And according to the <note place="margin">D</note> obscurity of his Birth was his Education too: his youth was not spent in the Imperial Court at <hi>Rome,</hi> nor in the Schools of Philosophers at <hi>Athens,</hi> nor at the feet of the great Rabbies at <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> but at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a place of mean esteem among the <hi>Iews,</hi> where he was remarkable for nothing so much as the Vertues proper to his Age, Modesty, Humility and Obedience. All which he exercises to so high a degree, that his greatest Kindred and acquaintance were mightily sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized when at 30. years of age, he began to discover himself by the Miracles which he wrought, and the Authority which <note place="margin">E</note> he spake with. And although the rayes of his Divinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to break forth through the Clouds he had hitherto dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised himself in, yet he persisted still in the same course of humility and self-denyal; taking care of others to the neglect
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:97974:35"/>
of himself; feeding others by a Miracle, and fasting himself, <note place="margin">A</note> to one: shewing his power in working miraculous Cures, and his humility in concealing them: Conversing with the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of the people, and choosing such for his Apostles, who brought nothing to recommend them but innocency and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity. Who by their heats and ignorance were continual exercises of his Patience in bearing with them, and of his care and tenderness in instructing them. And after a life thus led with such unparallel'd humility, when he could add nothing more to it by his actions, he doth it by his sufferings; and compleats the sad Tragedy of his Life by a most shameful and <note place="margin">B</note> ignominious Death. This is the short and true account of all those things which the admirers of the greatness of this world think mean and contemptible in our Saviours appearance here on earth. But we are now to consider whether so great humility were not not more agreeable with the design of his coming into the World, than all that pomp and state would have been which the Son of God might have more easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded than we can imagine. He came not upon so mean an errand, as to dazle the eyes of Mankind with the brightness of his Glory, to amaze them by the terribleness of his Majesty, <note place="margin">C</note> much less to make a shew of the riches and gallantry of the World to them: But he came upon far more noble and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent designs, to bring life and immortality to light, to give men the highest assurance of an eternal happiness and misery in the World to come, and the most certain directions for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the one, and avoiding the other: and in order to that, nothing was judged more necessary by him, than to bring the vanities of this World out of that credit and reputation they had gained among foolish men. Which he could never have done, if he had declaimed never so much against the vanity of <note place="margin">D</note> worldly greatness, riches and honours, if in the mean time himself had lived in the greatest splendour and bravery. For the enjoyning then the contempt of this world to his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in hopes of a better, would have looked like the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the excellency of fasting at a full meal, and of the conveniencies of Poverty by one who makes the greatest hast to be rich. That he might not therefore seem to offer so great a contradiction to his Doctrine by his own example; he makes choice of a life so remote from all suspicion of designs upon this world, that <hi>though the foxes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <hi>had holes, and the birds of the air had nests, yet the Son of Man,</hi> who was the Lord and Heir of all things, <hi>had not whereon to lay his head.</hi> And as he shewed by his life how little he valued the great things of the World, so he disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:97974:36"/>
by his death how little he feared the evil things of <note place="margin">A</note> it: all which he did with a purpose and intention to rectifie the great mistakes of men as to these things: That they might no longer venture an eternal happiness for the splendid and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vanities of this present life; nor expose themselves to the utmost miseries of another world, to avoid the frowns of this. From hence proceeded that generous contempt of the World, which not only our Saviour himself, but all his true Disciples of the first Ages of Christianity were so remarkable for; to let others see they had greater things in their eye than any here, the hopes of which they would not part with for all that this <note place="margin">B</note> world thinks great or desirable. So that considering the great danger most men are in, by too passionate a love of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e things, and that universal and infinite kindness which our Saviour had to the Souls of men; there was nothing he could discover it more in as to his appearance in the world, than by putting such an affront upon the greatness and honour of it, as he did by so open a neglect of it in his life, and despising it in his death and sufferings. And who now upon any pretence of reason dare entertain the meaner apprehensions of our Blessed Saviour, because he appeared without the pomp and greatness <note place="margin">C</note> of the world, when the reason of his doing so was, that by his own humility and self-denyal he might shew us the way to an eternal happiness? Which he well knew how very hard it would be for men to attain to, who measure things not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their inward worth and excellency, but the splendour and appearance which they make to the world: who think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing great but what makes them gazed upon; nothing desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able but what makes them flattered. But if they could be once perswaded how incomparably valuable the glories of the life to come are above all the gayeties and shews of this; they <note place="margin">D</note> would think no condition mean or contemptible, which led to so great an end; none happy or honourable which must so soon end in the grave, or be changed to eternal misery. And that we might entertain such thoughts as these are, not as the melancholy effects of discontent and disappointments, but as the serious result of our most deliberate enquiry into the value of things, was the design of our Saviour in the humility of his appearance, and of that excellent Doctrine which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the World by it. Were I to argue the case with Philosophers, I might then at large shew from the free acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements <note place="margin">E</note> of the best and most experienced of them, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing becomes so much one who designs to recommend Vertue to the World, as a real and hearty contempt of all the pomp of it, and that the meanest condition proceeding from such a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:97974:36"/>
principle is truly and in it self more honourable, than living <note place="margin">A</note> in the greatest splendour imaginable. Were I to deal with the <hi>Iews,</hi> I might then prove, that as the Prophecies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Messias</hi> speak of great and wonderful effects of his coming, so that they should be accomplished in a way of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and humility. But since I speak to Christians, and and therefore to those who are perswaded of the great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and love of our Saviour in coming into the World, to reform it, and that by convincing men of the truth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of a future state, no more need be said to vindicate the appearance of him from that meanness and contempt, <note place="margin">B</note> which the pride and ambition of vain men is apt to cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But not only our Saviours manner of Appearance, but the manner of his Conversation gave great offence to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was too free and familiar among persons who had the meanest reputation, <hi>the Publicans and Sinners;</hi> and in the mean time declaimed against the strictest observers of the greatest rigours and austerities of life. And this no doubt was one great cause of the mortal hatred of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees</hi> against him, though least pretended, that even thereby <note place="margin">C</note> they might make good that charge of hypocrisie which our Saviour so often draws up against them. And no wonder, if such severe rebukes did highly provoke them, since they found this so gainful and withall so easie a trade among the people, when with a demure look and a sowre countenance they could cheat and defraud their Brethren; and under a specious shew of devotion could break their fasts by devouring Widows houses, and end their long Prayers to God with acts of the highest injustice to their Neighbours. As though all that while, they had been only begging leave of God to do all <note place="margin">D</note> the mischief they could to their Brethren. It is true, such as these were, our Saviour upon all occasions speaks against with the greatest sharpness, as being the most dangerous enemies to true Religion: and that which made men whose passion was too strong for their reason abhor the very name of Religion, when such baseness was practised under the profession of it. When they saw men offer to compound with Heaven for all their injustice and oppression, with not a twentieth part of what God challenges as his due; they either thought Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be a meer device of men, or that these mens hypocrisie <note place="margin">E</note> ought to be discovered to the World. And therefore our Blessed Saviour, who came with a design to retrieve a true spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Religion among men, finds it first of all necessary to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mask those notorious hypocrites, that their deformities being
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:97974:37"/>
discovered, their ways as well as their persons might be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">A</note> understood and avoided. And when he saw by the mighty opinion they had of themselves, and their uncharitableness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all others, how little good was to be done upon them, he seldom vouchsafes them his presence; but rather converses with those who being more openly wicked were more easily convinced of their wickedness, and perswaded to reform. For which end alone it was that he so freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed with them, to let them see there were none so bad, but his kindness was so great to them, that he was willing to do them all the good he could: And therefore this could be no <note place="margin">B</note> more just a reproach to Christ, that he kept company some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with these, than it is to a Chyrurgion to visit Hospitals, or to a Physician to converse with the sick.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But when they saw that his Greatness did appear in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, by the authority of his Doctrine, and the power of his Miracles, then these wise and subtle men apprehend a further reach and design in all his actions: <hi>Viz.</hi> That his low condition was a piece of Popularity, and a meer disguise to ensnare the people, the better to make them in love with his Doctrine, and so by degrees to season them with Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <note place="margin">C</note> of Rebellion and disobedience: Hence came all the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of his being <hi>an Enemy to Caesar,</hi> and calling himself, <hi>the King of the Iews,</hi> and of his design to erect a Kingdom of his own, all which they interpret in the most malicious though most unreasonable sense. For nothing is so politick as malice and ill will is; for that finds designs in every thing; and the more contrary they are to all the Protestations of the persons concerned, the deeper that suggests presently they are laid, and that there is the more cause to be afraid of them. Thus it was in our Blessed Saviours case; it was not the greatest care <note place="margin">D</note> used by him to shew his obedience to the Authority he lived under, it was not his most solemn disavowing having any thing to do with their civil Interests, not the severe checks he gave his own Disciples for any ambitious thoughts among them, not the recommending the doctrine of Obedience to them, nor the rebuke he gave one of his most forward Disciples for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to draw his sword in the rescue of himself, could abate the fury and rage of his enemies, but at last they condemn the greatest Teacher of the duty of Obedience as a Traytor, and the most unparallel'd example of innocency as a Malesactor. <note place="margin">E</note> But though there could be nothing objected against the life and actions of our Blessed Saviour, as tending to sedition and disturbance of the Civil Peace, yet that, these men (who were inspired by malice, and prophesied according to their

So then, it was not what he did, but what he might have done: not Treason but Convenience which made them take away the life of the most innocent person: but if there had been any taint in his doctrine that way, there had been reason enough in such an Age of faction and sedition to have used the utmost care to prevent the spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. But so far is this from the least ground of probability that it is not possible to imagine a Religion which aims less <note place="margin">B</note> at the present particular interests of the embracers of it, and more at the publick interests of Princes than Christianity doth, as it was both preached and practised by our Saviour and his Apostles.</p>
                  <p>And here we have cause to lament the unhappy fate of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion when it falls under the censure of such who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Masters of all the little arts whereby this world is governed. If it teaches the duty of Subjects, and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Princes, if it requires obedience to Laws, and makes mens happiness or misery in another life in any measure to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend <note place="margin">C</note> upon it; then Religion is suspected to be a meer trick of State, and an invention to keep the world in awe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men might the better be moulded into Societies, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in them. But if it appear to inforce any thing indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensably on the Consciences of men, though humane Laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the contrary; if they must not forswear their Religion, and deny him whom they hope to be saved by, when the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate calls them to it, then such half-witted men think that Religion is nothing but a pretence to Rebellion, and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence only an obstinate plea for Disobedience. But this is to <note place="margin">D</note> take it for granted that there is no such thing as Religion in the World; for if there be, there must be some inviolable Rights of Divine Soveraignty acknowledged, which must not vary according to the diversity of the Edicts and Laws of men. But supposing the profession and practice of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be allowed inviolable, there was never any Religion, nay, never any inventions of the greatest Politicians, which might compare with that for the preservation of civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For this in plain and express words tells all the owners of it, that they must live in subjection and obedience; <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 13. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note>

force to keep men in obedience to Authority; for he that <note place="margin">A</note> only obeys because it is his interest to do so, will have the same reason to disobey when there is an apprehension that may make more for his advantage. But when the reason of obedience is derived from the concernments of another life, no hopes of interest in this world can be thought to ballance the loss which may come by such a breach of duty in that to come. So that no persons do so dangerously undermine the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of civil Government, as those who magnifie that to the contempt of Religion; none so effectually secure them as those <hi>who give to God the things that are Gods,</hi> and by doing so, <note place="margin">B</note> are obliged <hi>to give to Caesar the things that are Caesars.</hi> This was the Doctrine of Christianity as it was delivered by the first author of it; and the practice was agreeable, as long as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity preserved its primitive honour in the world. For, so far were men then from making their zeal for Religion a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to rebellion, that though Christianity were directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Religions then in vogue in the world, yet they knew of no other way of promoting it, but by patience, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, meekness, prayers for their persecutors, and tears when they saw them obstinate. So far were they then from soment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">C</note> suspicions and jealousies concerning the Princes and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours they lived under, that though they were generally known to be some of the worst of men as well as of Princes, yet they charge all Christians in the strictest manner, as they loved their Religion and the honour of it, as they valued their souls and the salvation of them, that they should be subject to them. So far were they then from giving the least encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the usurpations of the rights of Princes unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yea so constant and uniform was the doctrine and practice of Obedience in all the first and purest ages of the Christian Church, that no one instance can be produced of any usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rights of Princes under the pretence of any title from Christ, or any disobedience to their authority, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of promoting Christianity, through all those times <note place="margin">E</note> wherein Christianity the most flourished, or the Christians were the most persecuted. And happy had it been for us in these last ages of the World, if we had been Christians on the same terms which they were in the Primitive times;

then there had been no such scandals raised by the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy <note place="margin">A</note> of men upon the most excellent and peaceable Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the world, as though that were unquiet and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom, because so many have been so who have made shew of it. But let their pretences be never so great to Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility on one side, and to the Spirit on the other, so far as men encourage faction and disobedience, so far they have not the Spirit of Christ and Christianity, and therefore are none of his. For he shewed his great wisdom in contriving such a method of saving mens souls in another world, as tended most to the preservation of the peace and <note place="margin">B</note> quietness of this; and though this wisdom may be evil spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by men of restless and unpeaceable minds, yet I will be still justified by all who have heartily embraced the Wisdom which is from above, who are pure and peaceable as that Wisdom is, and such, and only such are the Children of it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That the design it self was very agreeable to the infinite Wisdom of God. What could we imagine more becoming the Wisdom of God, than to contrive a way for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of lapsed and degenerate Mankind? who more fit to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy upon such a message as this, than the Son of God? for his coming gives the greatest assurance to the minds of men, that God was serious in the management of this design, than which nothing could be of greater importance in order to the success of it. And how was it possible he should give a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter testimony of himself, and withal of the purpose he came <note place="margin">D</note> about, than he did when he was in the world? The accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of Prophesies, and power of Miracles shewed who he was; the nature of his Doctrine, the manner of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, the greatness of his Sufferings, shewed what his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was in appearing among men: for they were all managed with a peculiar respect to the convincing mankind, that God was upon terms of mercy with them, and had therefore sent his Son into the world, that he might not only obtain the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of sin for those who repent, but eternal life for all them that obey him. And what is there now we can imagine so <note place="margin">E</note> great and desireable as this, for God to manifest his wisdom in? It is true, we see a great discovery of it in the works of Nature, and might do in the methods of Divine Providence if partiality and interest did not blind our eyes; but both these,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97974:39"/>
though great in themselves, yet fall short of the contrivance <note place="margin">A</note> of bringing to an eternal happiness man who had fallen from his Maker, and was perishing in his own folly. Yet this is that which men in the pride and vanity of their own imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons either think not worth considering, or consider as little as if they thought so; and in the mean time think themselves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wise too. The <hi>Iews</hi> had the wisdom of their Traditions which they gloried in, and despised the Son of God himself when he came to alter them. The <hi>Greeks</hi> had the wisdom of their Philosophy which they so passionately admired, that whatever did not agree with that, though infinitely more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <note place="margin">B</note> and useful, was on that account rejected by them. The <hi>Romans,</hi> after the conquest of so great a part of the World, were grown all such Politicians and Statesmen, that few of them could have leisure to think of another world, who were so busie in the management of this. And some of all these sorts do yet remain in the World, which makes so many so little think of, or admire this infinite discovery of divine Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: nay, there are some who can mix all these together, joyning a <hi>Iewish</hi> obstinacy, with the pride and self-opinion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> to a <hi>Roman</hi> unconcernedness about the matters of <note place="margin">C</note> another life. And yet upon a true and just enquiry never any Religion could be found, which could more fully satisfie the expectation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> the reason of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> than that which was made known by Christ, <hi>who was the Wisdom of God, and the Power of God.</hi> Here the <hi>Iew</hi> might find his <hi>Messias</hi> come, and the Promises fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led which related to him, here the <hi>Greek</hi> might find his long and vainly looked for certainty of a life to come, and the way which leads to it, here the <hi>Roman</hi> might see a Religion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to another world and this together. Here are Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts <note place="margin">D</note> more holy, Promises more certain, Rewards more desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than ever the wit or invention of men could have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to. Here are Institutions far more pious, useful and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to mankind, than the most admired Laws of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Legislators of <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome.</hi> Here are no popular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs carried on, no vices indulged for the publick interest, which <hi>Solon, Lycurgus</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> are charged with.

But the nature of the Worship is such as the minds of those who come to it ought to be, and as becomes that God whom we profess to serve, pure and holy, grave and serious, solemn and devout, without the mixtures of superstition, vanity or ostentation. The precepts of our Religion are plain and easie to be known, very suitable to the nature of Mankind, and highly tending to the advantage of those who practise them, both in this and a better life. The arguments to perswade men are the most <note place="margin">B</note> weighty and powerful, and of as great importance as the love of God, the death of his Son, the hopes of happiness, and the fears of eternal misery, can be to men.

                  <p n="1">1. For Repentance for sins past. What more powerful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives can there be to perswade men to repent, than for God to let men know that he is willing to pardon their sins upon the sincerity of their Repentance, but without that, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains nothing but a fearful expectation of judgement, and fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry indignation? that their sins are their follies, and therefore to repent is to grow wise: that he requires no more from men, <note place="margin">D</note> but what every considerative man knows is fitting to be done whenever he reflects upon his actions: that there can be no greater ingratitude or disingenuity towards the Son of God than to stand at defiance with God when he hath shed his blood to reconcile God and Man to each other: that every step of his humiliation, every part of the Tragedy of his life, every wound at his death, every groan and sigh which he uttered upon the Cross, were designed by him as the most prevailing Rhetorick, to perswade men to forsake their sins, and be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: that there cannot be a more unaccountable folly, than by <note place="margin">E</note> impenitency to lose the hopes of a certain and eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for the sake of those pleasures which every wise man is ashamed to think of: that to continue in sin with the hopes to repent, is to stab a mans self with the hopes of a cure: that

the sooner men do it, the sooner they will find their minds at <note place="margin">A</note> ease, and that the pleasures they enjoy in forsaking their sins, are far more noble and manly than ever they had in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them: but if none of these arguments will prevail with them, perish they must, and that unavoidably, insupportably, and irrecoverably: And if such arguments as these will not prevail with men to leave their sins, it is impossible that any should.</p>

Let us then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the whole design of the Gospel, and see how admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably it is suited to the end it was intended for, to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those whose good was designed by it, and to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the great contriver and manager of it.

so great was the change which was wrought in him, that from a Bigot of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Religion he becomes an Apostle of the <hi>Christian,</hi> and from breathing flames against the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, none more ready than he to undergo them for Christ. If he had only given over his persecution, it might have been thought, that he had meerly run himself out of breath, and grown weary of his former fury, (as greater persons than he did afterwards) but to retain the same fervour of spirit in preaching Christ, which he had before in opposing him, to have as great zeal for making Christians, as he had for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying them, must needs proceed from some great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual <note place="margin">B</note> cause. Whilest the <hi>Iews</hi> thought he had too much learning and interest to become their enemy, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians found he had too much rage and fury to be their friend, even then when they least expected it, instead of continuing an Instrument of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> for punishing the Christians, he declared himself an Apostle and servant of Jesus Christ. And that no ordinary one neither; for such was the efficacy of those divine words, <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me,</hi> that they not only presently allay his former heat, but quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and animate him to a greater zeal for the honour of him <note place="margin">C</note> whom he had persecuted before. And the faster he had run when he was out of his way, the greater diligence he used when he found it, there being none of all the followers of Christ who out-stript him in his constant endeavours to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Christian Religion in the World. And if an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied diligence to promote it, an uncessant care for preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, an universal concern for all who owned it, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted spirit in bearing the affronts and injuries he underwent for it, be any perswasive arguments of the love a man bears to his Religion, there was never any person who made a <note place="margin">D</note> clearer demonstration than St. <hi>Paul</hi> did of the truth of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and his sincerity in embracing it. For his endeavours were suitable to the greatness of his spirit, his care as large as the Horizon of the Sun of righteousness, his courage as great as the malice of his enemies. For he was neither afraid of the malice of the <hi>Iews,</hi> or of the Wisdom of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or of the Power of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but he goes up and down preaching the Gospel in a sphere as large as his mind was, and with a zeal only parallel with his former fury.

Wherein we have considerable these two things, 1. The Apostles boldness <note place="margin">D</note> and freeness in declaring the doctrine of Christ, <hi>For I am not ashamed,</hi> &amp;c. 2.

                  <p n="1">1. The Apostles boldness and freeness in declaring the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ. It was neither the gallantry of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court, nor the splendor of the City, not the greatness of her Power, or wisdom of her Statesmen could make St. <hi>Paul</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the meaner opinion of the doctrine he hoped to preach among them.

But to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:97974:42"/>
preach a crucified Saviour among the glories and triumphs of <note place="margin">A</note> 
                     <hi>Rome,</hi> and a Doctrine of so much simplicity and contempt of the world among those who were the Masters of it, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged it with so much art and cunning; to perswade them to be followers of Christ in a holy life, who could not be like the gods they worshiped, unless they were guilty of the greatest debaucheries, seems to be an employment so lyable to the greatest scorn and contempt, that none but a great and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved spirit would ever undertake it. For when we consider af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so many hundred years profession of Christianity, how apt the greatness of the world is to make men ashamed of the <note place="margin">B</note> practice of it; and that men aim at a reputation for wit by being able to abuse the Religion they own; what entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might we then think our Religion met with among the great men of the Age it was first preached in, when it not only encountered those weaker weapons of scoffs and raillery, but the strong holds of interest and education? If our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now can hardly escape the bitter scoffs, and profane jests of men who pawn their souls to be accounted witty, what may we think it suffered then, when it was accounted a part of their own Religion to dispise and reproach ours? If in the Age we <note place="margin">C</note> live in, a man may be reproached for his piety and virtue, that is, for being really a Christian, when all profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be so, what contempt did they undergo in the first Ages of the Christian World, when the very name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian was thought a sufficient brand of infamy? And yet such was the courage and magnanimity of the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that what was accounted most mean and contemptible in their Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> their believing in a crucified Saviour, was by them accounted the matter of their greatest honour and glory. For though St. <hi>Paul</hi> only saith here that <hi>he was not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <hi>ashamed of the Gospel of Christ,</hi> yet elsewere he explains that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> which is contained in these words, when he saith, <hi>God forbid that I should glory in any thing, save in the Cross of Christ, by whom the World is crucified to me, and I unto the World.</hi> Gal. 6. 14. <hi>i. e.</hi> Although he could not but be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how much the world despised him, and his Religion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yet that was the great satisfaction of his mind, that his Religion had enabled him to despise the World as much. For neither the pomp and grandeur of the World, nor the smiles and flatteries of it, no nor its frowns and severities <note place="margin">E</note> could abate any thing of that mighty esteem and value which he had for the Christian Religion. For in his own expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>he accounted all things else but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Iesus his Lord,</hi> Phil. 3. 8. Which words
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97974:43"/>
are not spoken by one who was in despair of being taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice <note place="margin">A</note> of for any thing else, and therefore magnifies the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he was engaged in; but by a person as considerable as most of the time and Nation he lived in both for his birth and education. So that his contempt of the World was no sullen and affected severity, but the issue of a sober and impartial judgement; and the high esteem he professed of Christianity was no fanatick whimsey, but the effect of a diligent enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the most serious consideration. And that will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the grounds and reasons which St. <hi>Paul</hi> here gives <note place="margin">B</note> why he was not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, 1. From the excellent end it was designed for, and that is no less than <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> 2. From the effectualness of it in order to that end, <hi>it is the Power of God to Salvation.</hi> 3. From the necessity of believing the Gospel by all who would attain that end; <hi>to every one that believes, the Iew first and also to the Greek.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the excellent End it was designed for, the recovery and happiness of the souls of men, both which are implyed in the term <hi>salvation.</hi> For, considering the present condition of humane Nature, as it is so far sunk beneath it self, and kept <note place="margin">C</note> under the power of unruly passions; whatever tends to make it happy, must do it by delivering it from all those things which are the occasions of its misery. So that whatever Religion should promise to make men happy, without first making them vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and good, might on that very account be justly suspected of imposture. For the same reasons which make the acts of any Religion necessary, <hi>viz.</hi> that we may please that God who commands and governs the World, must make it necessary for men to do it, in those things which are far more acceptable to him than all our sacrifices of what kind soever, which are <note place="margin">D</note> the actions of true vertue and goodness. If then that accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been true, which <hi>Celsus</hi> and <hi>Iulian</hi> charged Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with, <hi>viz. that it indulged men in the practice of vice, with the promise of a future happiness notwithstanding;</hi> I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could have rendred it more suspicious to be a design to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Mankind. But so far is it from having the least foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of truth in it, that as there never was any Religion which gave men such certain hopes of a future felicity, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more encouragement to be good, so there was none ever required it on those strict and severe terms which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity <note place="margin">E</note> doth. For there being two grand duties of men in this world, either towards God in the holiness of their hearts and lives, or towards their Brethren, in a peaceable carriage among men (which cannot be without justice and sobriety)
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97974:43"/>
both these are enforced upon all Christians, upon no meaner <note place="margin">A</note> terms than the unavoidable loss of all the happiness our Religion promises. <hi>Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.</hi> Heb. 12. 14. This is then the grand design of Christianity, to make men happy in another world, by making them good and vertuous in this: It came to reform this world that it might people another; so to purifie the souls of men, as to make them meet to enjoy the happiness designed for them. This is that <hi>great Salvation</hi> which the Gospel brings to the world. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. and thence it is called <hi>the Word of Salvation,</hi> Acts 13. 26. <hi>the way of salvation,</hi> Acts 16. 17. <note place="margin">B</note> 
                     <hi>the Gospel of salvation,</hi> Ephes. 1. 13. So that though Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity be of unspeakable advantage to this world, there being no Religion that tends so much to the peace of mens minds, and the preservation of civil Societies as this doth; yet all this it doth by way of subordination to the great end of it, which is the promoting mens eternal happiness. And the more we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the vast consequence and importance of this end to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the greater reason we shall find that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> had why <hi>he should not be ashamed of the Gospel of Christ.</hi> For can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any end more noble that any doctrine can aim at than this? <note place="margin">C</note> Supposing the common principles of all Religion to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> the Being of God, and Immortality of our Souls, there can be nothing more becoming that God to discover, or those Souls to be imployed about, than the way to a blessed immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. And if we admire those discourses of the Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, wherein they speak more darkly and obscurely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those things, what admiration doth the Gospel deserve, which hath brought life and immortality to light? If we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the vertuous Heathens, who according to those short and obscure notices which they had of God and themselves, <note place="margin">D</note> sought to make the world any thing the better for their being in it, what infinitely greater esteem do those blessed Apostles deserve, who accounted not their own lives dear to them that they might make even their enemies happy? If those mens me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories be dear to us who sacrifice their lives and fortunes for the sake of the Country they belong to, shall not those be much more so who have done it for the good of the whole world? Such who chearfully suffered death while they were teaching men the way to an eternal life, and who patiently endured the flames if they might but give the greater light to the world by them. <note place="margin">E</note> Such who did as far out-go any of the admired <hi>Heroes</hi> of the Heathens, as the purging the World from sin is of greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence than cleansing an <hi>Augaean</hi> Stable from the filth of it, and rescuing men from eternal flames is a more noble design
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:97974:44"/>

And was not this a discovery infinitely greater and more suitable to the nature of God, than any which the subtilty of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or wisdom of the <hi>Romans</hi> could ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to concerning any of their Deities? Thus we see the ex cellent end of our Religion was that which made St. <hi>Paul</hi> so far <note place="margin">C</note> from being ashamed of it; and so it would do all us too, if we did understand and value it as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did. But it is the great dishonour of too many among us, that they are more asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their Religion than they are of their sins If to talk bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against Heaven, to affront God in calling him to witness their great impieties by frequent oaths, to sin bravely and with the highest confidence, to mock at such who are yet mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But this is rather the utmost endeavour to put Religion out of countenance, and make the Gospel it self blush and be ashamed, that ever such boldfaced impieties should be committed by men under the profession of it, as though they believed nothing so damnable as Repentance and a Holy life, and no sin so unpardonable as Modesty in committing it. But to use St. <hi>Pauls</hi> language when he had been describing such persons himself, <hi>Hob. 6. 9. We are perswaded better things of you, and things that accompany that salvation the Gospel was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for, though we thus speak.</hi> For certainly nothing can argue <note place="margin">E</note> a greater meanness of spirit, than while wicked and profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are not ashamed of that which unavoidably tends to their ruine, any should be shy of the profession and practice of that which conduces to their eternal happiness. What is become
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:97974:44"/>
of all that magnanimity and generous spirit which the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tve <note place="margin">A</note> Christians were so remarkable for, if while some are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent in sinning, others are ashamed of being or doing good? If we have that value for our immortal souls, and a future life, which we ought to have, we shall not trouble our selves much with the Atheistical scoffs and drollery of profane persons, who while they deride and despise Religion, do but laugh themselves into eternal misery. And thus much for the first ground of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> confidence, <hi>viz.</hi> The excellent end the Gospel was designed for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The effectualness of it in order to that end. <hi>It is the</hi>

                     <item>1. The inefficacy of any other doctrine for that end.</item>

                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1 The inefficacy of any other Doctrine for this end of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the eternal salvation of Mankind. If the world had been acquainted with any doctrine before which had been suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the purposes the Gospel was designed for, there would have been no such necessity of propagating it among men; nor had there been reason enough to have justified the Apostles in exposing themselves to so great hazards for the preaching of <note place="margin">C</note> it. If the notion of an eternal God and Providence, without the knowledge of a <hi>Saviour,</hi> had been sufficient to reform the World, and make men happy; it had not been consistent with the wisdom or goodness of God to have imploy'd so many persons, with the loss of their lives, to declare the Doctrine of Christ to the World. So that if Christianity be true, it must be thought necessary to salvation, for the necessity of it was declared by those who were the instruments of confirming the truth of it. I meddle not with the case of those particular persons who had no means or opportunity to know Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed <note place="margin">D</note> will, and yet from the Principles of Natural Religion did reform their lives, in hopes of a future felicity (if any such there were) but whether there were not a necessity of such a Doctrine as the Gospel is to be discover'd to the world, in order to the reformation of it? For some very few persons ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through the goodness of their natures, the advantage of their education, or some cause of a higher nature, may have led more vertuous lives than others did; but it is necessary, that what aims at the general good of Mankind, must be suited to the capacities of all, and enforced with arguments which <note place="margin">E</note> may prevail on any but the most obstinate and wilful persons. But when we consider the state of the World at that time when Christianity was first made known to it, we may easily see how insufficient the common Principles of Religion were, from
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:97974:45"/>
working a reformation in it, when notwithstanding them man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind <note place="margin">A</note> was so generally lapsed into Idolatry and Vice, that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any can be instanced in in the Heathen World, who had esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped both of them. And there was so near an affinity between both these, that they who were ingaged in the rites of their Idolatry, could hardly keep themselves free from the intan glements of vice; not only because many of their villanies were practised as part of their Religion, (and there was little hopes certainly of their being good, who could not be Religious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being bad) but because the very Gods they worship'd were represented to be as bad as themselves. And could they take <note place="margin">B</note> any better measure of Vertue, than from the actions of those whom they supposed to have so divine an excellency in them, as to deserve their adoration? So that if there were a design of planting wickedness in the world (which need not be, for it grows fast enough without it) it could not be done more suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully than by worshipping those for Gods, who did such things which good men would abhorr to think of. And yet this was the state of the world then, when the Gospel was preached, and not only of the more rude and barbarous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but of the most civilized and knowing people, as the <note place="margin">C</note> 
                     <hi>Romans</hi> themselves; as our Apostle at large proves in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of this chapter, wherein he shews, that though they had means enough of knowing the Eternal God and Providence, yet they were so fallen into Idolatry, and the most vicious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, that there was no means of recovering them, but by a fuller discovery both of the justice and goodness of God.</p>
                  <p>I know it will be here objected, that though the generality of men were bad then (as when were they otherwise) yet the Heathens had a kind of Apostles among them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers, who sought to amend the manners of men by the <note place="margin">D</note> moral instructions they gave them, so that if men were bad, it was not for want of good counsel, but for not observing it, which is all (they say) we have to say for our selves, when we are charged with the great debaucheries of the Christian world.</p>
                  <p>To which I answer, That our business is not now to enquire whether there hath not been an incomparably greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the world by Christianity, in the reforming mens lives, than ever was by any of the <hi>Heathen Morals;</hi> but whether these, taking them in the fairest dress, were so sufficient for <note place="margin">E</note> the bringing men to eternal happiness, that there needed not any such Doctrine as Christianity be published for that end? And there are two great things we may charge the best of their discourses with an insufficiency in, for the accomplishment of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:97974:45"/>
this end, which are Certainty, and Motives, or the want of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments <note place="margin">A</note> to believe, and Encouragements to practise.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They were destitute of sufficient certainty; for what a man ventures his eternal state upon, he ought to be well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the truth of it. But how was it possible for the World to be reformed by such wise Apostles (if they must be called so) who were perpetually disputing among themselves about those things which were the most necessary foundations of all Vertue and Religion? As though the best Arguments they had to prove their Souls immortal, was because their disputes about them were so. And those seemed among them to gain the <note place="margin">B</note> greatest reputation for wit, who were best able to dispute against common Principles; and they managed their business with greatest advantage, who only shewed the weakness of others principles, but established none of their own; which was an unavoidable consequence of the way they proceeded in, for offering at no such way of proof as Christianity doth, they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught men to dispute, than to live eternally. Besides, their discourses were too subtile and intricate for the common capacities of men; how long might a man live before an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telechia</hi> would make him know the nature of his soul the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">C</note> or an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> perswade him to believe its immortality? Insomuch that it is hard to determine, whether the arguments used by them, did not rather hinder assent, than perswade to it? and it seems probable that the honest minded, illiterate Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens believed those things more firmly than the greatest Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers. For plain truths lose much of their weight, when they are rarified into subtilties, and their strength is impaired when they are spun into too fine a thread. The arguments which must prevail with Mankind, must be plain and evident, easie and yet powerful. The natural sense of good and evil in men is <note place="margin">D</note> oft-times dulled by disputes, and only awakned by a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful representation of an infinite being, and a future Judgement: and that by such a way of proof as all persons are equal Judges of the truth and validity of it; such as the Resurrection of Christ is in the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But let us suppose the arguments certain and suitable, yet what sufficient motives or encouragements could they give to lead a holy and vertuous life, who after all their endeavours to perswade others, remained so uncertain themselves as to a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happiness? So <hi>Tully</hi> tells us of <hi>Socrates</hi> himself when he was <note place="margin">E</note> just dying, <hi>That he told his friends, that only the Gods knew whether it was fitter for men to live or die, but he thought no man did.</hi> And although some would excuse this as his usual way of disputing, yet of all times one would think it was fittest
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:97974:46"/>
for him then to declare his mind in the most express terms, not <note place="margin">A</note> only for the full vindication of himself, but for the comfort and encouragement of his friends. We are sure, Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity proceeds on those terms, that if a future happiness be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed uncertain, it declares expresly there can be no sufficient reason given for men to part with the conveniencies of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent life; nay, it supposes <hi>the best men to be the most miserable of all others, if there be not a future reward,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 19.—32. Again, what probability was there they should ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the World to vertue and goodness, when the severest of the Philisophers, made it lye in things so repugnant to humane <note place="margin">B</note> nature, as goodness is agreeable to it. As when they made it an equal fault for a man to be angry, and to murder his Soveraign; and that all passions are to be destroy'd, that pain and grief are nothing, that vertue in all conditions is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reward to it self. Which are so contrary to the common sense of mankind, that the only way to perswade men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, is first to perswade them they are not men. So that he was certainly the wisest man among the Heathens, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>that we ought to expect a higher Master to teach us these things,</hi> and to acquaint us with the happiness of a future life. <note place="margin">C</note> And hereby an answer may be given to <hi>Porphyries</hi> grand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection against Christian Religion, <hi>viz. If it were so necessary for the good of Mankind, why was it so long before it was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered?</hi> Because God would thereby discover the insufficiency of all the means the wit of man could find out to reform the world, without this. That not only the <hi>Iews</hi> might see the weakness of that dispensation they were under, but the <hi>Gentile</hi> world might groan with an expectation of some more powerful means to goodness than were yet among them. For when Philosophy had been so long in its height, and had so little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence <note place="margin">D</note> upon Mankind, it was time for the Sun of righteousness to arise, and with the softening and healing influence of his beams to bring the World to a more vertuous temper.</p>
                  <p>And that leads to the Second thing implyed, which is the peculiar efficacy of the Gospel for promoting mens salvation, <hi>for it is the Power of God to salvation,</hi> and that will appear, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how many ways <hi>the power of God</hi> is engaged in it. These three especially. 1. In confirmation of the Truth of it. 2. In the admirable Effects of it in the World. 3. In the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viue Assistance which is promised to those who embrace it. <note place="margin">E</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In confirmation of the Truth of it. For the World was grown so uncertain, as to the grand foundations of Religion, that the same power was requisite now to settle the World, which was at first for the framing of it. For though the Precepts

of Christian Religion be pure and easie, holy and suitable to <note place="margin">A</note> the sense of mankind, though the Promises be great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, proportionable to our wants and the weight of our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, though the reward be such that it is easier to desire than comprehend it, yet all these would but seem to baffle the more the expectations of men, unless they were built on some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary evidence of divine power. And such we assert there was in the confirmation of these things to us, not only in the miraculous birth of our Saviour, and that continual series of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd miracles in his life, not only in the most obliging cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of his death; nor only in the large effusion of divine <note place="margin">B</note> gifts upon his Apostles, and the strange propagation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion by them against all humane power; but that which I shall particularly instance in, as the great effect of divine power, and confirmation of our Religion, was his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the dead. For, as our Apostle saith, <hi>Rom. 1. 4. Christ was declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of Holiness, by the Resurrection from the dead.</hi> No way of evidence could be more suitable to the capacities of all, than this, it being a plain matter of fact; none ever better attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than this was, not only by the unanimous consent of all the <note place="margin">C</note> witnesses, but by their constant adhering to the truth of it, though it cost almost all of them their lives; and no greater evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could be given to the World of a divine power, since both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> agreed in this, that such a thing could not be effected but by an immediate hand of God. So far were they then from thinking a resurrection possible by the juyce of herbs, or an infusion of warm blood into the veins, or by the breath of living Creatures, as the great martyr for <hi>Atheism</hi> would seem from <hi>Pliny</hi> to perswade us; when yet certainly nothing can be of higher concernment to those who believe not another life, <note place="margin">D</note> than to have try'd this experiment long ere now; and since no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that nature hath ever happened since our Saviours resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, it only lets us know what credulous men in other things the greatest Infidels as to Religion are. But so far were they at that time from so fond an imagination, that they readily yielded, that none but God could do it, though they seem'd to question whether God himself could do it or no. As appears by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Interrogation, <hi>Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?</hi> Act. 26. 8. This was therefore judged on both sides to be a matter of so great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <note place="margin">E</note> that all the disputes concerning Christian Religion were resolved into this, Whether Christ were risen from the dead? And this the Apostles urge and insist on, upon all occasions, as the great evidence of the truth of his Doctrine, and this was the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:97974:47"/>
main part of their Commission, for they were sent abroad to be <note place="margin">A</note> 
                     <hi>witnesses of his Resurrection.</hi> Which was not designed by God as a thing strange and incredible to puzle mankind with, but to give the highest assurance imaginable to the World of the truth and importance of Christianity. Since God was pleased to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his power in so high a manner to confirm the certainty of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Gods power was seen in the admirable effects of Christian Religion upon the minds of men: which was most discernable by the strange alteration it soon made in the state of the world. In <hi>Iudea</hi> soon after the death of Christ, some of his Crucifiers become Christians, 3000. Converts made at one Sermon of St. <note place="margin">B</note> 
                     <hi>Peter</hi>'s, and great accessions made afterwards both in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> and other places. Yea in all parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, where the Christians came, they so increased and multiplyed, that thereby it appeared that God had given a Benediction to his new Creation suitable to what he gave to the first. So that within the compass of not a hundred years after our Saviours death, the World might admire to see it self so strangely changed from what it was. The Temple at <hi>Hierusalem</hi> destroy'd, and the <hi>Iews</hi> under a sadder dispersion than ever, and rendred uncapable of continuing their former Worship of God there: the Heathen <note place="margin">C</note> Temples unfrequented, the Gods derided, the Oracles ceased, the Philosophers puzled, the Magistrates disheartned by their fruitless cruelties, and all this done by a few Christians who came and preached to the World <hi>Righteousness, Temperance, and a Iudgement to come,</hi> whereof God had given assurance to the World, by raising one <hi>Iesus</hi> from the dead. And all this effected not by the power of Wit and Eloquence, not by the force and violence of rebellious subjects, not by men of hot and giddy brains, but by men sober, just, humble and meek in all their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, but withal such as might never have been heard of in the <note place="margin">D</note> world, had not this Doctrine made them famous. What could this then be imputed to less than a Divine Power, which by effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and secret ways carries on its own design against all the force and wit of men. So that the wise <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> at whose feet St. <hi>Paul</hi> was bred, seem'd to have the truest apprehensions of these things at that time, when he told the <hi>Sanhedrin, If this counsel, or this work be of men, it will come to nought, but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, least haply ye be found to fight against God.</hi> Act. 5. 38, 39.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the Divine Assistance which is promised to those who <note place="margin">E</note> embrace it: in which respect it is properly <hi>the power of God to salvation;</hi> and therein far beyond what the Philosophers could promise to any who embraced their opinions. For, the Gospel doth not only discover the necessity of a Principle superiour to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:97974:47"/>
Nature, which we call <hi>Grace,</hi> in order to the fitting our souls for <note place="margin">A</note> their future happiness, but likewise shews on what terms God is pleased to bestow it on men, <hi>viz.</hi> on the consideration of the death and passion of our Lord and Saviour. <hi>Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost, which he shed on us abundantly through Christ our Saviour,</hi> Titus. 3. 5. There being nothing in humane nature which could oblige God, to give to Mankind that assistance of his grace whereby they are enabled to work out this salvation the Gospel is designed for, with fear and trembling. The whole <note place="margin">B</note> tenor of the Gospel importing a divine power which doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the preaching of it, which is designed on purpose to heal the wounds, and help the weakness of our depraved and degenerate nature. Through which we may be <hi>kept to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> but it must be <hi>through Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Which is the last particular of the words; the necessity of <hi>believing the Gospel</hi> in order to the partaking of the salvation promised in it; <hi>it is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes, to the Iew first, and also to the Greek.</hi> An easie way of salvation, if no more were required to mens happiness but a <note place="margin">C</note> fancy and strong opinion which they will easily call Believing. So there were some in St. <hi>Augustin</hi>'s time, I could wish there were none in ours, who thought nothing necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but a strong Faith, let their lives be what they pleased. But this is so repugnant to the main design of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that they who think themselves the strongest Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, are certainly the weakest, and most ungrounded. For they believe scarce any other proposition in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that <hi>Whosoever believeth shall be saved.</hi> If they did believe that Christ came into the world to reform it, and <note place="margin">D</note> make it better, that <hi>the wrath of God is now revealed from Heaven against all unrighteousness,</hi> as well as <hi>that the just by Faith shall live,</hi> that the design of all that love of Christ, which is shewn to the World, is <hi>to deliver them from the hand of their enemies, that they might serve him in righteousness and holiness all the days of their lives,</hi> they could never imagine, that salvation is entailed by the Gospel on a mighty confidence or vehement perswasion of what Christ hath done and suffered for them. And so far is St. <hi>Paul</hi> from asserting this, that as far as I can see, he never meddles with a matter of that nicety, <note place="margin">E</note> whether a single act of Faith be the condition of our justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as it is distinguished from Evangelical obedience, but his discourse runs upon this subject; whether God will pardon the sins of men upon any other terms than those which are declared
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97974:48"/>
in the Christian Religion, the former he calls <hi>Works,</hi> and the <note place="margin">A</note> latter <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know, the subtilty of later times hath made St. <hi>Paul</hi> dispute in the matter of justification, not as one bred up at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> but of the <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>Sentences;</hi> but men did not then understand their Religion at all the worse because it was plain and easie; and, it may be, if others since had understood their Religion better, there would never have needed so much subtilty to explain it, nor so many distinctions to defend it. The Apostle makes the same terms of justification and of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for as hesaith elsewhere, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom 5. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>We are justified by Faith,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">B</note> he saith here, <hi>the Gospel is the power of God to salvation to every one that believes;</hi> if therefore a single act of Faith be sufficient for one, why not for the other also? But if believing here be taken in a more large and comprehensive sense, as a complex act re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to our undertaking the conditions of the Gospel; why should it not be taken so in the subsequent discourse of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle? For we are to observe, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Epistle is not disputing against any sort of Christians that thought to be saved by their obedience to the Gospel from the assistance of divine grace; but against those who thought the Grace and indulgence <note place="margin">C</note> of the Gospel by no means necessary in order to the pardon of their sins, and their eternal happiness. Two things therefore the Apostle mainly designs to prove in the beginning of it: First, the insufficiency of any other way of salvation besides that offer'd by the Gospel; whether it were the light of Nature which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> contended for, but were far from living according to it; or that imaginary <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Works,</hi> which the <hi>Iews</hi> fancied to themselves (for it will be a very hard matter to prove that ever God entred into a Covenant of Works with fallen Man, which he knew it was impossible for him to observe) bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t hey <note place="margin">D</note> were so highly opinionated of themselves, and of those legal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations which were among them, that they thought by vertue of them they could merit so much favour at Gods hands, that there was no need of any other sacrifice, but what was among themselves to expiate the guilt of all their sins. And on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they rejected the Gospel, as the Apostle tells us, <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 3</note> 
                     <hi>that they being ignorant of Gods righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.</hi> Against these therefore the Apostle proves, that if they hoped for happiness upon such strict terms, they laid <note place="margin">E</note> only a foundation of <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 3 27.</note> 
                     <hi>boasting</hi> if they did all which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but of misery if they did not; for then, <note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 3. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <hi>Cursed is every one that continues not in every thing written in the Law to do it. i. e.</hi> if they sailed in any one thing, then they must fail of all
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:97974:48"/>
their hopes; but such a state of persection being impossible to <note place="margin">A</note> humane Nature; he shews, that either all mankind must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably perish, or they must be saved by the Grace and Favour of God, which he proves to be discovered by the Gospel: and that God will now accept of a hearty and sincere obedience to his will declared by his Son; so that all those who perform that, though they live not in the nice observance of the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> shall not need to fear the penalty of their sins in another life. Which is the second thing he designs to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> That those who obeyed the Gospel, whether <hi>Iew</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> were equally capable of salvation by it. <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 3. 29</note> 
                     <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>is God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">B</note> 
                     <hi>the God of the Iews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Tes, of the Gentiles also:</hi> because both <hi>Iew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> were to be justified upon the same terms, as he proves afterwards. So that Gods justifying of us by the Gospel, is the solemn declaration of himself upon what terms he will pardon the sins of men; that is, deliver them from the penalties they have deserved by them. For the actual discharge of the person is reserved to the great day; all the justification we have here is only declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from God, but so as to give a right to us, by vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are assured, that God will not only not exercise his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <note place="margin">C</note> rigour, but shew all favour and kindness to those who by belief of the Gospel do repent and obey. God doth now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sin as he forbears to punish it; he remits the sinner as he he assures him by the death of Christ he will not punish upon his repentance; but he fully remits both, when he delivers the person upon the tryal of the great day, from all the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he hath deserved by his sins. So that our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat justification and salvation go both upon the same terms, and the same Faith which is sufficient for one, must be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the other also. <note place="margin">D</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>What care then ought men to take, lest by mis-understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the notion of Believing, so much spoken of as the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our salvation, they live in a neglect of that holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which the Gospel requires, and so believe themselves into eternal misery. But as long as men make their obedience ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, though but as the fruit and effect of Faith, it shall not want its reward: for those, <hi>whose hearts are purified by Faith</hi> shall never be condemned for mistaking the notion of it; and they who live as those that are to be judged according to <hi>their works,</hi> shall not miss their reward, though they do not think <note place="margin">E</note> they shall receive it <hi>for them.</hi> But such who make no other condition of the Gospel but Believing, and will scarce allow that to be called a Condition, ought to have a great care to keep their hearts sounder than their heads, for their only secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97974:49"/>
will lye in this, that they are good though they see no <note place="margin">A</note> necessity of being so. And such of all others I grant have reason to acknowledge the irresistable power of Divine Grace, which enables them to obey the will of God against the dictates of their own judgements. But thanks be to God, who hath so abundantly provided for all the infirmities of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the large offers of his Grace, and assistance of his Spirit, that though we meet with so much opposition without, and so much weakness within, and so many discouragements on every side of us; yet if we sincerely apply our selves to do the will of God, we have as great assurance as may be, that <note place="margin">B</note>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the wise and eternal Counsels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven concerning the salvation of Mankind by <note place="margin">D</note> the death of the Son of God, were first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to the World by his own appearance and preaching in it; nothing could be more reasonably expected, than that the dignity of his Person, the authority of his Doctrine, and the excellency of his Life, should have perswaded those whom he appeared among, to such an admiration of his Person, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of his Doctrine, as might have led them to an imitation of him in the holiness of his life and conversation. For if either the worth of the Person, or the Importance of the Message might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail <note place="margin">E</note> any thing towards a kind and honourable reception among men; there was never any person appeared in any degree com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to him, never any Message declared which might challenge so welcome an entertainment from men, as that was
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97974:50"/>
which he came upon. If to give Mankind the highest assurance <note place="margin">A</note> of a state of life and immortality, if to offer the pardon of sin, and reconciliation with God upon the most easie and reasonable terms, if to purge the degenerate World from all its impurities by a Doctrine as holy as the Author of it; were things as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Son of God to reveal, as the Sons of men to receive: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more unaccountable than that his person should be dispised, his Authority slighted, and his Doctrine contemned. And that by those whose interest was more concerned in the consequence of these things, than himself could be in all the affronts and injuries he underwent from men: For the more <note place="margin">B</note> the indignities, the greater the shame, the sharper the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which he did undergo, the higher was the honour and glory which he was advanced to: but the more obliging the instances of his kindness were, the greater the salvation that was tendered by him, the more prevailing the motives were for the entertainment of his Doctrine, the more exemplary and severe will the punishment be of all those who reject it. For it is very agreeable to those eternal Laws of Justice by which God governs the world, that the punishment should arise pro portionably to the greatness of the mercies despised: and <note place="margin">C</note> therefore although the Scripture be very sparing in telling us what the state of those persons shall be in another life who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of the Gospel; yet for those who do, and despise it, it tells us plainly, that an eternal misery is the just desert of those to whom an eternal happiness was offered, and yet neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by them. And we are the rather told of it, that men may not think it a surprize in the life to come; or that if they had known the danger, they would have escaped it; and therefore our Blessed Saviour, who never mentioned punishment but with a design to keep men from it, declares it frequently, that <note place="margin">D</note> the punishment of those persons and places would be most intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, who have received, but not improved the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: and that it would be more <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 11 23.</note> tolerable, for the persons who had offered violence to Nature, and had Hell-fire burning in their hearts by their horrid impurities, than for those who heard the Doctrine, and saw the Miracles of Christ, and were much the worse, rather than any thing the better for it. But lest we should think that all this black scene of misery was only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for those who were the Actors in that doleful Tragedy of our Saviours sufferings: we are told by those who were <note place="margin">E</note> best able to assure us of it, that the same dismal consequences will attend all the affronts of his Doctrine, as if they had been offered to his own person. For it is nothing but the common flattery and self-deceit of humane nature, which makes any
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97974:50"/>
imagine, that though they do not now either believe or obey <note place="margin">A</note> the Gospel; they should have done both, if they had heard our Saviour speak as never man spake, and seen him do what never man did: For the same disposition of mind which makes them now slight that Doctrine <hi>which is delivered to them by them that heard him,</hi> would have made them slight the Person as well as the Doctrine, if they had heard it from himself. And therefore it is but reasonable that the same punishment should belong to both; especially since God hath provided so abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly for the assurance of our Faith, by the miraculous and <hi>powerful demonstration of that divine spirit</hi> which did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany those who were the first publishers of this Doctrine to the <note place="margin">B</note> world. And therefore the Author of this Epistle, after he hath in the words of the Text declared, that it is impossible to escape, if we <hi>neglect the great salvation</hi> offered us by the Gospel; in the following words he gives us that account of it, <hi>that at first it began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them that heard him: God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.</hi> So that the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghost, falling upon the Apostles, and the many signs and wonders which were wrought by them, were the great testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <note place="margin">C</note> of God to the world, that these were the persons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by himself to declare that Doctrine whereon the eternal salvation of Mankind did depend. And since we have so lately acknowledged the truth of this testimony which God gave to the Apostles, by the solemn celebration of that glorious descent of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> upon them on the day of Pentecost, that which naturally follows from it is, the great care we ought to take lest we be found guilty of <hi>neglecting that great salvation</hi> which is offered to us in that Doctrine which was attested in so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a manner <hi>by God himself;</hi> and that from the consideration <note place="margin">D</note> of our own danger; <hi>for how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation?</hi> wherein are three things considerable:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The care God hath taken to make us happy, by offering <hi>so great salvation</hi> to us.</item>

                     <hi>He that despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Moses Law died without mercy under two or three witnesses, of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of Grace?</hi> This is a sad subject, but I am afraid too necessary to be spoken to in <note place="margin">C</note> the Age we live in; wherein men seem to be inapprehensive of the danger of inwardly despising the Religion they prosess to own, and the neglecting of that which they hope to be saved by. It is strange that it should be so, but much more strange that men should think to do so, and not be called to an account for it. It is not only the gross and open sinner that defies Heaven, and by his oaths and blasphemies dares God to shew his Power and Justice upon him, but the slye and self-deceiving hypocrite that hates Religion while he thinks he loves it; that in his heart contemns it, but is afraid to know that he does so, that ought to <note place="margin">D</note> be possessed with a truer sense of Religion, and a greater dread of the issue of the contempt or neglect of it. There is some appearance of ingenuity in an open enmity; but none so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as that which hides it self under the disguise of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. In our Saviours time there were several sorts of those who shewed their disesteem of him, some that were so enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged against him, that they contrive all ways for his disgrace and punishment, others could hear him with patience, <note n="b" place="margin">Mark 4. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>but the cares of this World, the deceitfulness of Riches, and the lust of other things choaked and stifled all good apprehensions of him,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">E</note> that they became weak and ineffectual. And those were guilty <hi>of making light of the marriage-feast</hi> because of other business which they had to mind, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 5. as well as those who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the injuries and affronts to his servants that invited them,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:97974:51"/>
                     <hi>v.</hi> 6. And as it was in the days of our Saviour, so it is now; <note place="margin">A</note> 
                     <hi>some were eating and drinking,</hi> minding nothing but the vain and sensual pleasures of the world; <hi>some were buying and selling,</hi> so busie in this world, that they had no leasure to think of being happy in another, some were deriding and blaspheming; but all these too wise, or too vain, or too profane to mind the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of eternal salvation. I wish we could say it were otherwise now, that a sensual and voluptuous, an easie and a careless life in some, that ambition and the restless pursuit after the honour and riches of the world in others, that a profane wit, and a contempt of all that is serious in those that think themselves <note place="margin">B</note> too great to be Religious, did not enervate the force of Christianity upon their minds, and make them all though up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on different grounds agree in the neglect of their own salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But is the case of such men grown so desperate that nore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy can work upon them? hath the love of sin and the world so far intoxicated them, that no reason or consideration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can awaken them? have they hardned themselves against all the power of divine Truths with a resolution as strong as death, and as cruel as the grave whither they are going? Will neither the love of happiness, nor the fear of misery, their own <note place="margin">C</note> interest, and the wisdom of avoiding so great a danger, the dread of the Majesty and Power of God, and the horror of the great day, prevail at least so far on men to consider, whether these things be true or no; and if they be, what unspeakable solly it is to neglect them? And the better to make that appear, I shall prove these following things:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That God by the Gospel hath taken so great care of mens happiness, that nothing but a gross neglect can make them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable.</item>
                     <item>2. That nothing can be more unreasonable, than when God <note place="margin">D</note> hath taken so much care of it, men should neglect it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</item>
                     <item>3. That it is very just for God to vindicate himself against so gross a neglect, by the severe punishments of the life to come.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. That God by the Gospel hath taken so great care of mens salvation, that nothing but a gross neglect can make them miserable. For, whatever the mind of man can imagine ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in order to its own happiness, in its present fallen and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate condition, is abundantly provided for by the Gospel <note place="margin">E</note> of Christ. For, man was so wholly lost as to his own felicity, that among the ruins and decays of his Nature, he could not pick up so much as the perfect image and Idea of his own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; when he reflects upon himself, he finds himself such a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97974:52"/>
consused mass of folly and weakness, that he can never imagine <note place="margin">A</note> that so noble a design should have its ground-work laid upon so course a Being. And rather than believe the foundation of his happiness to be within himself, there is nothing so vain and trifling without him, but he is ready to fall down before it, and cry out, Here I place my selicity. Sometimes he admires the brave shews, and the Pomp and Gallantry of the World, and thinks nothing comparable to a glorious out-side, and a great train of attendants: sometimes he raises himself, and flutters upon the wings of a popular Air, till a cross blast comes and leaves him in the common rout: sometimes his eyes are dazled <note place="margin">B</note> with the glory of the more refined and solid pieces of that Earth out of which he was framed, and thinks it reasonable, that the softness of flesh and blood, should yield to the impressions of silver and gold; sometimes he even envies the pleasures of the Brutes, and if it were possible would outdo them in their grossest sensualities: sometimes again he slatters himself, and then adores his own imperfections, and thinks his Passions, Honour; and his Profaneness Wit. So far is vain man from making himself happy, that the first step to it, is to make him understand what it is to be so. But supposing that the true <note place="margin">C</note> image of his happiness should drop down from Heaven; and by the place from whence it fell, should conclude where the thing it self is to be found; yet this were only to make him more miserable, unless he withal knew how to come thither. He is sure not to climb up to it by the tops of the highest mountains, nor to be carried thither upon the wings of a mighty wind, he hath no fiery Chariots at his command to ascend with to the Glories above: but only he <hi>that maketh his Angels Spirits, and his Ministers a flame of fire,</hi> is able to preserve the souls of men from vanishing into the soft air, and to conduct them to the <note place="margin">D</note> Mansions of eternal Bliss. It is he only that can make them capable of the Joys of another life, by purging them from the stains and the pollutions of this. And therefore without his grace and favour ever to hope for the happiness of Heaven, must be by fancying a Heaven to be there, where there is no God. So that it is necessary, that the Proposals of this salvation must come from the Author of it, and that with such arguments as may perswade men of the truth of it, and with such motives as may encourage men to accept of them. Now the Gospel of Christ affords us all these things which are necessary to our <note place="margin">E</note> happiness, there we have the most agreeable and setled notion and Idea of it, the most large and free offers of divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in order to it, the greatest assurance that these things did immediately proceed from God, and the most encouraging mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:97974:52"/>
to accept of these offers in order to that great salvation <note place="margin">A</note> which is tendred to us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We have the most agreeable and setled notion of true happiness: not such a mean and uncertain thing which lies at the mercy of the continual vicissitudes and contingencies of this present state, but that which is able to bear up the mind of man against all the troubles of this life, and to carry him to a Region beyond them all, where there is a fulness of joy without an allay of sadness after it, and ever-flowing rivers of pleasures that need no dams to make them rise higher, nor falls to make their motion perceived. Our Blessed Saviour never flatters his <note place="margin">B</note> followers with the expectation of a felicity in this life; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is the most he hath promised them, and that they may enjoy, if they follow his directions, let this world be what it will, and do what it pleases with them. He never tells his Disciples they may have satisfaction here if they lie upon their beds of down with their heads full of tormenting cares, that the pleasure of humane life lies in the gratifications of the senses, and in making what use they can of the world; he never deceives them with the promise of so poor a happiness as that which depends upon health, friends, prosperity, and having <note place="margin">C</note> our own wills. No, but he tells them of a more noble and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous felicity; that will preserve its own state and grandeur in spight of the world; a happiness consistent with loss of Estate, loss of Friends, with affronts and injuries, with persecutions, and death it self. For, when our Saviour begins to discourse of happiness, what another kind of strain doth he speak of it in, than any of those <hi>Philosophers</hi> who have so much obstructed the happiness of mans life by their voluminous writings and contentions about it. Here we meet with no <hi>Epicurean</hi> softness, which the sense of true Vertue carried the minds of the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">D</note> Heathens above; no rigid and incredible <hi>Stoical</hi> Paradoxes, that make men only happy by the change of names; no <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telean</hi> supposition of a prosperous life for Vertue to shew its power in; but here the only supposition made, is that which lies in a mans own breast <hi>viz.</hi> true goodness, and then let his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition be what it will, his happiness is consistent with it. For those above all other persons whom our Saviour calls Blessed, in the beginning of that excellent Abstract of Christianity, his Sermon on the Mount, are, not the rich and great men of the world, but those who to the <hi>poverty</hi> of their condition add that <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 5. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>of their spirits</hi> too, by being contented with the state they are in; not those, who are full of mirth and jollity, that laugh away one half of their time, and sleep the rest; but they who are <note n="b" place="margin">V. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>in a mournful condition,</hi> either by reason of their own sorrows,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:97974:53"/>
or out of compassion to others, or out of a general sense of their <note place="margin">A</note> own imperfections, or the inconstancy of our present state: Not those, who are ready enough to give, but unable to bear affronts, that think the lives of men a sacrifice small enough for any words of disgrace which they have given them; but <note n="a" place="margin">V. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>the meek and patient spirit,</hi> that is neither apt to provoke, nor in a rage and madness when it is; that values the rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity above all the barbarous Punctilioes of Honour. Not those, who are as impetuous in the pursuit of their designs, and as eager of tasting the fruits of them, as the thirsty Traveller in the sands of <hi>Arabia</hi> is of drinking the waters of a pleasant Spring: <note place="margin">B</note> but such who make <note n="b" place="margin">V. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>righteousness</hi> and <hi>goodness</hi> their <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> that which <hi>they hunger and thirst after,</hi> and take as much pleasure in as the most voluptuous <hi>Epicure</hi> in his greatest dainties: Not those, whose malice goes beyond their power, and want only enough of that to make the whole World a Slaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, and account racks and torments among the necessary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of governing the World; <note n="c" place="margin">V. 7.</note> but such, who when their enemies are in their power, will not torment themselves by cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to them, but have such a sense of common humanity, as not only to commend pity and good nature to those above them, but <note place="margin">C</note> to use it to those who are under them. Not those whose hearts are as full of dissimulation and hypocrisie, as the others hands are of blood and violence, that care not what they are, so they may but seem to be good: but such whose inward integrity and <note n="d" place="margin">V. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>purity of heart,</hi> far exceeds the outward shew and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it: who honour Goodness for it self, and not for the Glory which is about the head of it. Not those, who never think the breaches of the world wide enough till there be a door large enough for their own interests to go in at by them; that would rather see the world burning, than one peg be taken out <note place="margin">D</note> of their Chariot-wheels: but such who would sacrifice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, like the brave <note n="e" place="margin">V. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Roman,</hi> to fill up the wide gulf which mens contentions have made in the world; and think no Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy ought to be preserved more inviolable than that of <hi>Peace,</hi> which our Saviour left to his Disciples. Lastly, not those, who will do any thing rather than suffer, or if they <hi>suffer</hi> it shall be for any thing rather than <note n="f" place="margin">V. 10, 11, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>righteousness,</hi> to uphold a party, or maintain a discontented faction; but such, who never complain of the hardness of their way, as long as they are sure it is that of Righteousness; but if they meet with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches <note place="margin">E</note> and persecutions in it, they welcome them, as the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers of their future reward, the expectation of which makes the worst condition not only tolerable but easie to them. Thus we see what kind of happiness it is, which the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:97974:53"/>
Gospel promises; not such a one as rises out of the dust, or is <note place="margin">A</note> tost up and down with the motion of it; but such whose ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-failing fountain is above, and whither those small rivulets return, which fall down upon Earth to refresh the minds of men in their passage thither; but while they continue here, as the <hi>Iews</hi> say of the water that came out of the <hi>rock,</hi> it follows them while they travel through this wilderness below. So that the foundation of a Christians happiness is the expectation of a life to come, which expectation having so firm a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, as the assurance which Christ hath given us by his death and sufferings, it hath power and influence sufficient to bear up <note place="margin">B</note> the minds of men, against all the vicissitudes of this present state.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have the most large and free offers of divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in order to it. Were it as easie for Man to govern his own passions, as to know that he ought to do it; were the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Reason and Religion as powerful with Mankind as those of Folly and Wickedness are, we should never need complain much of the misery of our present state, or have any cause to fear a worse to come. There would then be no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition here but what might be born with satisfaction to ones own mind; and the life of one day led according to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <note place="margin">C</note> of vertue and goodness would be preferred before a sinning Immortality. But we have lost the command of our selves, and therefore our passions govern us; and as long as such furies drive us, no wonder if our easè be little. When men began first to leave the uncertain speculations of Nature, and found themselves so out of order, that they thought the great care ought to be to regulate their own actions; how soon did their passions discover themselves about the way to govern them! And they all agreed in this, that there was great need to do it, and that it was impossible to do it without the principles <note place="margin">D</note> of Vertue; <note n="a" place="margin">V. Lud. Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. ad S. Aug. de <hi>Civit. Dei, l. 19. c.</hi> 1.</note> for never was there any Philosopher so bad, as to think any man could be happy without Vertue; even the <hi>Epicureans</hi> themselves acknowledged it for one of their esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished Maxims, <hi>that no man could live a pleasant life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being good:</hi> and supposing the multiplication of <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi> about these things as far as <hi>Varro</hi> thought it possible to 288. (although there never vere so many, nor really could be upon his own grounds) yet not one of all these but made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be vertuous, in order to being happy, and those who did not think vertue to be desired for it self, yet made it a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <note place="margin">E</note> means for the true pleasure and happiness of our lives. But when they were agreed in this, that it was impossible for a vitious man to enjoy any true contentment of mind: they fell into nice and subtle disputes about the names and order of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:97974:54"/>
things to be chosen, and so lost the great effect of all their <note place="margin">A</note> common principles. They pretended great cures for the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of mens lives, and excellent remedies against the common distempers of humane nature, but still the disease grew under the remedy, and their applications were too weak to allay the fury of their passions. It was neither the order and good of the Universe, nor the necessity of events, nor the things being out of our power, nor the common condition of humanity, no nor that comfort of ill natured men, as <hi>Carneades</hi> call'd it, the many companions we have in misery, that could keep their passions from breaking out when a great occasion was presented <note place="margin">B</note> them. For he who had read all their discourses carefully, and was a great man himself, I mean <hi>Cicero,</hi> upon the death of his beloved daughter, was so far from being comforted by them, that he was fain to write a consolation for himself, in which the greatest cure (it may be) was the diversion he found in writing it. But supposing these things had gone much farther, and that all wise men could have governed their passions as to the troubles of this life (and certainly the truest wisdom lies in that). Yet what had all this been to a preparation for an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal state, which they knew little of, and minded less? All <note place="margin">C</note> their discourses about a happy life here, were vain, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by themselves; when, after all their rants about their <hi>wise man being happy in the bull of Phalaris,</hi> &amp;c. they yet allow'd him to dispatch himself if he saw cause, which a wise man would never do, if he thought himself happy when he did it. So that unless <hi>God</hi> himself had given assurance of a life to come, by the greatest demonstrations of it in the death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of his Son; all the considerations whatever could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have made mankind happy. But by the Gospel he hath taken away all suspicions and doubts concerning another state, <note place="margin">D</note> and hath declared his own readiness to be reconciled to us upon our repentance, to pardon what hath been been done amiss, and to give that divine assistance whereby our wills may be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, and our passions subdued, and upon a submission of our selves to his wise Providence, and a sincere obedience to his Laws, he hath promised eternal salvation in the life to come.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. God hath given us the greatest <hi>assurance</hi> that these offers came from himself; which the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives an account of here, saying, that <hi>this salvation began at first to be spoken by our Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him, God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <hi>also bearing them witness by signs and wonders,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein we have all the satisfaction which the minds of reasonable men could desire as to these things: It might be justly expected, that the messenger of so great news to the World should be no
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:97974:54"/>
mean and ordinary person; neither was he, for the honour <note place="margin">A</note> was as great in the person who brought it, as the importance was in the thing it self: No less than the Eternal Son of God came down from the Bosom of his Father, to rectifie the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of Mankind, and not only to shew them the way to be happy, but by the most powerful arguments to perswade them to be so. Nay, we find all the three persons of the Trinity here engaged in the great work of mans salvation; <hi>it was first spoken by our Lord, God also bearing them witness,</hi> and that <hi>with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost.</hi> So that not only the first revelation was from God, but the testimony to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <note place="margin">B</note> that it was so, was from him too; there being never so clear an attestation of any divine truths as was of the Doctrine of the Gospel. From whence it follows, that the foundation whereon our Faith stands, is nothing short of a <hi>divine testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> which God gave to the truth of that revelation of his will; so vain are the cavils of those who say, we have nothing but meer <hi>probabilities</hi> for our <hi>Faith,</hi> and do interpret that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proof which matters of fact are capable of, in a sense de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to the firmness of our Christian Faith. As though we made the Spirit of God a <hi>Paraclete</hi> or <hi>Advocate</hi> in the worst <note place="margin">C</note> sense, which might as well plead a bad as a good cause. No, we acknowledge, that <hi>God himself did bear witness</hi> to that doctrine <hi>deliver'd by our Lord,</hi> and that in a most signal and effectual manner, for the conviction of the world, by those demonstrations of a divine power which accompanyed the first Preachers of salvation by the Gospel of Christ. So that here the <hi>Apostle</hi> briefly and clearly resolves our Faith; if you ask, <hi>Why we believe that great salvation which the Gospel offers?</hi> the answer is, <hi>Because it was declared by our Lord,</hi> who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could nor would deceive us: If it be asked, <hi>How we know</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <hi>that this was delivered by our Lord?</hi> he answers, because this was the constant Doctrine of all his Disciples, <hi>of those who constantly heard him, and conversed with him.</hi> But if you ask again, <hi>how can we know, that their testimony was infallible, since they were but men,</hi> he then resolves all into that, <hi>that God bare witness to them by signs and wonders, and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost.</hi> And those persons whom these arguments will not convince, none other will. Who are we, that should not think that sufficient which God himself thought so! who are we, that dare que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion <note place="margin">E</note> the certainty of that which hath had the <hi>Broad Seal</hi> of Heaven to attest it! Can any thing make it surer than God himself hath done? and can there be any other way more effectual for that end, than those demonstrations of a divine
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:97974:55"/>
power and presence which the Apostles were acted by? Those <note place="margin">A</note> that cavil at this way of proof, would have done so at any other, if God had made choice of it: and those who will cavil at any thing, are resolved to be convinced by nothing; and such are not fit to be discoursed with.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Here are the most prevailing motives to perswade them to accept of these offers of salvation. There are two passions, which are the great hinges of Government, <hi>viz.</hi> mens Hopes and Fears, and therefore all Laws have had their sanctions suitable to these two in Rewards and Punishments: now there was never any reward which gave greater encouragement to <note place="margin">B</note> hope, never any punishment which made fear more reasonable than those are which the Gospel proposes. Will ever that man be good, whom the hopes of Heaven will not make so? or will ever that man leave his sins whom the fears of Hell will not make to do it? What other arguments can we imagine should ever have that power and influence on mankind, which these may be reasonably supposed to have? Would you have God alter the methods of his Providence, and give his rewards and punishments in this life? but if so, what exercise would there be of the patience, forbearance and goodness of God towards <note place="margin">C</note> wicked men? must he do it as soon as ever men sin? then he would never try whether they would repent and grow better? or must he stay till they have come to such a height of sin? then no persons would have cause to fear him, but such who are arrived at that pitch of wickedness: but how then should he punish them? must it be by continuing their lives, and making them miserable? but let them live, and they will sin yet further: must it be by utterly destroying them? that to persons, who might have time to sin the mean while, (supposing annibilation were all to be fear'd) would never have power enough to deterr <note place="margin">D</note> men from the height of their wickedness. So that nothing but the misery of a life to come, can be of force enough to make men fear God, and regard themselves; and this is that which the Gospel threatens to those that neglect their salvation, which it sometimes calls <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 25. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>everlasting fire,</hi> sometimes <note n="b" place="margin">Mark 9. 44.</note>

                     <hi>kill the soul; but rather fear him which is able to destroy both body and soul in hell.</hi> Thus the Gospel suggests the most proper object of fear, to keep men from sin, and as it doth that, so it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents likewise the most desireable object of hope to encourage
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:97974:55"/>
men to be good; which is no less than a happiness that is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier <note place="margin">A</note> to hope to enjoy than to comprehend; a happiness infinitely above the most ambitious hopes and glories of this world; wherein greatness is added to glory, weight to greatness, and eternity to them all; therefore call'd <note n="a" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</hi> Wherein the Joys shall be full and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, the perception clear and undisturbed, the fruition with continual delight and continual desire. Where there shall be no fears to disquiet, no enemies to allarm, no dangers to conquer, nothing shall then be, but an uninterrupted peace, an unexpressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Joy, and pleasures for evermore. And what could be ever <note place="margin">B</note> imagined more satisfactory to minds tired out with the vanities of this world, than such a repose as that is? What more agreeable to the minds and desires of good men, than to be eased of this clog of flesh, and to spend eternity with the fountain of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and <hi>the spirits of just men made perfect?</hi> What more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing delight to the souls that are purged, and <note n="b" place="margin">Rev. 7. 14</note> 
                     <hi>made glorious by the blood of the Lamb,</hi> than to be <hi>singing Hallelujahs to him that sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever?</hi> How poor and low things are those which men hope for in this world, compared with that great salvation, which the Gospel <note place="margin">C</note> makes so free a tender of? What a mean thing is it to be great in this world, to be honourable and rich, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be made the object of the envy of some, the malice of others, and at last it may be, an instance of this worlds vanity; and after all this to be for ever miserable? But O the wisdom of a well-chosen happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that carries a man with contentment and peace through this life, and at last rewards him with a Crown of everlasting felicity. Thus we see the Gospel proposes the most excellent means to make men happy, if they be not guilty of a gross neglect of it; and if they be, that is their own act, and they must thank none but themselves if they be miserable. <note place="margin">D</note>

                  <p n="2">2. But I pray, what reason can be given, since God is so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our happiness, that we should neglect it our selves? which is the next thing to be spoken to. There are three sorts of things we think we have reason to neglect: Such as are too <hi>mean,</hi> and unworthy our care, such as are so <hi>uncertain,</hi> that they will not recompence it, such as our own <hi>Interest</hi> is not at all concerned in; but I hope there are none who have an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal soul, and the use of their understandings, can ever reckon their salvation under one of these. <note place="margin">E</note>

                  <p n="1">1. Is it too <hi>mean</hi> an employment for you to mind the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of your eternal welfare? Is Religion a beggarly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible thing, that it doth not become the greatness of your minds to stoop to take any notice of it? Hath God lost his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:97974:56"/>
honour so much with you, that his service should be the object <note place="margin">A</note> of mens scorn and contempt? But what is it which these brave spirits think a fit employment for themselves, while they despise God and his Worship? Is it to be curiously dressed, and make a fine shew, to think the time better spent at the Glass than at their Devotions? These indeed are weighty imployments, and fit in the first place to be minded, if we were made only to be gazed upon. Is it meerly to see Plays, and read Romances, and to be great admirers of that vain and frothy discourse which all persons account wit but those which have it? This is such an end of mans life which no <hi>Philosopher</hi> ever thought of. <note place="margin">B</note> Or is it to spend time in excesses and debaucheries, and to be slaves to as many lusts as will command them? This were something indeed, if we had any other name given us but that of <hi>Men.</hi> Or lastly, is it to have their minds taken up with the great affairs of the World, to be wise in considering, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in managing the publick interest of a Nation? This is an employment, I grant, fit for the greatest minds, but not such which need at all to take them off from minding their eternal salvation. For the greatest wisdom is consistent with that, else Religion would be accounted folly, and I take it for <note place="margin">C</note> granted; that it is never the truly wise man but the pretender that entertains any mean thoughts of Religion. And such a one uses the publick Interest no better than he doth Religion, only for a shew to the world, that he may carry on his own designs the better. And is this really such a valuable thing for a man to be contented to cheat himself of his eternal happiness, that he may be able to cheat the world, and abuse his trust? I appeal then to the Consciences of all such who have any sense of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and the common interest of mankind, setting aside the considerations of a life to come, whether to be just and sober, <note place="margin">D</note> vertuous and good, be not more suitable to the design of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, than all the vanities and excesses, all the little arts and designs which men are apt to please themselves with? And if so, shall the eternal happiness which follows upon being good, make it less desireable to be so? No surely, but if God had required any thing to make us happy, which had been as contrary to our present Interest as the Precepts of Christianity are agreeable to it; yet the end would have made the severest commands easie, and those things pleasant which tend to make us happy. <note place="margin">E</note>

And yet the great uncertainty of all the honours and riches of this world, never hinder the covetous or ambitious person from their great earnestness in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of them.

                  <p>I shall only propound some few Considerations, to prevent so great a neglect as that of your salvation is.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Consider, what it is you neglect, the <hi>offer</hi> of Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, <note place="margin">E</note> the greatest kindness that ever was expressed to the World, the foundation of your present peace, the end of your beings, the stay of your minds, the great desire of your Souls, the utmost felicity that humane Nature is capable of. Is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:97974:57"/>
to neglect the favour of a Prince, the kindness of Great <note place="margin">A</note> Men, the offers of a large and plentiful Estate; but these are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the neglect of the favour of God, the love of his Son, and that salvation which he hath purchased for you. Nay, it is not a bare neglect, but it implies in it a mighty contempt not only of the things offered, but of the kindness of him who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them. If men had any due regard for God or themselves, if they had any esteem for his love, or their own welfare, they would be much more serious in Religion than they are. When I see a person wholly immersed in affairs of the World, or spending his time in luxury and vanity, can I possibly think that <note place="margin">B</note> man hath any esteem of God or of his own Soul? When I find one very serious in the pursuit of his Designs in the World, thoughtful and busie, subtle in contriving them, careful in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging them; but very formal, remiss and negligent in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of Religion, neither inquisitive about them, nor serious in minding them; what can we otherwise think, but that such a one doth really think the things of the World better worth looking after, than those which concern his eternal salvation. But consider, before it be too late, and repent of so great folly. Value an immortal Soul as you ought to do, think what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation <note place="margin">C</note> with God, and the Pardon of sin is worth, slight not the dear Purchase which was bought at no meaner a rate than the Blood of the Son of God, and then you cannot but mind the great salvation which God hath tendered you.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider, on what terms you neglect it, or what the things are for whose sake you are so great enemies to your own salvation. Have you ever found that contentment in sin or the vanities of the World, that for the sake of them, you are willing to be forever miserable? What will you think of all your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, and your neglects of God and your selves, when <note place="margin">D</note> you come to die? what would you give then (if it were in your power to redeem your lost time) that you had spent your time less to the satisfaction of your sensual desires, and more in seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to please God? How uncomfortable will the remembrance be of all your excesses, oaths, injustice and profaneness, when death approaches, and judgement follows it? What peace of mind will there then be to those who have served God with faithfulness, and have endeavoured to <hi>work out their salvation,</hi> though it hath been <hi>with fear and trembling?</hi> But <hi>what would it</hi> then <hi>profit a man to have gained the whole World, and to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <hi>lose his own soul?</hi> Nay, what unspeakable losers must they then be, that lose their Souls for that which hath no value at all, if compared with the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Consider, what follows upon this neglect, not only the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:97974:58"/>
loss of great salvation; but the incurring as great damnation for <note place="margin">A</note> it. The Scripture describes the miseries of the life to come, not meerly by negatives, but by the most sensible and painful things. If destruction be dreadful, what is <hi>everlasting destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</hi> if the anguish of the soul, and the pains of the body be so troublesom, what will <hi>the destruction be both of Body and Soul in Hell?</hi> If a Serpent gnawing in our bowels be a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of an insupportable misery here, what will that be of <hi>the Worm that never dies?</hi> if a raging and devouring fire, which can last but till it hath consumed a fading substance, be in its appearance so amazing, and in its pain so violent, what then <note place="margin">B</note> will the enduring be of that wrath of God, which shall burn like fire, and yet be everlasting? Consider then of these things, while God gives you time to consider of them; and think it an inestimable mercy that you have yet time to repent of your sins, to beg mercy at the hands of God, to redeem your time, to depart from iniquity, to be frequent in Prayer, careful of your Actions, and in all things obedient to the will of God, and so God will pardon your former neglects, and grant you this great salvation. <note place="margin">C</note>

If it were once to be hoped, that all Mankind would be wise and sober, that their judgements would be according to the truth of things, and their actions suitable to their judgements; we might then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably <note place="margin">E</note> expect that nothing would be valued so much as true goodness, nothing so much in contempt and disgrace as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and profaneness. But if we find it much otherwise in the Age we live in; we have so much the less cause to wonder at it;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97974:59"/>
because it hath been thus, in those times we might have thought <note place="margin">A</note> would have been far better than our own. I mean those times and ages, wherein there were not only great things first spoken and delivered to Mankind, but examples as great as the things themselves; but these did so little prevail on the stupid and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful world, that they among whom the <hi>Son of God</hi> did first manifest himself, seem'd only solicitous to make good one Prophesic concerning him, <hi>viz. That he should be despised and rejected of men.</hi> And they who suffer'd their malice to live as long as he did, were not contented to let it dye with him; but their fury increases as the Gospel does: and wherever it had <note place="margin">B</note> spread it self, they pursue it with all the rude clamors, and violent persecutions which themselves or their factors could raise against it. This we have a large testimony of, in those <hi>Iewish</hi> Christians to whom this Epistle was written; who had no sooner embraced the Christian Religion, but they were set upon by a whole army of persecutions. <hi>Heb. 10. 32. But call to remembrance the former days, in which after ye were illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions.</hi> As though the great enemy of souls, and therefore of Christians, had watched the first opportunity to make the strongest impression upon <note place="margin">C</note> them, while they were yet young and unexperienced; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore less able to resist so sharp an encounter. He had found how unsuccessful the offer of the good things of this World had been with their Lord and Master; and therefore was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to try what a severer course would do with all his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. But the same spirit by which he despised <hi>all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the World,</hi> which the Tempter would have made him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was the disposer of; enabled them with a mighty cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and strange transports of joy, not only to bear their own share of reproaches and afflictions, but a part of theirs who <note place="margin">D</note> suffer'd with them, <hi>v.</hi> 33, 34. But lest through continual duty, occasion'd by the hatred of their persecutors, and the multitude of their afflictions; their courage should abate, and their spirits saint; the Apostle finds it necessary, not only to put them in mind of their former magnanimity; but to make use of all arguments that might be powerful with them, to keep up the same vigour and constancy of mind in bearing their sufferings, which they had at first. For he well knew, how much it would tend to the dishonour of the Gospel, as well as to their own discomfort; if after such an early proof of a <note place="margin">E</note> great and undaunted spirit, it should be said of them, as was once of a great <hi>Roman</hi> Captain, <hi>Ultima Primis cedebant;</hi> that they should decline in their reputation as they did in their years; and at last sink under that weight of duty which they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97974:59"/>
had born with so much honour before. Therefore, as a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netal <note place="margin">A</note> in the Field, after a sharp and fierce encounter at first, with a mighty resolution by his Souldiers; when he finds by the number and fresh recruits of the enemy, that his smaller forces are like to be born down before them; and through meer weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of fighting are ready to turn their backs, or yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to the enemies mercy; lie conjures them by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they have gain'd, and the courage they had already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, by their own interest, and the example of their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by the hopes of glory, and the fears of punishment, that they would bear the last shock of their enemies force, and rather <note place="margin">B</note> be the Trophies of their Courage than of their Triumphs: so does our Apostle, when he finds some among them begin to debate, whether they had best to stand it out or no; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures them, 1. By the remembrance of their own former courage, whereby they did bear as sharp tryals as these could be, with the greatest chearfulness and constancy; and what could they gain by yielding at last, but great dishonour to themselves, that they had suffer'd so long to no purpose, unless it were to discover their own weakness and inconstancy. 2. By the hopes of a reward which would surely follow their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness; <note place="margin">C</note> 
                     <hi>v. 35, 36. Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward. For ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the promise:</hi> and the <hi>time will not be long</hi> ere ye come to enjoy it, <hi>v.</hi> 37. but <hi>if ye draw back,</hi> you lose all your former la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for he who alone is able to recompence you, hath said, <hi>that if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him,</hi> v. 38. and then from the example of himself, and all the genuine followers of Christ, <hi>but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul,</hi> v. 39. <note place="margin">D</note> But lest these examples should not be enough to perswade them; he conjures them by the name of all those who were as eminent for the greatness of their minds as the strength of their Faith; who have despised the frowns as well as the smiles of the world; and were not discouraged by the severest tryals from placing their confidence in God, and their hopes in a life to come; and all this done <hi>by persons who had not received the Promise:</hi> Heb. 11. 39. and could there be a greater disparagement to the clearness of that light we enjoy above them, if we only grew fainter by it? And therefore in the beginning of this Chapter <note place="margin">E</note> he encourages them by that army of Martyrs which had gone before them, <hi>by that Cloud of witnesses</hi> which did both direct and refresh them, that they would <hi>lay aside every thing which was apt to oppress or dishearten them, but especially their sinful

All the injuries, reproaches, false accusations, all the cruelties, indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and violence, which were offer'd him, from the time of his publick appearance to his expiring upon the Cross, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone by him, by the malice of unreasonable men, may be call'd <hi>the contradiction of sinners.</hi> For the sense of this word <note place="margin">C</note> extends as well to actions as words; and the sum of all that which our Saviour suffer'd from them, may be reduced under these heads. 1.

                  <p n="1">1. The ill entertainment of his Doctrine; which must needs seem very strange to those who do not consider what a difficult access the clearest reason hath to the minds of such who are governed by interest and prejudice.

What <note place="margin">E</note> could have been imagined more probable, than that the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, which had waited long in expectation of the <hi>Messias</hi> coming, should have welcom'd his approach with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est joy, and receiv'd the Message he brought with a kindness
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:97974:61"/>
only short of that which he shewed in coming among them? <note place="margin">A</note> Was it nothing to be eased of that heavy burden of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, which neither they nor their Fathers were able to bear? and that God was willing to exchange the chargeable and troublesome service of the Temple, for the more reasonable and spiritual Worship of himself? Was it nothing to have the Promises of a Land which now groaned under the weight of its oppressions, turned into those of an eternal state of bliss and immortality? and to change the Lamps of the Temple, for the glorious appearance of the Sun of Righteousness? Was it nothing to have an offer of Peace and Reconciliation with <note place="margin">B</note> God made them, after they had suffer'd so much under the sury of his displeasure? Was a meer temporal deliverance by some mighty Conquerour from the subjection they were in to the <hi>Roman</hi> Power, so much more valuable a thing, than an eternal redemption from the powers of Hell and the Grave? Are the pomps and vanities of this present life, such great things in Gods account, that it was not possible for his Son to appear without them? Nay, how unsuitable had it been for one who came to preach humility, patience, self-denyal, and contempt of the world, to have made an ostentation of the <note place="margin">C</note> State and Grandeur of it? So that either he must have changed his Doctrine, or rendred himself lyable to the suspicion of seeking to get this world by the preaching of another. And if his Doctrine had been of another kind, he might have been esteemed a great person among the <hi>Iews,</hi> but not the Son of God, or the promised <hi>Messias, in whom all Nations of the Earth should be blessed.</hi> Which surely they would never have thought themselves to have been, in one, who must have subdued the neighbour Nations to advance the honour of his own. But since the Son of God thought fit to appear in another manner <note place="margin">D</note> than they expected him, they thought themselves too great to be saved by so mean a Saviour. If he had made all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the Earth to have bowed under him, and the Nations about them to have been all tributaries to them; if <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had been made the Seat of an Empire as great as the World it self, they would then have gloried in his Name, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained whatever he had said, whether true or false, with a wonderful Veneration. But Truth in an humble dress meets with few admirers; they could not imagine so much Power and Majesty could ever shroud it self under so plain a disguise. <note place="margin">E</note> Thus Christ <note n="a" place="margin">1 John 11.</note> 
                     <hi>came to his own, and his own received him not.</hi> Yea, those that should have known him the best of all others; those who frequently conversed with him, and heard him <hi>speak as never man spake,</hi> and saw him do what never man
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:97974:61"/>
did, were yet so blinded by the meanness of his Parentage and <note place="margin">A</note> Education, that they baffle their own Reason, and persist in their Infidelity, because they knew the place and manner of his breeding; the names of his Mother and his Brethren and Sisters; <note n="a" place="margin">Matt. 13. 55, 56.</note> 
                     <hi>are they not all with us? whence then hath this man all these things?</hi> As though, <hi>Is not this the Carpenters Son,</hi> had been sufficient answer to all he could say or do.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The disparagement of his Miracles. Since the bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of his Doctrine, though never so reasonable, could not prevail with them to believe him to be the Son of God, he offers them a further proof of it by the mighty works which were <note place="margin">B</note> wrought by him. And though the more ingenuous among them were ready to acknowledge, <note n="b" place="margin">John 3. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>that no man could do the things which he did, unless God were with him:</hi> yet they who were resolved to hear and see, and not understand; when they found it not for their credit, to deny matters of fact so univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally known and attested, they seek all the means to blast the reputation of them that may be. Sometimes raising popular insinuations against him, that he was a man of no austere life, a friend of Publicans and sinners, one that could choose no other day to do his works on, but that very day wherein God himself <note place="margin">C</note> did rest from his; and therefore no great regard was to be had to what such a one did. When these arts would not take, but the people found the benefit of his Miracles, in healing the sick, curing the blind and the lame, feeding the hungry; then they undervalue all these in comparison with the wonders that were wrought by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Wilderness. If he would have made the Earth to open her mouth, and swallow up the City and the power of <hi>Rome;</hi> if he would have fed a mighty Army with bread from Heaven, in stead of feeding some few thousands with very small Provisions; if in stead of raising one <hi>Lazarus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> from the Grave, he would have raised up their <hi>Sampsons,</hi> and their <hi>Davids,</hi> their men of spirit and conduct, whose very presence would have put a new life, into the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; if in stead of casting out <hi>Devils,</hi> he would have cast out the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom they hated the worse of the two: if he would have set himself to the cure of a distempered State, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of healing the maladies of some few inconsiderable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: if instead of being at the expense of a Miracle to pay tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, he would have hinder'd them from paying any at all; then a <hi>Second Moses</hi> would have been too mean a title for him, <note place="margin">E</note> he could have been no less than the promised <hi>Messias,</hi> the <hi>Son of God.</hi> But while he imploy'd his power another way, the demonstration of it made them hate him the more; since they thought with themselves what strange things they would have
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97974:62"/>
done with it for the benefit of their Country; and therefore <note place="margin">A</note> express the greatest malice against him, because he would not imploy it as they would have him. From thence, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn his Miracles as only some effects of a Magical skill; and say, he dispossessed the lesser <hi>Devils</hi> by the power of him that was the <hi>Prince</hi> among them. So unworthy a requital did they make for all the mighty works which had been done among them; <hi>Which,</hi> as our Saviour saith, <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 11. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>if they had been done in</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>they would have repented long ago in sack cloth and ashes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. But although all this argued a strange spirit of <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">B</note> in them to all the designs for their own good; yet the malice from whence that rose, would not stop here; for as they had long contrived his ruine, so they watched only an opportunity to effect it. Which his frequent presence at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> seemed to put into their hands, but his reputation with the people made them fearful of embracing it. Therefore they imploy their Agents to deal privately with one of his Disciples who might be fittest for their design; and to work upon his covetous humour by the promise of a reward, to bring him to betray his Master with the greatest privacy into their hands. <note place="margin">C</note> This <hi>Iudas</hi> undertakes, knowing the place and season of his Masters retirements, not far from the City, where they might with the greatest secrecy and safety seize upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Which contrivance of theirs our Saviour was not at all ignorant of; but prepares himself and his Disciples for this great encounter. He institutes his solemn Supper, to be perpetually observed in remembrance of his death and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, after which he discourses admirably with his Disciples, to arm them against their future sufferings; and prays that most divine Prayer, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. which he had no sooner finished, <note place="margin">D</note> but he goes with his Disciples to the usual place of his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a <hi>Garden</hi> at the foot of the <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>Olives.</hi> And now begins the blackest Scene of sufferings that ever was acted upon humane Nature. Which was so great, that the Son of God himself expresseth a more than usual apprehension of it; which he discovered by the <hi>Agony</hi> he was in, in which he sweat <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 22 44</note> 
                     <hi>drops of blood;</hi> by the earnestness of his Prayer, falling upon his knees, and praying thrice, saying, <note n="c" place="margin">Mat 26. 39</note> 
                     <hi>O my Father, if it be possible, let this Cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Surely, this Cup must needs <note place="margin">E</note> have a great deal of bitterness in it, which the Son of God was so earnest to be freed from. If there had been nothing in it but what is commonly incident to humane Nature, as to the apprehensions of death or pain, it seems strange, that he
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:97974:62"/>
who had the greatest innocency, the most perfect charity, the <note place="margin">A</note> freest resignation of himself, the fullest assurance of the reward to come, should express a greater sense of the horror of his sufferings, than thousands did, who suffer'd for his sake. But now was <hi>the hour come</hi> wherein the Son of God was to be made a Sacrifice for the sins of men; wherein he was <hi>to bear our griefs, and carry our sorrows,</hi> when he was <note n="a" place="margin">Isa 53 4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>to be wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our iniquities;</hi> now <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 26. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>his soul was exceeding sorrowful even unto death;</hi> for now <note n="c" place="margin">Luk. 22. 53.</note> 
                     <hi>the hour of his enemies was come, and the power of darkness.</hi> And accordingly they improve it; they <note place="margin">B</note> come out against him as a Malefactor, with swords and staves, and having seized his Person, being betray'd into their hands by one of his Disciples, they carry him to the High Priests house, where his professed enemies presently condemn him of <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 26. 66, 67.</note> Blasphemy, and not content with this, they express the greatest contempt of him, for they spit in his face, they buffet him, and smite him with the Palms of their hands, they mock him, and bid him prophesie who it was that smote him; so inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent was their malice grown, and so spightful was their indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against him. And so fearful were they, lest he should <note place="margin">C</note> escape their hands, that the very next morning early, they send him bound to the <hi>Roman</hi> Governour, to have the sentence pronounced against him, to whom they accuse him of Sedition and Treason; but <hi>Pilate</hi> upon examination of him declares, <note n="e" place="margin">Luk 23. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>he found no fault in him;</hi> which made them heap more unreasonable calumnies upon him, being resolved by what means soever to take away his life. Nay, the price of the blood of the Son of God was fallen so low with them, that they preferred the life of a known seditious person, and a Murtherer before him. And when <hi>Pilate</hi> being unsatisfied, asked still, <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Mat 27. 23</note> 
                     <hi>what evil he had done?</hi> they continue their importunity without any other answer but <hi>Crucifie him</hi> and making up what wanted in Justice and Reason in the loudness of their clamors. And at last seeing the sury and madness of the people, with the protestation of his own innocency as to his blood, he delivers him up to the people; and now he is stripped, and scourged, and mock'd, with <hi>a Crown of Thorns, a Scarlet Robe,</hi> and a <hi>Reed in his hand:</hi> all the indignities they could think of, they put upon him. But though it pleased them, to have him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to all the ignominies imaginable, yet nothing would sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie <note place="margin">E</note> them but <hi>his blood;</hi> and therefore he is led forth to be crucified, and though so lately scourged and weakened by his sorrows, yet he is made to carry his own Cross (at least through the City) for no other death could satisfie them, but the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:97974:63"/>
most ignominious, and painful. And when he was brought <note place="margin">A</note> to the place of Crucifixion, they nail his hands and feet to the Cross, and while he was hanging there, they deride and mock him still, they devide his garments before his face, give him Gall and Vinegar to drink, and the last act of violence committed upon him, was the piercing of his side, so that out of his <hi>Pericardium</hi> issued <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 19. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>both water and blood.</hi> Thus did the Son of God suffer at the hands of unreasonable men; thus was the blood of that immaculate Lamb split by the hands of violence; and he who left the bosom of his Father, to bring us to glory, was here treated as if he had been unworthy to live <note place="margin">B</note> upon the Earth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But that which yet heightens these sufferings of Christ, is to consider, <hi>from whom</hi> he suffer'd these things, it was <hi>from sinners;</hi> which is as much as to say, from <hi>men,</hi> if the word were taken in the largest sense of it; for all have sinned; but being taken by us in opposition to othermen, so it implies a greater height of wickedness in these than in other persons. But this is not here to be consider'd absolutely, as denoting what kind of persons he suffer'd from, but with a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the nature of their proceedings with him, and the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations <note place="margin">C</note> that lay upon them to the contrary. So that the first shews the injustice and unreasonableness of them; the second, their great ingratitude, considering the kindness and good will which he expressed towards them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Injustice and unreasonableness of their proceedings against him. It is true indeed, (what <hi>Socrates</hi> said to his wife, when she complained that he suffer'd unjustly, <hi>What,</hi> saith he, <hi>and would you have me suffer justly?)</hi> it is much greater comfort to the person who does suffer, when he does it unjustly but it is a far greater reflection on those who were the causes of <note place="margin">D</note> it. And that our <hi>Blessed Saviour</hi> did suffer with the greatest injustice from these men, is apparent from the falseness and weakness of all the accusations which were brought against him. To accuse the <hi>Son of God</hi> for Blaphemy, in saying, he was so, is as unjust as to condemn a <hi>King</hi> for treason, because he saith he is a <hi>King:</hi> they ought to have examined the grounds on which he call'd himself so; and if he had not given pregnant evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of it, then to have passed sentence upon him as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postor and Blasphemer. If the thing were true, that he was what he said, <hi>the Son of God,</hi> what horrible guilt was it in <note place="margin">E</note> them, to imbrue their hands in his blood? and they found he always attested it, and now was willing to lay down his life to confirm the truth of what he said. This surely ought at least to have made them more inquisitive into what he had affirmed;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:97974:63"/>
but they allow him not the liberty of a fair tryal, they hasten <note place="margin">A</note> and precipitate the sentence, that they might do so the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If he were condemned as a false Prophet; (for that seems to be the occasion of the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> meeting to do it, to whom the cognisance of that did particularly belong) why do they not mention what it was he had foretold, which had not come to pass; or what reason do they give why he had usurped such an Office to himself? If no liberty were allowed under pain of death for any to say, that they were sent from God, how was it possible for the <hi>Messias</hi> ever to appear, and not be condemned? for the expectation of him was, that he <note place="margin">B</note> should be a great person immediately sent from God, for the delivery of his people. And should he be sent from God, and not say that he was so? for how then could men know that he was? So that their way of proceeding with him, discovers it self to be manifestly unjust, and contrary to their own avowed expectations. Neither were they more successful in the accusation of him before <hi>Pilate;</hi> why did not the witnesses appear to make good the charge of sedition and treason against him? where were the proofs of any thing tending that way? Nay, that which abundantly testified the innocency of our <note place="margin">C</note> 
                     <hi>Saviour,</hi> as to all the matters he was accused of, was that the <hi>Roman Governour,</hi> after a full examination of the cause, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares him innocent, and that not only once but several times; and was fully satisfied in the Vindication he made of himself, so that nothing but the fear of what the <hi>Iews</hi> threatned, <hi>viz.</hi> accusing him to <hi>Caesar</hi> (a thing he had cause enough otherwise to be afraid of) which made him at last yield to their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. But there was one circumstance more which did highly discover the innocency of Christ, and the injustice of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which was <hi>Iuda</hi>'s confession and end; the man who <note place="margin">D</note> had betray'd his Lord, and had receiv'd the wages of his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; but was so unquiet with it, that in the time when his other Disciples durst not own him, he with a great <hi>impetus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to them with his Money, throws it among them with that sad farewel to them all, <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 27. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood.</hi> What could have been said more for his Vindication at this time than this was, by such a person as <hi>Iudas,</hi> one who had known our Saviour long, and had been the fittest instrument, if any guilt could have been fasten'd upon him, to have managed the accusation against him; but <note place="margin">E</note> the anxiety of his mind was too great for what he had done already, to live to do them any longer service; for either his grief suffocated him, or his guilt made him hang himself; for the words will signifie either. Neither can it be said by any
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97974:64"/>
modern <hi>Iews,</hi> that all the testimony we have of these things <note place="margin">A</note> is from his own Disciples; but that certainly they had some greater matter to accuse him of; which we now have lost. For how is it possible to conceive, that a matter so important as that was, should be lost by those of their own Nation, who were so highly concerned to vindicate themselves in all places, as soon as the <hi>Gospel</hi> was spread abroad in the World? For the guilt of this blood was every where by the <hi>Christians</hi> charged upon them; and their prodigious sufferings afterwards were imputed wholly by them to the shedding of that <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> which by a most solemn imprecation they had said, <hi>should</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. This <hi>contradiction</hi> of theirs to Christ was an act of high <note place="margin">D</note> Ingratitude. It was a sharp but very just rebuke which the <hi>Iews</hi> received from <hi>our Saviour,</hi> when they were once ready to stone him; <note n="d" place="margin">Joh. 10. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>Many good works have I shewed you from my Father, for which of those works do you stone me?</hi> The very same might have been applyed to his Judges and accusers; when they were about to crucifie him. For what was his whole Life after he appeared publickly, but a constant design of doing good? His presence had far more vertue for the curing all bodily distempers, than the <hi>Pool</hi> of <hi>Bethesda</hi> among the <hi>Iews,</hi> or the <hi>Temples</hi> of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> What won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <note place="margin">E</note> were made of very small things done by other persons, as the cure of a blind Man by <hi>Vespasian!</hi> when such multitudes of far more certain and considerable cures, can hardly keep up the reputation of any thing extraordinary in him. But though his
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:97974:64"/>
kindness was great to the bodies of men, where they were fit <note place="margin">A</note> objects of pity and compassion; yet it was far greater to their souls, that being more agreeable to the design of his coming into the World; for the other tended to raise such an esteem of him as might make him the more successful in the cure of their Souls. And to shew, that this was his great business, wherever he comes, he discourses about these things, takes every opportunity that might be improved for that end, refuses no company he might do good upon, and converses not with them with the pride and arrogance of either the <hi>Pharisees</hi> or <hi>Philosophers,</hi> but with the greatest meekness, humility and <note place="margin">B</note> patience. How admirable are his more solemn discourses, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that upon the Mount, and that wherein he takes leave of his Disciples! How dry and insipid are the most sublime dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of the <hi>Philosophers</hi> compared with these! how clearly doth he state our Duties, and what mighty encouragements does he give to practise them! how forcibly does he perswade men to self-denyal and contempt of the world! how excellent and holy are all his Precepts! how serviceable to the best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of men in this life and that to come! how suitable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable to the souls of good men are the rewards he promises! <note place="margin">C</note> what exact rule of Righteousness hath he prescribed to men, <hi>in doing as they would be done by!</hi> with what vehemency doth he rebuke all hypocrisie and <hi>Pharisaism!</hi> with what tenderness and kindness does he treat those that have any real inclinations to true goodness! with what earnestness does he invite, and with what love doth he embrace all repenting sinners! with what care doth he instruct, with what mildness doth he reprove, with what patience doth he bear with his own disciples! Lastly, with what authority did he both speak and live, such as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a reverence, where it did not beget a love! And yet <note place="margin">D</note> after a life thus spent, all the requital he met with, was to be reproached, despised, and at last crucified. O the dreadful effects of malice and hypocrisie! for these were the two great enemies which he always proclaimed open war with; and these at first contrived, and at last effected his cruel death. What baseness, ingratitude, cruelty, injustice, (and what not?) will those two sins betray men to, when they have once taken posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the hearts of men! for we can find nothing else at the bottom of all that wretched conspiracy against our Saviour; but that his doctrine and design was too pure and holy for them; <note place="margin">E</note> and therefore they study to take him away who was the author of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We consider, <hi>in what way and manner,</hi> our Saviour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent all these sufferings; and this as much as any thing is

                     <hi>that Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, that we should follow his steps; who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth; who when he was reviled, reviled not again: when he suffered, he threatned not, but committed himself to him that judged righteously.</hi> He uses none of those ranting expressions which none of the patientest persons in the world were accustomed to; of bidding them <hi>laugh in Phalaris his Bull;</hi> and when they were <note place="margin">B</note> racked with pains, to cry out, <hi>Nil agis dolor:</hi> he tells them not, that it is their duty to have no sense of torments, and to be jocund and pleasant when their flesh is torn from them, or nailed to a Cross; if this be any kind of fortitude, it is rather that of a <hi>Gladiator</hi> than of a wise man or a Christian. The worst of men either through a natural temper of body, or having hardned themselves by custom, have born the greatest torments with the least expression of grief under them.

For, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that <hi>Agony</hi> he was in immediately before his being betray'd, when he sees the Officers coming towards him, he asks them <hi>whom they seek for?</hi> and tells them, <hi>I am he;</hi> which <note place="margin">C</note> words so astonished them, <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 18. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>that they went back, and fell upon the ground:</hi> thereby letting them understand how easie a matter it was for him to have escaped their hands; and that it was his own free consent, that he went to suffer, for he knew certainly before hand, the utmost that he was to undergo, and therefore it was no unreasonable <hi>impetus,</hi> but a settled resolution of his mind to endure all <hi>the contradictions of sinners.</hi> When he was spit upon, mocked, reproached and scourged, none of all these could draw one impatient expression from him. The malice and rage of his enemies did not at all provoke him; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <note place="margin">D</note> it were to pity and pray for them. And that he did, with great earnestness in the midst of all his pains: and though he would not plead for himself to them, yet he pleads for them to God; <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi> How much more divine was this, than the admired <hi>Theramenes</hi> among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who being condemned to dye by the thirty <hi>Tyrants,</hi> when he was drinking off his cup of Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, said, <hi>he drank that to Critias,</hi> one of his most bitter enemies, and hoped he would pledge it shortly. <hi>Socrates</hi> seemed not to express seriousness enough at least, when he bid one of <note place="margin">E</note> his friends, when he was dying, offer up a Cock to <hi>Aescula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi> for his deliverance. <hi>Aristides</hi> and <hi>Phocion</hi> among the <hi>Greeks</hi> came the nearest to our Saviours temper, when one pray'd, <hi>that his Country might have no cause to remember him
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:97974:66"/>
when he was gone,</hi> and the other charged his Son, <hi>to forget</hi>

                     <hi>the injuries they had done him;</hi> but yet by how much the greater the person and office was of our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> than of either of them, by how much the cruelty and ignominy, as well as pain was greater which they exposed him to, by how much greater concernment there is to have such an offence pardon'd by one that can punish it with eternal misery, than not revenged by those, who though they may have will, have not always power to execute; so much greater was the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our <hi>Saviour</hi> to his enemies, in his Prayer upon the Cross, than of either of the other, in their concernment for <note place="margin">B</note> that ungrateful City, that had so ill requited their services to it. Thus when the Son of God was oppressed, and afflicted, <note n="a" place="margin">Isa. 53. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>he opened not his mouth,</hi> but only in Prayer for them, who were his bitter enemies; and though nothing had been more easie than for him to have cleared himself from all their accusations, who had so often baffled them before; yet he would not now give them that suspicion of his innocency, as to make any <hi>Apology</hi> for himself; but <hi>committed himself to God that judges righteously, and was brought as a Lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers was dumb, so he</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">C</note> 
                     <hi>opened not his mouth.</hi> And the reason thereof was, he knew what further design for the good of mankind was carrying on by the bitterness of his passion, and that all the cruel usage he underwent, was that he might be <hi>a sacrifice of atonement</hi> so the sins of the World. Which leads to the last thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to our consideration.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Which is, <hi>the causes</hi> why God was pleased to suffer his Son <hi>to endure such contradiction of sinners against himself.</hi> I know it is an easie answer to say, that God had determin'd it should be so, and that we ought to enquire no further: but <note place="margin">D</note> sure such an answer can satisfie none who consider, how much our salvation depends upon the knowledge of it, and how clear and express the Scripture is in assigning the causes of the sufferings of Christ. Which though as far as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments were concerned in it, we have given an account of already, yet considering the particular management of this grand affair by the care of divine Providence, a higher account must be given of it, why so divine and excellent a person should be exposed to all the contempt and reproach imaginable, and after being made a sacrifice to the tongues and rods of the <note place="margin">E</note> people, then to dye a painful and ignominious death? So that allowing but that common care of divine Providence, which all sober <hi>Heathens</hi> acknowledged, so transcendent sufferings as these were, of so holy and innocent a person,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:97974:66"/>
ought to be accounted for, in a more than ordinary manner; <note place="margin">A</note> when they thought themselves concerned to vindicate the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of Gods providence in the common calamities of those who are reputed to be better than the generality of Mankind. But the reasons assigned in that common case will not hold here, since this was a person immediately sent from God upon a particular message to the World, and therefore might plead an exemption by vertue of his Ambassage from the common <hi>Arrests</hi> and troubles of humane nature. But it was so far otherwise, as though God had designed him on purpose to let us see how much misery humane nature can undergo. Some <note place="margin">B</note> think themselves to go as far as their reason will permit them; when they tell us, that he suffer'd all these things <hi>to confirm the truth of what he had said,</hi> and particularly <hi>the Promise of Remission of sins,</hi> and that <hi>he might be an example to others, who should go to Heaven by suffering afterwards,</hi> and that <hi>he might, being touched with the feeling of our infirmities here, have the greater pity upon us now he is in Heaven.</hi> All these I grant to have been true and weighty reasons of the sufferings of Christ, in subordination to greater ends, but if there had been nothing beyond all this, I can neither understand why he should <note place="margin">C</note> suffer so deeply as he did, nor why the Scripture should insist upon a far greater reason more than upon any of these? I grant, the death of Christ did confirm the truth of his Doctrine, as far as it is unreasonble to believe that any one who knew his Doctrine to be false, would make himself miserable to make others believe it; but if this had been all intended, why would not an easier and less ignominious death have served? since he who would be willing to die to confirm a falshood, would not be thought to confirm a truth by his death, because it was painful and shameful. Why, if all his sufferings were <note place="margin">D</note> designed as a testimony to others, of the truth of what he spake, were the greatest of his sufferings, such as none could know the anguish of them but himself, I mean his <hi>Agony</hi> in the Garden, and that which made him cry out upon the Cross: <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Why were not his Miracles enough to confirm the truth of his Doctrine? since the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> was received without his death, by the evidence his Miracles gave that he was sent from God; since the Doctrine of remission of sins had been already deliver'd by the Prophets, and received by the People of the <hi>Iews;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">E</note> since those who would not believe for his Miracles sake, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would they believe though they should have seen him rise from the Grave, and therefore not surely because they saw him put into it. But of all things, the manner of our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:97974:67"/>
sufferings seems least designed to bring the World to the <note place="margin">A</note> belief of his Doctrine, which was the main obstacle to the entertainment of it among the men of greatest reputation for wisdom and knowledge. For it was <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 23</note> 
                     <hi>Christ crucified, which was to the Iews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness.</hi> Had the Apostles only preached that the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> had appeared from Heaven, and discovered the only way to bring men thither, that he assumed our Nature for a time to render himself capable of conversing with us, and therein had wrought many strange and stupendious miracles, but after he had sufficiently acquainted the World with the nature of <note place="margin">B</note> his doctrine, he was again assumed up into Heaven; in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, the doctrine might have been so easily received by the world, as might have saved the lives of many thousand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who dyed as <hi>Martyrs</hi> for it. And if it had been necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that some must have dyed to confirm it, why must the Son of God himself do it? when he had so many Disciples who willingly sacrificed their lives for him, and whose death would on that account have been as great a confirmation of the truth of it as his own.

                     <hi>the shedding of the blood of Christ was necessary as a federal rite to confirm it.</hi> I answer, if only as a federal rite, why no cheaper blood would serve to confirm it but that of the Son of God? We never read that any Covenant was confirmed by the death of one of the contracting parties; and we cannot think that God was so prodigal of the blood of his Son, to have it shed only in allusion to some ancient customs. But if there were such a necessity of alluding to them, why might not the blood of any other person have done it? when yet all that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom was no more, but that a sacrifice should be offer'd, and <note place="margin">D</note> upon the parts of the sacrifice devided, they did solemnly swear and ratifie their Covenant. <note n="c" place="margin">V.

Besides, how incongruous must this needs be, that the death of Christ the most innocent person in the World, without any respect to the guilt of sin, should suffer so much on purpose to assure us, that God will pardon those who are guilty of it? May we not much rather <note place="margin">E</note> infer the contrary, considering the holiness and justice of Gods nature; if he dealt so severely <hi>with the green tree, how much more will he with the dry?</hi> If one so innocent suffer'd so much, what then may the guilty expect?

the best subject he hath, to be severely punished, could ever <note place="margin">A</note> any imagine that it was with a design to assure them that he would pardon the most rebellious? No; but would it not rather make men afraid of being too innocent, for fear of suffering too much for it? And those who seem very careful to pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erve the honour of Gods Justice, in not punishing one for anothers faults, ought likewise to maintain it in the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one who had no fault at all to answer for. And to think to escape this by saying, <hi>that to such a person such things are calamities, but no punishments,</hi> is to revive the ancient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded Stoicism, which thought to reform the diseases of <note place="margin">B</note> Mankind by meer changeing the names of things, though never so contrary to the common sense of humane nature: which judges of the nature of punishments by the evils men undergo, and the ends they are designed for. And by the very same reason that God might exercise his dominion on so innocent a person as our Saviour was, without any respect to sin <hi>as the moving cause to it,</hi> he might lay eternal torments on a most innocent Creature (for degrees and continuance do not alter the reason of things) and then escape with the same eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that this was no act of injustice in God, because it was <note place="margin">C</note> a meer exercise of Dominion. And when once a sinner comes to be perswaded by this that God will pardon him, it must be by the hopes that God will shew kindness to the guilty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he shews so little to the innocent; and if this be agreeable to the Justice and Holiness of Gods nature, it is hard to say what is repugnant to it. If to this it be said, <hi>that Christs consent made it no unjust exercise of Dominion in God towards him:</hi> it is easily answered, that the same consent will make it less injustice in God to lay the punishment of our sins upon Christ, upon his undertaking to satisfie for as; for then the <note place="margin">D</note> consent supposes a meritorious cause of punishment; but in this case the consent implyeth none at all. And we are now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the reasons of such sufferings, and consequently of such a consent; which cannot be imagined but upon very weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty motives, such as might make it just in him to consent, as well as in God to inflict.</p>
                  <p>Neither can it be thought that all the design of the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ, was <hi>to give us an example</hi> and an incouragement to suffer our selves; though it does so in a very great measure, as appears by the Text it self. For the hopes of an eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">E</note> for these short and light afflictions, ought to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement enough, to go through the miseries of this life in expectation of a better to come. And the <hi>Cloud of Witnesses,</hi> both under the Law and the Gospel, of those who have suffer'd
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:97974:68"/>
for righteousness sake, ought to make no one think it strange, <note place="margin">A</note> if he must endure that, which so many have done before him, and been crowned for it. And lastly, to question whether <hi>Christ could have pity enough upon us in our sufferings,</hi> unless he had suffer'd so deeply himself; will lead men to distrust the pity and compassion of Almighty God, because he was never capable of suffering, as we do. But the <hi>Scripture</hi> is very plain and full (to all those who rack not their minds to pervert it) in assigning a higher reason than all these of the <hi>sufferings</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> viz. That <note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 18.</note>

                  <p>Nothing now remains, but the influence that ought to have upon us, lest we be weary and faint in our minds. For which end I shall suggest two things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The vast disproportion between Christs sufferings and ours.</item>

                  <p n="1">1. The vast Disproportion between Christs sufferings and <note place="margin">B</note> our own. Our lot is fallen into suffering times; and we are apt enough to complain of it. I will not say it is wholly true of us, what the <hi>Moralist</hi> saith generally of the complaints of men, <hi>Non quia dura sed quia molles patimur;</hi> that it is not the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our conditions so much as the softness of our spirits which makes us complain of them. For I must needs say, this <hi>City</hi> hath smarted by such a series and succession of judgements which few Cities in the world could parallel in so short a time. The Plague hath emptied its houses, and the fire consumed them; the War exhausted our spirits, and it were well if Peace <note place="margin">C</note> recovered them. But still these are but the common calamities of humane nature, things that we ought to make account of in the World; and to grow the better by them. And it were happy for this City; if our thankfulness and obedience were but answerable to the mercies we yet enjoy: let us not make our condition worse by our fears; nor our fears greater than they need to be: for no enemy can be so bad as they. Thanks be to God our condition is much better at present than it hath been; let us not make it worse by fearing it may be so. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints will never end till the World does; and we may imagine <note place="margin">D</note> that will not last much longer; when the City thinks it hath trade enough, and the Country riches enough. But I will not go about to perswade you that your condition is better than it is, for I know it is to no purpose to do so; all men will believe as they feel. But suppose our condition were much worse than it is; yet what were all our sufferings compared with those of our Saviour for us? the sins that make us smart, wounded him much deeper; they pierced his side, which only touch our skin, we have no cause to complain of the bitterness of that Cup which he hath drunk off the dreggs of already. We lament <note place="margin">E</note> over the ruins of a City, and are revived with any hopes of seeing it rise out of the dust; but Christ saw the ruins that sin caused in all mankind, he undertook the repairing them, and putting men into a better condition than before: And we may
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:97974:69"/>
easily think what a difficult task he had of it; when he came <note place="margin">A</note> to restore them who were delighted in their ruins, and thought themselves too good to be mended. It is the comfort of our miseries, (if they be only in this life) that we know they cannot last long; but that is the great aggravation of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours sufferings, that the contradiction of sinners continues against him still. Witness, the <hi>Atheism,</hi> I cannot so properly call it, as the <hi>Antichristianism</hi> of this present Age; wherein so many profane persons act over again the part of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees;</hi> they slight his Doctrine, despise his Person, disparage his miracles, contemn his Precepts, and undervalue <note place="margin">B</note> his Sufferings. Men live as if it were in defiance to his holy Laws; as though they feared not what God can do, so much as to need a <hi>Mediator</hi> between him and them. If ever men <hi>tread under foot the Son of God,</hi> it is when they think themselves to be above the need of him; if ever they count <hi>the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing,</hi> it is not only when they do not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it as they ought, but when they exercise their profane wits upon it. <hi>Blessed Saviour!</hi> was it not enough for thee to bear the contradiction of sinners upon Earth; but thou must still suffer so much at the hands of those whom thou dyedst for, that <note place="margin">C</note> thou mightest bring them to Heaven? was it not enough for thee to be betrayed on Earth, but thou must be defied in Heaven? Was it not enough for thee to stoop so low for our sakes, but that thou shouldest be trampled on because thou didst it? was the ignominious death upon the Cross too small a thing for thee to suffer in thy Person, unless thy Religion be contemned, and exposed to as much shame and mockery as thy self was? Unhappy we, that live to hear of such things! but much more unhappy if any of our sins have been the occasion of them: If our unsuitable lives to the Gospel have open'd the mouths of <note place="margin">D</note> any against so excellent a Religion. If any malice and revenge, any humour and peevishness, any pride or hypocrisie, any sensuality and voluptuousness, any injustice, or too much love of gain, have made others despise that Religion which so many pretend to, and so few practise. If we have been in any measure guilty of this, as we love our Religion, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Saviour, let us endeavour by the holiness and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our spirits, the temperance and justice of our actions, the patience and contentedness of our minds, to recover the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that Religion which only can make us happy, and our <note place="margin">E</note> Posterity after us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What Encouragement we have from the sufferings of Christ, to bear our own the better; because we see by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that God deals no more hardly with us, than he did with his

Why should we <note place="margin">A</note> think to escape, when his own Son underwent so much? if we meet with reproaches, and ill usage, with hard measure, and a mean condition, with injuries and violence, with mockings and affronts, nay with a shameful and a painful death, what cause have we to complain, for did not the Son of God undergo all these things before us? If any of your Habitations have been consumed, that you have been put to your shifts where to lodge your selves, or your Families; consider, that <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 8. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>though the Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the Air have nests, yet the Son of Man had not whereon to lay his head.</hi> If your condition <note place="margin">B</note> be mean and low, think of him, <note n="b" place="margin">Phil. 2. 6, 7.</note>

                     <hi>though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that through his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty ye might be made rich.</hi> If you are unjustly defamed and reproached, consider what contumelies and disgraces the Son of God underwent for you. If you are in pain and trouble, think of his Agony and bloody sweat, the nailing of his hands and feet to the Cross, to be a sacrifice for the expiation of your sins. Never think much of undergoing any thing, whereby <note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note>

The <hi>design</hi> that was laid for that, and all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances <note place="margin">D</note> of the story, we must have resort to the account that is given of it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. Where we shall find that the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the design was the sharing of the Government among themselves, which it was impossible for them to hope for, as long as <hi>Moses</hi> continued as a <hi>King in Iesurun,</hi> for so he is called, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 5. Him therefore they intend to lay aside, but this they knew to be a very difficult task, considering what wonders <hi>God</hi> had wrought by him in their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> what wisdom he had hitherto shewed in the conduct of them, what care for their preservation, what integrity <note place="margin">E</note> in the management of his power, what reverence the people did bear towards him, and what solemn vows and promises they had made of obedience to him. But ambitious and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious men are never discouraged by such an appearance of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:97974:72"/>
difficulties; for they know they must address themselves to the people, and in the first place perswade them that they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage <note place="margin">A</note> their interest against the usurpation of their Governours. For by that means they gain upon the peoples affections, who are ready to cry them up presently as the true <hi>Patriols</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of their <hi>Liberties</hi> against the encroachment of <hi>Princes:</hi> and when they have thus insinuated themselves into the good opinion of the people; groundless suspicions, and unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fears and jealousies will pass for arguments and demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Then they who can invent the most popular lies against the Government are accounted the men of integrity, and they <note place="margin">B</note> who most diligently spread the most infamous reports, are the men of honesty, because they are farthest from being <hi>Flatterers</hi> of the <hi>Court.</hi> The people take a strange pride, as well as pleasure, in hearing and telling all the faults of their <hi>Governours;</hi> for in doing so they flatter themselves in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they deserve to rule much better than those which do it. And the willingness they have to think so of themselves, makes them misconstrue all the actions of their <hi>Superiours</hi> to the worse sense, and then they find out plots in every thing, upon the people. What ever is done for the necessary maintenance of <note place="margin">C</note> 
                     <hi>Government,</hi> is suspected to be a design meerly to exhaust the people to make them more unable to resist. If good Laws be made, these are said by factious men to be only intended for snares for the good people, but others may break them and go unpunished. If Government be strict and severe, then it is cruel and tyrannical, if mild and indulgent, then it is remiss and negligent. If <hi>Laws</hi> be executed, then the peoples Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be oppressed; if not, then it were better not to make <hi>Laws,</hi> than not to see them executed. If there be Wars, the people are undone by Taxes; if there be Peace, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done <note place="margin">D</note> by Plenty. If extraordinary Judgements befall them, then they lament the sins of their Governours, and of the Times, and scarce think of their own. If miscarriages happen (as it is impossible always to prevent them) they charge the form of Government with them, which all sorts are subject to. Nay, it is seldom that Governours escape with their own faults, the peoples are often laid upon them too. So here, <hi>Numb. 16. 14. Moses</hi> is charged with not carrying them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> when it was their own sins which kept them thence. Yea, so partial have the people generally been against their <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <hi>Rulers,</hi> when swayed by the power of Faction, that this hath made Government very difficult and unpleasing; for what ever the actions of <hi>Princes</hi> are, they are liable to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the people. Their bad actions being more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:97974:72"/>
and their good therefore suspected of design; and the <note place="margin">A</note> wiser Governours are, the more jealous the people are of them. For alwaies the weakest part of mankind are the most suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; the less they understand things, the more designs they imagine are laid for them, and the best counsels are the soonest rejected by them. So that the wisest <hi>Government</hi> can never be secure from the jealousies of the people, and they that will raise a faction against it will never want a party to side with them. For when could we ever have imagined a Government more likely to be free from this, than that which <hi>Moses</hi> had over the people of <hi>Israel?</hi> He being an extraordinary person <note place="margin">B</note> for all the abilities of <hi>Government;</hi> one bred up in the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Court,</hi> and in no mean degree of honour, being called the the Son of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter, one of great experience in the management of affairs, of great zeal for the good of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as appeared by the tenderness of his peoples interest in their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> one of great temper and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <note place="margin">☜</note> above all men of the earth; one who took all imaginable care for the good establishment of <hi>Laws</hi> among them; but above all these one particularly chosen by God for this end, and therefore furnished with all the requisites of a good man, <note place="margin">C</note> and an excellent <hi>Prince:</hi> yet for all these things a dangerous sedition is here raised against him, and that upon the common grounds of such things, <hi>viz.</hi> usurpation upon the peoples rights, arbitrary Government, and ill management of affairs; Usurpation upon the peoples rights, <hi>v.</hi> 4. the <hi>Faction</hi> makes a <hi>Remonstrance</hi> asserting the priviledges of the <hi>people</hi> against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the Congregation are holy every one of them, and the Lord is among them; Wherefore then lift you up your selves above the Congregation of the Lord:</hi> As though they had said, we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <note place="margin">D</note> only in behalf of the <hi>Fundamental Liberties</hi> of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple both Civil and Spiritual; we only seek to retrench the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitances of power, and some late innovations which have been among us; if you are content to lay aside your power which is so dangerous and offensive to <hi>Gods holy people,</hi> we shall then sit down in quietness; for alas it is not for our selves that we seek these things (what are we?) but the <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>Gods people</hi> is dearer to us than our lives, and we shall willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sacrifice them in so good a <hi>Cause.</hi> And when <hi>Moses</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards sends for the Sons of <hi>Eliah</hi> to come to him, they perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptorily <note place="margin">E</note> refuse all <hi>Messages</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> and with their <note n="a" place="margin">V. 12, 13</note>

And the only true reason that it is ever so, is from the want of wisdom and judgement in the generality of mankind, who sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom see to the end of things, and hardly distinguish between the names and nature of them, till their own dear bought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath taught them the difference. Sedition is of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and hath the inseparable properties of <hi>Sin;</hi> for it is <note place="margin">B</note> conceived with pleasure, brought forth with pain, and ends in death and misery. Nothing enters upon the stage with a bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shew and appearance, but however prosperous for a time it may continue, it commonly meets with a fatal end. But it is with this sin as to this world, as it is with others as to the next; men when they are betrayed into them, are carried away and transported with the pleasing temptations, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the unspeakable misery that follows after them. So that what the <hi>Devils</hi> advantage is in order to the ruine of mens souls, is the advantage of seditious persons over the less understanding <note place="margin">C</note> people; they both tempt with an appearance of good, and equally deceive them which hearken to them. But as we still find, that notwithstanding all the grave admonitions, the sober counsels, the rational discourses, the perswasive arguments which are used to deter men from the practice of sin, they will still be such <hi>Fools</hi> to yield to the <hi>Devils</hi> temptations against their own <hi>welfare:</hi> So, neither the blessings of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>Peace,</hi> nor the miseries of an intestine <hi>War,</hi> neither the securitie of a settled <hi>Government,</hi> nor the constant danger of <hi>Innovations</hi> will hinder men of fiery and restless spirits from <note place="margin">D</note> raising combustions in a Nation, though themselves perish in the <hi>Flames</hi> of them. This we find here was the case of <hi>Corah</hi> and his company; they had forgotten the groans of their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the miracles of their deliverance out of it, and all the faithful services of <hi>Moses,</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered not the difficulties of <hi>Government,</hi> nor the impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of satisfying the ambitious desires of all pretenders; they regarded not that <hi>God</hi> from whom their power was derived, nor the account they must give to him for their resistance of it: nothing but a full <hi>Revenge</hi> upon the Government can satisfie <note place="margin">E</note> them, by leaving no means unattempted for its overthrow, though themselves be consumed by the fall of it. It were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for <hi>Government</hi> if these turbulent spirits could be singled out from the rest in their first attempts; but that is the usual

subtilty of such men, when they find themselves aimed at, they <note place="margin">A</note> run into the common herd, and perswade the people that they are equally concerned with themselves in the present danger, that though the pretence be only against faction and sedition, the design is the slavery and oppression of the <hi>People.</hi> This they manage at first by grave nods, and secret whispers, by deep sighs, and <hi>extatick</hi> motions, by far fetched discourses, and <hi>Tragical</hi> stories, till they find the people capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their impressions, and then seem most unwilling to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that which it was at first their design to discover.

That <hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>a right to Power,</hi> is inseparable from the people; <hi>libertatis patrocinium suscipiunt,</hi> saith <hi>Calvin,</hi> upon <hi>Corah</hi> and his company; and I believe they will be found to be the first assertors of this kind of <hi>Liberty</hi> that ever were in the world. And happy had it been for us in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if <hi>Corah</hi> had never found any Disciples in it. For what <note place="margin">B</note> a blessed <hi>Liberty</hi> was this which <hi>Corah</hi> aimed at, <hi>viz.</hi> to change one excellent Prince, as <hi>Moses</hi> was, for 250 <hi>Tyrants,</hi> besides <hi>Corah</hi> and the Sons of <hi>Reuben?</hi> What just and equal liberty was it which <hi>Moses</hi> did deprive them of? It was only the <hi>Liberty</hi> of destroying themselves, which all the power he he had could hardly keep them from. Could there be any greater <hi>Liberty</hi> than delivering them out of the house of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage? and was not <hi>Moses</hi> the great Instrument in effecting it? Could there be greater <hi>Liberty</hi> than for their whole Nation to be preserved from all the designs of their enemies, to enjoy <note place="margin">C</note> their own <hi>Laws,</hi> and matters of <hi>Iustice</hi> to be duly administred among them? and had they not all these under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Moses?</hi> What means then this out-cry for <hi>Liberty?</hi> Is it that they would have had no <hi>Government</hi> at all among them, but that every one might have done what he pleased himself? This indeed were a desireable <hi>Liberty,</hi> if a man could have it alone: but when every one thinks that he is but one, though he be free; and every one else is as free as he, but though their <hi>freedom</hi> be equal to his, his <hi>Power</hi> is not equal to theirs; and therefore to bring things to a more just proportion, every <note place="margin">D</note> one must part with some power for a great deal of security. If any man can imagine himself in such a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>confusion,</hi> which some improperly call a <hi>state</hi> of <hi>nature;</hi> let him consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whether the contentment he could take in his own liberty and power to defend himself, would ballance the fears he would have of the injury which others in the same state might be able to do him. Not that I think meer <hi>fear</hi> made men at first enter into Societies, for there is a natural inclination in mankind to it, and one of the greatest pleasures of humane life lies in the enjoyment of it. But what other considerations <note place="margin">E</note> incline men to, fear makes reasonable, though men part with some supposed liberty for the enjoyment of it. So that the utmost liberty is destroyed by the very nature of <hi>Government,</hi> and nothing can be more unreasonable than for men to quarrel
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:97974:75"/>
with <hi>Government</hi> for that, which they cannot enjoy and the <note place="margin">A</note> preservation of themselves together. Which alone makes the desire of <hi>Power</hi> reasonable, and if the preservation of our selves in our rights and properties may be had without it, all that the want of <hi>Liberty</hi> signifies, is, that men have all the conveniences of <hi>Power</hi> without the trouble and the cares of it. And if this be not a more desirable <hi>Liberty</hi> than the other, let any rational man judge. The pretence of <hi>Liberty</hi> then in this sense against <hi>Government,</hi> is, that men are <hi>Fools</hi> in taking the best care to preserve themselves, that <hi>Laws</hi> are but instruments of <hi>Slavery,</hi> and every single man is better able to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <note place="margin">B</note> than the united strength of a people in <hi>Society</hi> is to defend him. And this kind of <hi>Liberty</hi> we may justly think will be desired by none but mad-men, and beasts of prey. It follows then, that what <hi>Liberty</hi> is inconsistent with all <hi>Government,</hi> must never be pleaded against any one sort of it. But is there then so great a degree of <hi>Liberty</hi> in one mode of <hi>Government</hi> more than another, that it should be thought reasonable to disturb <hi>Government,</hi> meerly to alter the form of it? Would it have been so much better for the people of <hi>Israel</hi> to have been governed by the 250 men here mentioned, than by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">C</note> Would not they have required the same subjection and obedience to themselves, though their commands had been much more unreasonable than his? What security can there be that every one of these shall not be worse in all respects than him whom they were so willing to lay aside; and if one be thought troublesome, what <hi>Liberty</hi> and ease is there when their name is <hi>Legion?</hi> So that the folly of these popular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences is as great as the sin in being perswaded by them.</p>
                  <p>And it may be they have not thought amiss who have attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted a great part of that disturbance of the Peace of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> under a pretence of popular <hi>Government,</hi> to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just admiration of those <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Writers, who have unreasonably set up <hi>Liberty</hi> in opposition to <hi>Monarchy.</hi> But some of the wisest of them have given us a truer account of these things, and have told us, that it was impossible the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> State could have been preserved longer, unless it had sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to an <note n="a" place="margin">Dio.

                     <hi>Imperial Power;</hi> for the popular heats and factions were so great, that the annual election of <hi>Magistrates,</hi> was but another name for a <hi>tumult;</hi> and as <hi>Dio</hi> goes on <note n="b" place="margin">L. 44. init.</note> 
                     <hi>the name of popular Government is far more plausible, but the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <hi>benefits of Monarchy are far greater; it being much easier to find one good than many; and though one be accounted diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, the other is almost impossible.</hi> And as he elsewhere well observes, <hi>the flourishing of a Common-wealth depends upon its
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:97974:76"/>
poverty;</hi> that being alone able to unite the minds of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours,</hi> who in a plentiful state, not set about with enemies, <note place="margin">A</note> will be grasping at their own private interests, and fall natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from thence into divisions and animosities; but <hi>the flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Monarchy lies in the riches of it,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> having the same interest, and being rich or poor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. So that we see the notion of <hi>Liberty,</hi> and exercise of power in <hi>Government,</hi> is so far from being an inseparable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the people, that the proper notion of it is inconsistent with <hi>Government</hi> and that which lies in the <hi>enjoyments of our Rights and Properties,</hi> is so far from being inconsistent with <note place="margin">B</note> 
                     <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that they are more advanced by that, than by any other way of Government.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another principle which tends to the subverting Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under a pretence of <hi>Liberty,</hi> is, that in case of <hi>Usurpation</hi> upon the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>People,</hi> they may resume the exercise of <hi>Power,</hi> and punish the <hi>Supreme Magistrate</hi> himself, if he be guilty of it. Than which there can be no principle ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined more destructive to civil <hi>Societies,</hi> and repugnant to the very nature of <hi>Government.</hi> For it destroys all the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Oaths and Compacts; it makes the solemnest <note place="margin">C</note> bonds of obedience signifie nothing when the pleople shall think fit to declare it: it makes every prosperous <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> just; for no doubt when the power is in the <hi>Rebels</hi> hands, they will justifie themselves, and condemn their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign. (And if <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> had succeeded in their Rebellion against <hi>Moses,</hi> no doubt they would have been called the <hi>Keepers</hi> of the <hi>Liberties</hi> of <hi>Israel.)</hi> It makes all Government dangerous to the persons in whom it is, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unavoidable infirmities, of it, and the readiness of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to misconstrue the actions of their <hi>Princes,</hi> and their inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity <note place="margin">D</note> to judge of them; it not being fit that the reasons of all counsels of Princes should be divulged by <hi>Proclamations.</hi> So that there can be nothing wanting to make <hi>Princes</hi> miserable, but that the people want <hi>Power</hi> to make them so. And the supposition of this principle will unavoidably keep up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant jealousie between the <hi>Prince</hi> and his people: for if he knows their minds, he will think it reasonable to secure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by all means against their <hi>Power,</hi> and endeavour to keep them as unable to resist as may be: whereby all mutual confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence between a <hi>Prince</hi> and his <hi>People</hi> will be destroyed: and <note place="margin">E</note> there can be no such way to bring in an arbitrary <hi>Government</hi> into a <hi>Nation,</hi> as that which such men pretend, to be the only means to keep it out. Besides, this must necessarily engage a Nation in endless disputes about the forfeiture of Power into
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:97974:76"/>
whose hands it falls: whether into the people in common, or <note place="margin">A</note> some persons particularly chosen by the people for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: for in an established <hi>Government</hi> according to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the King himself is the true representative of the people; others may be chosen for some particular purposes, as proposing Laws, &amp;c. but these cannot pretend by vertue of that choice, to have the full power of the people; and withal, whatever they do against the consent of the people is unlawful; and their power is forfeited by attempting it.</p>
                  <p>But on the other side, what mighty danger can there be in supposing the persons of <hi>Princes</hi> to be so <hi>sacred,</hi> that no sons <note place="margin">B</note> of violence ought to come near to hurt them? Have not all the ancient <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Empires</hi> of the world flourished under the supposition of an unaccountable power in <hi>Princes?</hi> That hath been thought by those who did not own a derivation of their power from <hi>God,</hi> but a just security to their persons, considering the hazards, and the care of Government which they undergo? Have not the people who have been most jealous of their <hi>Liberties,</hi> been fain to have recour'e to an unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able power, as their last refuge in case of their greatest necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? I mean the <hi>Romans</hi> in their <hi>Dictators.</hi> And if it were <note place="margin">C</note> thought not only reasonable, but necessary then, ought it not to be preserved inviolable, where the same <hi>Laws</hi> do give it by which men have any right to challenge any power at all? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth this <hi>give Princes the liberty to do what they list;</hi> for the <hi>Laws</hi> by which they <hi>Govern,</hi> do fence in the <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> of men; and <hi>Princes</hi> do find so great conveniency ease and security in their <hi>Government</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> that the sense of that will keep them far better within the compass of <hi>Laws,</hi> than the <hi>Peoples</hi> holding a Rod over them, which the best <hi>Princes</hi> are like to suffer the most by, and bad will but grow desperate by <note place="margin">D</note> it. Good <hi>Princes</hi> will never need such a curb, because their oaths and promises, their love and tenderness towards their people, the sense they have of a <hi>Power</hi> infinitely greater than theirs, to which they must give an account of all their actions, will make them govern as the <hi>Fathers</hi> of their Country; and bad <hi>Princes</hi> will never value it, but will endeavour by all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means to secure themselves against it. So that no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency can be possibly so great on the supposition of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable <hi>Power</hi> in Soveraign <hi>Princes,</hi> taking it in the general, and meerly on the account of reason, as the unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">E</note> mischiefs of that <hi>Hypothests,</hi> which places all power ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in the people, and notwithstanding all <hi>oaths</hi> and <hi>bonds</hi> whatsoever to obedience gives them the liberty to resume it when they please: which will always be when that <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:97974:77"/>
                     <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Sedition</hi> shall prevail among them, which ruled <note place="margin">A</note> here in <hi>Corah</hi> and his company.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another pretence for this Rebellion of <hi>Corah,</hi> was, <hi>the freeing themselves from the encroachments upon their spiritual priviledges which were made by the usurpations of</hi> Aaron <hi>and the Priesthood.</hi> This served for a very popular pretence, for they knew no reason that one <hi>Tribe</hi> should engross so much of the wealth of the Nation to themselves, and have nothing to do but to attend the service of God for it. What, say they, <hi>are not all the Lords people holy?</hi> Why may not then all they <hi>offer up incense to the Lord,</hi> as well as the Sons of <hi>Aaron?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">B</note> How many <hi>publick uses</hi> might those <hi>Revenues</hi> serve for, which are now to maintain <hi>Aaron,</hi> and all the sons of <hi>Levi?</hi> But if there must be some to attend the service of God, why may not the <hi>meanest</hi> of the people serve for that purpose, those who can be serviceable for nothing else? Why must there be an order of <hi>Priesthood</hi> distinct from that of <hi>Levites?</hi> why a <hi>High-Priest</hi> above all the <hi>Priests?</hi> what is there in all their office which one of the common people may not do as well as they? cannot they slay the sacrifices, and offer incense, and do all other parts of the <hi>Priestly office?</hi> So that at last they make all <note place="margin">C</note> this to be a Politick design of <hi>Moses</hi> only to advance his own <hi>Family</hi> by making his <hi>Brother High-Priest,</hi> and to have all the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> at his devotion, to keep the people the better in awe. This hath always been the quarrel at <hi>Religion,</hi> by those who seldom pretend to it, but with a design to destroy it. For who would ever have minded the constant attendance at the <hi>Temple,</hi> if no encouragements had been given to those who were imployed in it? Or is not <hi>Religion</hi> apt enough to be despised of it self, by men of prophane minds, unless it be rendred more <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>contemptible</hi> by the <hi>Poverty</hi> of those <note place="margin">D</note> who are devoted to it? Shall not <hi>God</hi> be allowed the priviledge of every <hi>Master</hi> of a <hi>Family,</hi> to appoint the ranks and orders of his own servants, and to take care they be provided for, as becomes those who wait upon him? What a dishonour had this been to the <hi>true God,</hi> when those who worshipped <hi>false Gods</hi> thought nothing too great for those who were imployed in the service of them? But never any yet cryed, but he that had a mind to betray his <hi>Master, to what purpose is all this waste?</hi> Let <hi>God</hi> be honoured as he ought to be, let <hi>Religion</hi> come in for its share among all the things which deserve en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, <note place="margin">E</note> and those who are imployed in the offices of it, enjoy but what <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> of their <hi>Country</hi> give them, and then we shall see it was nothing, but the <hi>discontent</hi> and <hi>faction</hi> of <hi>Corah</hi> and his company which
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97974:77"/>
made any encroachment of <hi>Aaron</hi> and the <hi>Priesthood</hi> any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence <note place="margin">A</note> for Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>But all these pretences would not serve to make them escape the severe hand of divine <hi>justice;</hi> for in an extraordinary and remarkable manner he made them suffer the just desert of their sin, for <hi>they perished in their contradiction,</hi> which is the next thing to be considered, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Iudgement</hi> which was inflicted upon them for it. They had provoked <hi>Heaven</hi> by their sin, and disturbed the <hi>earth</hi> by their Faction; and the <hi>earth,</hi> as if it were moved with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation against them, trembled and <hi>shook,</hi> as <hi>Iosephus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">B</note> saith, like waves that are tossed with a mighty wind, and then with a horrid noise it rends asunder, and opens its mouth to swallow those in its bowels who were unfit to live upon the face of it. They had been dividing the people, and the earth to their amazement and ruine divides it self under their feet, as though it had been designed on purpose, that in their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themselves might feel, and others see the mischief of their sin. Their seditious principles seemed to have infected the ground they stood upon; the earth of a sudden proves as unquiet and troublesome as they; but to rebuke their madness, it was <note place="margin">C</note> only in obedience to him who made it the executioner of his wrath against them; and when it had done its office, it is said, <note n="a" place="margin">Numb. 16. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>that the earth closed upon them; and they perished from among the Congregation.</hi> Thus the <hi>earth</hi> having revenged it self against the disturbers of its peace, <hi>Heaven</hi> presently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with a <hi>flaming fire,</hi> taking vengeance upon the 250. men, who in opposition to <note n="b" place="margin">V. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>Aaron, had usurped the Priestl office, in offering incense before the Lord.</hi> Such a <hi>Fire,</hi> if we believe the same Historian, which far outwent the most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful eruptions of <hi>Aetna</hi> or <hi>Vesuvius,</hi> which neither the art of <note place="margin">D</note> man, nor the power of the wind could raise, which neither the burning of Woods nor Cities could parallel; but such a <hi>Fire</hi> which the wrath of <hi>God</hi> alone could kindle, whose light could be outdone by nothing but the heat of it. Thus Heaven and Earth agree in the punishment of such disturbers of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> by this remarkable judgement upon them hath left it upon record to all ages, that all the world may be convinced how displeasing to him the sin of faction and sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is. For <hi>God</hi> takes all this that was done against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> as done against himself. For they are said <hi>to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered</hi>

                     <hi>This is that Dathan and Abiram, who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:97974:78"/>
company of Corah, when they strove against the Lord.</hi> By <note place="margin">A</note> which we see <hi>God</hi> interprets striving against the Authority ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him, to be a striving against himself. <hi>God</hi> looks upon himself as immediately concerned in the Government of the world; for <hi>by him Princes raign,</hi> and they are his <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents</hi> upon earth; and they who <hi>resist,</hi> resist not a meer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the people, but <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 13. 1, 2.</note> 
                     <hi>an Ordinance of God;</hi> and they who do so shall in the mildest sense receive a <hi>severe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> from him. Let the pretences be never so popular, the persons never so great and famous; nay, though they were of the great Council of the <hi>Nation,</hi> yet we see <hi>God</hi> doth not <note place="margin">B</note> abate of his severity upon any of these considerations.</p>
                  <p>This was the first formed sedition that we read of against <hi>Moses,</hi> the people had been murmuring before, but they wanted heads to manage them: Now all things concur to a most dangerous Rebellion upon the most popular pretences of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty;</hi> and now <hi>God</hi> takes the first opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of declaring his hatred of such actions; <hi>that others might hear, and fear, and do no more so presumptuously.</hi> This hath been the usual method of divine Judgements; the first of the kind hath been most remarkably punished in this life, that <note place="margin">C</note> by it they may see how hateful such things are to <hi>God;</hi> but if men will venture upon them notwithstanding, <hi>God</hi> doth not always punish them so much in this world, (though he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth) but reserves them, without repentance, to his Justice in the world to come. The first man that sinned was made an example of <hi>Gods</hi> Justice; The first world; the first pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick attempt against Heaven at <hi>Babel</hi> after the plantation of the world again; the first Cities which were so generally corrupted after the flood; the first breaker of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> after the <hi>Law;</hi> the first offerers with strange fire; the first lookers into the <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <hi>Ark,</hi> and here the first popular Rebellion and Usurpers of the office of <hi>Priesthood. God</hi> doth hereby intend to preserve the honour of his <hi>Laws;</hi> he gives men warning enough by one examplary punishment, and if notwithstanding that, they will commit the same sin, they may thank themselves if they suffer for it, if not in this life, yet in that to come. And that good effect this Judgement had upon that people, that although the next day 14000. suffered for murmuring at the destruction of these men, yet we do not find that any Rebellion was raised among them afterwards upon these popular pretences of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">E</note> and the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi> While their Judges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued (who were <hi>Kings,</hi> without the state and title of <hi>Kings)</hi> they were observed with reverence, and obeyed with diligence.

                     <hi>The Lord forbid that I should do this thing against my Master the Lords Anointed, to stretch forth my hand against him, seeing he is the Anointed of the Lord.</hi> And lest we should think <note place="margin">B</note> it was only his <hi>Modesty</hi> or his <hi>Policy</hi> which kept him from doing it, he afterwards, upon a like occasion declares, it was only the sin of doing it, which kept him from it. <note n="c" place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>For who can stretch forth his hand against the Lords Anointed and be guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less?</hi> Not as though <hi>David</hi> could not do it <hi>without the power of the Sanhedrin,</hi> as it hath been pretended by the Sons of <hi>Corah</hi> in our age; for he excepts <hi>none;</hi> he never seizes upon him to carry him prisoner to be tryed by the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> nor is there any foundation for any such power in the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> over the persons of their <hi>Soveraigns.</hi> It neither being contained in the <note place="margin">C</note> grounds of its institution, nor any precedent occurring in the whole story of the Bible, which gives the least countenance to it: Nay, several passages of <hi>Scripture</hi> utterly overthrow it, for how could <hi>Solomon</hi> have said, <note n="d" place="margin">Eccles. 8. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Where the word of a King is, there is power; and who may say unto him, what dost thou?</hi> If by the constitution of their Government, the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> might have controlled him in what he said or did. But <hi>have not several of the modern Iews said so?</hi> Granting that some have; yet so they have spoken many unreasonable and foolish things besides; but yet none of these have said, that it was in <note place="margin">D</note> the power of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> to depose their <hi>Kings,</hi> or put them to death; all that they say is, that in the cases expressed by the <hi>Law,</hi> if the <hi>Kings</hi> do transgress, the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> had the power of inflicting the penalty of <hi>scourging,</hi> which yet they deny to have had any <hi>infamy</hi> in it among them. But did not <hi>David</hi> transgress the <hi>Law</hi> in his murder and adultery? did not <hi>Solomon</hi> in the multitude of his wives and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> yet where do we read that the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> ever took cognisance of these things?

                     <hi>Nachmanides,</hi> saith expresly, <hi>That no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may judge the King, but the holy and blessed God alone.</hi> But
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:97974:79"/>
we have an Authority far greater than his, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Davids</hi> in <note place="margin">A</note> this case, who after he hath denied that <hi>any man can stretch forth his hand against the Lords Anointed, and be guiltless:</hi> In the very next words he submits the judgement of him only to <hi>God</hi> himself, saying, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 26. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>As the Lord liveth, the Lord shall smite him, or his day shall come to die, or he shall descend into battel and perish.</hi> He thought it sufficient to leave the judgement of those things to <hi>God,</hi> whose power over <hi>Princes</hi> he knew was enough, if well considered by them, to keep them in awe.

They could find no way to justifie their former wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but by adding more: The consciousness of their own guilt, and the fears of the punishment due to it, made them unquiet <note place="margin">B</note> and thoughtful, as long as his life and presence did upbraid them with the one, and made them fearful of the other. And when they found the greatness and constancy of his mind, the firmness of his Piety, the zeal he had for the true interest of the people, would not suffer him to betray his <hi>Trust</hi> for the saving of his life; they charge him with their own guilt, and make him suffer because they had deserved to do it. And as if it had not been enough to have abused the names of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> before, they resolve to make the very name of <hi>Iustice</hi> to suffer together with their <hi>King:</hi> by calling that infamous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany <note place="margin">C</note> who condemned their <hi>Soveraign, A High Court of Iustice</hi> which trampled under foot the <hi>Laws</hi> both of God and men. But lest the world should imagine they had any shame left in their sins, they make the people witnesses of his <hi>Murther;</hi> and pretend the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> for doing that, which they did detest and abhor. Thus fell our <hi>Royal Martyr</hi> a sacrifice to the fury of unreasonable men; who either were so blind as not to see his worth, or rather so bad as to hate him for it. And as <hi>God gave once</hi> to the people of the <hi>Iews a King in his Anger,</hi> being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to it by their sins, we have cause to say, that upon the <note place="margin">D</note> same account <hi>he took</hi> away one of the best of <hi>Kings from us in his wrath.</hi> But blessed be that <hi>God,</hi> who in the midst of judgement was pleased to remember mercy, in the miraculous preservation, and glorious restauration of our Gratious Soveraign; let us have a care then of abusing the mercies of so great a deliverance to quite other ends than <hi>God</hi> intended it for; lest he be provoked to say to us, as he did of old to the <hi>Iews,</hi>

But if neither the sense of their future miseries, nor their present sins will at all abate their fury or asswage their malice, nothing is then left for kindness to shew it self by, but by lamenting their folly, bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their obstinacy, and praying God to have pity upon them, who have so little upon themselves. And all these were very remarkable in the carriage of our Blessed Saviour towards his most implacable enemies: he had taken care to instruct them by his doctrine; to convince them by his miracles, to oblige them by the first offers of the greatest mercy; but all these <note place="margin">B</note> things had no other effect upon them, than to heighten their malice, increase their rage, and make them more impatient till they had destroyed him. But their stupidity made him more sensible of their folly, and their obstinacy stirred up his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion towards them, in so much that the nearer he approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his own sufferings, the greater sense he expressed of theirs. For he was no sooner come within view of that bloody City, wherein he was within few days to suffer <hi>by,</hi> as well as <hi>for</hi> the sins of men; but his compassion breaks forth, not only by his weeping over it; but by that passionate expression, which is <note place="margin">C</note> abrupt only by the force of his grief: <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 19. 41, 42.</note> 
                     <hi>If thou hadst known, even thou at least in this thy day the things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto thy peace! but now they are bid from thine eyes.</hi> And when he was within the City, he could not mention the desolation which was to come upon it for all the righteous blood which had been spilt there, but he presently subjoyns, <note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 23. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>O Hierusalem, Hierusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings and ye would not?</hi> what words <note place="margin">D</note> could more emphatically express the love and tenderness of Christ towards his greatest enemies than these do? especially considering that he knew how busie they were in contriving his sufferings, while he was so passionately lamenting theirs. And when their malice had done its utmost upon him, and they saw him hanging upon the Cross and ready to yield up his last breath, he imploys the remainder of it in begging pardon for them, in those pathetical words <note n="c" place="margin">Luke 21. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.</hi> By all which we see, that what punishments soever the Jewish nation underwent afterwards <note place="margin">E</note> for the great sin of crucifying the Lord of life, were no effect of meer revenge from him upon them, but the just judgement of God which they had drawn upon themselves by their own obstinacy and wilful blindness.</p>

And that they might not think themselves surprised, when <note place="margin">A</note> the dreadful effects of Gods anger should seize upon them, our Saviour as he drew nearer to the time of his sufferings gives them more frequent and serious warnings of the sad consequence of their incorrigibleness under all the means of cure which had been used among them. For they were so far from being amended by them, that they not only despised the remedy, but the Physitians too; (as though that were a small thing) they beat, they wound, they kill those who came to cure them: but as if it had not been enough to have done these things to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, (to let the world see how dangerous it is to attempt the <note place="margin">B</note> cure of incorrigible sinners) when God sent his own Son to them, expecting they should reverence him, they find a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar reason for taking him out of the way, <note n="a" place="margin">V. 38.</note> 
                     <hi>for then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance would be their own.</hi> But so miserably do sinners miscarry in their designs for their advantage, that those things which they build their hopes the most upon prove the most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and pernicious to them: When these persons thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sure of the inheritance by killing the Son, that very sin of theirs, not only put them out of possession, but out of the hopes of recovering what interest they had in it before. For <note place="margin">C</note> upon this it is that our Saviour here saith in the words of the Text, <hi>Therefore say I unto you, that the Kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which words, are the application which our Saviour makes of the foregoing parable concerning the vineyard, which it seems the Chief Priests and Pharisees, did not apprehend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be concerned in, till he brought the application of it so close to them; so that then they find they had condemned themselves, when they so readily passed so severe a sentence <note place="margin">D</note> upon those husbandmen, who had so ill requited the Lord of the Vineyard for all the care he had taken about it, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of sending him the fruits of it, they abuse his messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and at last murther his Son. When therefore Christ asks them, <note n="b" place="margin">V. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>When the Lord therefore of the Vineyard cometh, what will he do unto those husbandmen?</hi> They thought the case so plain, that they never take time to consider, or go forth to advise upon it, but bring in a present answer upon the evidence of the fact. <note n="c" place="margin">V. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>They say unto him, he will mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his Vineyard</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <hi>to other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</hi> Little did they think what a dreadful sentence they passed upon themselves and their own nation in these words: little did they think that hereby they condemned their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:97974:82"/>
to be burned, their City to be destroyed, their Country to <note place="margin">A</note> be ruined, their Nation to be Vagabonds over the face of the earth; little did they think that herein they justified God in all the miseries which they suffered afterwards, for in these words they vindicate God and condemn themselves, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Gods Justice in the severest punishments he should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon such obstinate wretches. Our Saviour having gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this confession from them, and so made it impossible for them to start back in charging God with injustice in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; he now applies it to themselves in these words, which I suppose, ought immediately to follow the 41. verse. <note place="margin">B</note> 
                     <hi>Therefore say I unto you the Kingdom of God shall be taken from you,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein we have,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The greatest judgement which can ever befal a people, which is <hi>the taking away the Kingdom of God from them.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The greatest mercy can ever be vouchsafed to a nation, which is Gods giving his Kingdom to it. <hi>And give it to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>In the judgement we consider the cause of it, <hi>therefore say I unto you,</hi> &amp;c. which is either, more general as referring to all going before, and so it makes the taking away the <note place="margin">C</note> Kingdom of God to be the just punishment of an incorrigible people, or more particular as referring to the sin of the Jews in crucifying Christ, and so it makes the guilt of that sin to be the cause of all the miseries, which that nation hath under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone since that time.</p>
                  <p>In the later part we may consider the terms upon which God either gives or continues his Kingdom to a nation, and that is, <hi>bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We consider the former with a particular respect to the state of the Jewish nation. And therein, 1. The greatness of <note place="margin">D</note> their judgement implyed in those words <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> &amp;c. 2. The particular reason of that judgement which was crucifying the Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The greatness of the judgement which befel the Jewish nation after imbruing their hands in the blood of Christ. And that will appear if we take <hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> in that double notion in which it was taken at that time. 1. It was taken by the Jews themselves for some peculiar and temporal blessings, which those who enjoyed it had above all other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 2. It was taken by our Saviour for a clearer manisesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">E</note> of the will of God to the world, and the consequence of that in the hearts of good men; and all the spiritual blessings which do attend it. So that the taking away <hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> from them must needs be the heaviest judgement which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:97974:82"/>
could befal a people, since it implies in it, the taking away all <note place="margin">A</note> the greatest temporal and spiritual blessings.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We take it in the notion the Jews themselves had of it; and in this sense we shall make it evident that <hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> hath been taken from that people in accomplishment of this prediction of our Saviour. For they imagined the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> among them to consist in these things espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, <hi>Deliverance from their enemies,</hi> A <hi>flourishing state,</hi> The <hi>upholding their Religion in Honour,</hi> chiefly in the pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous worship of the Temple. Now if instead of these things, they were exposed to the fury of their enemies so as never <note place="margin">B</note> any nation besides them were, if their whole Polity was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed so as the very face of Government hath ever since been taken from them; if their Religion hath been so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upheld, that the practice of it hath been rendred impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible by the destruction of the Temple, and the consequences of it, then the Jews themselves cannot but say, that in their own sense <hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> hath been taken from them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They make <hi>the Kingdom of God</hi> to consist in <hi>a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them from their enemies.</hi> For this was their great quarrel at our Saviour that he should pretend to bring the <note place="margin">C</note> Kingdom of God among them, and do nothing in order to their deliverance from the Roman Power. They either were such great admirers of the Pomp and Splendor of the world, or so sensible of their own burdens and the yoke that was upon them, that they could not be perswaded that God should design to send his Kingdom among them for any other end but their ease and liberty. They apprehended the Crown of Thorns which was put upon our Saviours head was the fittest repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the nature of his Kingdom; for they looked upon it as the meer shew of a Kingdom, but the reality was nothing but <note place="margin">D</note> affliction and tribulation; and this was a doctrine they thought of all others the least needful to be preached to them, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained so much of what they underwent already. They took it for the greatest contradiction to talk of a Kingdom among them, as long as they were in subjection to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Governors. But if Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> had raised an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in defence of their liberty, and had destroyed the Romans, they would never have enquired farther concerning Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, or Miracles, this had been instead of all others to them, and then they would willingly have given him that title, which <note place="margin">E</note> was set up only in derision as the Elogium of his Cross, <hi>Iesus of Nazareth King of the Iews:</hi> But we see how justly God dealt with them soon after, when they crucified the Son of God because he preached another Kingdom than they dream'd

And from this time there never was a more Tragical story ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acted or written than that is of the miseries which this people underwent. For if ever there were the marks of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <note place="margin">B</note> vengeance seen in the ruine of a Nation, they were in that. For they were so far from hearkning to the counsel of their wisest men, that the first thing they made sure of, was the destruction of them. Wisdom was but another name for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son among them: and there needed no other evidence to take away the lives of any but to say that they were rich and wise. When they had thus secured themselves (as they thought) against the danger of too much Wisdom, by the removal of all such, who at least did not counterfeit madness and folly by joyning with them; then they began to suspect one another, <note place="margin">C</note> and three Factions at once break forth at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> who seem'd to be afraid the Romans should not destroy them fast enough, for in the several parts of the City where they were, they were continually killing one another: and never joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether but when they saw the Romans approaching their Walls, least they should take that work out of each others hands. By all means they were resolved to endure a seige, and as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative for that, they burnt up all the stores almost of provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which were among them: whence ensued a most dreadful <note place="margin">Ios. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>that it was now apparent that God from the beginning of the War had designed their destruction, and they had better be the executioners of his vengeance themselves than suffer the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans to be so.</hi> Upon which they all miserably destroyed each other: who were the last who opposed the Roman Power. <note place="margin">E</note>

                  <p>What shall we say then to these things? Have we any ground to suspect the truth of the story as either made by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in hatred of the Jews, or improved mightily to their disadvantage? Not so certainly, when all the circumstances
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:97974:84"/>
are related by Jewish and Roman Writers, who had no kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <note place="margin">A</note> at all for Christians. Or shall we say there was nothing extraordinary in all this, but that the Jews were a wild and seditious people that destroyed themselves and their nation? but it is evident they were not always so; they had been a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that had flourished with the reputation of wisdom and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and had great success against their enemies. And the Romans themselves at this time acknowledged they never saw a people of a more invincible spirit and less afraid of dying than these were. But all this turned to their greater prejudice; and they who had been so famous in former ages for miraculous <note place="margin">B</note> deliverances from the power of their enemies, were now not only given up into their hands, but into those which were far more cruel, which were their own. What then can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine should make so great an alteration in the State of their affairs now, but that God was their friend then and their enemy now? He gave then success beyond their Counsels, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preparation; now he blasts all their designs, divides their counsels, and makes their contrivances end in their speedier ruine. Now they felt the effect of what God had threatned long before, <note n="a" place="margin">Hos. 9 12.</note>

Whereby we see how much the welfare of a Nation depends upon Gods Favour and that no other security is comparable to that of true Religion. The Nation of the Jews, was for all that we know never more numerous, than at this time, never more resolute and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to venture their lives, never better provided of fortified Towns and strong places of retreat and all provisions for War; but there was a hand writing upon the Wall against them, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, Tekel, Peres,</hi> God had weighed them in the ballance and <note place="margin">D</note> found them too light, he divides their Nation and removes his Kingdom from them and leaves them to an utter desolation.

For although we ought not to measure the rules of Eastern diet by those of our Northern Climates, and it be withall true that the number of people add both to the riches and plenty of it, and that the fertile places of that land were so almost to a miracle, yet considering their scarcity of rain and their Sabbatical years, we must have recourse to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate <note place="margin">E</note> care of heaven which provided for all their necessities and filled their stores to so great abundance that <note n="c" place="margin">1 Kings 5. 11.</note>

For all the the males being obliged strictly by the Law <note place="margin">B</note> to go up three times a year to Hierusalem (we should think against all rules of Policy to leave the country naked) it seem's incredible that their enemies should not over-run the Country, and destroy their Wives and Children at that time. But all their security was in the promise which God had made; <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 34. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shall go up to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year.</hi> And to let us see that obedience to God is the best security against the greatest dangers, we never read of any invasion of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in one of those times, nor of any miseries they suffer'd <note place="margin">C</note> then; till the last and fatal destruction of <hi>Hierusalem</hi> when God had taken away his Kingdom from them. And with that, their whole Polity fell; for never since have they been able to maintain so much as the face of Government living in subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if not in slavery in all parts of the world. So that whether we mean the succession of power in <hi>Iudahs</hi> tribe, or the seat of power in the whole nation, or the distinction and superiority of that tribe above the rest, by the <hi>Scepter</hi> which was not <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 49. 10.</note>

I know what vaine hopes, and foolish fancies, and incredible stories they have among them; of some supreme power, which they have in some part of the world but they know not where.

So that they are under an unavoidable necessity of breaking their Law; if they do them not, they break the Law which commands them to be done, <note place="margin">E</note> if they do them, they break the Law which forbids the doing them in any other place but at the Temple at <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> And this I am apt to think, was one of the greatest grounds among them after the destruction of the Temple of their

setting up traditions above the written Law; for finding <note place="margin">A</note> it impossible to keep the written Law, if they could gain to themselves the Authority of interpreting it, they were not much concerned for the Law it self. And this is one of the strongest holds of their infidelity at this day. For otherwise we might in reason have thought, that their infidelity would have been buried in the ashes of their Temple; when they had such plain predictions that the <hi>Messias was to come during the second Temple,</hi> that the prediction of Christ concerning the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this Temple was so exactly fulfilled, that all attemps for the rebuilding of it were vain and fruitless. Of all which <note place="margin">B</note> none promissed so fair as that in <hi>Iulians</hi> time, who out of spight to the Christians, and particularly with a design to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the prophecy of our Saviour gave all encouragement to the <hi>Iews</hi> to build it, he provided at his own charge all mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for it, and gave command to the Governour of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to take particular care in it; and the Jews with great joy and readiness set about it; but when they began to search the ground in order to the laying the Foundations, the earth round about trembles with a horrible earthquake, and the flames of a sudden break out, which not only consumed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakers <note place="margin">C</note> but a great multitude of spectators, and the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials prepared for the building: In so much that an universal astonishment seized upon them, and the rest had rather leave their work, than be consumed by it.

And what a strange difference do we now find in the building of a third and a second Temple? In the former, though they met with many troubles and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet God carried them through all and prospered their endeavours with great success. Now they had all humane en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements <note place="margin">E</note> and God only opposes them, and makes them desist with the loss of their workmen and materials, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual dishonour to themselves, for attempting to fight against God in building him a Temple against his will. From which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97974:86"/>
we see that in all the senses the Jews understood <hi>the Kingdom</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A</note> 
                     <hi>of God,</hi> it was remarkably taken from them within so many years after Christ the true Passover was slain by them, as had passed from their first Passover after their going out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> to their entrance into <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The difficulty will be far less and the concernment not so great as to the Jews, to prove that the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> in the sense our Saviour meant it for <hi>the Power of the Gospel,</hi> was taken from them. For the event it self is a clear proof of it. In stead of that therefore I shall now prove that this taking away the Kingdom of God from them, was the effect of their sin in crucifying <note place="margin">B</note> Christ. <hi>Therefore I say &amp;c.</hi> To make this clear I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by these following steps.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is acknowledged by the Jews themselves that these great calamities have happened to them for some extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary sins. For to these they impute the destruction of the City and Temple, their oppressions and miseries ever since, and the deferring the coming of the <hi>Messias.</hi> For some of them have confessed <note n="a" place="margin">Tit. Sanhed. c. 11. sect. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>that all the terms prefixed for the coming of the</hi> Messias <hi>are past long ago</hi> but that God provoked by their great sins hath thus long deferred his appearance, and suffered <note place="margin">C</note> them in the mean while to lye under such great calamities.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The sin ought to be looked on as so much greater by how much heavier and longer this punishment hath been, than any inflicted upon them before. For if God did in former cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities punish them for their sins, when they were brought back again into their own land after 70. years; we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that this is a sin of a higher nature which hath not been expiated by 1600. years captivity and dispersion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Jews have not suffered these calamities for the same sins for which they suffered before. For then God charged <note place="margin">D</note> them with Idolatry as the great provoking sin; and it is very observable that the Jews were never freer from the suspicion of this sin than under the second Temple, and particularly near their destruction. They generally pretended a mighty zeal for their Law, and especially opposed the least tendency to Idolatry; in so much that they would not suffer the <hi>Roman</hi> Ensigns to be advanced among them because of the Images that were upon them; and all the History of that time tells us of the frequent contests they had with the <hi>Roman</hi> Governours about these things: and ever since that time they have been perfect haters <note place="margin">E</note> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and none of the least hindrances of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing Christianity hath been the infinite scandal which hath been given them by the <hi>Roman Church</hi> in that particular.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It must be some sin, which their Fathers committed and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:97974:87"/>
continues yet unrepented of by them to this day. Their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">A</note> committing it, was the meritorious cause of the first pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, their Children not repenting of it, is the cause why that judgement lies still so heavy upon them. And now what sin can we imagine this to be, but putting to death the true <hi>Messias;</hi> which they will acknowledge themselves to be a sin that deserves all the miseries they have undergone; and it is apparent that in all this long captivity they never have had the heart to repent of the sin of crucifying Christ, other sins they confess and say they heartily repent of, but why then hath not God accepted of their repentance and brought them back into <note place="margin">B</note> their own Land; according to the promises he long since made unto their Fathers? Which is a certain argument it is some sin as yet unrepented of by them which continues them under all their sufferings; and what can this be but that horrid sin of putting to death the son of God, with that dreadful imprecation which to this day hath its force upon them <hi>His blood be upon us and our Children?</hi> and this sin they are so far from repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of, that they still justify their Fathers in what they did, and Blaspheme Christ to this day in their prayers, where they think they may do it with safety. And to all this we may add <note place="margin">C</note> that the ensuing calamities were exactly soretold by that Christ whom they crucified, and if no other argument would convince them that he was at least a Prophet, yet the punctual accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of all his predictions ought to do it: as will appear by comparing <note n="a" place="margin">Matt. 24. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. With the series of the story. And it is observable that the very place where our Saviour foretold these things <hi>viz. the Mount of Olives,</hi> was the first wherein the <hi>Roman</hi> Army encamped before <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> And as they had crucified the Son of God, and put the Lord of glory to open shame, mocking and deriding him in his sufferings; so when the <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <hi>Romans</hi> came to revenge his quarrel upon them, they took the captive Jews and crucified them openly in the view of the City, 500. oft-times in a day, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>in different forms for sport sake as</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Ioseph. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us who was then in the <hi>Roman</hi> camp; and withal adds, their numbers were so great that these was no room left for the crosses to stand, or wood enough to make crosses of. And they who had bought the blood of the Son of God for 30. pieces of silver had this sin of theirs severely punished, when such multitudes of the Jews (2000 in one night) had their bowels ript up by the <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers in hopes to have found the gold and silver there, which they were supposed to have swallowed. And what greater argument can we have to believe that such judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fell upon them upon the account of their sin in crucifying
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:97974:87"/>
Christ, than that they were so punctually foretold so long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">A</note> and had all things so exactly answering in the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of them? For when Christ spake those things the Jews thought their destruction as incredible as that he was the <hi>Messias;</hi> but what greater evidence could there be to them that he was so, than that God did so severely avenge his blood upon them, and continues to do it for their unbelief and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency to this very day.</p>
                  <p>But it may be some will say, <hi>what are all these things to us, we are none of those who crucified Christ or justify the doing it; Thanks be to God, the Kingdom of God is not taken from us,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">B</note> 
                     <hi>but we enjoy what was taken from them.</hi> To which I answer. If we really were what we pretend to be, these things are of great consequence to be considered by us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For is it nothing to us to have so great an argument of the truth of our Religion, as the sufferings of the Jews to this day is for the sin of crucifying Christ? As often as we think of them we ought to consider the danger of infidelity, and the heavy judgements which that brings upon a people. We may take some estimate of the wrath of God against that sin, by the desolation of the Country, and the miseries of the inhabitants <note place="margin">C</note> of it. When you think it a small sin to despise the Son of God, to revile his doctrine, and reproach his miracles, consider then what the Jews have suffered for these sins. As long as they continue a people in the world, they are the living monuments of the Vengeance of God upon an incorrigible and unbelieving nation. And it may be one of the ends of Gods dispersing them almost among all nations, that as often as they see and despise them, they may have a care of those sins which have made them a byword and reproach among men, who once were a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beloved of God and feared by men. See what it is to <note place="margin">D</note> despise the offers of grace, to reproach and ill use the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers of it who have no other errand but to perswade men to accept that Grace and bring forth the fruits thereof. See what it is for men to be slaves to their own lusts, which makes them not only neglect their own truest interest but that of their nation too. If that had not been the fundamental mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage of the rulers of the Jewish nation at the time of our Saviour, they would most readily have entertained him and saved their land from ruine. See what it is for a people to be high in conceit of themselves and to presume upon Gods favour <note place="margin">E</note> towards them. For there never was a nation more self opinionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as to their wisdom, goodness, and interest with God than the Jews were when they began their war: and the confidence of this made them think it long till they had destroyed themselves.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97974:88"/>
See what it is to be once engaged too far in a bad cause, <note place="margin">A</note> how hard it is though they suffer never so much for it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, for them to repent of it. We might have thought the Jews when they had seen the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> would have come off from their obstinacy; but how very few in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison from that time to this, have sincerely repented of the sins of their Fore-fathers in the death of Christ. See how hard a matter it is to conquer the prejudices of education, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the most unjust actions of those when we come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, whom from our infancy we had in veneration. For it is in great measure because they were their Ancestors, that <note place="margin">B</note> the Jews to this day are so hardly convinced they could be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of so soul a sin as crucifying the <hi>Messias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Is it nothing to us what they have suffered, who enjoy the greatest blessings we have, by their means, and upon the same terms which they did. For <hi>to them at first were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Oracles of God,</hi> we enjoy all the excellent and sacred records of ancient times from them, all the prophecies of the men whom God raised up and inspired from time to time among them. By their means we converse with those great persons, <hi>Moses, David, Solomon</hi> and others, and understand their <note place="margin">C</note> wisdom and piety by the writings which at this day we enjoy. By them we have conveyed to us, all the particular prophesies which relate to the <hi>Messias,</hi> which point out the Tribe, the place, the time, the very person he was to be born of. By their means we are able to consute their infidelity, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm our own faith. Therefore we have some common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment with them, and ought on that account to be sensible of their miseries. Is it nothing then to you that God hath dealt so severely with them, from whom you derive so great a part of your Religion? But if that be nothing, consider the <note place="margin">D</note> terms upon which you enjoy these mercies you have; and they are as the latter clause of the text assures us, no other <hi>than the bringing forth the fruits thereof.</hi> If we prove as obstinate and incorrigible as they, God may justly punish us, as he hath done them. It is but a <hi>Vineyard</hi> that God lets us, it is no <hi>inheritance;</hi> God expects our improvement and giving him the fruits of it, or else he may justly take it away from us and give it to other Husbandmen. Let us never flatter our selves in thinking it impossible God should make us as miserable and contemptible a people as he hath done the Jews; but we may <note place="margin">E</note> be miserable enough and yet fall short of them. Have we any such promises of his favour as they had? how great were their priviledges while they stood in favour with God above all other nations in world? <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 9. 4, 5.</note> But we see, though they were the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97974:88"/>
first and the <hi>natural branches, they are broken off by unbelief,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A</note> 
                     <hi>and we stand by faith.</hi> Nothing then can be more reasonable than the exhortation of the Apostle, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 11. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>be not high minded but fear.</hi> Boast not of your present priviledges; despise not those who are broken of, for consider, <hi>if God spared not the natural branches, we ought to take heed, lest he also spare</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">V. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>not us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is it nothing to us what the Jews suffer, since our sins are in some senses more aggravated than theirs were? For though there can be no just excuse made for their wilful blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yet there may be much less made for ours. For what <note place="margin">B</note> they did against him was when he appeared in the weakness of humane flesh, in a very mean and low condition, before the great confirmation of our faith, by his resurrection from the dead; But our contempt of Christ is much more unpardonable, not only after that, but the miraculous consequences of it, and the spreading and continuance of his doctrine in the world, after the multitudes of Martyrs and the glorious. Triumphs of our Religion over all the attempts of the persecutors and betrayers of it; after the solemn vows of our Baptism in his name, and frequent addresses to God by him, and celebrating the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory <note place="margin">C</note> of his death and passion. What can be more mean, and ungrateful, what can shew more folly and weakness than after all these to esteem the blood of Christ no otherwise than as of a common malefactor, or at least to live as if we so esteemed it? Nay we may add to all this, after so severe an instance of Gods vengeance already upon the Jews; which ought to increase our care, and will therefore aggravate our sin. What the Jews did they did as open and professed enemies, what we do we do as false and perfidious friends, and let any man judge which is the greater crime, to assault an enemy, or to betray a <note place="margin">D</note> Friend.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Can this be nothing to us who have so many of those <hi>Symptoms</hi> upon us which were the fore-runners of their desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Not as though I came hither like the son of <hi>Anani</hi> in the Jewish story, who of a sudden, 4. years before the war, cryed out in the Temple, <hi>a voice from the East, a voice from the West, a voice from the 4.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:97974:89"/>
they may end in. There were these following remarkable fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners <note place="margin">A</note> of desolation in the Jewish state, I am afraid we are too much concerned in.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A strange degeneracy of all sorts of men from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of their Ancestors. This <hi>Iosephus</hi> often mentions and complains of and that there was no sort of men free; from the highest to the meanest, they had all degenerated not only from what they ought to be, but from what their Ancestors were. And there can be nothing which bodes worse to a people than this doth; for the decay of vertue is really the loss of strength and interest. And if this be not among us at this day in one <note place="margin">B</note> sense, it must be in another, or else there would never be such general complaints of it as there are. It is hard to say that there hath ever been an Age, wherein vice, such as the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens abhorred, hath been more confident and daring than in this; wherein so many have not barely left vertue, but have bid defiance to it; and are ashamed of their Baptism for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much as because therein they renounced the Devil and all his works; These are the <hi>Zealots</hi> in wickedness as the Jews were in faction. The flaming sword, the voice in the Temple, the terrible Earthquakes, were not greater Prodigies in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">C</note> among them, than men are in Morality among us, nor sadder presages of future miseries.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A general stupidity and inapprehensiveness of common danger: every one had a mighty zeal for his little party and faction he was engaged in, and would venture his life for that, never considering that by this means there was no more left to do, for the <hi>Romans,</hi> but to stand by and see them destroy one another. I pray God that may be never said of the <hi>Romans</hi> in another sense concerning this Church of ours. We cannot but be sensible how much they are pleased at our divisions and <note place="margin">D</note> they have always hay and stubble enough, not only to build with, but thereby to add fuel to our flames. How happy should we be if we could once lay aside our petty animosities and all mind the true interest of our Church and the security of the Protestant Religion by it, which ought to be dearer to to us than our lives! But that is our misery, that our divisions in Religion have made us not more contemptible, than ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to forrain nations, and it puzleth the wisest among our selves to find out expedients to keep us from ruining one of the best Churches of the Christian world. <note place="margin">E</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. An Atheistical contempt of Religion: for <hi>Iosephus</hi> who was apt enough to flatter his Country-men; tells us there never was <note n="a" place="margin">L. 5. c. 16.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a more Atheistical Generation of men than at that time, <hi>the leaders of the factions</hi> were; for
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:97974:89"/>
they contemned the Laws of men and mocked at the Laws of <note place="margin">A</note> of God; <note n="a" place="margin">L. 5. c. 2. P. 887.</note> and derided the Prophetick Oracles as fabulous impostures: they would allow no difference of sacred and prophane, for they would drink the wine of the sacrifices promiscuously, and anoint their heads commonly with the sacred oyl; in a word they owned no distinction of good and evil, <note n="b" place="margin">P. 986.</note> but thought the greatest wickedness to be good to them. To say there is such a Generation of men among us, is to foretel our ruine more certainly than Comets and the most dreadful presages do: For this is a sort of madness which seldom seizes upon a people, but when they are past cure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">B</note> are near their end.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Spiritual pride. This was very remarkable in <hi>the people</hi> of the Jews, in a time when they had as little reason for it, as any people in the world. They still looked on themselves as Gods chosen and peculiar people, his darlings and his delight, and thought that Gods honour and interest in the world were mightily concerned in their preservation. If they should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, they could not imagine what God would do for a people to serve him; for all but themselves they looked on with a very scornful pity, and thought that God hated them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">C</note> they did. They had the purity of his ordinances, in his house of prayer; and the society of the faithful among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: whereas all others they thought, served God only with their own inventions, or placed their Religion in dull morality. They were the people who maintained his cause, and ventured their lives and estates for it, and therefore God was bound in faithfulness to defend them, and he must deny himself if he did destroy them. It seems strange to us, that a people rejected by God for their horrible Hypocrisie, should claim such an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in him, when they were marked out for destruction by him; <note place="margin">D</note> but such is the bewitching nature of spiritual pride and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, that it infatuates the minds of men to their ruin; and flatters them with their interest in the Promises, till God makes good his threatenings and destroys them. Never any people thought they had a richer stock of promises to live on than they; <hi>ancient promises,</hi> to <hi>Abraham Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob, full promises,</hi> of favour, protection, and deliverance from enemies; <hi>particular promises</hi> made to them and to no other people in the world. Besides these, they had mighty <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences</hi> of Gods kindness towards them, <hi>undoubted experiences,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">E</note> not depending on the deceitful workings of fancy; but seen in very strange and wonderful deliverances; <hi>frequent experiences,</hi> throughout the whole History of their nation: and <hi>peculiar experiences</hi> being such vouchsafements to them, which God
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:97974:90"/>
communicated to none but his chosen people. Add to these, <note place="margin">A</note> that they had at this time a wonderful zeal for the true worship of God as they thought; they regarded no persecution or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, but thought it their glory and honour to sacrifice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the cause of God and his people. And yet all this while, God was the greatest enemy they had; and all their pretences signified nothing to him who saw their unsusserable pride and loathsome Hypocrisie through those thin vails they had drawn over them, to deceive the less observing sort of men by. Other sins that are open and publick God preserves the Authority of his Laws by punishing of them, but these <note place="margin">B</note> spiritual sins of pride and Hypocrisie, he not only vindicates his Authority over the consciences of men, but the infiniteness, of his wisdom and knowledge in their discovery, and his love to Integrity and inward holiness in the punishment of them. And therefore these sins are more especially odious to God as incroaching upon his highest and most peculiar attributes; thence he is said <hi>to resist the proud,</hi> as though he made an attempt upon God himself; and he loaths the Hypocrite in heart, as one that mocks God as well as deceives men. The first ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the destruction of this nation of the Jews was the <note place="margin">C</note> prevalency of the Pharisaical temper among them, which was a compound of pride and Hypocrisie; and when the field was over-run with these tares, it was then time for God to put in his sickle and cut them down. God forbid, that our Church and the Protestant Religion in it should be in danger of destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, for that would be a judgement beyond fire and sword and plague, and any thing we have yet smarted by; that would be the taking away <hi>the Kingdom of God from us,</hi> and setting up the <hi>Kingdom of darkness,</hi> that would be not only a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our own Age, but the heaviest curse next to renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <note place="margin">D</note> Christianity, we could entail upon posterity. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever though God in mercy may design better things for us, we cannot be sufficiently apprehensive of our danger, not so much from the business of our enemies, as those bad Symptoms we find among our selves. When there is such monstrous pride and ingratitude among many who pretend to a purer worship of God than is established by Law, as though there were little or no difference between the Government of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> and the bondage of <hi>Egypt.</hi> O <hi>England, England</hi> what will the Pride and unthankfulness of those who profess Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion <note place="margin">E</note> bring thee to! Will men still prefer their own reputation or the interest of a small party of Zealots, before the common concernments of our faith and Religion? <hi>O that we did know at least in this our day, the things that belong to our peace!</hi>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:97974:90"/>
but let it never be said <hi>that they are hid from our eyes.</hi> But if <note place="margin">A</note> our common enemy should enter in at the breaches we have made among our selves, then men may wish, they had sooner known the difference between the reasonable commands of our own Church, and the intolerable Tyranny of a forrain and usurped power: between the soft and gentle hands of a mother, and the Iron sinews of an Executioner; between the utmost rigour of our Laws, and the least of an Inquisition. If ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude were all, yet that were a sin high enough to provoke God to make our condition worse than it is, but to what a strange height of spiritual pride are those arrived, who ingross <note place="margin">B</note> all true god iness to themselves? as though it were not possible among us to go to heaven and to Church together. As though Christ had no Church for 1500. years and more, wherein not one person can be named who thought it unlawful to pray by a prescribed form. As though men could not love God and pray sincerely to him, that valued the peace and order of the Church above the heats and conceptions of their own brains. Where differences proceed meerly from ignorance and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, they are less dangerous to themselves or others: but where there is so much impatience of reproof, such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt <note place="margin">C</note> of superiours, such uncharitable censures of other men, such invincible prejudices and stiffeness of humour, such scorn and reproach cast upon the publick worship among us; What can such things spring from but a root of bitterness and spiritual pride? I speak not these things to widen our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences or increase our animosities they are too large and too great already, nor to condemn any humble and modest dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from us; but I despair ever to see our divisions healed, till Religion be brought from the Fancies to the hearts of men; and till men instead of mystical notions and unacccountable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, <note place="margin">D</note> in stead of mis-applying promises and misunderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the spirit of prayer, instead of judging of themselves by mistaken signs of Grace, set themselves to the practice of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, selfdenial, meekness, patience, charity, obedience and a holy life and look on these as the greatest duties and most distinguishing characters of true Christianity. And in doing of these there shall not only be a great reward in the life to come; but in spight of all opposition from Atheism, profaneness, or superstition, we may see our divisions cured and the Kingdom of God, which is a Kingdom of peace and holiness to abide and <note place="margin">E</note> flourish among us.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

                     <item>2. That they could not be the effects of an evil, but of a holy and divine spirit; and therefore that there was really such <hi>a pouring out of the spirit</hi> as is here mentioned.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. That the things attributed to the Apostles could not arise from any meerly natural causes. It is not my present business <note place="margin">E</note> to prove the truth of the matters of fact, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did those things which were accounted miracles by those who saw them or heard of them; and that on the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost they did speak with strange tongues; for these things are
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:97974:92"/>
so universally attested by the most competent witnesses <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A</note> persons of the same age whose testimony we can have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to suspect; and not only by those who were the friends to this Religion, but the greatest enemies Jews and Heathens; and by all the utmost endeavors of Atheistical men who have not set themselves to disprove the testimony, but the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it, (by saying that granting them true they do not infer the concurrence of a divine spirit) that on the same grounds any person would Question the truth of these things, he must question the truth of some other things, which himself believes on the same or weaker grounds than these are. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing <note place="margin">B</note> then the matters of fact to be true, we now enquire whether these things might proceed from any meerly natural causes, which will be the best done by examining the most plausible accounts which are pretended to be given of them. And thus some have had the confidence to say, <hi>that whatever is said to be done by the power of miracles in the Apostles might be effected by a natural temperament of body, or the great power of imagination; and that their speaking with strange tongues might be the effect only of a natural Enthusiasm, or some distemper of brain.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">C</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the power of miracles might be nothing but a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural temperament or the strength of imagination.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. An excellent natural temper of body they say may do strange and wonderful things, so that such a one who hath an exact temperament may walk upon the waters, stand in the air, and quench the violence of the fire; and by a strange kind of sanative contagion may communicate healthful spirits, as persons that are infected do noisom and pestilential. These are things spoken with as much ease and as little reason, as any of the calumnies against Religion, which are so boldly ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <note place="margin">D</note> by men who dare speak any thing as to these things but reason, and do any thing but what is good.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. But can these men after all their confidence produce any one person in the world, who by the exquisiteness of his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral temper hath ever walked upon the waters, or poised him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the air, or kept himself from being singed in the fire? If these things be natural how comes it to pass that no other instances can be given but such as we urge for miraculous? We say indeed that <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 14. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ walked on the Sea,</hi> but withal we say this was an argument of that divine power in him, <hi>which</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">E</note> as <hi>Iob</hi> saith, <note n="b" place="margin">Job. 9. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the Sea:</hi> We say that <note n="c" place="margin">2 Kings 2. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Elijah was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up into Heaven by a Chariot of fire and a whirlewind;</hi> but it was only by his power, <note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 104. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>who maketh the winds his

messengers, and flames of fire his Ministers,</hi> as some render <note place="margin">A</note> those words of the Psalmist: We say that the three Children were preserved <note n="a" place="margin">Dan. 3. 25, 26.</note> 
                     <hi>in the fiery fornace, that they had no hurt;</hi> and even <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was hereby convinced, that he was the <hi>true God,</hi> which was able to preserve his servants from the force of that devouring element which was therefore so much worshipped by those Eastern people because it destroyed not only the men but the Gods of other nations. But is this enough to satisfie any reasonable men that these things were done by natural causes; because they were done at all? For that is to suppose it impossible there should be miracles; which is to say <note place="margin">B</note> it is impossible there should he a God; which is an attempt somewhat beyond what the most impudent Atheists pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But in this case nothing can be reasonably urged but <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience</hi> to the contrary; if these were things which were usually done by other causes there would be no reason to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a miraculous power: but we say it is impossible that such things should be produced by meer natural causes, and in this case there can be no confutation but by contrary experience. As we see the opinion of the Ancients concerning the uninhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness of the the torrid Zone, and that there were no Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes, <note place="margin">C</note> are disproved by the manifest experience to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all modern discoverers. Let such plain experience be produced, and we shall then yield the possibility of the things by some natural causes, although not by such <hi>an exact tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of body,</hi> which is only an instance of the strong power of imagination in those who think so whatever that may have on others. Such a temperament of body as these persons imagine, considering the great inequality of the mixture of the earthy and aërial parts in us, being it may be as <hi>great a miracle</hi> it self, as any they would disprove by it. <note place="margin">D</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But supposing such a temperament of body to be possible, how comes it to be so beneficial to others, as to propagate its vertue to the cure of diseased persons? We may as well think that a great beauty may change a Black by osten viewing him, or a skilful Musitian make another so by sitting near him, as one man heal another because he is healthful himself. Unless we can suppose it in the power of a man to send forth the best spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his own body and transfuse them into the body of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but by this means that which must cure another must destroy himself. Besides the healthfulness of a person lies much <note place="margin">E</note> in the freedom of perspiration of all the noxious vapours to the body; by which it will appear incredible that a man should preserve his own health by sending out the worst vapors and at the same time cure another, by sending out the best.</p>

3. Supposing we should grant that a vigorous heat and a <note place="margin">A</note> strong arm may by a violent friction discuss some tumor of a distempered body; yet what would all this signifie to the mighty cures which were wrought so easily and with a word speaking and at such great distance as were by Christ and his Apostles? Supposing, our Saviour had the most exact natural temper that ever any person in the world had; yet what could this do to the cure of a person above twenty miles distance? for so our Saviour cured the Son of a Nobleman who lay sick at <hi>Capernaum,</hi> when himself was at <note n="a" place="margin">Joh 4. 46, 53.</note> 
                     <hi>Cana</hi> in <hi>Galilee?</hi> So at <note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 8. 6, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Capernaum</hi> he cured the Centurions servant at his own house without going thither. Thus we find the Apostles cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">B</note> though <note n="c" place="margin">Acts 5. 15. 19. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>they did not touch them;</hi> and that not one or two but multitudes of diseased persons. And nothing can be more absurd than to imagine that so many men should at the same time work so many miraculous cures by vertue of a temperament peculiar to themselves: for how come they only to happen to have this temperament and none of the Jews who had all equal advantages with them for it? Why did none of the enemies of Christ do as strange things as they did? How come they never to do it before they were <hi>Christians,</hi> nor in such an extraordinary manner till after the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost? <note place="margin">C</note> Did the being Christians alter their natural temper and infuse a <hi>sanative</hi> vertue into them which they never had before? Or rather was not their Christianity like to have spoyled it if ever they had it before; by their frequent watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, fastings, hunger and thirst, cold and nakedness, stripes and imprisonments, racks and torments? Are these the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of an excellent constitution? if they be, I doubt not but those who magnifie it in them, would rather want the vertue of it, than be at the pains to obtain it. <note place="margin">D</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But what a natural temper cannot do, they think <hi>the power of imagination</hi> may: and therefore in order to the ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the power of miracles, they mightily advance that of imagination: which is the <hi>Idol</hi> of those who are as little Friends to reason in it as they are to Religion. Any thing shall be able to effect that, which they will not allow God to do: nay the mostextravagant thing which belongs to humane nature shall have a greater power than the most holy and divine spirit. <hi>But do not we see,</hi> say they, <hi>strange effects of the power of imagination upon mankind?</hi> I grant we do, and in nothing <note place="margin">E</note> more than when men set it up against the power of God: yet surely we see far greater effects of that in the world than we do of the other. The power of imagination can never be supposed to give a being to the things we see in the world; but
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:97974:94"/>
we have the greatest reason to attribute that to a divine and <note place="margin">A</note> infinite power; and is it not far more rational that that which gave a Being to the course of nature should alter it when it pleaseth, than that which had nothing to do in the making of it. So that in general, there can be no competition between the power of God and the strength of imagination as to any extraordinary effects which happen in the world. But this is not all; for there is a repugnancy in the very nature of the thing that the power of imagination should do all those mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which were wrought by Christ or his Apostles. For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they must be wrought by the imagination of the Agent or <note place="margin">B</note> of the Patient: if of the Agent, then there can be no more necessary to do the same things than to have the same strength of imagination which they had; what is the reason then that never since or before that time were so many signs, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders wrought as there were then by the Apostles and Disciples of our Lord? If <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> cured the lame man by the strength of imagination; why have no persons ever since cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red those whose welfare they have as heartily desired as ever they could do his? Certainly if imagination could kill mens enemies, there would never need <hi>Duels</hi> to destroy them, nor <note place="margin">C</note> Authority to punish such as do it: and if it could cure Friends, there would need no Physitians to heal and recover them and death would have nothing to do, but with persons that were wholly Friendless. If they say, <hi>that persons are not sufficiently perswaded of their own power; and therefore they do see lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good;</hi> let any of those who contend the most for it attempt the cure when they please of any the most common infirmity of mankind; and if they cannot do that, let them then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us they can do miracles by that, which they cannot cure the tooth-ach by. But here they will say, <hi>the imagination</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <hi>of the Patient is necessary in order to a miracle being wrought upon him:</hi> not such I am sure as Christ and his Apostles wrought, who not only healed the lame and the blind, but <hi>raised the dead;</hi> and what power of imagination do they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he had lain four days in the Grave? and however they think of the soul they must in this case allow this power of imagination to be <hi>immortal.</hi> So that were there no other arguments but that of raising the dead that demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates it impossible that what Christ or his Apostles did, did depend on the strength of Fancy in those on whom they wrought <note place="margin">E</note> their miracles.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But,</hi> say they, <hi>did not Christ and his Apostles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire believing first in all persons that had miracles wrought upon them; and why should this be, but because the strength of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:97974:94"/>
imagination was required to it. And is it not expresly said,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A</note> 
                     <hi>that Christ could not do any mighty works among his own country men because of their unbelief; by which it appears that the efficacy of his miracles did depend on the faith of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi> To which I answer,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That Christ did not always require faith in the person on whom he wrought his miracles; for then it had been impossible he should ever have raised any from the dead; which we are sure he did. And did not <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 10. 9, 12.</note> St. <hi>Paul</hi> raise <hi>Eu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ychus</hi> from the dead? and can any think so absurdly as that faith was required from a dead man in order to his resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <note place="margin">B</note> So that the greatest miracles of all others were wrought, where there was no possibility of believing in those on whom they were wrought.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When in miraculous cures believing was required it was to shew for what end those miracles were wrought, <hi>viz.</hi> to confirm the Doctrine of the Gospel by them: they did not work miracles to be admired by the people as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would have done; the Apostles had no such intolerable vanity to be cried up for <hi>Gods,</hi> though they did such great things; not like that <hi>Caesar</hi> of the <hi>Atheists</hi> as some call him, who concludes <note place="margin">C</note> one of his <note n="b" place="margin">Dialog. 54. Doemoniacis.</note> 
                     <hi>Dialogues</hi> with that horrible piece of vanity (to say no more of it) <hi>aut Deus es aut Vaninus,</hi> and <hi>Pompona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his Master before him had said <note n="c" place="margin">Pomponat. de Incantat. c. 4. p. 53.</note> 
                     <hi>Philosophi sunt Dii ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restres,</hi> (and you must be sure to reckon him in the number;) but how was it possible for these men to discover more their mean thoughts of a Deity than by making him to be as despicable as themselves? What boasting and ostentation would these men have made of themselves, if they could have done but the thousand part of what the Apostles did? But they were men did as far excel all such in all true vertue and real <note place="margin">D</note> excellency as they did in that miraclous power which God had given them. If they required men to believe whom they cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it was that they might cure both body and soul together: but sometimes they cured persons whom they saw not: as the <note n="d" place="margin">Acts 19. 11, 12.</note> 
                     <hi>hankerchiefs</hi> from St. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Ephesus</hi> cured the diseased when they were carried to them. But generally they took all opportunities to convey the Doctrine of Christianity into the minds of those, out of whose bodies they cast either diseases or Devils. <hi>But is it not said that Christ could do no mighty works among them because of their unbelief, and the power of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <hi>his disciples could not be greater than his own?</hi> To which I answer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is no where said in the Scripture that Christ could do no miracles at all among them because of their unbelief: for in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:97974:95"/>
one place it is said, <note n="a" place="margin">Mark 13. 58.</note> 
                     <hi>And he did not many mighty works</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A</note> 
                     <hi>there because of their unbelief.</hi> He did miracles enough to convince them; but when he saw their obstinacy, he would not cast away any more upon them. And in that other place where it is said, <note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 6. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>that he could there do no mighty work,</hi> it is presently added, <hi>save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them.</hi> And what absurdity is there that Christ should do no extraordinary miracle among them, among whom he saw that himself and his miracles were both equally contemned. It is not the method of divine goodness to bestow the largest kindnesses at first; those who improve the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings <note place="margin">B</note> of savour shall have more, but those who despise the first may justly be rejected from any farther kindness.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When it is said <hi>that he could not,</hi> that expression doth not imply any impossibility in the thing but a deliberate resolution to the contrary, so it is used Acts 4. 20. <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 4 20.</note> 
                     <hi>For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</hi> Who questions but there was a possibility in the thing, that they might have held their peace? but it was a thing which upon great deliberation they had resolved not to do. So <note n="d" place="margin">Revel. 2. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>thou canst not bear them which are evil;</hi> and <note n="e" place="margin">2 Cor. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>we can do</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">C</note> 
                     <hi>nothing against the truth; but for the truth.</hi> From which it appears that this can be no prejudice to the power of Christ in working miracles, but only shews his just resolution not to do it, considering the contempt wherewith he had been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained among them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is pretended by those men who set themselves to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue those miraculous gifts which the Apostles had, <hi>that the gift of tongues might be only the effect of an Enthusiastick heat, or some distemper of their brains, as men in a high Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are apt to speak such things and words, which while they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <hi>are in health they could never do.</hi> But that such unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imaginations do more argue a distempered brain, than any thing we assert concerning these divine persons will easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from these considerations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That no violent heat whatsoever can form a new lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to a man which he never knew before. If language had been natural to man there might have been some reason for it; but that we all know to be an arbitrary thing: and as well might a blind man paint with an exact difference of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, or one write plainly who could never read, as any <note place="margin">E</note> person by the meer heat of his Phancy speak suddenly in a tongue which he never learnt. There have been some who have said <note n="f" place="margin">Vania. Dial. 54. p. 407.</note> 
                     <hi>that the mind of man hath naturally all kinds of languages within it self, and it wants nothing but some
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97974:95"/>
mighty heat to stir men up to speak in any kind of them.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A</note> But we are to take notice that those things are accounted <hi>wit</hi> when spoken against Religion, which would have been <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense</hi> and <hi>contradictions</hi> if spoken for it. And certainly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more absurdly said, than for the same men to make all the imaginations we have of things to come in by our senses, and yet to say that the mind of man can have those things in it, which he never learnt or heard. If this supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were true we might invert that saying of <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 26. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Festus</hi> to St. <hi>Paul much learning hath made thee mad;</hi> for then <hi>madness</hi> or that which is the next to it, <hi>a great heat of brain,</hi> would <note place="margin">B</note> make men the most <hi>learned.</hi> If this were true, there would be a much easier way of attaining to speak in the languages of all nations than that which many take to gain a very few of them: for the heightening of Phancy either by Wine, or a degree of madness would inspire men with skill in tongues to a miracle.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But supposing such a thing possible, which is far from being so, yet it is very remote from our present case; for the Apostles made it manifest to all persons that they were far enough from being inspired with the vapours of wine or touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">C</note> with any Enthusiastick madness. They spake with strange tongues, but in such a manner as convinced great numbers of their hearers of the excellency of that doctrine which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by them. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> answered <hi>Festus,</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Act. 26. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>I am not mad most noble</hi> Festus, <hi>but speak forth the words of truth and soberness;</hi> so they did not speak incoherent and insignificant words which madness makes men do, nor any mean and trivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things, meerly for ostentation of their gifts, but they spake though with divers tongues, <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 2. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>the great or wonderful things of God:</hi> So their auditors confessed with admiration. <note place="margin">D</note> These are not the effects of Wine or Madness as St. <hi>Peter</hi> at large proves, against the unreasonable cavils of some <note n="d" place="margin">V. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>who mocked and said they were full of new wine.</hi> Which he doth with so great success that the same day 3000 persons disown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">V. 41.</note> their former course of life and embraced Christianity. Surely, madness was never more infectious, never made men more wise and sober, than this did, if the Apostles were acted only by that. When was there ever better and more weighty sense spoken by any, than by the Apostles after the day of <hi>Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost?</hi> With what reason do they argue, with what strength <note place="margin">E</note> do they discourse, with what a sedate and manly courage do they withstand the opposition of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> against them? they never fly out into any extravagant passion, never betray any weakness or fear: but speak the truth with boldness and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:97974:96"/>
rejoyce when they suffer for it. It could be no sudden heat which acted them on the day of Pentecost, for the same Spirit <note place="margin">A</note> and power continued with them afterwards: they lived and acted by vertue of it, so that their life was as great a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, as any that was wrought by them. Their zeal was great but regular, their devotion servent and constant, their conversation honest and prudent, their discourses in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming and convincing, and the whole course of their lives breathed nothing but glory to God, and good will towards men. If they are called to suffer for their Religion, with what constancy do they own the truth, with what submission do they <note place="margin">B</note> yield to their persecutors, with what meekness and patience do they bear their sufferings! If differences arise among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, with what care do they advise, with what caution do they direct, with what gentleness do they instruct, with what tenderness do they bear with diffenters, with what earnestness do they endeavour to preserve the peace of the Christian Church! when they are to plant Churches, how ready to go about it, how diligent in attending it, how watchful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all miscarriages among them! When they write Epistles to those already planted, with what Authority do they teach, <note place="margin">C</note> with what Majesty do they command, with what severity do they rebuke, with what pity do they chastise, with what vehemency do they exhort, and with what weighty arguments do they perswade all Christians to adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things! So that such persons who after all these things can believe that the Apostles were acted only by some extravagant heats may as easily perswade themselves that men may be drunk with sobriety, and mad with reason, and debauched with goodness. But such are fit only to be treated in a dark room, if any can be found darker than their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings <note place="margin">D</note> are.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But yet there may be imagined a higher sort of madness than these men are guilty of. <hi>viz.</hi> That when men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that these things could not be done by meer Mechanical causes, then they attribute them to the assistance of Spirits, but not to the holy and divine, but such as are evil and impure. A madness so great and extravagant, that we could hardly imagine that it were incident to humane nature, unless the Scripture had told us that some had thus blasphemed the son of man, and either had or were in danger of blaspheming the <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> too. And this is properly <hi>blaspheming the Holy Ghost,</hi> (which was not given, as our text tells us, till after Christs ascension) when men attribute all those miraculous gifts which were poured out upon the Apostles in confirmation
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:97974:96"/>
of the Christian doctrine to the power of an unclean Spirit. <note place="margin">A</note> For so the Evangelist St. <hi>Luke,</hi> when he mentions the <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 12. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy against the Holy Ghost which shall not be forgiven</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately subjoyns; <hi>their bringing the Apostles to the Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues and Magistrates and Powers;</hi> and adds, <hi>that the Holy Ghost,</hi> (even that which they so blasphemed in them) <hi>should teach them in that same hour what they ought to say.</hi> I deny not but the attributing the miraculous works of Christ who had the Holy Spirit without measure, to an evil Spirit was the same kind of sin; but it received a greater aggravation after the resurrection of Christ from the dead, and the miraculous <note place="margin">B</note> effusion of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles. For now the great confirmation was given to the truth of all that Christ had said before; he had some times concealed his miracles and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the publishing of them: and to such he appeared but as the son of man, of whom it is said <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>that had they known him they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory:</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> more expresly; <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 3. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>and now Brethren I wote that through ignorance you did it as did also your Rulers.</hi> But now since his resurrection and ascension when God by the effusion of the Holy Ghost hath given the largest and fullest Testimony to the <note place="margin">C</note> doctrine of the Gospel; if men after all this shall go on <hi>to blaspheme the Holy Ghost,</hi> by attributing all these miracles to a Diabolical power, then there is no forgiveness to be expected either in this world, or the world to come, Because this argues the greatest obstinacy of mind, the highest contempt of God, and the greatest affront that can be put upon the Testimony of the holy Spirit; for it is charging the Spirit of truth to be an evil and a lying Spirit. By which we see what great weight and moment the Scripture lays upon this pouring out of the Holy Ghost on the Apostles, and what care men ought to <note place="margin">D</note> have how they undervalue and despise it, and much more how they do reproach and blaspheme it. They might as well imagine that light and darkness may meet and embrace each other, as that the infernal Spirits should imploy their power in promoting a doctrine so contrary to their interest? For Heaven and Hell cannot be more distant, than the whole design of Christianity is from all the contrivances of wicked Spirits. How soon was the Devil's Kingdom broken, his Temples demolished, his oracles silenced, himself baffled in his great design of deceiving mankind when Christianity prevailed in the <note place="margin">E</note> world? Having thus far asserted the truth of the thing <hi>viz.</hi> that there was such an effusion of the Holy Spirit, now come to consider.</p>

The plentifulness of this effusion of the Spirit; there had been some drops, as it were, of this Spirit which had fallen upon some of the Jewish nation before; but those were no more to be compared with these <hi>rivers of waters,</hi> than the waters of <hi>Siloam</hi> which run softly, with the mighty River <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> What was the <hi>Spirit</hi> which <hi>Bezaleel</hi> had to build the <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 31. 3.</note> Tabernacle with, if compared with that Spirit which the <note place="margin">B</note> Apostles were inspired with for <hi>building</hi> up the Church of God? what was that <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 28 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Wisdom</hi> which some were filled with to make garments for <hi>Aaron,</hi> if compared with that Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation which led the Apostles into the knowledge of all Truth? What was that <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Courage</hi> which was given to the <hi>Iudges</hi> of old, if compared with that <hi>Spirit</hi> which did <hi>convince the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgement?</hi> What was that <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> which was communicated to the 70. elders, if compared with that Spirit of his son, which God hath shed abroad in the hearts of his <note place="margin">C</note> people? What was that <hi>Spirit</hi> of prophesie, which inspired some <hi>Prophets</hi> in several ages, with that <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 2. 16, 17.</note> 
                     <hi>pouring out of the Spirit upon all flesh;</hi> which the Apostle tells us was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished on the day of <hi>Pentecost?</hi> But these <hi>Rivers</hi> of <hi>Waters</hi> though they began their course at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> upon that day, yet they soon overflowed the Christian Church in other parts of the world. The sound of that rushing mighty wind was soon heard in the most distant places: and the fiery tongues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slamed the hearts of many who never saw them. These gifts being propagated into other Churches, and many other tongues <note place="margin">D</note> were kindled from them as we see how much this gift of tongues obtained in the Church of <hi>Corinth:</hi> And so in the History of the Acts of the Apostles, we find after this day how the Holy Ghost fell upon them which believed, and what mighty signs and wonders were done by them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The benefit and usefulness of this effusion of the Spirit; like <hi>the Rivers</hi> of <hi>Waters</hi> that both refresh and enrich, and thereby make glad the City of God. The coming down of the Spirit was like <note n="d" place="margin">Isa. 44. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>the pouring water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <hi>the Rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; that the poor and needy who seek water might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed, and they whose tongues failed for thirst might satisfy themselves with living water.</hi> These are some of the lofty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97974:97"/>
whereby the <hi>Courtly Prophet Isaiah</hi> sets forth the great <note place="margin">A</note> promise of the spirit; none better befitting the mighty advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages the Church of God hath ever since enjoyed by the pouring out of the spirit than these. For the fountain was opened in the Apostles, but the streams of those Rivers of living water have run down to our Age: not confined within the banks of <hi>Tiber,</hi> nor mixing with the impure waters of it; but preserved pure and unmixed in that sacred doctrine contained in the Holy Scripture. Within those bounds we confine our faith, and are not moved by the vain discourses of any who pretend to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a new Fountain head to these waters at <hi>Rome;</hi> and <note place="margin">B</note> would make it impossible for them to come down to us through any other Channel but theirs. But supposing they had come to us through them, have they thereby gotten the sole disposal of them, that none shall tast but what and how much they please? and must we needs drink down the filth and mud of their Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel too? As long as they suffer us to do what Christ hath commanded us to do, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">John7. 37. Revel. 22. 17.</note> to take of these waters of life freely we do our own duty and quarrel not with them. But if they go about to stop the passage of them, or adulterate them with some forrain mixture, or strive with us as the Herdsmen of <note place="margin">C</note> 
                     <hi>Gerar</hi> did with <hi>Isaac</hi>'s Herdsmen saying the <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 26. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Water is ours,</hi> then if the name of the well be <hi>Esek,</hi> if contentions do arise, the blame is not ours; we assert but our own just right against all their encroachments. For as <hi>Isaac</hi> pleaded <note n="c" place="margin">V. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>that he only digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of</hi> Abraham <hi>his Father,</hi> and although <hi>the Philistins</hi> had stopped them after the death of <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet that could be no hindrance to his right, but he might open them again, and call their names after the names by which his Father had called them. So that is the substance of our Plea, we pretend <note place="margin">D</note> to nothing but to clear the passage which they have stopped up and was left free and open for us in the time of the Apostles and Fathers; we desire not to be imposed upon by their later usurpations: we plead for no more but that the Church of God may have the same purity and integrity which it had in the primitive times, and that things may not only be called by the names by which the Fathers have called them; but that they may be such as the Fathers have left them. But otherwise let them boast never so much of the largeness of their stream, of the Antiquitity of their Channel, of the holiness of their waters, <note place="margin">E</note> of the number of their Ports and the riches of their trading; nay and let them call their stream by the name of the <hi>Ocean</hi> too (if they please), yet we envy them not their <hi>Adma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> and <hi>Pharpar</hi> and all the Rivers of <hi>Damascus,</hi> so we may sit down quietly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:97974:98"/>
by these living waters of <hi>Iordan.</hi> We are contented with the <note place="margin">A</note> miracles which the Apostles wrought without forging or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving new ones; we are satisfied with the gift of strange tongues which they had, we know no necessity now of <hi>speaking</hi> much less of <hi>praying</hi> in an <hi>unknown tongue:</hi> we believe that Spirit infallible which inspired the Apostles in their holy writtings and those we acknowledge, embrace and I hope are willing to dye for: But if any upstart Spirit pretend to sit in an infallible chair, we desire not to be brought under bondage to it, till we see the same miracles wrought by vertue of it, which were wrought by the Apostles to attest their infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. <note place="margin">B</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The last thing to be spoken to, is, <hi>the season</hi> that this effusion of the Spirit was reserved for, which was after the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ascension of Christ to Heaven. This was reserved as the great <hi>Donative</hi> after his Triumph over Principalities and Powers, when he was ascended up on high he sends down the greatest gift that ever was bestowed upon mankind <hi>viz.</hi> this gift of his Holy Spirit. Hereby Christ discovered the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his purchase, the height of his Glory, the exercise of his Power, the assurance of his Resurrection and Ascension: <note place="margin">C</note> and the care he took of his Church and People; by letting them see that he made good his last promise to them of sending them another Comforter who should be with them to assist them in all their undertakings, to direct them in their doubts, to plead their cause for them against all the vain oppositions of men. And he should not continue with them for a little time as Christ had done, but he should abide with them for ever <hi>i. e.</hi> so as not to be taken from them as himself was, but should remain with them, as a pledge of his love, as a Testimony of his truth, as an earnest of Gods favour to them now, and their <note place="margin">D</note> future inheritance in heaven; for he should comfort them by his presence, guide them by his counsel, and at last bring them to glory.</p>
                  <p>Nothing now remains but that as the occasion of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing on this day doth so much exceed that of the Jews at their ceremony of <hi>pouring out the water;</hi> so our joy should as much exceed in the nature and kind of it the mirth and jollity which was then used by them. With what joy did the <hi>Israelites</hi> when they were almost burnt up with thirst in the wilderness cast of the pleasant streams which issued out of the <note place="margin">E</note> rock? <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>that rock</hi> saith the Apostle <hi>was Christ</hi> and the gifts of the Spirit are that stream of living water which flows from him, and shall not we express our thankfulness for so great and unvaluable a mercy? Our joy cannot be too great
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:97974:98"/>
for such a gift as this so it be of the nature of it <hi>i. e.</hi> a spiritual <note place="margin">A</note> joy. The Holy Ghost ought to be the Fountain of that joy which we express for Gods giving him to his Church. Let us not then affront that good Spirit, while we pretend to bless God for him let us not grieve him by our presumptuous sins, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist his motions in our hearts by our wilful continuance in them. The best way we can express our thankfulness is by yielding up our selves to be guided by him in a holy life, and then we may be sure our joy shall never end with our lives, but shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with a greater fulness for ever more. <note place="margin">B</note>

For what complaint hath been more frequent among men almost in all ages, than that peace and <note place="margin">E</note> prosperity hath been the portion of the wicked, that their troubles have not been like other mens, that none seem to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy greater pleasures in this world than they who live as if there were no other? The consideration of which hath been a
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:97974:99"/>
matter of great offence to the weak, and of surprise to the wisest; <note place="margin">A</note> till they have searched more deeply into the nature of these things (which the more men have done the better esteem they have always had of divine providence) and from thence have understood that the true felicity of a mans life lies in the contentment of his own mind, which can never arise from any thing without himself, nor be enjoyed till all be well within. For when we compare the state of humane nature with that of the beings inferiour to it, we shall easily find that as man was designed for a greater happiness than they are capable of; so that cannot lie in any thing which he enjoys in common <note place="margin">B</note> with them, (such as the pleasures of our senses are) but must consist in some peculiar excellencies of his being. And as the capacity of misery is always proportionable to that of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; so the measure and the kind of that must be taken in the same manner that we do the other. Where there is no sense of pleasure there can be none of pain; where all pleasure is confined to sense, the pain must be so too; but where the greatest pleasures are intellectual, the greatest torments must be those of the mind. From whence it follows that nothing doth so much conduce to the proper happiness of man, as that <note place="margin">C</note> which doth the most promote the peace and serenity of his mind: nothing can make him more miserable than that which causeth the greatest disturbance in it. If we can then make it appear that the highest honours, the greatest riches, and the softest pleasures can never satisfie the desires, conquer the fears, nor allay the passions of an ungoverned mind, we must search beyond these things for the foundations of its peace. And if notwithstanding them there may be such a sting in the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a wicked man, that may inflame his mind to so great a height of rage and fury, which the diversions of the world <note place="margin">D</note> cannot prevent, nor all its pleasures cure: we are especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to fix such a notion of mans happiness which either sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses a sound mind or else makes it so; without which all the other things so much admired can no more contribute towards any true contentment than a magnificent Palace, or a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously wrought bed to the cure of the Gout or Stone. All which I speak, (not as though I imagined any state of perfect tranquility or compleat happiness were attainable by any man in this present life: for as long as the causes are imperfect the effect must be so too: and those Philosophers who discoursed <note place="margin">E</note> so much of a happy state of life did but frame <hi>Ideas</hi> in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals</hi> as they did in <hi>Politicks,</hi> not as though it were possible for any to reach to the exactness of them, but those were to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted best which came the nearest to them:) but I therefore
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97974:100"/>
speak concerning a happy state of life for these two reasons. <note place="margin">A</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. That though none can be perfectly happy, yet that some may be much more so than others are, <hi>i. e.</hi> they may enjoy far greater contentment of mind in any condition than others can do; they can bear crosses, and suffer injuries with a more equal temper; and when they meet with vicissitudes in the world they wonder no more at it, than to see that the wind changes its quarter, or that the Sea proves rough and tempestuous which but little before was very even and calm. They who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand humane nature have few things left to wonder at; and they who do the least wonder, are the least surprised; and they <note place="margin">B</note> who are the least surprised are the least troubled; and those are the happiest men as this world goes, who meet with fewest troubles in it. The <hi>Italians</hi> have a shrewd Proverb, that there is less mony, less wisdom, less honesty in the world than men generally make account of; I will not stand to maintain the truth of it, but the less men believe of these things, the less they are deceived, and the less they are deceived the less they are troubled. For no troubles are greater than those which are the most unexpected; none are so unexpected as those which come upon men who are only undeceived by their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: <note place="margin">C</note> For they undergo a great deal of trouble to gain a little wisdom whereas a true judgement and consideration of these things before hand, keeps the mind of man more steady and fixt amidst all the contingencies of humane affairs. By which we see that wisdom of it self hath a great influence upon the quiet and peace of mans mind and the happiness of his life: but if we add to that the inseparable property of true wisdom, <hi>viz.</hi> patience and submission to the Will of God upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of his infinite Wisdom and Goodness, he must be strangely blind that cannot discern a greater peace and serenity <note place="margin">D</note> following these two in the minds of men, than where folly and irreligion raign. Thus far then we have gained, that Wisdom and Piety tend very much to the lessening the troubles of a mans life; and therein lies the far greatest part of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this imperfect State. For it is a vain thing to expect in so open a condition as we live in here that no cross winds should blow upon us; but if they only shake our branches and make our leaves fall, as long as the root holds firm and the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy entire, the former beauty and glory will return again. It can be no disparagement to the most skilful Pilot, to have his <note place="margin">E</note> Vessel tossed upon a tempestuous Sea, but to escape with little damage when he sees others sink down and perish, shews the great difference which wisdom gives in the success, where the dangers are equal and common. So that not only some men
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:97974:100"/>
may meet with fewer troubles in the world than others do; but <note place="margin">A</note> supposing they meet with the same, some are far more happy in passing through them than others are. And this is the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sense I know can be given of those otherwise extravagant speeches of the Philosophers of old, concerning <hi>the Wise man being happy in the Bull of</hi> Phalaris, <hi>or under the greatest racks and torments,</hi> not as though they could be so senseless to imagine that any man could be as happy in his torments as out of them; but that taking him in the same State with another man who wants that constancy of mind which he hath, he may be said to be happy in respect of the other. By which <note place="margin">B</note> we see that although no state of life can be said to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly happy, yet some may be much nearer than others can be. Which was necessary to be premised in order to the right understanding the design of our following discourse: which is to shew.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That some course of life to any man who considers what he doth, is utterly inconsistent with a state of Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity; I mean the course of Sin and Wickedness. So the Prophet assures us from the mouth of God himself: in the words of the text. <hi>There is no peace saith my God to the Wicked.</hi> Which words are spoken on purpose by the Prophet, to shew <note place="margin">C</note> how much the wickedness of men doth hinder them from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying that peace and happiness which they might have had without it; for in the foregoing words he represents God as shewing great pity to the scattered remainders of a broken and distressed people; though he had punished them severely for their sins, and banished them out of their native country, yet he promiseth them, <hi>that those who put their trust in him should possess the land and again inherit his holy mountain.</hi> v. 13. and therefore speaks <hi>that the way might be cast up and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <hi>prepared for their return,</hi> and every impediment taken out of the way, v. 14. <hi>for the high and lofty one who inhabits eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; will again dwell in his high and holy place, viz.</hi> at <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> (so the words may be understood, for the Hebrew verb is future) but especially with those who were humbled for their sins, who are here called <hi>the humble and contrite ones.</hi> v. 15. For <hi>God would not always contend with them,</hi> for he knew they were not able to stand before him; <hi>v.</hi> 16. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his punishment of them was just for their sins, v. 17. yet <hi>God took notice of their repentance</hi> and would therefore <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <hi>heal their breaches,</hi> and conduct them back again to their own land, and thereby give so great an occasion of joy and triumph, that by it he is said <hi>to restore comforts to those who mourned</hi> for the calamities they lay under. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 18. yea he would grant
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97974:101"/>
them so much inward peace and outward prosperity, that <note place="margin">A</note> they should far and near joyn in their praises to God for it; and therefore he is said <hi>to create the fruit of the lips peace, peace,</hi> &amp;c. But all this while they must have a care of decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themselves, though God did restore them to their own land with abundance of joy and peace, in expectation that the remembrance of their former calamities and the present bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings they enjoyed would make them abhor the sins which had provoked God to punish them; yet if they should return to their wickedness again, or continue in it after so great mercies, they would soon find that their wickedness would overthrow <note place="margin">B</note> their peace, and nothing but discontent and trouble would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon it; as the natural product of it. <hi>For like the troubled Sea that is tossed up and down</hi> with violent and impetuous winds, fomes and rages, one wave beating against another, and the effect of all this commotion is nothing but casting upon the neighbour shore a greater burden of unprofitable mire and dirt: such would the effect of their wickedness be among them, <hi>v.</hi> 20. it would make them restless and unquiet in themselves, having no one certain motion but tossed up and down with every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary blast of wind, and producing nothing by all these vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">C</note> agitations but unprofitable counsels and unsuccesful designs. But lest the Prophet should be supposed to speak all this out of discontent and passion, he confirms what he had said from the mouth of God in these few but smart words of the Text. <hi>There is no peace, saith my God to the wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words we see are general and indefinite, both as to the nature of the <hi>peace</hi> here mentioned, and the notion of <hi>Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> implyed; and therefore I shall handle them in their due extent by shewing that no one kind of true peace is consistent with any sort of prevailing wickedness: whether by <hi>peace</hi> we <note place="margin">D</note> mean the <hi>peace</hi> a man hath <hi>with himself</hi> in the tranquillity of his mind; or the <hi>peace</hi> which men have in society with one another. In either of these senses it will appear true, <hi>that there is no peace to the wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Taking <hi>peace,</hi> for the <hi>tranquillity of a mans mind;</hi> in order to which it is necessary for a man to have some certain foundation to build his peace upon, and that he be secured from those things which will overthrow it; both which shew it impossible for a wicked man to have any true peace in his mind, because he can have no certain grounds to build it upon; <note place="margin">E</note> and those things do accompany his wickedness, which will certainly overthrow it:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Wicked man can have no certain foundations for his peace. By which I do not mean any contracted dulness, or
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:97974:101"/>
bruitish stupidity, which if we will call <hi>peace</hi> the most insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <note place="margin">A</note> parts of the creation do infinitely exceed us in it; but such a composure and settlement of our minds, which ariseth from a due consideration of things; and differs as much from the former temper as a vigorous and healthful state of body doth from the dull effects of a Lethargy. And such a peace as this no wicked man can ever have but upon one of these suppositions.</p>
                  <p>Either (1.) That Wickedness is but a meer name of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace set upon some kind of actions, but that really there is no such a thing as sin, or the differences of good and evil; or <note place="margin">B</note> else,</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Supposing there is such a thing as sin, it is ridiculous to believe there ever should be such a punishment of it as men are affrighted with;</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Or Lastly, supposing there be a punishment of sin to come, it is madness to abstain from the present pleasures of sin for the fear of it. These being only the imaginable grounds a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man can have any peace in his mind from; I shall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly shew the falseness and the folly of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is no such thing as Sin or Wickedness in the <note place="margin">C</note> world, and that the differences of good and evil are meerly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary things, and that those are names only imposed upon things by the more cunning sort of men to affright men from the doing some actions, and to encourage them to do others. But what a miserable case are those in, who can never enjoy any contentment in themselves unless all the differences of good and evil be utterly destroyed! We should conclude that mans condition desperate, who believes it impossible for him to have any ease in his mind, unless he could be transformed into the shape of a beast, or petrified into the hardness of a rock. These <note place="margin">D</note> are things not utterly impossible, but yet they are possible in so remote a degree that it is all one to say, he can have no ease, as to say, that he expects it only upon those terms: But it is utterly inconsistent with the supposition of humane nature, or a being endued and acting with reason, to make all things equally good or evil. For what doth reason signifie as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the actions of men, but a faculty of discerning what is good and fitting to be done, from what is evil and ought to be avoided? And to what purpose is such a faculty given us, if there be no such difference in the nature of things? Might not <note place="margin">E</note> men with equal probability argue that there is no such thing as a difference in the things about which life and sense are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant, as in those wherein reason is imploved? With what impatience would those men be heard who should assert that
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:97974:102"/>
there is no such thing as a difference in the qualities of meats <note place="margin">A</note> and drinks, but that they do all equally tend to the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life, that it is pedantical and beneath a Gentleman to talk of any such thing as <hi>Poisons,</hi> that will so suddenly and certainly destroy mens lives, and that these are things which none talk of or believe besides those whose trade is either to kill or cure men? With how much wit and subtilty might a man argue upon these things, that it is impossible for any man to define what the nature of poison is, or in what manner it destroys the life of man, that men have conquered the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of it by use, and that the same things which have been <note place="margin">B</note> poison to some, have been food and nourishment to others? But notwithstanding all these plausible arguments, none of these brave spirits dare venture the experiment upon themselves: and yet these (only changing the terms) are the very same arguments used against the natural differences of good and evil; <hi>viz.</hi> the difficulty of defining or setting the exact bounds of them, and the different customs or apprehensions of men in the world concerning the things which are called good and evil. If we proceed farther to the objects of sense; how ridiculous would those persons appear that should with a mighty confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence <note place="margin">C</note> go about to perswade men, that the differences between light and darkness, between pleasure and pain, between smells and tasts and noises are but phantastick and imaginary things? Who would ever believe that those are men of the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent sight to whom light and darkness are equal: (for others who pretend not to so much wit, are wont to call such persons blind.) Or that those have the most exquisite sense, that feel no difference of pain and pleasure, (which was wont to be thought the sign of no sense at all.) And surely the persons I am now arguing against, love their palats too well, to admire <note place="margin">D</note> those who can discern no difference of tasts; and would be well enough contented to be thought deaf if they could put no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction between the pleasant sound of vocal or instrumental Musick, and the harsh jarring of two saws drawn cross each other. Thus it appears that nothing would make men more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous than to explode and laugh at the difference that there is in the means of life and the objects of sense: let us now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed higher. Dare any man say there is no such thing as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in man, because there appears so little of the truth of it in men, and so much of the counterfeit of it in Bruits? or that <note place="margin">E</note> there is no such thing as a difference of Truth and fashood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are so commonly mistaken for one another? What reason then imaginable can there be, that there should not be as wide a distance in the matters of our choice, as in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:97974:102"/>
of our sense and understanding? Is it that we have natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <note place="margin">A</note> faculties of sense and perception, but not of choice? that, every one is able to resute by his constant experience, that finds a greater liberty in his choice, than in his perception. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which is wholly unintelligible, unless a difference be found in the nature of the things proposed to his choice; that some have a greater excellency and commendableness in them, more agreeable to humane nature, more satisfactory to the minds of those who choose them, than others are. And must all this difference be destroyed, meerly because all men are not agreed, what things are good and what evil? We call goodness the <note place="margin">B</note> beauty of the soul; and do men question whether there be such a thing as beauty at all, because there are so many different opinions in the world about it? Or is deformity ever the less real because the several nations of the world represent it in a colour different from their own? Those arguments then against the natural differences of good and evil must needs appear ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, which will be granted to hold in nothing else but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the thing in question. And yet in the midst of all the ruines and decays of humane nature, we find such evident footsteps and impressions of the differences of good and evil in the minds <note place="margin">C</note> of men, which no force could extinguish, no time could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face; no customs could alter. Let us search the records of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, and enquire into the later discoveries of nations, we shall find none so barbarous and bruitish as not to allow the differences of good and evil; so far as to acknowledge, that there are some things which naturally deserve to be praised, and others which deserve to be punished. Where as if good and evil were meerly names of things, there can be no reason as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, why praise and honour should necessarily belong to some things and infamy and disgrace to follow others. If the <note place="margin">D</note> things themselves be arbitrary, the consequences of them would be so too. But is it possible to imagine that any man should deserve to be punished as much for being true to his trust, as for betraying it; for honouring his Parents as for destroying them; for giving to every one their due, as for all the arts of injustice and oppression? Is it possible for men to suffer as much in their esteem, for their fidelity, temperance, and chastity, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do for their falseness, intemperance, and lasciviousness? How comes the very name of a lie to be a matter of so much reproach and dishonour, that the giving of it is thought an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury <note place="margin">E</note> so great as cannot be expiated without the satisfaction of the givers blood, if it be in it self self so indifferent a thing? Nay, I dare appeal to the consciences of the most wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whether they are so well pleased with themselves, when
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:97974:103"/>
they come reeking from the satisfaction of their lusts, and sod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <note place="margin">A</note> with the continuance of their debaucheries, as when they have been paying their devotions to God, or their duties to their Parents, or their respects to their Country or Friends? Is there not (whether they will or no,) an inward shame, and secret regret and disquiet following the one, and nothing but ease and contentment the other? What should make this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in those persons who love their vices far more than they do the other? and if it were possible for them would bring vertue more out of countenance than sin is: yet after all their endeavors, though vice hath the stronger interest, vertue <note place="margin">B</note> hath the greater Reverence. Thus considering humane nature as it is, we find indelible characters remaining upon it of the natural differences of good and evil; but then if we consider it with a respect to the Maker of it, that will cast a clearer light upon them, and make those characters appear more discerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For nothing can be more absurd than to imagine a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture owing its being, and all it hath to the bounty of a Being infinite in all Perfections, and yet not to be obliged to give all honour, worship and service to it. To rip up the bowels of a Mother to whom a man owes his coming into the world; to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassinate <note place="margin">C</note> a Prince, to whom he owes all the honours and riches he hath in it; are crimes of so black a nature, that the worst of men can hardly be supposed to commit them, nor the worst of Devils to defend them: But to blaspheme God and to deride his service seems to have a much greater malignity in it, in as much, as our obligations to his honuor and service, are much greater than they can be to any created Being. But if there be no natural differences of good and evil, even this must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an indifferent thing, as well as the former: and what safety can there be in conversing with those men, whom no <note place="margin">D</note> bonds of Religion, Nature, or Gratitude can tye? Let us, if it were possible suppose a Society of men constituted of such who make all things equally good and evil in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what a monstrous <hi>Leviathan</hi> would they make among them? no Religion, no Law, no Kindness, no Promises, no Trust, no Contracts could ever oblige them not to do any thing which they thought might be done with safety. By which it appears that these principles are so inconsistent with humane Nature, and all the bonds of Religion and Duty, that whoever owns them must suppose mankind more savage than the beasts <note place="margin">E</note> of prey, he must renounce his reason, destroy all Religion, and disown a Deity. For if there be a God, we must be inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly bound to observe and obey him; and the very notion of a God implies a being infinitely perfect; and if there be such
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:97974:103"/>
perfections in God, they cannot but be so in their own nature, <note place="margin">A</note> and if they be so in their own nature they must in their degree be so in us as well as in him; so that if goodness, holiness and righteousness be absolute perfections as they are in God, they must be perfections so far as they are in us; and the contrary must be imperfections; which makes the differences of good and evil so far from being arbitrary, that those things which agree to the perfections of God as well as his will must needs be good, and those which are repugnant to them must needs be evil. The result of all is, that if a wicked man can have no peace in his mind, without overthrowing the differences <note place="margin">B</note> of good and evil, he can have no peace without the greatest violence offered to God, to nature, and himself, and if this be the way to Peace let his Reason judge.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second foundation which a wicked man must build his peace upon is, that supposing there be such a thing as sin, yet that men have no cause to disturb themselves with the fears of so great a punishment to follow after, as that which sinners are afrighted with. But what security can a sinner have against the fears of punishment when his conscience condemns him for the guilt of his sins? Is it that God takes no notice at all of <note place="margin">C</note> the actions of men, that he will not disturb his own eternal peace and happiness by observing all their follies? So some of old imagined, who pretended that out of meer kindness to the Deity they gave him his <hi>Quietus est,</hi> and took from him as much as in them lay, the care and government of the world: but it was really a greater kindness to their lusts which made them do it, and makes many now a days so willing upon the same frivolous pretences to exclude the providence of God out of the world, for can any man who considers what God is think his providence inconsistent with his happiness? If we speak of <note place="margin">D</note> such weak and imperfect beings as the wisest of mankind are, it might not a little contribute to their peace to be eased of the cares of Government. But the reason of that is because all things cannot be foreseen by them before they happen, nor well managed when they do, whence come oversights and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments and consequently all the uneasie effects of these. But when we speak of God, we speak of a being infinitely Wise and Powerful, from whom nothing can be hid, and whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can resist: and what can be imagined more easie than for a conjunction of infinite Wisdom and Power, to contrive <note place="margin">E</note> and manage all the affairs of the world? If therefore wicked men could suppose that God could not know what they did, or could not punish them if he knew it, they might indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in greater security: but to suppose his Wisdom so great
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97974:104"/>
that he cannot but know their actions, and his Power so irresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible, that it is impossible for them to stand before him when <note place="margin">A</note> he designs to punish, to flatter themselves with the hopes of impunity is an extravagant piece of folly and madness. Or is it then, that though God doth take notice of their actions, he will not be so much displeased as to punish them? but this is as repugnant to the Justice and holiness of God, as the other was to his Wisdom and Power. Will not the righteous God who hath made Laws to govern mankind see to the execution of them? for if he did not hate sin why did he so strictly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it? if he doth hate sin, he will severely punish it. Nay <note place="margin">B</note> hath he not been severe already in the execution of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the world for sin? what did <hi>Adam</hi> and his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity suffer for the first sin? what did the old world, <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> the people of the Jews suffer for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? And is not he the same God still? Is his hand shortned that he cannot strike, or doth his heart fail that he dare not punish? Surely of all nations we have no cause to think so, and of all Ages; not in this of ours; wherein we have smarted so much by the just displeasure of God against our sins. But where then lies the sinners hope? Is it at last, that though God may <note place="margin">C</note> sometimes punish men in this life for their sins he will never do it in that to come? If he could have said it was impossible he should do it, and proved it sufficiently, there might have been some ground for his security, but that is impossible he should ever do; but to hope he will not do it when he hath declared that he will, is instead of bringing peace to his own mind to set God at variance with himself. For nothing can be more plainly revealed, more frequently inculcated, more earnestly pressed than <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 2. 5, 6, 8, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>that there is a day of wrath to come, wherein the righteous judgement of God shall be revealed; and wherein</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <hi>God will render to every man according to his deeds: wherein tribulation, and anguish and wrath shall be upon every soul of man that doth evil; wherein the secrets of all hearts and actions shall be disclosed, when the graves shall be opened,</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">John 5. 29</note> 
                     <hi>and they that have done good shall come forth to the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation. For the Lord Iesus himself</hi> even he who dyed for the salvation of all penitent sinners, <note n="c" place="margin">2 Thess. 1. 7, 8, 9.</note> 
                     <hi>shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire,</hi> taking vengeance on them that <hi>know not God and obey not the Gospel</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <hi>of Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and the glory of his power.</hi> Then shall that dreadful sentence be passed upon all impenitent sinners, <note n="d" place="margin">Matth. 25. 41.</note> 
                     <hi>depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97974:104"/>
the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Which words are so full of horrour and astonishment as might not only disturb the sinners peace <note place="margin">A</note> and security, but awaken him to such a sense of his sins, as to loath, abhorr and forsake them, and thereby flie from the wrath to come.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But after all this, is it possible to suppose, that any should think their present pleasures would countervail all the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of another life? which is the last imaginable foundation for a sinners peace, while he continues in his wickedness. The most professed <hi>Epicureans</hi> that ever were, made this one of their fundamental maxims, that no pleasure was to be chosen, which brought after it a pain greater than it self: on which <note place="margin">B</note> account they made temperance and sobriety necessary to a pleasant life, because excesses and debaucheries leave far more of burden than of ease behind them. But what would these men have said, if they had believed the intolerable anguish of a tormented mind, the racks of an enraged conscience, the fire of everlasting vengeance to be the consequent of all the pleasures of sin? they must upon their own principles have concluded that none but madmen and fools would ever venture upon them. And that not only because the after pain would <note place="margin">C</note> so much exceed the present pleasure; but because the fears of that pain to come must abate proportionably of the pleasure which might otherwise be enjoyed. Suppose a man certainly knew that upon the pleasing his palat with the most excellent wine, and gratifying his appetite, with the most delicate food he must be racked with the stone, and tormented with the Gout as long as he should live; can we imagine such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son could have any pleasure in his mind (whatever his palat had) in the emjoyment of them while he did consider the consequent of them. But what are these miseries compared with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable <note place="margin">D</note> horrour of a conscience loaden with guilt, sunk under despair, having a gnawing worm and unquenchable flames; the wrath of an almighty God, and the fury of his vengeance to encounter with, without the least hopes of conquering? I do not now ask, what the sinner will then think of all his Atheism and Infidelity when the greatness of his miserie shall convince him that it is an Almighty hand which lays it upon him; nor what pleasure he can have in the thoughts of his former excesses, when not one drop can be procured for the mitigation of his flames? nor what satisfaction those lusts <note place="margin">E</note> have given him, the very thoughts of which pierce his soul, and if it were possible would rend him in pieces with the torment of them? but that which I demand is, what peace of mind a sinner can have in this world who knows not how soon he may
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97974:105"/>
be dispatched to that place of torment? can he bind the hands <note place="margin">A</note> of the Almighty, that he shall not snatch him away till he doth repent? or can he reverse the decrees of heaven, or suspend the execution of them? can he abrogate the force of his Laws, and make his own terms with God? can he dissolve the chains of darkness with a few death-bed tears, and quench the flames of another world with them? O foolish sinners who hath bewitched them with these deceitful dreams! will heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates fly open with the strength of a few dying groans? will the mouth of hell be stopt with the bare lamentation of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Are there such charms in some penitent words extorted <note place="margin">B</note> from the fear of approaching misery, that God himself is not able to resist them? Certainly there is no deceit more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, nor I fear more common in the world, than for men to think that God is so easie to pardon sin, that though they spend their lives in satisfying their lusts; they shall make amends for all by a dying sorrow and a gasping repentance. As though the unsaying what we had done, or wishing we had done otherwise since we can do it no longer, (for that is the bottom of all putting off repentance to the last) were abundant compensation to the justice of God, for the affronts of <note place="margin">C</note> his Majesty, contempt of his Laws, abuse of his patience, and all the large indictments of wilful and presumptuous sins, which the whole course of our lives is charged with. The supposal of which makes the whole design of Religion signify very little in the world.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have examined the foundations of a sinners peace, and found them very false and fallacious:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. we are now to shew that those things do accompany a sinners course of life which certainly overthrow his peace; which are these two. 1. The reflections of his mind. 2. The <note place="margin">D</note> violence of his passions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The reflections of his mind, which he can neither hinder nor be pleased with. No doubt if it were possible for him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive himself of the greatest excellency of his being, it would be the first work he would do, to break the glass which shews him his deformity. For as our Saviour saith <note n="a" place="margin">John 3. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>every one that doth evil hateth the light lest his deeds should be reproved;</hi> not only the light without which discovers them, but that light of conscience within, which not only shines but burns too. Hence proceeds that great uneasiness which a sinner feels <note place="margin">E</note> within as often as he considers what he hath done amiss, which we call the remorse of conscience; and is the natural conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of the violence a man offers to his reason in his evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It was thought a sufficient vindication of the innocency
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97974:105"/>
of two Brothers by the <hi>Roman</hi> Judges, when they were accused <note place="margin">A</note> for Parricide; that although their Father was murthered in the same room where they lay, and no other person was found on whom they could fasten the suspicion of it, yet in the morning the door was open and they fast asleep. For as the Orator saith, <note n="a" place="margin">Pro Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioc. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>no man can imagine, that those who had broken all the Laws of God and nature by so great an act of wickedness could presently sleep upon it: for they who do such things can neither rest withoutcare, nor breath without fear. We are not to believe,</hi> saith he, <hi>the fables of the Poets, as though wicked men were haunted and terrified with the burning torches of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">B</note> 
                     <hi>the furies; but every mans wickedness is the greatest terrour to himself, and the evil thoughts which pursue wicked men are their constant and domestick furies.</hi> It would be endless to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what force the more civil Heathens, have given to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science either way, as to the peace which follows innocency, and the disquiet which follows guilt. Which they looked on as the great thing which governed the world, <note n="b" place="margin">De N. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum. l. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>quâ sublatâ jacent omnia</hi> as the orator speaks, without which all things would be in great disorder, for these punishments they are sure not to escape, <note n="c" place="margin">De leg. l. 1.</note> though they may do others; and these <note place="margin">C</note> they thought so great and weighty that upon this ground they vindicated divine providence as to the seeming prosperity of wicked men, thinking it the most unreasonable thing in the world, to call those persons happy who suffered under the severe lashes of their own consciences. If there were such a force in the consciences of those who had nothing but the light of nature to direct them, how much greater weight must there be when <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>the terrours of the Lord</hi> are made known by himself, <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>and the wrath of God revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness of men?</hi> I know that wicked men <note place="margin">D</note> in the height of their debaucheries pretend to be above these things, and are ready to laugh at them as the effects of a strong spleen and a weak brain: but I appeal to their most sober thoughts, when the steams of wine are evaporated, and the intoxication of evil company is removed from them, when in the deep and silent night, they revolve in their minds the actions of the foregoing day; what satisfaction they then take in all the sinful pleasures they have pursued so eagerly? but especially; when either their lusts have consumed their bodies, or the vengeance of God hath overtaken them; when death <note place="margin">E</note> begins to seize upon their vitals, and themselves not wholly stupified through the power of their sins or their disease, let then, if it were possible, any represent the fears, the horrour and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment which the consciences of wicked men labour under
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:97974:106"/>
in remembrance of their evil actions. How mean and poor <note place="margin">A</note> would they leave themselves if with all their honours and riches they could purchase to themselves, a reprieve from death and from the miseries which follow after it? what would they then give for the comfort of a good conscience, and the fruit of a holy, righteous, and sober life? with what another sense of Religion do men whose minds are awakened speak then, in comparison of what they did in the days of their mirth and jollity? Neither is this <hi>to take them at the greatest disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> as some of them have been ready to say; for I suppose their minds as clear then as at any time, and so much the clearer, <note place="margin">B</note> because freed from the impediments of such freedom of their thoughts at another time; for the same thoughts would have possessed them before, only the pleasures and the hopes of life diverted their minds from them, but now the nearness of the things they feared, and the weight and consequence of them make them more diligently examine and impartially consider them. But that demonstrates the great misery of a sinners State; that what cures the other greatest troubles of our life doth the most increase his, which is the exercise of reason and consideration, that allays the power of griefs, that easeth the <note place="margin">C</note> mind of vain fears, that prevents many troubles and cures others, that governs other passions and keeps them in their due bounds; but this is it which of all things doth the most increase the trouble of a wicked mans mind; for the more he considers, the worse he finds his condition; and while he finds his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition so bad, he can never enjoy any peace in his mind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The violence of his passions: those a wicked man hath lost the command of, or else he could never be a wicked man, and whosoever is under the power of any unruly passion forseits all his peace by it. For what peace can ever be expected in such <note place="margin">D</note> a State of violence and usurpation, where the calm govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reason is cast off as an unnecessary burden, and every passion under the pretence of liberty sets up for an arbitrary power? Nay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what confusion and disorder must needs follow, where the powers of the mind, which ought to keep all in order, are themselves in subjection to their own slaves: and none ever govern so ill as those which ought to obey. How serene and quiet is the mind of a man where the superiour faculties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve their just authority? How composed is his temper, how moderate his desires, how well governed his fears! But where <note place="margin">E</note> once that authority is lost, how extravagant is the rage of men, how unruly their lusts, how predominant their fears! What peace had <hi>Xerxes</hi> in his mind when in stead of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering his foolish passion, he challenged mount <hi>Athos</hi> into the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:97974:106"/>
field, and no doubt would have run fast enough if he had seen <note place="margin">A</note> it moving? What pleasure was it to see that mighty Monarch whip the Sea in a rage, as though the waves had been under his discipline, and would run the faster for the fear of his rod? What harm had the hair of his head done to that man who pulled it off with the violence of his passion, <hi>as though</hi> as the Philosopher told him, <hi>baldness would asswage his grief?</hi> Was ever <hi>Varus</hi> the nearer to restoring his Legions for <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus</hi> knocking his head against the wall in a rage about the loss of them? What injury did <hi>Neptune</hi> suffer, when he displaced his image in the <hi>Circenstan</hi> games, because he had an <note place="margin">B</note> ill Voyage at Sea? What height of madness and folly did that modern Prince's rage betray him to, who, as the French Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra list saith, <note n="a" place="margin">Montagne.

                     <hi>having received a blow from heaven, sware to be revenged on Almighty God, and for 10. years space forbid all publick exercise of devotion towards him?</hi> I instance in these things to let us see there is nothing so ridiculous, nothing so absurd, nothing so irreligious but a violent passion may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray men to. And if such things ever break forth into actions, what may we conceive the inward disturbance is, where the outward shew (which usually dissembles the inward passion), <note place="margin">C</note> betrayed so much rage and disorder; for where such flames break out, what combustion may we conceive within? But it is not only this kind of passion which is so great an enemy to the peace of a mans mind, but when his desires are restless, and his fears unconquerable, and this is the case of every wicked man. His lusts inflame him and the means he uses to quench them inrage them more; his ambition grows greater as his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour doth; and there is no hopes of a cure, where the disease thrives under the remedy; his love of riches is necessary to maintain his honour and feed his lusts; and where passions so <note place="margin">D</note> great, so many, so different all increase by being gratified what disturbance and confusion follows? But supposing that vices in men may agree (as the Devils in Hell do) to the destruction of mens souls; yet what security can a wicked man have against the power of his fears? and we all know no passion disquiets more than that doth. And how many sorts of fears possess a sinners mind? fears of disappointments, fears of discovery, and fears of punishment, but supposing he could master all the rest and the fears of punishment as to this life too; yet the fears of that to come is sufficient to rob him of any peace in his mind, <note place="margin">E</note> and impossible to be overcome by him. For no sound reason can be given against his fears, but the strongest arguments in the world to confirm them. Nay the greatest grounds of others comforts are the strongest foundations for his fears, as
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:97974:107"/>
the belief of a God, and Providence, and a life to come: <note place="margin">A</note> And what can give that man peace, whom the very thoughts of the God of peace doth disturb so much? That is the first kind of <hi>Peace</hi> we have shewed to be in consistent with a course of wickedness, which is the <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>tranquillity of a mans own mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Taking this peace for an <hi>outward peace,</hi> and so these words not in respect of every person in particular and that peace which belongs to him as such, but as they are joyned together in community; so they imply that nothing undermines our <hi>civil peace</hi> and the prosperity of a nation so much as prevailing <note place="margin">B</note> wickedness doth. So that although mighty deliverances were given the people of the Jews in a very strange and unexpected manner, when God raised up <hi>Cyrus</hi> his servant, a man from whom no kindness was expected, and made him the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of setling the people in their land under their own lawful Princes, and restored the true worship of God among them, yet if they grew wanton in the days of their prosperity, and forgat the God who delivered them, they must expect a return of Calamities again upon them; for <hi>there is no Peace saith my God to the wicked. i. e.</hi> This is the method of his <note place="margin">C</note> providence, and the way he useth in governing the world; while Religion and vertue flourish among them, they may hope for peace and prosperity; but if those decay and sin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness prevail, no other arts imaginable will secure a lasting peace, or an abiding tranquillity. All other ways are but tricks and devices, and there are many of them in the hearts of men, but the Counsel of the Lord that shall stand against them all; and that Counsel he hath declared himself by the mouth of another Prophet, <note n="a" place="margin">Jer. 18. 9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a Kingdom to build and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <hi>to plant it, if it do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice, then will I repent of the good, wherewith I said I would bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them.</hi> Thus we find it was in this people of the Jews, upon their first return from captivity they shewed some zeal towards the rebuilding the Temple and setling the worship of God there; but this fit did not hold them long, they soon fell back to their former sins and disobedience to the Laws of God, upon this they brake out into greater schisms and factions in matters of Religion than ever were known among them before; for then the <hi>Pharisees</hi> fell into a seperation under a pretence of <note place="margin">E</note> greater sanctity and severity of life, and these by their shew of zeal gained a mighty interest among the people; so great that the Princes stood in awe of them: then the <hi>Sadducees</hi> (who were most part Courtiers as <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us) out of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97974:107"/>
to the other looked on Religion as a meer political <note place="margin">A</note> institution, cryed out against faction and popularity, and questioned at least whether there were any Spirits or life to come. And what peace followed upon these things? very little among themselves we may be sure by the heats and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities that were continually among them; the issue of which was, the Temple was profaned by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> rifled by <hi>Pompey;</hi> their own Princes deposed and Usurpers ruled over them; and when the Son of God himself could not reclaim them, their Temple, nation, and government were all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in one common ruin. Thus we see how these words of <note place="margin">B</note> the Prophet were fulfilled upon this people.</p>
                  <p>But some have been ready to say <hi>that Gods proceedings with the Iews ought not to be drawn into an example to any other nations, because his dealings with them were peculiar, and by vertue of a particular Covenant which God made with them, which he hath not done with any other nation in the world.</hi> This objection were of great force, if God himself had not in the words before mentioned, declared the same concerning any other nation or Kingdom, and if the instances were not as remarkable in other people as in that of the Jews. If we search <note place="margin">C</note> the monuments of former ages, and consider the strange revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which have happened in the mighty emipres and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the world; we shall find no one circumstance more considerable in them than this, that the nations which God hath made use of for a scourge to others have been remarkable for nothing so much, as for the vertues opposite to the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing vices among those who were overcome by them. Thus when the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Monarchy fell, the <hi>Persians</hi> who were the sword in Gods right hand, were eminent for nothing more than their great temperance and frugality, while the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> perished by their luxury and effeminacy. And when the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy degenerated into the same vices, the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians</hi> were raised up to be the executioners of Gods wrath upon them, because they were at that time freer than any other people from those softening and destroying vices. And when the <hi>Persian</hi> luxury had infected their conquerours the severe Disciplin and vertue of the <hi>Romans</hi> made them more successful in subduing the remainders of the <hi>Graecian</hi> Empire, than their courage and number could. And when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> themselves (after a long time of Gods forbearance with <note place="margin">E</note> them, and several respites from punishment by the vertue and conduct of such excellent Princes as <hi>Antoninus</hi> and <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> in the Heathen, and <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Theodos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:97974:108"/>
as any we ever read of, then did God let loose (as it were) the <note place="margin">A</note> 
                     <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> and other barbarous nations out of their several dens who seemed to be designed rather to destroy than to conquer. So sudden, so numerous, so irresistible in most places were the incursions they made. But what was it which gave them so strange success? was it their long practice and skill in military affairs? No, they were rude and unexperienced: was it their mighty courage? No, they were despised by the <hi>Romans</hi> as great cowards, and begged for peace when it was denyed them. But as <note n="a" place="margin">Sal. l. 7. p. 161. &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Salvian</hi> tells us who lived in those times and knew the manners of both sides, the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">B</note> were of a very severe chastity, among whom fornication was punished sharply, and adultery a crime scarce heard of; whereas all manner of uncleanness and licentiousness did abound among the <hi>Romans,</hi> who yet were then called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. The <hi>Goths</hi> were devout and pious, acknowledging divine providence, making their solemn supplications to God before their victories, and returning him the praise of them afterwards; but the <hi>Romans</hi> were fallen into that degree of irreligion and <hi>Atheism</hi> that nothing was more common among them than to droll upon Religion. <note n="b" place="margin">P. 166.</note> 
                     <hi>A nostris omnia fermè</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">C</note> 
                     <hi>religiosa ridentur,</hi> as <hi>Salvian</hi> speaks: they thought all things managed by chance or fate and ascribed very little to God. And where these sins abounded most, they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up and down as by a divine instinct, as they confessed themselves, and where they conquered, <note n="c" place="margin">P. 168.</note> as he particularly speaks of the <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> they purged all the stews of uncleanness, and made so great a reformation by the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Laws, that even the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves were chast among them. Thus we see how those great and mighty Empires have been broken to pieces by the weight of their <note place="margin">D</note> impieties falling upon them.</p>
                  <p>May the consideration then of these things move us in time to a reformation of our lives, before our iniquities grow full and ripe for vengeance. We have seen many revolutions, and God knows how many more we may see; if that should be true of us, which the same Author saith of the <hi>Romans</hi> in the midst of all their changes <hi>Sola tantum vitia perdurant,</hi> their vices remained the same still. Thanks be to God, that things have a fairer appearance at present than they have had, and never so good a time to amend as now: but if men flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <note place="margin">E</note> with present security, and their sins increase as their fears abate, the clouds which seem dispersed may soon gather again, and the face of the Heavens will change if we do not.</p>
                  <p>And if it be not in our power to reclaim others from their
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97974:108"/>
sins, let us endeavour to preserve the honour of our Church by amending our own, and convince our enemies by living <note place="margin">A</note> better than they. And give me leave to say, and so I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that among all the expedients which have been thought of for the peace of this Church and Nation, that of leaving off our sins, and leading vertuous and exemplary lives, will at last prove to be the most successful. <note place="margin">B</note>

                  <p>Consider now whether so dreadful a preparation for Christs coming to judgement be not one great reason why it should be called <hi>the terror of the Lord?</hi> For can any thing be imagined more full of horror and amazement than to see the whole world in a flame about us? We may remember (and I hope we yet do so) when the flames of one City filled the minds of <note place="margin">B</note> all the beholders with astonishment and fear: but what then would it do, not only to see the earth vomit and cast forth fire every where about us; and the Sea to boyl and swell and froth like water in a seething pot, but to hear nothing but perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al claps of thunder, and to see no light in the Heavens, but what the flashings of lightning give? Could we imagine our selves at a convenient distance to behold the eruption of a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mountain, such as <hi>Aetna</hi> and <hi>Vesuvius</hi> are, when the earth about it trembles and groans, the Sea foams and rages, and the bowels of the mountain roar through impatience of casting forth <note place="margin">C</note> its burden, and at last gives it self ease by sending up a mixture of flames, and ashes, and smoak, and a flood of fire, spreading far and destroying where ever it runs; yet even this, though it be very apt to put men in apprehensions and fears of this great day, falls very far short of the terror of it. Could we yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suppose that at the same time we could see fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone raining from Heaven on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> the earth opening to devour <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, <hi>Belshazzar</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at the hand writing against the wall, and the Jews de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying themselves in the fire of their Temple and City, this <note place="margin">D</note> may somewhat higher advance our imaginations of the horror of the worlds conflagration, but yet we cannot reach the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of it: in as much <hi>as the Heavens and the earth which are now, are kept in store</hi> saith the Apostle <note n="a" place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>reserved unto fire against the day of judgement and perdition of ungodly men;</hi> even those heavens whole beauty, and order, and motion, and influence we now admire; and that earth whose fruitful womb and richly adorned surface affords all the conveniencies of the life of man, must either be destroyed or at least purged and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by this last and dreadful Fire.

destroyed by the anger of God, but that this destruction shall <note place="margin">A</note> be by real fire, which adds more to the sensible terror of it, to all that shall behold it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The terror of Christs appearance in that day. The design of the Scripture in setting forth the coming of Christ to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to represent it in such a manner to us as is most apt to strike us with awe and terror at the apprehension of it. Now the greatest appearance of Majesty among men is, either when a mighty Prince marches triumphantly in the midst of a Royal Army, with all the splendor of a Court and the disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of a Camp, having his greatest attendants about him, <note place="margin">B</note> and sending his Officers before him, who with the sound of Trumpets give notice of his approach, and is every where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with the shouts and acclamations of the people: or else, of a Prince, sitting upon his throne of Majesty set forth with all the Ornaments of State and Greatness, with all his Nobles and Courties standing about his Throne, and in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son calling Malefactors to account; and both these ways the appearance of Christ upon his second coming is represented to us: first <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 24. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>as coming in the clouds of Heaven, i. e.</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding triumphantly (as it were upon a Chariot) on a body of <note place="margin">C</note> light brighter than the Sun, having <note n="b" place="margin">2 Thes. 1. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>all the Heavenly host attending upon him,</hi> and therefore he is said <note n="c" place="margin">Matth. 24. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>to come with power and great glory; and sending his Angels with a great sound of a trumpet before him;</hi> 
                     <note n="d" place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 16</note> 
                     <hi>after whom the Lord himself shall descend from Heaven with a shout, with the voice of the Archangel and with the trump of God.</hi> Not as though we were to imagine any material trumpet, as some have grossly done, whose sound could reach over the whole earth; but the sound of the last trumpet seems to be the same with <note n="e" place="margin">John 5. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>the voice of the Son of God, which the dead are said to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <hi>hear and live; i. e.</hi> it shall be an effectual power for raising the dead; which may be therefore called <hi>the sound of a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,</hi> because it supplies the use of one in calling all people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and doth more lively represent to our capacities the Majesty of Christs appearance with all the Heavenly host of Angels and Saints. Thus when God appeared upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> with his Holy Angels about him, we there read <note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 68. 17. Exod. 20. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>of the noise of the trumpet:</hi> and when God shewed his glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in the temple, he is said <note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 47. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>to go up with a shout and the Lord with the sound of a trumpet:</hi> and when he sets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <note place="margin">E</note> against his enemies, God himself is said <note n="h" place="margin">Zach 9. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>to blow the trumpet, and to go with the whirlwinds of the</hi> South. But besides this, we find Christ upon his second coming described as <note n="i" place="margin">Matth. 25. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>sitting on the throne of his glory, and all the Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:97974:113"/>
about him, and all nations gathered before him</hi> to receive <note place="margin">A</note> their sentence from him. His throne is said to be <hi>great and white, i. e.</hi> most magnificent and glorious, and to make it the <note place="margin">Rev. 20. 11.</note> more dreadful; <note n="a" place="margin">Chap. 4. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>from it are said to proceed lightnings and thundrings and voices;</hi> and so terrible is the Majesty of him that sits upon the throne <note n="b" place="margin">Rev. 20. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Heaven and earth are said to flie away from his face; but the dead small and great are to stand before him and to be judged according to their works.</hi> And if the appearance of a common Judge be so dreadful to a guilty prisoner, if the Majesty of an earthly Prince begets an awe and reverence where there is no fear of <note place="margin">B</note> punishment, what may we then imagine when Justice and Majesty both meet in the person of the Judge, and fear and guilt in the Conscience of Offenders? Therefore it is said, <note n="c" place="margin">Rev. 1. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreas of the earth shall wail because of him.</hi> We find the best of men in Scripture seized on with a very unusual consternation at any extraordinary divine appearance: The sight upon Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was so terrible even to <hi>Moses</hi>

                     <hi>that he stood trembling.</hi> If these whom God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared o in a way of kindness were so possessed with fear, what horror must needs seize upon the minds of the wicked when <note n="g" place="margin">2 Thes. 1. 7, 8.</note>

                     <hi>they went backward and fell to the ground;</hi> how unconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly greater must it be when his design shall be to manifest that Glory to the world which he then concealed from it?

Then the most secret impurities, the most subtile hypocrisie, the most artificial fraud, and the most dissembled malice shall be laid <note place="margin">B</note> open to publick view. For then <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>God will bring to hight the hidden things of darkness</hi> and <hi>will make manifest the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of the hearts.</hi> Then all the intrigues of lust and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so much the talk and business of this world, will be nothing but mens shame and reproach in the next. With what hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror will they then behold all the sins of their lives set in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before them, when they seemed in this life, next to the committing them, to design as much as may be to forget them? Happy men! if their Consciences were like their Table Books, that they could blot out and put in what they pleased them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: <note place="margin">C</note> then all the black Catalogue of their sins would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently expunged, and they would have nothing to be seen there, but the Characters of what at least seemed to be good. For though men be never so vicious they neither care that others should think so of them, nor they of themselves: of all things they do not love to dispute where they cannot answer, and that is their case in all their retorts of Conscience upon them. They know there is no drolling with so sowre a piece, as that within them is, for that makes the smartest and most cutting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partees; which are uneasie to bear, but impossible to answer. <note place="margin">D</note> Therefore they study their own quiet, by seeking to keep that silent; and since they never hope to make Conscience dumb, they would have it sleep as much as may be: and although the starts it sometimes makes, shew that the most sleepy sinners have some troublesom dreams, yet if it doth not throughly awake in this world, it will do it with a vengeance in another. Then there will be no Musick and Dancing which can cure the biting of this <hi>Tarantula</hi> within; no <hi>Opium</hi> of stupidity or Atheism will be able to give one minutes rest. How will men then curse themselves for their own folly in being so easily tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted; <note place="margin">E</note> and all those who laid traps and snares to betray them by? what different apprehensions of sin will they have then, from what they have now, while they are beset with temptations to it? O, will a forsaken sinner then say, had I ever believed as I
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:97974:114"/>
ought to have done, that this would have been the fruit of a <note place="margin">A</note> sinful life, I should have taken more care to prevent this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery than I have done! But O the solly of intemperance, the mischief of ambition, the rage of lust, the unfatiableness of covetousness, the madness of debauchery, and the dulness of Atheism, what have ye now brought me to, with all your pleasures and promises and flatteries while I lost my soul in your service! O that I had time, to grow wise, again; and once more to try whether I could withstand the cheats and witchcraft of a deceitful world! Now all my sins are as fresh before me, as if committed yesterday, and their burden is heavier than the <note place="margin">B</note> weight of mountains however light I made of them then; I need no judge to condemn me but my own conscience; O that I could as easily see an end of my misery, as I do that I have deserved that there should be none. Thus shall the book of conscience be opened at that day in the heart of every impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent sinner, wherein like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> roul he finds written with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without, <note n="a" place="margin">Ezek. 2. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>lamentation and mourning and Woe.</hi> Yet this will not be the only terrour in the proceedings of that day, that all the sins that ever wicked men committed will be set in order before them with their several circumstances and <note place="margin">C</note> aggravations, although the remembrance of them cannot be without extreme horrour and amazement; but that they must undergo a strict and severe examination of all their actions by a most powerful, holy and just Judge. And if it be so trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesom a thing to them in this world to go down into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or to call to remembrance their own wicked actions which they have loved and delighted in; what will it be when they must all be brought forth before the judgement seat of Christ who hates and abhorrs them? If men can so hardly endure to have the deformity of their vices represented to <note place="margin">D</note> them though very imperfectly here, how will they bear the dissecting and laying them open in the view of the whole world? When the smallest fibres and the most subtile threads in our hearts shall be curiously examined, and the influence they have had upon our actions fully discovered. When sins that have been dispised for their littleness, or unregarded for their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, or laughed at as no sins at all, shall appear to have had a greater venom in them, than men would imagine. What shall they think then of their great and presumptuous sins; whereby they have not only offered violence to God and <note place="margin">E</note> his Laws, but to the dictates of their own consciences in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them? Never think that length of time will abate the severity of the enquiry, or lessen the displeasure of God against thee for them. Remember the case of <hi>Amalek,</hi> how God
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:97974:114"/>

The Judge himself hath told us before hand what it shall be, to make us more apprehensive of it in this State, wherein we are capable to prevent it by sincere repentance and a holy life. The tenour of it is expressed in those dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful words, <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> It is impossible to conceive words fuller of horrour and amazement than those are, to such as duly consider the importance of them. It is true <note place="margin">B</note> indeed wicked men in this world are so little apprehensive of the misery <hi>of departing from God,</hi> that they are ready to bid God depart from them, and place no mean part of their felicity in keeping themselves at a distance from him. The true reason of which is, that while they pursue their lusts, the thoughts of God are disquieting to them; as no man that robs his neighbour loves to think of the Judge while he does it, not as though his condition were securer by it, but when men are not wise enough to prevent a danger, they are so great fools to count in their wisdom not to think of it. But therein lies a <note place="margin">C</note> great part of the misery of another world, that men shall not be able to cheat and abuse themselves with false notions, and shews of happiness. The clouds they have embraced for Deities shall then vanish into smoke; all the satisfaction they ever ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined in their lusts shall be wholly gone, and nothing but the sad remembrance of them, lest behind to torment them. All the Philosophy in the world will never make men understand their true happiness so much, as one hours experience of another State will do: all men shall know better, but some shall be more happy and others more miserable by it. The righteous shall not <note place="margin">D</note> only see God, but know what the seeing of God means, and that the greatest happiness we are capable of is implyed therein; and the wicked shall not only be bid to depart from him, but shall then find that the highest misery imaginable is comprehended in it. It is a great instance of the weakness of our capacities here, that our discourses concerning the happiness and misery of a future life, are like, those of Children about affairs of State, which they represent to themselves in a way agreeable to their own Childish fancies; thence the Poctical dreams of <hi>Elysian</hi> fields, and turning wheels and rouling stones and such <note place="margin">E</note> like imaginations. Nay, the Scripture it self sets forth the joys and torments of another world in a way more suited to our fancy than our understanding; thence we read <hi>of sitting down with</hi> Abraham, Isaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob to represent the happiness
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:97974:116"/>
of that State, and of <hi>a gnawing worm,</hi> and a <hi>devouring</hi> fire <note place="margin">A</note> and <hi>blackness of darkness</hi> to set forth the misery of it But as the happiness of heaven doth infinitely exceed the most lofty metaphors of Scripture, so doth the misery of hell the most dreadful representation that can be made of it. Although a worm gnawing our entrails, and a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Take a man that afflicts himself under the sense of some intolerable disgrace, or calamity befallen him; <note place="margin">B</note> or that is oppressed with the guilt of some horrid wickedness, or sunk into the depth of despair; the Agonies and torments of his mind may make us apprehend the nature of that misery, although he falls short of the degrees of it. And were this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery to be of no long continuance, yet the terror of it must needs be great; but when <hi>the worm shall never dye,</hi> and <hi>the fire shall never be quenched,</hi> when insupportable misery shall be everlasting, nothing can then be added to the terrour of it: and this is as plainly contained in the sentence of wicked men, as any thing else is. But here men think they may justly <note place="margin">C</note> 
                     <hi>plead with God and talk with him of his judgements;</hi> what proportion, say they, is there, <hi>between the sins of this short life and the eternal misery of another?</hi> which objection is not so great in it self as it appears to be by the weak answers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which have been made to it; When to assign a proportion, they have made a strange kind of infinity in sin either from the object, which unavoidably makes all sins equal, or from the wish of a sinner that he might have an eternity to sin in, which is to make the justice of Gods punishments to be not according to their works, but to their wishes; But we need not strain things <note place="margin">D</note> so much beyond what they will bear to vindicate Gods justice in this matter. Is it not thought just and reasonable among men, for a man to be confined to perpetual imprisonment for a fault he was not half an hour in committing? Nay do not all the Laws of the world make death the punishment of some crimes, which may be very suddenly done? And what is death, but the eternal depriving a man of all the comforts of life? And shall a thing then so constantly practised and universally justified in the world, be thought unreasonable when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to God? <hi>It is true,</hi> may some say <hi>if annihilation were</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">E</note> 
                     <hi>all that was meant by eternal death, there could be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception against it:</hi> but I ask, whether it would be unjust for the Laws of men to take away the lives of offenders in case their souls <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

loss of life? if not, why shall not God preserve the honour <note place="margin">A</note> of his Laws, and vindicate his Authority in governing the world, by sentencing obstinate sinners to the greatest misery, though their souls live for ever in the apprehension of it? Especially since God hath declared these things so evidently before hand, and made them part of his Laws, and set ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life on the other side to ballance everlasting misery, and proposed them to a sinners choice in such a manner, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but contempt of God and his grace, and wilful impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency can ever betray men into this dreadful State of eternal destruction. <note place="margin">B</note>

If the conflagration of the world were an impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, how came it to be so anciently received by the eldest and wisest Philosophers?

                  <p n="1">1. There is no reason to expect any other argument should <note place="margin">E</note> perswade men if this of the terror of the Lord do it not. If an almighty power cannot awaken us, if infinite justice cannot affright us, if a judgement to come cannot make us tremble, and eternal misery leave no impression upon us, what other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:97974:117"/>
or methods can we imagine would reclaim us from our <note place="margin">A</note> sins? We have been too sad an instance our selves, of the ineffectualness of other means of amendment by the mercies and judgements of this present life: have ever any people had a greater mixture of both these, than we have had in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of a few years? If the wisest persons in the world had been to have set down beforehand the method of reforming a sinful nation, they could have pitched upon none more effectual than what we have shewed not to be so. First they would have imagined, that after enduring many miseries and hardships, when they were almost quite sunk under dispair, if God should <note place="margin">B</note> give them a sudden and unexpected deliverance, meer ingenuity and thankfulness would make them afrid to displease a God of so much kindness. But if so great a flash of joy and prosperity instead of that should make them grow wanton and extravagant, what a course then so likely to reclaim them, as a series of smart and severe judgements one upon another, which might sufficiently warn yet not totally destroy. These we have had experience of, and of worse than all these, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are not amended by them. For are the Laws of God less broken, or the duties of Religion less contemned and despised <note place="margin">C</note> after all these? What vices have been forsaken, what lusts have men been reclaimed from, nay what one sort of sin hath been less in fashion than before? Nay have not their number as well as their aggravation, increased among us? Is our zeal for our established Religion greater? Is our faith more firm and setled, our devotion more constant, our Church less in danger of either of the opposite factions than ever it was? Nay is it not rather like a neck of land between two rough and boyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous seas, which rise and swell, and by the breaches they make in upon us, threaten an inundation? By all which we see what <note place="margin">D</note> necessity there is that God should govern this world by the considerations of another; that when neither judgements nor mercies can make men better in this life; judgement without mercy should be their portion in another. O the infatuating power of sin! when neither the pity of an indulgent Father, nor the frowns of a severe Judge can draw us from it: when neither the bitter passion of the Son of God for our sins, nor his threatning to come again to take vengeance upon us for them, can make us hate and abhorr them: when neither the shame nor contempt, the diseases and reproaches which follow sin in this <note place="margin">E</note> world; nor the intollerable anguish and misery of another can make men sensible of the folly of them so as to forsake them. Could we but represent to our minds that State wherein we must all shortly be, when the bustle and hurry, the pleasures
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:97974:118"/>
and diversions, the courtships and entertainments of this world <note place="margin">A</note> shall be quite at an end with us, and every one must give an account of himself to God; what another opinion of these things should we have in our minds, with what abhorrency should we look upon every temptation to sin, how should we loath the sight of those who either betrayed us into sin or flattered us when we had committed it? Could men but ask themselves that reasonable question, why they will defie God by violating his known Laws, unless they be sure he either cannot or will not punish them for it? thy would be more afraid of doing it than they are, for supposing both, to do it, is perfect madness: <note place="margin">B</note> to question his power who is Almighty, or his will who hath declared it and is immutable is the height of folly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The condition of such is desperate whom no arguments can perswade to leave their sins. For there can be no breaking prison in that other State, no escaping tryal, no corrupting the Judge, no reversing the sentence, no pardon after judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, no reprieve from punishment, no abatement or end of misery. How canst thou then hope O impenitent sinner, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to fly from or to endure that wrath of God that is coming swiftly upon thee to arrest thee by death, and convey thee to <note place="margin">C</note> thy tormenting prison? canst thou hope, that God will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thee before that dreadful day comes, when he hath confined thee thither in order to it? Canst thou hope that day will never come which the vindication of Gods justice, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Christ, the happiness of the blessed, as well as the punishment of the wicked make so necessary that it should come? or canst thou hope, to defend thy self, against an all seeing eye, a most righteous Judge and an accusing conscience when that day doth come? when all the mercies thou hast abused, the judgements thou hast slighted, the motions of grace thou <note place="margin">D</note> hast resisted, the checks of conscience thou hast stifled, and the sins of all kinds thou hast committed, shall rise up in judgement to condemn thee? O that we had all the wisdom to consider of these things in time, that the terror of the Lord may perswade us to break off all our sins by a sincere repentance, and to live so that we may dye with comfort, and be for ever with the Lord in his eternal Joy. <note place="margin">E</note>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F we look into the twenty fourth verse of this Chapter we shall find our Saviour there, laying down such hard conditions of mens being his Disciples, as were, to all <note place="margin">D</note> appearance, more likely to have driven away those which he had already, than to have drawn any others after him: For he requires no less than the greatest readiness to suffer for his sake, and that to no meaner a degree than the loss of what is most precious to men in this world, in their lives; which is implyed in those words; <hi>If any man will come after me let him deny himself, and take up his Cross and follow me.</hi> If our Saviour had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly designed to have made himself great by the number of his followers, if he had intended a Kingdom in this world, as the <note place="margin">E</note> Jews imagined, he would have made more easie conditions of being his Disciples; He would have chosen another way to have attained his end, and made use of more pleasing and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular arguments to have perswaded the people to follow him.
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:97974:119"/>
When the Eastern Impostor afterwards began to set up for a new <note place="margin">A</note> Religion, he took a method as contrary to our Saviours as his Religion and design was: he knew the Greatness and Honour, the pleasures and the pomp of this world, were the things most passionately loved and admired by the generality of mankind; and therefore he fitted his Religion to the natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, and proposed such means of advancing it as were most like to make men great by undertaking them. And men are never so willing to be cheated by any Religion, as that which complies with their present interests and gratifies their sensual inclinations. In this case there need not many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments <note place="margin">B</note> to court persons to embrace that which they were so strongly inclined to before; and the very name of Religion does them great service when it allows what they most desire, and makes them sin with a quiet Conscience.</p>
                  <p>But that is the peculiar honor of Christianity, that as it can never be suspected to be a design for this world, so it hath risen and spread it self by ways directly contrary to the Splendor and Greatness of it: For it overcame by sufferings, increased by persecutions, and prevailed in the world by the patience and self-denial of its followers. He that was the first Preacher of <note place="margin">C</note> it, was the greatest example of suffering himself; and he bids his Disciples not to think much of following their Lord and Saviour though it were <hi>to take up the Cross</hi> and lay down their lives for his sake. We may easily imagine how much startled and surprized his Disciples were at such discourses as these, who being possessed with the common opinion of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdom of the Messias, came to him with great expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of honour and advancement by him; and no less would content some of them, than being his highest Favourites and Ministers of State <hi>suting at his right hand, and at his left</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <hi>hand in his Kingdom:</hi> they had already in their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shared the preferments and dignities of his Kingdom among themselves; and were often contending about prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, <hi>who should be the greatest among them.</hi> Insomuch, that when Christ now, the time of his suffering approaching, began more plainly to discourse to them of <hi>his own sufferings at</hi> Hierusalem, <hi>v.</hi> 21. St. <hi>Peter,</hi> either out of his natural for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwardness and heat, or being elevated by the good opinion which our Lord had expressed of him before <hi>v.</hi> 17. takes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him very solemnly to rebuke him for ever thinking to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <note place="margin">E</note> himself to so mean a condition; <hi>Be it far from thee, Lord; this shall not be unto thee,</hi> v. 22. upon which, Jesus not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproves <hi>Peter</hi> with great smartness and severity, as savo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more of the pomp and ease of the world, than of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:97974:119"/>
and design of his Kingdom; <hi>v.</hi> 23. but takes this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">A</note> to tell his Disciples, that they must no longer dream of the Glories and Splendor of this world, nor entertain themselves with vain Fancies of the Pleasures and contentments of this life; but if they would shew themselves to be truly his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they must prepare for persecutions and Martyrdoms, they must value their Religion above their lives; for the time was now coming on, they must part with one or the other; and if they were not prepared beforehand by self-denial and taking up the Cross, they would run great hazard of losing their souls for the love of this world: and therefore our Saviour <note place="margin">B</note> shews,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The great advantage that would accrue to them; if they were willing to suffer for his sake. <hi>Whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it,</hi> v. 25. <hi>i. e.</hi> instead of this short and uncertain life, which would spend it self in a little time, he should have one infinitely more valuable; and therefore no exchange could be better made, than that of laying down such a life as this for one of eternal Happiness and Glory; for so our Saviour elsewhere explains it <hi>he that hateth his life in this world, shall keep it unto life eternal, St.</hi> John 12. 25. <note place="margin">C</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The great folly of losing this eternal state of happiness for the preservation of this present life, or the enjoyment of the things of this world: which he first lays down as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth, v. 25. <hi>For whosoever will save his life shall lose it,</hi> and then discovers the folly of it in the words of the text, by comparing such a mans gain and his loss together, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing he should obtain the utmost that can be hoped for in this world. <hi>For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherein we may consider these three particulars;</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The possibility supposed of losing the soul; though a man should gain the whole world.</item>
                     <item>2. The hazard implied of the loss of the soul for the sake of the gain of the world.</item>
                     <item>3. The folly expressed of losing the soul, though it be for the gain of the whole world.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. The possibility supposed of the loss of the soul in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world; For the force of our Saviours argument depends wholly on the supposition of the certainty of the souls Being <note place="margin">E</note> in another state; and its capacity of happiness or misery there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For, setting that aside there can be no argument strong enough to perswade any man to part not only with what he hath or hopes for in this life, but with life it self. He that is
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:97974:120"/>
so great a Fool to be an Athiest, would yet be much more so <note place="margin">A</note> to be a Martyr for his opinion. What is there could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the loss of life, to a man that believes that there is nothing after it? But supposing there should be a life to come, as it is impossible to give any demonstration to the contrary, what madness would it be, for a man to run himself into the miseries of another world with a design to prove there is none? If all that our Saviour had meant, were only to represent the folly of a person, that would lay down his life for the purchase of an estate, (for so the soul is often taken for the life) that would not have reached the scope and design of his discourse. <note place="margin">B</note> And no instances can be produced of such a kind of folly, which would be as great as for a man to lose his head for a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or to purchase the lease of his life by destroying himself. But supposing this to be a Proverbial speech, yet the folly of losing a mans life for the gain of the whole world is not brought in by our Saviour meerly for it self: but as it doth much more represent the unspeakable folly of such who for the love of this world will venture the loss of an eternal endearing life, and all the misery which is consequent upon it. If that man would gain nothing by his bargains but the reputation of a Fool, that <note place="margin">C</note> for the possession of the whole world for one moment, would be content to be killed in the next; how much greater folly are they guilty of, that for the sake of this world and the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of their lives here, expose themselves to all the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of another life, which God hath threatned or their souls can undergo? It is such a loss of the soul which is here spo ken of, as is consistent with the preservation of this present life; <hi>for whosoever</hi> saith Christ, <hi>will save his life shall lose it;</hi> and to those words before, these of the text have a particular reference, and therefore must be understood not of losing this <note place="margin">D</note> life, but of the loss of the Soul in a future state.</p>
                  <p>And this loss cannot be understood of the souls annihilation or ceasing to be, as soon as the life is gone; for that being supposed, he would be the happiest man that had the most of this world at his command and enjoyed the greatest pleasure in it. So St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself determines, that if there were no fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture state, the Epicureans argument would take place, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor 15. 32.</note> 
                     <hi>Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die:</hi> and he reckons those among the most miserable of all mankind who ventured the loss of all that is accounted desirable in this world and of their <note place="margin">E</note> lives too; if there were not a better life to come. <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor 15. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>For if in this life only we have hope in Christ,</hi> saith he, <hi>we are of all men the most miserable.</hi> So that the strength of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours discourse depends upon the supposition of the immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:97974:120"/>
of the soul; and its capacity of being happy or miserable in <note place="margin">A</note> a future state.</p>
                  <p>And it is the great commendation of the Christian Religion, that the particular duties required in it are established on the same Foundations that natural Religion is, which are the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a Deity and the immortality of the Soul. <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>For he that comes unto God must believe that he it, and that he is a rewarder of them that seek him;</hi> which being spoken with a respect to one who for being good was translated out of this world, must refer to the rewards of a future life. And we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire no more than these common principles of Religion to make <note place="margin">B</note> the most difficult duties of Christianity appear reasonable to mankind. For it is upon the account of this future state of the soul, that it is our most just and necessary care to look after the welfare of our souls in the first place, <hi>to seek the Kingdom of God the and righteousness thereof,</hi> before the concernments of this present life, because a state that endures for ever ought to be preferred before a short and uncertain abode in this world. It is this, which makes it reasonable to please God, though to the displeasing our selves and the crossing our natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; because eternal happiness and misery depends upon <note place="margin">C</note> his favor or displeasure. It is this, which obliges men to the greatest care of their actions, because their future state in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, will be according to their lives here, for <hi>every man shall then receive according to his works.</hi> It is this, which ought to keep men from all fleshly lusts, not meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are inconvenient for their bodies, but <hi>because they war against their souls.</hi> It is this, which makes the love of this world so dangerous a thing, because it draws away the hearts and affections of men from things that are above and fixes them upon things below. It is this, which makes it necessary for <note place="margin">D</note> us to subdue our passions, to conquer temptations, to forgive injuries, to be patient under afflictions, and to lay down our lives for Religion, because <hi>there will be a reward for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> and the happiness of another state will make abundant recompence for all the difficulties of this.</p>
                  <p>So that in the Gospel the doctrine of the souls immortality is not spoken of as the nice speculation of subtile and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative men; nor meerly supposed as a foundation of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but it is interwoven in the substance of it, and adds strength to all its parts. For herein we find the immortality <note place="margin">E</note> of the soul not barely asserted, nor proved by uncertain argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor depending on the opinion of Philosophers; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered with the greatest authority, revealed with the clearest light, and confirmed by the strongest evidence. If any one
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:97974:121"/>
can make known to mankind the state of souls in another <note place="margin">A</note> world it must be God himse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lf; if ever it was made known plainly by him it must be in the Gospel, whereby <note n="a" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>life and immortality are brought to light;</hi> if ever any arguments were proper to convince mankind of it, they are such as are contained therein. For it is not barely the resurrection of our Lord, which is a manifest evidence of the truth of the souls subsisting after a real death; but the whole design of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and the Christian Religion is built upon it. So that if we suppose the immortality of the soul the Christian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appears more reasonable by it; but if we suppose the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine <note place="margin">B</note> of Christ to be true there can be no doubt left of the immortality of the soul; and whatever arguments we have to prove the truth of this doctrine by, the same do of necessity prove the certainty of the souls immortality.</p>
                  <p>I confess many subtile arguments have been used by those who never knew any thing of divine revelation to prove the soul to be of such a nature, that it was not capable of dying with the body; and some of them such as none of their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were ever able to answer. For the most common acts of sense are unaccountable in a meer Mechanical way; and after all <note place="margin">C</note> the attemps of the most witty and industrious men I despair of ever seeing the powers of meer matter raised to a capacity of performing the lowest acts of perception; and much more of those nobler faculties of memory, understanding and will. But although the arguments from hence are sufficient to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the belief of the souls immortality to all considering men; yet the far greatest part of mankind was never so; and a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of so great consequence as this is, ought to be proposed in the most plain, most certain, and most effectual manner.</p>
                  <p>While these disputes were managed among the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers <note place="margin">D</note> of old, though those who asserted the immortality of the soul had the better reason of their side; yet their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries spake with greater confidence; and that always bears the greatest sway among injudicious people. And some men are always fond of a reputation for wit by opposing common opinions though never so true and useful: especially when they serve a bad end in it and do thereby plead for their own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties. But it cannot be denied, that those who were in the right did likewise give too great advantage to their enemies, partly by their own diffidence and distrust of what they had <note place="margin">E</note> contended for, partly from the too great niceness and subtilty of their arguments, partly from the ridiculous fopperies which they maintained together with that of the souls immortality, as the transmigration of them into the bodies of Brutes and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:97974:121"/>
such like. But the main disadvantage of all to the world was, that the immortality of the soul was rather insisted on as a <note place="margin">A</note> Principle of Philosophy than of Religion. Some of the best of their arguments were such as made the souls of Brutes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal as well as those of men; and those could not be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to have any great force on the lives of men, which would equally hold for such creatures which were not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of rewards and punishments in another life. But therein lies the great excellency of the doctrine of the souls immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as it is discovered in the Gospel, not only that it comes from him who best understands the nature of souls, but is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in such a manner as is most effectual for the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">B</note> of mankind. For the fullest account herein given of it is by the rewards and punishments of another life; and those not Poetically described by fictions and Romances; but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the plainess of truth, the gravity of a Law, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of a Judge, the authority of a Lawgiver, the Majesty of a Prince, and the wisdom of a Deity. Wherein the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness described is such as the most excellent minds think it most desireable; and the misery so great as all that consider it, must think it most intolerable. And both these are set forth <note place="margin">C</note> with so close a respect to the actions of this life, that every one must expect in another world, according to what he doth in this.</p>
                  <p>How is it then possible that the doctrine of the souls being in another state, could be recommended with greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to mankind, than it is in the Gospel? and what is there can be imagined to take off the force of this, but the proving an absolute incapacity in the soul of subsisting after death? It is true indeed in the state of this intimate union and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction between the soul and body, they do suffer mutually <note place="margin">D</note> from each other. But if the souls suffering on the account of the body, as in diseases of the brain, be sufficient to prove there is no soul; why may not the bodies suffering on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the soul, as in violent passions of the mind, as well prove that there is no body? It is not enough then to prove that the soul doth in some things suffer from the body; (for so doth the Child in the Mothers womb from the distempers of its Mother, yet very capable of living when separated from her) but it must be shewed that the soul is not distinct from the body to prove it uncapable of being without it. <note place="margin">E</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But on the other side, I shall now shew that there is nothing unreasonable in what the Scripture delivers concerning the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal state of the Souls of men, as to future rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, because there are those things now in them consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:97974:122"/>
as distinct from their bodies, which make them capable <note place="margin">A</note> of either of them. And those are,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. That they are capable of pleasure and pain distinct from the body.</item>
                     <item>2. That they have power of determining their own actions.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. That the souls of men are capable of pleasure and pain distinct from the pleasure and pain of the body. Whereever pleasure and pain may be, there must be a capacity of rewards and punishments, for a reward is nothing but the heightning of pleasure, and punishment an increase of pain; And if there be both these in men of which no account can be given from <note place="margin">B</note> their bodies, there must be a nobler principle within, which we call the Soul, which is both the cause and the subject of them. We may as easily imagine that a Fox should leave his prey to find out a demonstration in <hi>Euclid,</hi> or a Serpent attempt the squaring of the circle in the dust, or all the Fables of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sop</hi> become real histories, and the Birds and Beasts turn Wits and Polititians, as be able to give an account of those we call plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the mind from the affections of the body. The tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport of joy which <hi>Archimedes</hi> was in at the finding out his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired <hi>Problem,</hi> was a more certain evidence of the real plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures <note place="margin">C</note> of the mind, than the finding it was of the greatness of his wit. Could we ever think that men who understood them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves would spend so much time in lines, and numbers, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and examining Problems and Demonstrations which depend upon them, if they found not a great delight and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in the doing of it? But whence doth this pleasure arise? not from seeing the figures, or meer drawing the lines, or calculating the numbers, but by deducing the just and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary consequences of one thing from another; which would afford no more pleasure to a man without his soul, than a book <note place="margin">D</note> of <hi>Geometry</hi> would give to a herd of Swine. It is the Soul alone which takes pleasure in the search and finding out such Truths, which can have no kind of respect to the body; it is that, which can put the body out of order with its own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, by spending so much time in contemplation as may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust the spirits, abate the vigor of the body and hasten its decay. And while that droops and sinks under the burden, the soul may be as vigorous and active in such a consumptive state of the body as ever it was before, the understanding as clear, the memory as strong, the entertainments of the mind as great, <note place="margin">E</note> as if the body were in perfect health. It is a greater and more manly pleasure, which some men take in searching into the nature of these things in the world than others can take in the most voluptuous enjoyment of them; the one can
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:97974:122"/>
only satisfie a bruitish appetite while, it may be, something <note place="margin">A</note> within is very unquiet and troublesom; but the other brings a solid pleasure to the mind without any regret or distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance from the body. By this we see, that setting aside the consideration of Religion, the mind of man is capable of such pleasures peculiar to it self, of which no account could be given, if there were not a spiritual and therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Being within us, not only distinct from the body, but very far above it. But the very capacity of Religion in mankind doth yet further evidence the truth of it. I would fain understand how men ever came to be abused <note place="margin">B</note> with the notion of Religion, as some men are willing to think they are, if there were not some faculties in them above those of sense and imagination? For where we find nothing else but these, we see an utter incapacity of any such thing as Religion is; in some brute creatures we find great subtilty and strange imitations of reason; but we can find nothing like Religion among them. How should it come to be otherwise among men, if imagination were the highest facultie in man; since the main principles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are as remote from the power of imagination as may <note place="margin">C</note> be? What can be thought more repugnant to all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions we take in by our senses, than the conception of a Deity and the future State of Souls is? How then come the impressions of these things to sink so deep into humane nature, that all the art and violence in the world can never take them out? The strongest impressions upon all other Beings are such as are suitable to their natures, how come those in mankind to be such as must be supposed to be not only above but contrary to them if an immortal soul be not granted? If men had no principle within them, beyond that <note place="margin">D</note> of sense, nothing would have been more easie, than to have shaken off the notion of a Deity and all apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a future State: But this hath been so far from ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, that it is a thing utterly impossible to be done: all the wit and arts, all the malice and cruelty, all the racks and torments that could yet be thought on could not alter mens perswasions of the Christian Religion, much less raze out the Foundations of Natural Religion in the world. But what imaginable account can be given of the joys and pleasures, which the Martyrs of old expressed under the <note place="margin">E</note> most exquisite torments of their bodies; if their minds were not of a far nobler and diviner nature than their bodies were? Although a natural stupidity and dulness of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per may abate the sense of pain, although an obstinate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:97974:123"/>
may keep men from complaining of it; yet, not only to <note place="margin">A</note> bear the Cross but to embrace it; to be not only patient but pleasant under tortures; nay, to sing with greater joy in the flames than others do when they are heated with wine, doth not only shew that there is something within us capable of pleasure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the body, but that the pleasures of it may be so great as to swallow up the pains of the body. But I need not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to such great and extraordinay instances; (although suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently attested by such who saw and heard them) for every good man hath that inward pleasure in being and doing good, which he would not part with for all the greatest Epicurism in <note place="margin">B</note> the world. And where there is, or may be so great pleasure, no wonder if there be likewise a sense of pain proportionable to it; witness those gripes and tortures of Conscience which wicked men undergo from the reflection upon themselves; when their own evil actions fill them with horror and amazement, when the cruelties they have used to others return with greater violence upon their own minds, when the unlawful pleasures of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy prove the greatest vexation to their souls, and the weight of their evil actions sinks them under despair and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehensions of future misery. These are things we <note place="margin">C</note> need not search histories, or cite ancient authors for; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans own Conscience will tell him, if he hath not lost all sense of good and evil; that as there is a real pleasure in doing good, there is the greatest inward pain in doing evil. Having thus shewed that the soul of man is capable of pleasure and pain in this present state distinct from the body, it thence follows that it is capable of rewards and punishments, when it shall be separated from it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the souls of men have a power of determining their own actions; without which there could be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable <note place="margin">D</note> account given of the rewards and punishments of another life. Were I to prove liberty in man from the supposition of Religion I know no argument more plain or more convincing than that which is drawn from the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of future rewards and punishments: but being now to prove a capacity of rewards and punishments from the consideration of Liberty, I must make use of other means to do it by. And what can be imagined greater evidence in Beings capable of reflecting upon themselves, than the constant sense and experience of all mankind? Not that all men are agreed in <note place="margin">E</note> their opinions about these things; (for even herein men shew their liberty, by resisting the clearest evidence to prove it) but that every man finds himself free in the determining his moral actions. And therefore he hath the same reason to believe this,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:97974:123"/>
which he hath of his own Being or understanding. For what <note place="margin">A</note> other way hath a man to know that he understands himself or any thing else, but the sense of his own mind? and those who go about to perswade men that they think themselves free when they are not, may in the next place perswade them that they think they understand when they do not. Nay, they might hope in the first place to perswade men out of their understandings, for we are not so competent judges of the more necessary and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural acts, for men understand whether they will or no, as of the more free and voluntary; for in this case every man can when he pleases put a tryal upon himself, and like the confuting the <note place="margin">B</note> arguments against motion by moving, can shew the folly of all the pleas for fatal necessity by a freedom of action. But if once this natural liberty be taken away, wisdom and folly as well as vice and vertue would be names invented to no purpose, no men can be said to be better or wiser than others, if their actions do not depend on their own choice and consideration, but on a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den train of causes which it is no more in a mans power to hinder than in the earth to hinder the falling of rain upon it. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sense and reason may prevail upon mankind, not to fancy themselves under invisible chains and fetters, of which they can <note place="margin">C</note> have no evidence or experience; we may thence infer the souls capacity of rewards and punishments in another life, since hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness and misery are set before them, and it must be their own voluntary choice which brings them to either of them: When either by their own folly they run themselves upon ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting ruine, or by making use of the assistance of divine grace they become capable of endless Joy. But since men have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a power of governing themselves, but are capable of doing it by considerations as remote from the things of sense as Heaven is from Earth; it is not conceivable there should be such a power <note place="margin">D</note> within us, if there were not an immortal soul which is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it. For what is there that hath the shadow of liberty in meer matter? what is there of these inferiour creatures that can act by consideration of future things, but only man? Whence comes man to consider but from his reason? or to guide himself by the consideration of future and eternal things, but from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal principle within him; which alone can make things at a distance to be as present, can represent to it self the infinite pleasures and unconceivable misery of an eternal state in such a manner as to direct the course of this present life in order to <note place="margin">E</note> the obtaining of the one and avoiding of the other. And thus much concerning the supposition here made of the loss of the soul, and its immortality implied therein.</p>
                  <p>I come to consider the hazard of losing the soul for the gain of this world. F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

case, the better to represent the folly of losing the soul for the <note place="margin">A</note> sake of the world; yet he doth imply the danger may be as great, although a mans ambition never comes to be so extravagant, as to aim at the possession of the whole world. The whole world can never make amends for the loss of the soul; yet the soul may be lost for a very inconsiderable part of it; although all the wealth and treasures of the <hi>Indies</hi> can never compensate to a man the loss of his life, yet that may be in as great danger of losing upon far easier terms than those are. It is not to be thought that those whom our Saviour speaks to, could ever propose such vast designs to themselves as the Empire of the whole world was; but, he tells <note place="margin">B</note> them, if that could be supposed, it were far more desirable to save a soul than to gain the world, yet such is the folly of mankind to lose their souls for a very small share of this present world. For the temptations of this world are so many, so great, so pleasing to mankind, and the love of life so natural and so strong, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerate men will run any hazard of their souls for the gain of one or preservation of the other. The highest instance of this kind is that which our Saviour here intends, when men will make shipwrack of faith and a good conscience to escape the danger of their lives; or with <hi>Iudas</hi> will betray their Saviour for some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <note place="margin">C</note> gain although very far short of that of the whole world. And if I be not much mistaken, it is upon this account, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour pronounces it so hard <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 19. 23, 24. Mark. 10. 24, 25. Luke 18. 24, 25.</note> 
                     <hi>for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> because in such difficult times of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution on the account of Religion as those were; such men would be shrewdly tempted to venture the loss of their souls in another world rather than of their estates in this. For it was the young mans unwillingness to part with his great possessions to follow Christ, which gave him occasion to utter that hard saying. It is on this account St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>the love of money is the root of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">D</note> 
                     <hi>all evil, which while some have coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows:</hi> It was on this account, <note n="c" place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>that</hi> Demas <hi>forsook</hi> Paul, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loved this present world:</hi> and that, <note n="d" place="margin">James 4. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>the friendship of this world is said to be enmity with God,</hi> and that our Saviour saith, <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 6. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>no man can serve two Masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other; else he will hold to the one and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the other; ye cannot serve God and Mammon.</hi> Which doth suppose that these two do require two contrary things at the same time; for if a hundred Masters did all require the same <note place="margin">E</note> thing a man might, in doing that, be said to serve them all. But when Religion requires that we must part with all for that, and the world requires that we must part with Religion to preserve our interest in it, then it is impossible to serve God and Mammon together; for we must hold to the one and dispise the other.</p>

                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:97974:124"/>
But what then? Is there no danger of the loss of the soul <note place="margin">A</note> for the sake of this world, but only in the case of persecution? then, some may say, <hi>we hope there is no fear now of mens being too rich to go to Heaven.</hi> Thanks be to God that we live in times free from such dangerous tryals as those of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution are, and wherein men may quietly enjoy their Estates, and the best Religion in the world together: but although there be no danger of splitting upon the rocks, there may be of sinking with being overcharged or springing too great a leak within us, whereby we let in more than we can be able to bear. And supposing the most prosperous and easie condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion men can fancy to themselves here; yet the things of this <note place="margin">B</note> world are so great occasions of evil, so great hindrances of good, that on these accounts men always run a mighty hazard of their souls for the sake of this world. The Devil knew well enough where his greatest strength lay, when he reserved the <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 4. 8. 9.</note> temptation of the glories of this world to the last place in dealing with Christ himself; when nothing else would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon him, he was yet in hopes that the Greatness and Splendour of this world would bring him to his terms. And surely if the Devil had not a mighty opinion of the power of <note place="margin">C</note> these charms of <hi>the Kingdoms and glory of this world,</hi> he would never have put such hard terms to them which were no less than <hi>falling down and worshipping him:</hi> which we do not find he ever durst so much as mention before till he held this bait in his hand. And although our Saviour baffled him in this his strongest temptation, yet he still finds, that far less than what he here offered, will bring men in subjection to him. How small a matter of gain will tempt some men to all the sins of lying, of fraud and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice? who pawn their souls and put them out at interest for <note place="margin">D</note> a very small present advantage, although they are sure in a very little time to lose both their interest and the Principal too.</p>
                  <p>How many for the sake of the Honours and preferments of this World are willing to do by their consciences as the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> did by his letter, lay them aside till their business be done and then expect to hear no more of them! What poor and trifling things in this world, do men continually venture their souls for? As though all were clear gains which they could put off so dead a commodity as the Salvation of their Souls for. How apt are such to applaud themselves for their <note place="margin">E</note> own skill, when meerly by a little swearing and lying and cheating, things which cost them nothing but a few words, they can defeat the designs of their enemies and compass their own! But how low is the rate of souls fallen in the esteem of such persons as these are! If they had not been of any greater value,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:97974:125"/>
they had not been worth any ordinary mans, much less, the Son <note place="margin">A</note> of Gods laying down his life for the redemption of them.

                  <p>These are men who lose their souls upon design, but there are others so prodigal of them, that they can play and sport them <note place="margin">C</note> away, or lose them only because it is the custom to do so. With whom all the reasons and arguments in the world cannot prevail to leave off their sins, if it once be accounted a fashion to commit them. Yea so dangerous things are fashionable vices, that some will seem to be worse than they are, (although few continue long Hypocritical in that way) that they might not be out of the fashion, and some will be sure to follow it (if not out-do it) though to the eternal ruin of their souls. But although all damn'd persons at the great day will be confounded and ashamed, yet none will be more ridiculously miserable than such who go to <note place="margin">D</note> Hell for fashion sake. What a strange account would this be at the dreadful day of judgement for any to plead for themselves, that they knew that chastity, temperance, sobriety and devotion were things more pleasing to God, but it was grown a Mode to be vicious, and they had rather be damned than be out of the fashion? The most charitable opinion we can have of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons now, is that they do not think they have any souls at all; for it is prodigious folly for men to believe they have souls that are immortal, and yet be so regardless of them.</p>
                  <p>Yet these who are vicious out of complyance are not the only <note place="margin">E</note> persons who shew so little care of their souls, what shall we say to those who enjoying the good things of this life, scarce ever do so much as think of another? Who are very solicitous about every little mode of attire for their bodies, and think no time long enough to be spent in the grand affairs of dressing and adorning
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:97974:125"/>
their out sides; but from one end of the year to the other never <note place="margin">A</note> spend one serious thought about eternity, or the future State of their souls. Their utmost contrivances are how to pass away their days with the greatest ease and pleasure to themselves; and never consider what will become of their souls when they come to die. Alas poor immortal souls! are they become the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible things men have about them? All care is little enough with some for the body, for the pampering and indulging of that, and making provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof; but any cure is thought too much for the soul; and no time passes so heavily away, as the hours of devotion do. The very shew of Religion is looked on as a burden, what then do they think of <note place="margin">B</note> the practice of it? The Devil himself shews a greater esteem of the souls of men, than such persons do; for he hath been always very active and industrious in seeking their ruin, but is ready enough to comply with all the inclinations of the body, or mens designs in this world; nay he makes the greatest use of these as the most powerful temptations for the ruin of their souls; by all which it is evident, that, being our greatest enemy he aims only at the ruin of that which is of greatest value and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and that is the thing so much despised by wicked <note place="margin">C</note> men, <hi>viz.</hi> the soul. These do in effect, tell the Devil he may spare his pains in tempting them; they can do his work fast enough themselves, and destroy their own souls without any help from him. And if all men were so bent upon their own ruin, the Devil would have so little to do, that he must find out some other imployment besides that of tempting to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert himself with, unless it be the greatest diversion of all to him, to see men turned Devils to themselves. But are the temptations of this world so infatuating that no reason or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration can bring men to any care of or regard to their souls? <note place="margin">D</note> we have no ground to think so, since there have been and I hope still are such, who can despise the glittering vanities, the riches and honours, the pleasures and delights of this world when they stand in competition with the eternal happiness of their souls in a better world. And that not out of a sullen humour or a morose temper, or a discontented mind; but from the most prudent weighing and ballancing the gain of this world and the loss of the soul together. <hi>For what is a man profited if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul, or what shall he give in exchange for his soul?</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. Which is the last particular, to represent the folly of losing the soul, though it were for the gain of the whole world. Which will appear by comparing the gain and the loss with each other in these 4. things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The gain here proposed is at the best but possible to one;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:97974:126"/>
but the hazard of losing the soul is certain to all. And what <note place="margin">A</note> folly is it for men to run themselves upon so great and certain danger, for so uncertain gain, which never any man yet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to, or are ever like to do it? our Saviour knew how hard a matter it was so set any bounds to the ambitious thoughts or the covetous designs of men: every step the ambitious man takes higher gives him the fairer prospect before him; it raises his thoughts, enlarges his desires, puts new projects into his mind, which like the circles of water spread still farther and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till his honour and he be both laid in the dust together: The covetous person is never satisfied with what he enjoys, the <note place="margin">B</note> more he gets, still the more he hopes for; and like the grave whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is going, is always devouring and always craving: Yet neither of these can be thought so vain as to propose no less to themselves than the Empire or riches of the whole world. But our Saviour allows them the utmost, that ever can be supposed as to mens designs for this world; let men be never so ambitious or covetous, they could desire no more than all the world; though they would have all this, yet this all would never make amends for the loss of the soul. It is a thing possible, that one person might by degrees bring the whole world in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection <note place="margin">C</note> to him, but it is possible in so remote a degree that no man in his wits can be thought to design it. How small a part of the inhabited world have the greatest Conquerours been able to subdue! and if the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Prince was ever so vain to weep that he had no more worlds to conquer, he gave others a just occasion to laugh at so much Ignorance which made him think he had conquered this. And to put a check to such a troublesome ambition of disturbing the world in others, how early was he taken away in the midst of his vast thoughts and designs? What a small thing would the compass of the whole <note place="margin">D</note> earth appear to one that should behold it at the distance of the fixed stars? and yet the mighty Empires which have made the greatest noise in the world have taken up but an inconsiderable part of the whole earth. What are then those mean designs which men continually hazard their souls for, as much as if they aimed at the whole world? For we are not to imagine that only Kings and Princes are in any hazard of losing their souls for the sake of this world; for it is not the greatness of mens condition, but their immoderate love to the world which ruins and destroys their souls. And covetousness and ambition do not always raign <note place="margin">E</note> in Courts and Palaces, they can stoop to the meanness of a Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and ruin the souls of such as want the things of this world as well as those that enjoy them. So that no state or condition of men is exempt from the hazard of losing the soul for the love of this world, although but one person can be supposed at once to have the possession of the whole world.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:97974:126"/>
2. The gain of this world brings but an imaginary happiness, <note place="margin">A</note> but the loss of the soul a most real misery. It is easie to suppose a person to have the whole world at his command and not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and how can that man be happy that is not at his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? The cares of Government in a small part of the earth are so great and troublesome, that by the consent of mankind the managers of it are invested with more than ordinary priviledges by way of recompence for them; but what are these to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous thoughts, the continual fears, the restless imployments, the uninterrupted troubles which must attend the gain of the whole world? So that after all the success of such a mans designs, <note place="margin">B</note> he may be farther off from any true contentment than he was at the beginning of them. And in that respect mens conditions seem to be brought to a greater equality in the world, because those who enjoy the most of the world do oft-times enjoy the least of themselves; which hath made some great Emperours lay down their Crowns and Scepters to enjoy themselves in the retirements of a Cloyster or a Garden. All the real happiness of this world lies in a contented mind, and that we plainly see doth not depend upon mens outward circumstances; for some men may be much farther from it in a higher condition in this world, <note place="margin">C</note> than others are, or it may be themselves have been, in a far lower. But if mens happiness did arise from any thing without them, that must be always agreeable to their outward condition; but we find great difference as to mens contentment in equal circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, and many times much greater in a private State of life, than in the most publick capacity. By which it appears, that what ever looks like happiness in this world, depends upon a mans soul and not upon the gain of the world; nay it is only from thence that ever men are able to abuse themselves with false notions and <hi>Idea</hi>'s of happiness here. But none of those shall go into another <note place="margin">D</note> world with them; farewel then to all imaginary happiness; to the pleasures of sin, and the cheats of a deceitful world; then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the dreadful apprehensions of its own misery shall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess that soul which shall then too late descern its folly, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it when it is past recovery. Then the torments of the mind shall never be imputed to melancholy vapours, or a disordered fancy. There will be no drinking away sorrows, no jesting with the sting of conscience, no playing with the flames of another world. God will then no longer be mocked by wicked men, but they shall find to their own eternal horrour and confusion, that <note place="margin">E</note> it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. He neither wants power to inflict, nor justice to execute, nor venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to pursue, nor wrath to punish; but his power is irresistible, his justice inflexible, and his wrath is insupportable. Consider now O foolish sinner that hast hither to been ready to cast away
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:97974:127"/>
thy soul upon the pleasures of sin for a season; what a wise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change <note place="margin">A</note> thou wilt make of a poor imaginary happiness for a most real and intolerable misery. What will all the gain of this world signify in that State whither we are all hastening a pace? What contentment will it be to thee then to think of all those bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vanities, which have betrayed thy soul into unspeakable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery? Wouldst thou be willing to be treated with all the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of State and Greatness for an hour or two, if thou wert sure that immediately after thou must undergo the most exquisite tortures and be racked and tormented to death? When men neglect their souls and cast them away upon the sinful pleasures <note place="margin">B</note> and gains of this world, it is but such a kind of aiery and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical happiness; but the miseries of a lost soul are infinitely beyond the racks and torments of the body. It hath sometimes happened that the horrour of despair hath seized upon mens minds for some notorious crimes in this life, which hath giyen no rest either to body or mind, but the violence of the inward pains have forced them to put an end to this miserable life; as in the case of <hi>Iudas.</hi> But if the expectation of future misery be so dreadful, what must the enduring of it be? Of all the ways of dying we can hardly imagine any more painful or full of honour <note place="margin">C</note> than that of sacrificing their Children to <hi>Moloch</hi> was among the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and Children of <hi>Ammon</hi> where the Children were put into the body of a brass Image and a fire made under it, which by degrees with lamentable shricks and cryings roasted them to death; yet this above all others in the New Testament is chosen as the fittest representation of the miseries of another world and thence the very name of <hi>Gehenna</hi> is taken. But as the joys of heaven will far surpass all the pleasure which the mind of a good man hath in this life; so will the torments of Hell as much exceed the greatest miseries of this world. <note place="margin">D</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in the most exquisite pains of the body there is that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction still left, that death will at last put an end to them; but that is a farther discovery of the unspeakable folly of losing the soul for the sake of this world, that</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The happiness of this world can last but for a little time, but the misery of the soul will have no end. Suppose a man had all the world at his command and enjoyed as much sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in it as it was possible for humane nature to have; yet the very thoughts of dying and leaving all in a short time, must needs make his happiness seem much less considerable to <note place="margin">E</note> him. And every wise man would provide most for that State wherein he is sure to continue longest. The shortness of life makes the pleasures of it less desirable, and the miseries less dreadful: but an endless State makes every thing of moment which belongs to it. Where there is variety and liberty of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:97974:127"/>
change, there is no necessity of any long deliberation before hand, <note place="margin">A</note> but for that which is to continue always the same the greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration is needful, because the very continuance of some things is apt to bring weariness and satiety with it. If a man were bound for his whole life time to converse only with one person without so much as seeing any other, he would desire time and use his best judgement in the choice of him. If one were bound to lie in the same posture without any motion but for a month together, how would he imploy his wits before hand to make it as easie and tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as might be? Thus solicitous and careful would men be for any thing that was to continue the same although but for a short <note place="margin">B</note> time here: But what are those things to the endless duration of a soul in a misery, that is a perpetual destruction, and everlasting death; always intolerable and yet must always be endured. A misery that must last when time it self shall be no more; and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most periods we can imagine fall infinitely short of the continuance of it. O the unfathomable Abysse of Eternity! how are our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations lost in the conceptions of it! But what will it then be to be swallowed up in an Abysse of misery and eternity together? And I do not know how such an eternal State of misery could have been represented in Scripture in words more Emphatical than it is; not <note place="margin">C</note> only by <hi>everlasting fire,</hi> and <hi>everlasting destrustion,</hi> but by <hi>a worm that never dyes</hi> and a <hi>fire that never goes out;</hi> and the very same expressions are used concerning the eternal State of the Blessed and the damned; so that if there were any reason to Question the one, there would be the same to question the other also.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The loss of this world may be abundantly recompenced, but the loss of the soul can never be. <hi>For what shall a man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his soul?</hi> If a man runs the hazard of losing all that is valuable or desirable in this world for the sake of his soul, heaven &amp; eternal happiness will make him infinite amends for it. He will <note place="margin">D</note> have no cause to repent of his bargain that parts with his share in this evil world for the joys and glories which are above. They who have done this in the resolution of their minds, have before hand had so great satisfaction in it, <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 5. 2. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>that they have gloried in tribulations and rejoyced in hopes of the glory of God;</hi> they have upon casting up their accounts found <note n="b" place="margin">8. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>that the sufferings of this present life are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed;</hi> because the afflictions they meet with here are <hi>but light and momentany,</hi> but that which they expected in recompence for them, <note n="c" place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>was an exceeding and an eternal weight of Glory.</hi> O <note place="margin">E</note> blessed change! what life can be so desirable as the parting with it is on such terms as these? It was the hopes of this glorious recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence which inspired so many Martyrs to adventure for heaven with so much courage, patience, and constancy in the primitive times of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:97974:128"/>
the Christian Church. How do they look down from heaven and <note place="margin">A</note> despise all the vanities of this world in comparison with what they enjoy! And if they are sensible of what is done on earth with what pity do they behold us miserable creatures, that for the sake of the honours, pleasures, or riches of this world venture the loss of all which they enjoy and thereby of our souls too! Which is a loss so great, that no recompence can ever be made for it, no price of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption can ever be accepted for the delivery of it. For even the Son of God himself who laid down his life for the redemption of souls, shall then come from heaven with flaming fire to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance on all those who so much despise the blood he hath shed for <note place="margin">B</note> them, the warnings he hath given to them, the Spirit he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised them, the reward he is ready to bestow upon them, as in spight of all to cast away those precious and immortal souls which he hath so dearly bought with his own blood.</p>
                  <p>Methinks the consideration of these things might serve to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken our security, to cure our stupidity, to check our immoderate love of this world and inflame our desires of a better. Wherein can we shew our selves men more than by having the greatest regard to that which makes us men? which is our souls. Wherein can we shew our selves Christians better, than by abstaining from all those <note place="margin">C</note> hurtful lusts which war against our souls, and doing those things which tend to make them happy? We are all walking upon the shore of eternity, and for all that we know the next tide may sweep us away; shall we only sport and play or gather cockle shells and lay them in heaps like Children, till we are snatched away past all recovery? It is no such easie matter to prevent the losing our souls as secure sinners are apt to imagine. It was certainly to very little purpose that we are bid <note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 2. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>to work out our Salvation</hi> if lying still would do it; or <note n="b" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>to give all diligence about it,</hi> if none would serve the turn: <note n="c" place="margin">Matth. 7. 14</note> 
                     <hi>or to strive to enter in at the straight gate,</hi> if it <note place="margin">D</note> were so wide to receive all sinners. No? <note n="d" place="margin">Luke 13. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Many shall seek to enter in and shall not be able,</hi> what then shall become of those that run as far from it as they can? Those, I mean, whom no intreaties of God himself, no kindness of his Son, no not the laying down his life for their souls, no checks or rebukes of their own consciences can hinder from doing those things which do without a speedy and sincere repentance exclude men from the Kingdom of heaven. O that men could at last be perswaded to understand themselves and set a just value upon their immortal souls! How would they then despile the vanities, conquer the temptations, and break through <note place="margin">E</note> the difficulties of this present world, and by that means fit their souls for the eternal enjoyment of that blessed State of souls which God the Father hath promised, his Son hath purchased, and the Holy Ghost hath confirmed.

a further account from me, concerning <hi>the true reason of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A</note> 
                        <hi>the sufferings of Christ.</hi> Wherein my design was so far <hi>from representing old Errors to the best advantage,</hi> or <hi>to rack my wits to defend them,</hi> as that person seems to suggest; that I aimed at nothing more than to give a true account of what upon a serious enquiry, I judged to be the most natural and genuine meaning of the Christian Doctrine contained in the Writings of the New Testament.</p>
                     <p>For finding therein such multitudes of expressions which to an unprejudiced mind attribute all the mighty effects of the Love of God to us, to the obedience and sufferings of Christ; <note place="margin">B</note> I began to consider what reason there was why the plain and easie sense of those places must be forsaken, and a remote and Metaphorical meaning put upon them. Which I thought my self the more obliged to do, because I could not conceive if it had been the design of the Scripture, to have delivered the received Doctrine of the Christian Church, concerning the reason of the sufferings of Christ, that it could have been more clearly and fully expressed than it is already. So that supposing that to have been the true meaning of the several places of Scripture which we contend for; yet the <note place="margin">C</note> same arts and subtilties might have been used to pervert it, which are imployed to perswade men that is not the true meaning of them. And what is equally serviceable to truth and falshood, can of it self, have no power on the minds of men to convince them it must be one, and not the other. Nay, if every unusual and improper acception of words in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, shall be thought sufficient to take away the natural and genuine sense, where the matter is capable of it; I know scarce any article of Faith can be long secure; and by these arts men may declare that they believe the Scriptures, and yet <note place="margin">D</note> believe nothing of the Christian Faith. For if the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, though unusual acception of those expressions <hi>of Christs dying for us,</hi> of <hi>redemption, propitiation, reconciliation by his blood, of his bearing our iniquities,</hi> and <hi>being made sin and a curse for us,</hi> shall be enough to invalidate all the arguments ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them to prove that which the proper sense of them doth imply; why may not the improper use of the terms of Creation and Resurrection, as well take away the natural sense of them in the great Articles of the Creation of the World, and Resurrection after death? For if it be enough to prove <note place="margin">E</note> that <hi>Christs dying for us,</hi> doth not imply <hi>dying in our stead;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause sometimes <hi>dying for others</hi> imports no more than dying for some advantage to come to them; if <hi>redemption</hi> being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times used for <hi>meer deliverance,</hi> shall make our <hi>redemption</hi> by
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:97974:130"/>
Christ, wholly <hi>Metaphorical;</hi> if the terms of <hi>propitiation recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilation,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A</note> &amp;c. shall lose their force because they are sometimes used where all things cannot be supposed parallel with the sense we contend for: why shall I be bound to believe that the World was ever created in a proper sense, since those persons against whom I argue, so earnestly contend that in those places in which it seems as proper as any, it is to be understood on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a metaphorical? If when <hi>the World and all things are said</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">John 1. 3, 10.</note> 
                        <hi>to be made by Christ,</hi> we are not to understand the production but the reformation of the World and all things in it, although the natural sense of the Words be quite otherwise; what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <note place="margin">B</note> can make it necessary for me not to understand the Creation of the World in a metaphorical sense, when <hi>Moses</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers to us the history of it? Why may not I understand <hi>in the beginning,</hi> Gen. 1. for the beginning of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, as well as <hi>Socinus</hi> doth <hi>in the beginning,</hi> John 1. for the beginning of the Evangelical? and that from the very same argument used by him, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>in the beginning</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the main subject concerning which the author in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to write, and that I am as sure it was in <hi>Moses</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Law</hi> given by him as it was in St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> concerning <note place="margin">C</note> the <hi>Gospel</hi> delivered by <hi>Christ.</hi> Why may not <hi>the Creation of the Heavens and the Earth,</hi> be no more than the erection of the Jewish Polity? since it is acknowledged, that by <hi>New Heavens and new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness,</hi> no more is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood than a new state of things under the Gospel? Why may not the <hi>confused Chaos</hi> import no more than the state of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and darkness under which the World was before the Law of <hi>Moses?</hi> since it is confessed that it signifies in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment such a state of the World before the Gospel appeared? and consequently, why may not <hi>the light which made the first</hi>

of Herbs and living Creatures,</hi> be the great encrease of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">A</note> of all sorts, as well those of a meaner rank (and therefore called herbs) as those of a higher, that were to live upon the other, and sometimes trample upon them, and therefore by way of excellency called <hi>the Living Creatures?</hi> And when these were multiplied and brought into order, (which being done by steps and degrees, is said to be finished, in several days) then the State and the Church flourished and enjoyed a great deal of pleasure, which was the production of Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and their being placed in Paradise (for <hi>a perfect Man,</hi> notes a high degree of perfection, and <hi>a Woman</hi> is taken for the <hi>Church</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">B</note> in the <hi>Revelations):</hi> But when they followed the Customs of other Nations which were <hi>as a forbidden tree</hi> to them, then they lost all their happiness and pleasure, and were expelled out of their own Country, and lived in great slavery and misery, which was the Curse pronounced against them, for violating the rules of Policy established among them. Thus you see how small a measure of wit, by the advantage of those ways of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting Scripture, which the subtilest of our adversaries make use of, will serve to pervert the clearest expressions of Scripture to quite another sense than was ever intended by the Writer of <note place="margin">C</note> them. And I assure you, if that rule of interpreting Scripture be once allowed, that where words are ever used in a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical sense, there can be no necessity of understanding them in a proper; there is scarce any thing which you look on as the most necessary to be believed in Scripture, but it may be made appear not to be so upon those terms: for by reason of the paucity and therefore the ambiguity of the Original words of the Hebrew language, the strange Idioms of it, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent senses of the same word in several Conjugations, the want of several modes of expression which are used in other <note place="margin">D</note> Languages, and above all the lofty and Metaphorical way of speaking used in all Eastern Countries, and the imitation of the Hebrew Idioms in the Greek translation of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Original of the New, you can hardly affix a sense upon any words used therein, but a man who will be at the pains to search all possible significations and uses of those words, will put you hard to it, to make good that which you took to be the proper meaning of them. Wherefore although I will not deny to our adversaries the praise of subtilty and diligence, I cannot give them that, (which is much more praise worthy) <note place="margin">E</note> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> of discretion and sound judgement. For while they use their utmost industry to search all the most remote and Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal senses of words, with a design to take off the genuine and proper meaning of them, they do not attend to the ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:97974:131"/>
that may be made of this to the overthrowing those <note place="margin">A</note> things, the belief of which themselves make necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For by this way the whole Gospel may be made an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, and the Resurrection of Christ be thought as metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical as the Redemption by his Death, and the sorce of all the Precepts of the Gospel avoided by some unusual signification of the words wherein they are delivered. So that nothing can be more unreasonable than such a method of proceeding, unless it be first sufficiently proved that the matter is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the proper sense, and therefore of necessity the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper only is to be allowed. And this is that which <hi>Socinus</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">B</note> seems after all his pains to pervert the meaning of the places in controversie, to rely on most; viz. <hi>That the Doctrine of satisfaction doth imply an impossibility in the thing it self,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Socia. de Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. Part. 2. Cap. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </note> 
                        <hi>and therefore must needs be false; nay,</hi> he saith <hi>the infallibility of the Revealer had not been enough in this Case, supposing that Christ had said it, and risen from the dead, to declare his own Veracity; unless he had delivered it by its proper cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and effects, and so shewed the possibility of the thing it self. And the reason,</hi> he saith, <hi>why they believe their Doctrine true, is not barely because God hath said it, but they believe certainly</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">C</note> 
                        <hi>that God hath said it, because they know it to be true;</hi> by knowing the contrary Doctrine to be impossible. The controversie then, concerning the meaning of the places in dispute is to be resolved from the nature and reasonableness of the matter contained in them: for if <hi>Socinus</hi> his reason were answerable to his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if the account we give of the sufferings of Christ, were repugnant not only to the Justice, Goodness and Grace of God, but to the nature of the thing; if it appear impossible, that mankind should be redeemed in a proper sense, or that God should be propitiated by the Death of his Son as a Sacrifice for <note place="margin">D</note> sin; if it enervate all the Precepts of Obedience, and tends ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to justifie sins than those who do repent of them, I shall then agree, that no industry can be too great in searching Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, comparing places, examining Versions, to find out such a sense as may be agreeable to the nature of things, the Attributes of God, and the design of Christian Religion. But if on the contrary, the Scripture doth plainly assert those things, from whence our Doctrine follows, and without which no reasonable account can be given either of the expressions used therein, or of the sufferings of Christ; if Christs death did <note place="margin">E</note> immediately respect God as a sacrifice, and were paid as a price for our Redemption; if such a design of his death be so far from being repugnant to the nature of God, that it highly manifests his Wisdom, Justice and Mercy; if it assert nothing but
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:97974:132"/>
what is so far from being impossible, that it is very reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the common principles of Reason, as well as the Free-Grace of God in the pardon of sin; if, being truly understood, it is so far from enervating, that it advances highly all the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of Christian Religion, then it can be no less than a betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the grand Truths of the Christian Doctrine, not to believe ours to be the true sense of the places in controversie. And this is that which I now take upon me to maintain.</p>
                     <p>For our clearer proceeding herein, nothing will be more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, than to understand the true <hi>state of the Controversie;</hi>

The state of the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</note> which hath been rendred more obscure by the mistakes of some, <note place="margin">B</note> who have managed it with greater zeal than judgement; who have asserted more than they needed to have done, and made our Adversaries assert much less than they do: And by this means have shot over their Adversaries heads, and laid their own more open to assaults. It is easie to observe, that most of <hi>Socinus</hi> his Arguments are levelled against an opinion, which few who have considered these things do maintain, and none need to think themselves obliged to do it; which is, That Christ paid a proper and rigid satisfaction for the sins of men, considered under the notion of debts, and that he paid the very <note place="margin">C</note> same, which we ought to have done; which in the sense of the Law, is never called Satisfaction, but strict payment. Against this, <hi>Socinus</hi> disputes from the impossibility of Christs paying the very same that we were to have paid; because our penalty was Eternal death, and that as the consequent of inherent guilt, which Christ neither did nor could undergo. Neither is it enough to say, <hi>That Christ had undergone Eternal death, unless he had been able to free himself from it;</hi> for the admission of one to pay for another, who could discharge the debt in much less time than the offenders could, was not the same which the Law <note place="margin">D</note> required. For that takes no notice of any other than the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who had sinned; and if a <hi>Mediator</hi> could have paid the same, the Original Law must have been disjunctive; <hi>viz.</hi> That either the Offender must suffer, or another for him; but then the Gospel had not been the bringing in of a better <hi>Covenant,</hi> but a performance of the old. But if there be a relaxation or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation of the first Law, then it necessarily follows, that what Christ paid, was not the very same which the first Law required; for what need of that, when the very same was paid that was in the obligation? But if it be said, <hi>That the Dignity of the person</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">E</note> 
                        <hi>makes up, what wanted in the kind or degree of punishment:</hi> This is a plain confession that it is not the same, but something equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, which answers the ends of the Sanction, as much as the same would have done, which is the thing we contend for. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:97974:132"/>
if the very same had been paid in the strict sense, there <note place="margin">A</note> would have followed a deliverance <hi>ipso facto;</hi> for the release immediately follows the payment of the same: and it had been injustice to have required any thing further, in order to the discharge of the Offender, when strict and full payment had been made of what was in the obligation. But we see that Faith and Repentance, and the consequences of those two, are made conditions on our parts, in order to the enjoying the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of what Christ hath procured: So that the release is not immediate upon the payment, but depends on a new contract; made in consideration of what Christ hath done and suffered <note place="margin">B</note> for us. If it be said, <hi>That by Christs payment we become his; and he requires these conditions of us;</hi> besides the contrariety of it to the Scriptures, which make the conditions to be required by him to whom the payment was made; we are to consider, that these very persons assert, that Christ paid all for us, and in our name and stead; so that the payment by Christ, was by a substitution in our room; and if he paid the same which the Law required, the benefit must immediately accrue to those in whose name the debt was paid: For what was done in the name of another, is all one to the Creditor, as if it had been done <note place="margin">C</note> by the Debtor himself. But above all things, it is impossible to reconcile the freeness of remission, with the full payment of the very same which was in the obligation. Neither will it serve to say, <hi>That though it was not free to Christ, yet it was to us:</hi> For the satisfaction and remission must respect the same person; for Christ did not pay for himself, but for us, neither could the remission be to him: Christ therefore is not considered in his own name, but as acting in our stead; so that what was free to him, must be to us; what was exactly paid by him, it is all one as if it had been done by us; so that it is impossible <note place="margin">D</note> the same debt should be fully paid and freely forgiven. Much less will it avoid the difficulty in this case to say, <hi>That it was a refusable payment;</hi> for it being supposed to be the very same, it was not in justice refusable; and however not in equity, if it answer the intention of the Law, as much as the suffering of the offenders had done; and the more it doth that, the less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusable it is. And although <hi>God himself found out the way,</hi> that doth not make the pardon free, but the designation of the person who was to pay the debt. Thus when our Adversaries dispute against this opinion, no wonder if they do it success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, <note place="margin">E</note> but this whole opinion is built upon a mistake, that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction must be the payment of the very same; which while they contend for, they give our Adversaries too great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and make them think they triumph over the Faith of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:97974:133"/>
the Church, when they do it only over the mistake of some <note place="margin">A</note> particular persons. But the foundation of this mistake, lies in the consideration of punishment, under the notion of <hi>debts,</hi> and that satisfaction therefore must be by strict payment in rigor of Law; but how great that mistake is, will appear in the subsequent discourse: but it cannot but be wondred at, that the very same persons who consider sins, as debts which must be strictly satisfied for, do withal contend for the absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of this satisfaction; whereas <hi>Socinus</hi> his Arguments would hold good, <hi>if sins were only considered as debts, and God as the meer Creditor of punishment, he might as freely part</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">B</note> 
                        <hi>with his own right without satisfaction, as any Creditor may forgive what summ he pleases, to a person indebted to him;</hi> and no reason can be brought to the contrary, from that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sins, why he may not do it. But if they be considered with a respect to Gods Government of the world, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Laws, then some further account may be given, why it may not be consistent with that, to pass by the sins of men, without satisfaction made to them.</p>
                     <p>And because the mistake in this matter, hath been the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of most of the subsequent mistakes on both sides, and <note place="margin">C</note>

Of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of debts and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> the discovery of the cause of errours, doth far more to the cure of them, than any Arguments brought against them; and withal, the true understanding of the whole Doctrine of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction depends upon it, I shall endeavour to make clear the notion under which our sins are considered; for upon that, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the nature of the satisfaction which is to be made for them. For while our Adversaries suppose, that sins are to be looked on under the notion of debts in this debate, they assert it to be wholly free for God to remit them, without any satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. They make the right of punishment meerly to depend <note place="margin">D</note> on Gods absolute Dominion; and that all satisfaction must be considered under the notion of compensation, for the injuries done to him, to whom it is to be made But if we can clearly shew a considerable difference between the notion of debts and punishments, if the right of punishment doth not depend upon meer Dominion, and that satisfaction by way of punishment, is not primarily intended for compensation, but for other ends, we shall make not only the state of the Controversie much clearer, but offer something considerable towards the resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. The way I shall take for the proof of the difference <note place="margin">E</note> between debts and punishments, shall be using the other for the Arguments for it. For besides, that those things are just in matter of debts, which are not so in the case of punishments; as, that it is lawful for a man to forgive all the debts which
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:97974:133"/>
are owing him by all persons, though they never so contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maciously <note place="margin">A</note> refuse payment, but our Adversaries will not say so in the case of sins; for although they assert, That the justice of God doth never require punishment in case of Repentance, yet withal they assert, That <hi>in case of Impenitency, it is not only agreeable, but due to the nature and decrees; and</hi>

                        <hi>therefore to the rectitude and equity of God not to give pardon.</hi> But if this be true, then there is an apparent difference between the notion of <hi>debts</hi> and <hi>punishments;</hi> for the Impenitency doth but add to the greatness of the debt: And will they say, it is only in Gods power to remit small debts, but he must <note place="margin">B</note> punish the greatest? what becomes then of Gods absolute li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to part with his own right? will not this shew more of his kindness to pardon the greater, rather than lesser offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? But if there be something in the nature of the thing, which makes it not only just, but necessary for impenitent sinners to be punished, as <hi>Crellius</hi> after <hi>Socinus</hi> frequently acknowledges, then it is plain, that sins are not to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered meerly as debts, for that obstinacy and impenitency is only punished as a greater degree of sin, and therefore as a greater debt. And withal, those things are lawful in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <note place="margin">C</note> of debts, which are unjust in the matter of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; as it is lawful for a Creditor, when two persons are considered in equal circumstances, to remit one, and not the other; nay, to remit the greater debt, without any satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and to exact the lesser to the greatest extremity; but it is unjust in matter of punishments, where the reason and circumstances are the same, for a person who hath committed a crime of very dangerous consequence, to escape unpunished, and another who hath been guilty of far less to be severely executed. Besides these considerations, I say, I shall now <note place="margin">D</note> prove the difference of debts and punishments, from those two things whereby things are best differenced from each other; <hi>viz.</hi> The different Reason, and the different End of them.</p>
                     <p>The different Reason of debts and punishments: The reason of debts is dominion and property, and the obligation of <note place="margin">§. 4. The reason of humame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is the publick interest.</note> them, depends upon voluntary contracts between parties; but the reason of punishments is Justice and Government, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not upon meer contracts, but the relation the person stands in to that Authority to which he is accountable for his actions. For if the obligation to punishment, did depend upon meer <note place="margin">E</note> contract, then none could justly be punished, but such who have consented to it by an antecedent contract: If it be said, <hi>That a contract is implied, by their being in society with others;</hi> that is as much as I desire to make the difference appear,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:97974:134"/>
for in case of debts, the obligation depends upon the voluntary <note place="margin">A</note> contract of the person; but in case of punishments, the very relation to Government, and living under Laws doth imply it. And the right of punishment depends upon the obligation of Laws, where the reason of them holds, without any express contract, or superiority of one over another; as in the case of violation of the Law of Nations, that gives right to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nation to punish the infringers of it. Otherwise Wars could never be lawful between two Nations, and none could be warrantable, but those of a Prince against his rebellious subjects, who have broken the Laws themselves consented <note place="margin">B</note> expresly to. Besides, in case of debts, every man is bound to pay, whether he be call'd upon or no; but in case of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, no man is bound to betray or accuse himself. For the obligation to payment in case of debt; ariseth from the injury sustained by that particular person, if another detains what is his own from him; but the obligation to punishment, arises from the injury the Publick sustains by the impunity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of crimes, of which the Magistrates are to take care; who by the dispensing of punishments, do shew that to be true which <hi>Grotius</hi> asserts, that if there be any Creditor to be assigned <note place="margin">C</note> in punishment, it is the publick good: Which appears by this, that all punishments are proportioned, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the offences have upon the publick interest; for the reason of punishment is not because a Law is broken, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the breach of a Law tends to dissolve the community, by infringing the Authority of the Laws, and the honour of those who are to take care of them. For if we consider it, the measure of punishments is in a well ordered State, taken from the influence which crimes have upon the peace and interest of the community. No man questions, but that Malice, Pride <note place="margin">D</note> and Avarice, are things really as bad as many faults, that are severely punished by humane Laws; but the reason these are not punished is, because they do not so much injury to the publick interest, as Theft and Robbery do. Besides, in those things wherein the Laws of a Nation are concerned, the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most rigor is not used in the preventing of crimes, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of them when committed, if such an execution may endanger the publick more than the impunity of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may do. And there are some things which are thought fit to be forbidden, where the utmost means are not used to <note place="margin">E</note> prevent them; as Merchants are forbidden to steal customs, but they are not put under an Oath not to do it. And when penalties have been deserved, the execution of them hath been deferred, till it may be most for the advantage of the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:97974:134"/>
publick: as <hi>Ioabs</hi> punishment till <hi>Solomons</hi> Reign, though he deserved it as much in <hi>Davids.</hi> So that the rule commonly talked of, <hi>Fiat justitia &amp; pereat mundus,</hi> is a piece of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantry, rather than true Wisdom; for whatever penalty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, brings a far greater detriment to the publick, than the forbearance of it, is no piece of Justice to the State, but the contrary, the greatest Law, being the safety and preservation of the whole body. By which it appears, that in humane Laws, the reason of punishment is not, that such an action is done, but because the impunity in doing it, may have a bad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the publick interest; but in debts, the right of Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution <note place="margin">B</note> depends upon the injury received by a particular person, who looks at no more than the reparation of his loss by it.</p>
                     <p>We are now to consider, how far these things will hold in Divine Laws, and what the right of punishment doth result <note place="margin">§. 5.

For <hi>Crellius,</hi> the subtillest of our Adversaries, knowing how great consequence the resolution of this is, in the whole Controversie of Satisfaction, vehemently contends, <hi>That the right of punishment doth result from Gods absolute Dominion, and therefore he is to be considered as the offended party, and not as Governor in the right of inflicting punishment;</hi> for which his <note place="margin">C</note> first Argument is, <hi>That our obedience is due to Gods Law, on the account of his Dominion; but when that is not performed,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">p. 144.</note> 
                        <hi>the penalty succeeds in its room, and therefore that doth belong to God on the same account:</hi> His other arguments are, <hi>from the compensation of injuries due to the offended party, and from Gods anger against sin, in which he is to be considered as the offended party:</hi> These two latter will be answered under the next head; the first I am to examine here. He therefore tells us, that the right of punishment belongs to Gods Dominion, because the reason of his Government of mankind is, because he <note place="margin">D</note> is the Lord of them. But, for our better understanding this, we are to consider, although the original right of Government doth result from Gods Dominion; for therefore our obedience is due, because of his Soveraignty over us; yet when God takes upon him the notion of a Governor, he enters into a new rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with his creatures, distinct from the first as meer Lord. For he is equally Lord of all to whom he gives a being, but he doth not require obedience upon equal terms, nor governs them by the same Laws: Dominion is properly shewed in the exercise of power; but when God gives Laws according to which he will <note place="margin">E</note> reward and punish, he so far restrains the exercise of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to a subserviency to the ends of Government. If we should suppose, that God governs the world meerly by his Dominion, we must take away all rewards and punishments; for then the

actions of men, would be the meer effects of irresistable power, <note place="margin">A</note> and so not capable of rewards and punishments; for there could be neither of these, where mens actions are not capable of the differences of good and evil, and that they cannot be, if they be the acts of Gods Dominion, and not of their own. But if God doth not exercise his full Dominion over rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is apparent that he doth govern them under another notion than as meer Lord, and the reason of punishment is not to be taken from an absolute right which God doth not make use of, but from the ends and designs of Government, which are his own Honour, the Authority of his Laws, and the good <note place="margin">B</note> of those whom he doth govern. And <hi>Crellius</hi> is greatly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, when he makes <hi>punishment to succeed in the place of the right of obedience;</hi> for it is only the desert of punishment, which follows upon the violation of that right, and as we assert, that the right of obedience is derived from Gods Soveraignty, so we deny not, but the desert of punishment is from the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; but withal we say, that the obligation to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depends upon the Laws, and Gods right to inflict punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (Laws being supposed) is immediately from that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which he hath over mankind: For otherwise, if the <note place="margin">C</note> whole right of punishment did still depend upon Gods Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and the first right of Soveraignty, then al sins must have equal punishments, because they are all equal violations of the fundamental right of obedience; then it were at liberty for God to punish a greater sin, with a less punishment; and a lesser sin, with a greater: And lastly, this would make the punishment of sin, a meer Arbitrary thing in God; for there would be no reason of punishment, but what depended upon Gods meer will; whereas the reason of punishment in Scripture is drawn from a repugnancy of sin to the divine purity and holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <note place="margin">D</note> and not meerly from Gods power or will to punish; but if that were all the reason of it, there would be no repugnancy in the nature of the thing for the most vitious person to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, and the most pious to be made everlastingly miserable. But who ever yet durst say or think so? From whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the relation between sin and punishment is no result of Gods arbitrary will; but it is founded in the nature of the things, so that as it is just for God to punish offenders, so it would be unjust to punish the most innocent person without any respect to sin. But if the right of punishment depends <note place="margin">E</note> meerly on Gods Dominion, I cannot understand why God may not punish when, and whom, and in what manner he pleaseth; without any impeachment of his Justice, and therefore it is to be wonder'd at, that the same persons who assert the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:97974:135"/>
right of punishment to be meerly in Gods dominion, should <note place="margin">A</note> yet cry out of the injustice of one person being punished for anothers faults; for why may not God exercise his dominion in this case? yes, say they, <hi>he may his dominion, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not punish, because punishment supposes guilt, and cannot be just without it;</hi> how far that reaches, will be examined after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; at present, we take notice of the contradiction to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves which our Adversaries are guilty of, that they may serve their own <hi>hypothesis,</hi> for when we dispute with them, against absolute remission without satisfaction, then they contend that the right of punishment is a meer act of dominion, and God may <note place="margin">B</note> part with his right, if he please; but when they dispute with us against the translation of punishment from one to another, then they no longer say that the right of punishment is an act of dominion, but that it is a necessary consequent of inherent guilt, and cannot be removed from one to another. And then they utterly deny that punishment is of the nature of debts; for <hi>one mans money,</hi> they say, <hi>may become anothers, but one</hi>

and compensation of the loss that accrues to him by the <note place="margin">A</note> injury sustained; and whatever goes beyond this, is the effect of Government, which constitutes penalties for preservation of the Society which is under Laws. But herein <hi>Crellius</hi> is our adversary, but with no advantage at all to his Cause; for he offers to prove against <hi>Grotius, that something more is due by an injury beyond bare compensation for what the other is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to lose by the right of nature;</hi> for saith he, <hi>in every injury there is not only the reall damage which the person sustains, but there is a contempt of the person implyed in it, for which as well as the former, he ought to have compensation.</hi> To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <note place="margin">B</note> 1. That this doth not prove what he designs, <hi>viz.</hi> that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment doth belong to the injured person in a state of Nature, beyond bare restitution, but that it is necessary, that men should not continue in such a state, that so they may be vindicated from that contempt, and others compelled to restitution. Both which, as they are punishments, are not in the power of the offended party as such, but shew that it is very reasonable there should be Laws and Governours, that private persons may be preserved in their just rights, and offenders punished for the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication not only of their honour, but of the Laws too. And <note place="margin">C</note> Laws being established, the injured person hath right to no more, than the compensation of his loss; for that being forced upon the offending party, is a sufficient vindication of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. 2. If the contempt of a private person makes a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation necessary, how much more will this hold in a publick Magistrate; whose contempt by disobedience is of far worse consequence than that of a private person. And by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Crellius</hi> overthrows his main <hi>hypothesis,</hi> viz. that God may pardon sin without satisfaction; for if it be not only necessary, that the loss be compensated but the dishonour too; then so much <note place="margin">D</note> greater as the dishonour is; so much higher as the person is; so much more beneficial to the world as his Laws are; so much more necessary is it that in order to pardon there must be a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction made to him, for the affronts he hath received from men.

                        <hi>man must object, that this is a thing evil in it self; for although it be forbidden us under the New Testament, yet in it self it is not unlawful for one that hath suffered pain from another to seek for the case of his own pain, by the miseries of him that injured him: and for this purpose,</hi> saith he, <hi>we have the Passion of</hi>

Whereas the right of punishment is derived from an injury received, and therefore that which gives that right, is some damage sustained, the reparation of which is the first thing designed by the offended party: Though it take not up the whole nature of punishment. And on this account no man can justly propose any end to himself in anothers evil, but <note place="margin">E</note> what comes under the notion of restitution. For the evil of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is only intended in punishment as it respects the good of him for whose sake that evil is undergone. When that good may be obtained without anothers evil, the desire of it is unjust
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:97974:137"/>
and unreasonable: and therefore all that contentment that any <note place="margin">A</note> one takes in the evil another undergoes, as it is evil to him, is a thing repugnant to humane nature, and which all persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn in others when they allow themselves in it. It will be hard for <hi>Crellius</hi> to make any difference between this end of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment which he assigns, and the greatest cruelty; for what can that be worse than taking delight in making others misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and seeing them so when he hath made them. If it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>that cruelty is without any cause, but here a just cause is supposed,</hi> I answer, a just cause is only supposed for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but there can be no just cause for any to delight in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series <note place="margin">B</note> of others, and to comfort themselves by inflicting or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them. For the evil of another is never intended, but when it is the only means left for compensation; and he must be guilty of great inhumanity, who desires anothers evil any further than that tends to his own good, <hi>i. e.</hi> the repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the damage sustained; which if it may be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anothers evil, then that comes not by the right of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture within the reason of punishment; and consequently where it doth not serve for that end, the comfort that men take in it is no part of justice, but cruelty. For there can be no <note place="margin">C</note> reason at all assigned for it; for that <hi>lenimentum doloris</hi> which <hi>Crellius</hi> insists on is meerly imaginary, and no other than the Dog hath in gnawing the stone that is thrown at him; and for all that I know, that propension in nature to the retribution of evil for evil any further than it tends to our security, and the preservation for the future, is one of the most unreasonable Passions in humane Nature.</p>

For <hi>Crellius</hi> hath already told us, what it is to satisfie one as an offended party, <note place="margin">D</note> that is, to ease himself by the punishment of others; but what ever is designed for the great ends of Government, is not to be considered under that notion, although the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor may be justly offended at the neglect of them. And there is this considerable difference between the punishment made to an offended party, as such, and that which is for the ends of Government, that the former is a satisfaction to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> and the latter to Laws and the publick interest.

                     <p>Having thus considered the nature of punishments among men, we come more closely to our matter, by examining how far this will hold in the punishments which God inflicts on the <note place="margin">B</note> account of sin.

was not concerned to do it, and in this case the same reasons <note place="margin">A</note> which make the effect not to follow, make the desire of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the divine wisdom and perfection: or else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the effect is hindred by the repentance of the person, or some other way which may make it not necessary to do it; then upon the same reason the effect is suspended, the inclination to do it should be so too; for that must be supposed to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by an eternal reason and counsel as well as his actions; unless some natural passions in <hi>God</hi> be supposed antecedent to his own wisdom and counsel, which is derogatory to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite perfection of God, since those are judged imperfections in our selves: If it be taken only <hi>with the effect</hi> following it, <note place="margin">B</note> then God can never be said to be angry but when he doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, whereas his <hi>wrath is said to be kindled</hi> in Scripture, where the effect hath not followed; which if it implies any more than the high provocation of God to punish (as I suppose it doth not) then this inclination to punish is to be conceived distinct from the effect following it. But that conception of <hi>anger in God</hi> seems most agreeable to the divine nature, as well as to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which makes it either <hi>the punishment it self,</hi> as <hi>Crellius</hi> elsewhere acknowledges it is often taken so; or <note place="margin">Crell. de verâ Relig. l. 1. c. 30.</note>

And thus the grand difficulty of <hi>Crellius</hi>

                        <note place="margin">D</note> appears to be none at all, against all those passages of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which speak of <hi>appeasing God,</hi> of <hi>attonement,</hi> and <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,</hi> viz. <hi>that if they prove satisfaction, they must prove that God being actually angry with mankind before the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his Son, he must be presently appeased upon his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing them.</hi> For no more need to be said, than that God being justly provoked to punish the sins of mankind, was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to accept of the sufferings of his Son, as a sufficient sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Attonement for the sins of the world, on considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which he was pleased to offer those terms of pardon, <note place="margin">E</note> which upon mens performance of the conditions required on their part, shall be sufficient to discharge them from that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to punishment which they were under by their sins. And what absurdity, or incongruity there is in this to any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:97974:141"/>
of reason, I cannot imagine. But our Adversaries first <note place="margin">A</note> make opinions for us, and then shew they are unreasonable. They first suppose that anger in God is to be considered as a passion, and that passion a desire of revenge for satisfaction of it; and then tell us, that if we do not prove, that this desire of revenge can be satisfied by the sufferings of Christ, then we can never prove the doctrine of satisfaction to be true; whereas we do not mean by Gods anger any such passion, but the just declaration of Gods will to punish upon our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of him by our sins; we do not make the design of satisfaction to be, that God may please himself in the reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <note place="margin">B</note> the sins of the guilty upon the most innocent person; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we make the design of punishment, not to be the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of anger as a desire of revenge, but to be the vindication of the honour and rights of the injured person, by such a way as himself shall judge most satisfactory to the ends of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

in a sense agreeable to those other places, where God is said <note place="margin">A</note>

And this we do not deny to be a just punishment, since our Adversaries themselves, as well as we, make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. But we are not to understand, that the end of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine punishments doth so respect the community, as though God himself were to be excluded out of it; for we are so to understand it, as made up of God as the Governor, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as the persons governed, whatever then tends to the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the rights of Gods Honor and Soveraignty, tends to the good of the whole, because the manifestation of that <note place="margin">D</note> end is so great an end of the whole.</p>
                     <p>But withal, though we assert in the life to come, the ends of <note place="margin">§. 12.

For the other is the <hi>Reserve,</hi> when nothing else will do, and therefore was not primarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; but the proper ends of punishment, as a part of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, are to be taken from the design of them in this life. And here we assert, that Gods end in punishing, is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing <note place="margin">E</note> his honor, not by the meer miseries of his creatures, but that men by beholding his severity against sin, should break off the practice of it, that they may escape the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the future state. So that the ends of punishment here,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:97974:142"/>
are quite of another kind, from those of another life; for <note place="margin">A</note> those are inflicted, because persons have been unreclaimable by either the mercies or punishments of this life; but these are intended, that men should so far take notice of this seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, as to avoid the sins which will expose them to the wrath to come. And from hence it follows, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever sufferings, do answer all these ends of Divine punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and are inflicted on the account of sin, have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per notion of punishments in them, and God may accept of the undergoing them as a full <hi>satisfaction</hi> to his Law, if they be such as tend to break men off from sin, and assert Gods <note place="margin">B</note> right, and vindicate his honor to the world; which are the ends assigned by <hi>Crellius,</hi> and will be of great consequence to us in the following Discourse. <note place="margin">C</note>

incline us to obedience, and that obedience being the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">A</note> in order to pardon, at so many removes they make the death of Christ to have influence on the remission of our sins. They assert <hi>that God took occasion by the sins of men to ex ercise an act of dominion upon Christ in his sufferings, and that the sufferings of Christ were intended for the taking away the sins of men;</hi> but they utterly deny, <hi>that the sufferings of Christ were to be considered as a punishment for sin, or that Christ did suffer in our place and stead;</hi> nay, they contend with great vehemency, <hi>that it is wholly inconsistent with the justice of God to make one mans sins the meritorious</hi>

If they do, they are then punishments; if not, they are meer exercises of power and dominion; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ends they are intended for, and whatever recompence be made for them.

                        <hi>Lord of all, had a right of absolute dominion upon the life and body of Christ, and therefore might justly deliver him up to death, and give his body to the Cross; and although Christ by the ordinary force of the Law of</hi> Moses, <hi>had a right to escape so painful and accursed death, yet God by the right of dominion had the power of disposal of him, because he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to compensate his torments with a reward infinitely greater than they were: but because</hi> he saith, <hi>for great ends the consent of Christ was necessary, therefore God did not use his utmost dominion in delivering him up by force as he might</hi>

                        <hi>but to give us a firm hope of it in this present state, now our sins by deserving eternal punishment, do hinder the effect of that decree upon us, and therefore they were an impulsive cause of the death of Christ, by which it was effected, that this</hi>

                        <hi>decree should obtain notwithstanding our sins. But we are not to understand as though this were done by any expiation of the guilt of sin by the death of Christ; but this effect is hindred by three things, by taking away their sins, by assuring men that their former sins, and present infirmities upon their sincere obedience shall not be imputed to them, and that the effect of that decree shall obtain, all which,</hi> saith he, <hi>is effected morte Christi interveniente, the death of Christ intervening, but not as the procuring cause.</hi> So that after all these words he means no more by making our sins <hi>an impulsive cause of the</hi>

                        <hi>death of Christ,</hi> but that the death of Christ was an argument to confirm to us the truth of his Doctrine, which doctrine of his doth give us assurance of these things: and that our sins when they are said to be <hi>the impulsive cause,</hi> are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered with a respect to <hi>their guilt,</hi> but to that <hi>distrust of God</hi> which our sins do raise in us; which distrust is in truth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this sense of <hi>Crellius the impulsive cause,</hi> and not the <hi>sins</hi> which were the cause or occasion of it. For that was it which the doctrine was designed to remove, and our sins only as the causes of that. But if it be said, <hi>that he speaks not only of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">E</note> 
                        <hi>but of the punishment of sin as an impediment which must be removed too, and therefore may be called an impulsive cause,</hi> we are to consider that the removal of this is not attributed to the death of Christ, but to the leaving of our sins by the belief of his
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:97974:144"/>
Doctrine; therefore the punishment of our sins cannot unless <note place="margin">A</note> in a very remote sense be said to be an <hi>impulsive cause</hi> of that, which for all that we can observe by <hi>Crellius,</hi> might as well have been done without it; if any other way could be thought sufficient to confirm his Doctrine, and Christ, without dying, might have had power to save all them that obey him. But we understand not an impulsive cause in so remote a sense, as though our sins were a <hi>meer occasion of Christs dying,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the death of Christ was one argument among many others to believe his Doctrine, the belief of which would make men leave their sins; but we contend for a neerer and <note place="margin">B</note> more proper sense, <hi>viz.</hi> that the death of Christ was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily intended for the <hi>expiation of our sins,</hi> with a respect to <hi>God</hi> and not to us, and therefore our sins as an <hi>impulsive cause</hi> are to be considered as they are so displeasing to God; that it was necessary for the Vindication of Gods Honour, and the deterring the world from sin, that no less a Sacrifice of Attonement should be offered, than the blood of the Son of God. So that we understand an <hi>impulsive cause</hi> here in the sense, that the sins of the people were, under the Law, the cause of the offering up those Sacrifices, which were appointed <note place="margin">C</note> for the expiation of them. And as in those Sacrifices there were two things to be considered, <hi>viz.</hi> the mactation, and the oblation of them, the former as a <hi>punishment</hi> by a substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of them in place of the persons who had offended; the latter as the proper Sacrifice of attonement, although the mactation it self, considered with the design of it, was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificial act too: So we consider the sufferings of Christ with a twofold respect, either as <hi>to our sins,</hi> as the impulsive cause of them, so they are to be considered as a <hi>punishment,</hi> or as <hi>to God,</hi> with a design to expiate the guilt of them, so they are <note place="margin">D</note> a <hi>Sacrifice of Attonement.</hi> The first consideration is, that we are now upon, and upon which the present debate depends, for if the sufferings of Christ be to be taken under the notion of <hi>punishment,</hi> then our Adversaries grant, that our sins must be an impulsive cause of them in another sense than they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it.

                        <note place="margin">B</note> there is nothing so miserable, that either men or beasts can undergo, but when it serves their turn, it shall be only a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity and no punishment, though it be said to be on purpose to shew Gods severity against the sins of the world.

I had thought our Adversaries had maintained that the Sacrifices (on the day of expiation at least) had represented and typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Sacrifice which was to be offered up by Christ; and so <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Crellius</hi> elsewhere contend: he need not therefore have troubled himself concerning the sins of the Goat, when it is expresly said, <hi>That the sins of the people were put on the head of the Goat;</hi> Whatever then the punishment <note place="margin">Lev. 16. 21.</note> were, it was on the account of the sins of the people, and not <note place="margin">D</note> his own. But <hi>Crellius</hi> urgeth against <hi>Grotius, that if the Scape-Goat had been punished for the expiation of the sins of the people, that should have been particularly expressed in Scripture, whereas nothing is said there at all of it, and that the throwing down the Scape-Goat from the top of the rock, was no part of the Primitive Institution, but one of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitions taken up by the Iews in after-times, because of the ominousness of the return of it; and although we should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (which is not probable) that it should dye by famine in the Wilderness, yet this was not the death for expiation,</hi>

For if they be understood of taking away sins, then they are only to be meant of the power that was in the death of Christ, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade men to leave their sins; which we must have a care of understanding so, as to attribute any effect to the death of Christ in order to it; but only that the death of Christ was an argument for us to believe what he said, and the believing what he said would incline us to obey him, and if we obey him, we shall leave off our sins, whether Christ had died or <note place="margin">C</note> no: supposing his miracles had the same effect on us, which those of <hi>Moses</hi> had upon the <hi>Iews,</hi> which were sufficient to perswade them to believe and obey without his death. But if this be all that was meant by Christs <hi>bearing our sins in his body on the tree;</hi> why might not St. <hi>Peter</hi> himself be said to bear them upon his cross too? for his death was an excellent example of patience, and a great argument to perswade men he spake truth, and that doctrine which he preached, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and remission of sins: So that by this sense, there is nothing peculiar attributed to the <hi>death of Christ</hi> But ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">D</note> the other sense for the <hi>taking away the punishment of sins,</hi> we must see how this belongs to the death of Christ: Do they then attribute our delivery from the punishment of sin, to the death of Christ on the <hi>Cross?</hi> yes, just as we may attribute <hi>Coesars</hi> subduing <hi>Rome,</hi> to his passing over <hi>Rubicon,</hi> because he took that in his way to the doing of it: so they make the death of Christ only as a passage, in order to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of sins, by taking away the punishment of them.

                        <hi>in this very Chapter, hath the signification of taking away,</hi> v. 4. <hi>For he hath born our griefs, and carried our sorrows,</hi> which is applied by St. <hi>Matth. 8. 17. to bodily diseases, which our Saviour did not bear, but took away, as it is said in the foregoing verse; he healed all that were sick, on which those words come in, That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias,</hi> &amp;c. To which I answer: 1. It is granted by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, <note place="margin">B</note> that St. <hi>Mathew</hi> in those words, doth not give the full sense of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> but only applies that by way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, to bodily diseases, which was chiefly intended for the sins of men. And in a way of accommodation it is not unusual to strain words beyond their genuine and natural signification, or what was intended primarily by the person who spake them. Would it be reasonable for any to say that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> signifies <hi>to give,</hi> because that place <hi>Psal.</hi> 68, 18. where the word by all is acknowledged to signifie <hi>to receive,</hi> is rendred <hi>to give, Eph.</hi> 4. 8. so that admitting another sense of the <note place="margin">C</note> word here, as applied to the cure of bodily diseases, it doth not from thence follow, that this should be the meaning of the word in the primary sense intended by the <hi>Prophet.</hi> 2. The word as used by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> is very capable of the primary and natural sense; for St. <hi>Matthew</hi> retain words of the same signification, with that which we contend for, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <hi>given over to death;</hi> but how far this is from proving his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose will easily appear, 1. Because those by whom they were said <hi>to be chastened,</hi> did not think they did it without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to a fault; but they supposed them to be justly punished; and this is that we plead for, that the chastisement considered with a respect to him that inflicts it, doth suppose some fault as the reason of inflicting it. 2. This is far from the present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, for the <hi>chastisement</hi> there mentioned is oposed to death, <hi>as chastened, but not killed;</hi> whereas <hi>Grotius</hi> expresly speaks of such <hi>chastisements as include death,</hi> that these cannot be <note place="margin">B</note> supposed to be meerly designed for instruction, and therefore must be conceived under the notion of punishment.

And therefore in opposition to <hi>Crellius,</hi> I shall prove these two things: 1. That supposing Christ suffered for our sins, there was a sufficient argument to deter us from the practice of sin. 2. Supposing that his sufferings had no respect to our <note place="margin">E</note> sins, they could not have that force to deter men from the practice of it: for he after asserts, <hi>That Christs sufferings might be a</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>to us, though they were no punishment of sin.</hi> 1. That the death of Christ considered as a punishment of sin,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:97974:151"/>
is a proper <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or hath a great force to deter men from <note place="margin">A</note> the practice of sin: and that because the same reason of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is supposed in Christ and in our selves, and because the example is much more considerable, than if we had suffered our selves. 1. The same reason of punishment is supposed. For why are men deterred from sin, by seeing others punished; but because they look upon the sin as the reason of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore where the same reason holds, the same ends may be as properly obtained. If we said that Christ suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death meerly as an innocent person out of Gods domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over his life; what imaginable force could this have to <note place="margin">B</note> deter men from sin, which is asserted to have no relation to it as the cause of it? But when we say, that <hi>God laid our iniquities upon him,</hi> that he suffered not upon his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count but ours, that the sins we commit against God were the cause of all those bitter Agonies which the Son of God underwent, what argument can be more proper to deter men from sin than this is? For hereby they see the great abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency of sin which is in God, that he will not pardon the sins of men without a compensation made to his Honor, and a demonstration to the world of his hatred of it. Hereby they <note place="margin">C</note> see what a value God hath for his Laws, which he will not relax as to the punishment of offenders, without so valuable a consideration as the blood of his own Son. Hereby they see, that the punishment of sin is no meer arbitrary thing depending barely upon the will of God; but that there is such a connexion between sin and punishment as to the ends of Government, that unless the Honor and Majesty of God, as to his Laws and Government may be preserved, the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Laws must expect <hi>a just recompence of reward.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they see what those are to expect who neglect or despise <note place="margin">D</note> these sufferings of the Son of God for them; for nothing can then remain, but <hi>a certain fearful looking for of judgement and fiery indignation which shall devour the Adversaries.</hi> So that, here all the weighty arguments concur which may be most apt to prevail upon men to deter them from their sins. For <hi>if God did thus by the green tree, what will be do by the dry?</hi> If he who was so innocent in himself, so perfectly holy, suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red so much on the account of our sins; what then may those expect to suffer, who have no innocency at all to plead, and add wilfulness and impenitency to their sins? But if it be replied <note place="margin">E</note> by <hi>Crellius, that it is otherwise among men:</hi> I answer, that we do not pretend in all things to parallel the sufferings of Christ for us, with any sufferings of men for one another. But yet we add, that even among men the punishments inflicted
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:97974:152"/>
on those who were themselves innocent as to the cause of <note place="margin">A</note> them, may be as exemplary as any other. And the greater ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of severity there is in them, the greater terror they strike into all offenders. As Childrens losing their estates and honors, or being banished for their Parents treasons in which they had no part themselves. Which is a proper punishment on them of their Fathers faults, whether they be guilty or no? and if this may be just in men, why not in God? If any say, <hi>that the Parents are only punished in the Children,</hi> he speaks that which is contradictory to the common sense of mankind; for punishment doth suppose sense or feeling of it; and in this <note place="margin">B</note> case the Parents are said to be punished, who are supposed to be dead and past feeling of it, and the Children who undergo the smart of it must not be said to be punished; though all things are so like it, that no person can imagine himself in that condition, but would think himself punished, and severely too. If it be said, <hi>that these are calamities indeed, but they are no proper punishments,</hi> it may easily be shewed that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction will not hold here. Because these punishments were within the design of the Law, and were intended for all the ends of punishments, and therefore must have the nature of them. <note place="margin">C</note> For therefore the Children are involved in the Fathers pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment on purpose to deter others from the like actions. There are some things indeed that Children may fall into by occasion of their Fathers guilt, which may be only <hi>calamities</hi> to them, because they are necessary consequents in the nature of the thing, and not purposely designed as a punishment to them. Thus, being deprived of the comfort and assistance of their Parents, when the Law hath taken them off by the hand of justice: this was designed by the Law as a punishment to the Parents, and as to the Children it is only a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent <note place="margin">D</note> of their punishment. For otherwise the Parents would have been punished for the Childrens faults, and not the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren only involved in that which unavoidably follows upon the Parents punishment. So that <hi>Crellius</hi> is very much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken either in the present case of our Saviours punishment, or in the general reason of exemplary punishments, as among men. But the case of our Saviour is more exemplary, when we consider the excellency of his person, though appearing in our nature, when no meaner sufferings would satisfie, than of so transcendent a nature as he underwent, though he <note place="margin">E</note> were the Eternal Son of God, this must make the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment much more exemplary, than if he were conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red only as our Adversaries do, as <hi>a meer man.</hi> So that the dignity of his person under all his sufferings may justly
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:97974:152"/>
add a greater consideration to deter us from the practice of sin, <note place="margin">A</note> which was so severely punished in him, when he was pleased to be a Sacrifice for our sins. From whence we see that the ends of a <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> are very agreeable with the sufferings of Christ considered as a punishment for sin.</p>
                     <p>We now consider whether as <hi>Crellius</hi> asserts, supposing Christs death were no punishment, it could have these effects <note place="margin">§ 10. Gods hatred of sin could not be seen in the sufferings of Christ, if they were no punishment of sin. <hi>Crell. c. 1. p.</hi> 69.</note> upon mens minds or no? <hi>Yes,</hi> he saith, <hi>it might, because by his sufferings we might see how severely God would punish wicked and obstinate persons.</hi> Which being a strange riddle at the first hearing it, <hi>viz.</hi> that by the sufferings of an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <note place="margin">B</note> person without any respect to sin as the cause of them: we should discern Gods severity against those who are obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in sin; we ought the more diligently to attend to what is said for the clearing of it. <q>
                           <hi>First,</hi> saith he, If God spared not his own most innocent and holy and only Son, than whom nothing was more dear to him in Heaven or Earth, but exposed him to so cruel and ignominious a death; how great and severe sufferings may we think God will inflict on wicked men, who are at open defiance with him?</q> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess my self not subtle enough to apprehend the force of this <note place="margin">C</note> argument, <hi>viz.</hi> If God dealt so severely with him who had no sin either of his own or others to answer for; therefore he will deal much more severely with those that have. For Gods severity considered without any respect to sin, gives rather encouragement to sinners, than any argument to deter them from it. For the natural consequence of it is, that God doth act arbitrarily, without any regard to the good or evil of mens actions; and therefore it is to no purpose to be sollicitous about them. For upon the same account that the most innocent person suffers most severely from him, for <note place="margin">D</note> all that we know, the more we strive to be innocent, the more severely we may be dealt with, and let men sin, they can be but dealt severely with, all the difference then is, one shall be called <hi>punishments,</hi> and the other <hi>calamities,</hi> but the severity may be the same in both. And who would leave off his sins meerly to change the name of <hi>punishments</hi> into that of <hi>calamities?</hi> And from hence it will follow, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of good and evil, and the respects of them to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reward, are but aiery and empty things; but that God really in the dispensation of things to men, hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <note place="margin">E</note> to what men are or do, but acts therein according to his own Dominion, whereby he may dispose of men how or which way he pleases. If a Prince had many of his Subjects in open rebellion against him, and he should at that time
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:97974:153"/>
make his most obedient and beloved, Son to be publickly exposed <note place="margin">A</note> to all manner of indignities, and be dishonoured and put to death by the hands of those rebels; could any one imagine that this was designed as an exemplary punishment to all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, to let them see the danger of rebellion? <hi>No,</hi> but would it not rather make them think him a cruel Prince, one that would punish innocency as much as rebellion; and that it was rather better to stand at defiance, and become desperate, for it was more dangerous to be beloved than hated by him, to be his Son than his declared Enemy? So that insisting on the death of Christ as it is considered as a <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, (for of <note place="margin">B</note> that we speak now) there is no comparison between our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries <hi>hypothesis</hi> and <hi>ours; but,</hi> saith <hi>Crellius, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence is not good on our side, if Christ suffered the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our sins, therefore they shall suffer much more who continue in sin, for Christ suffered for the sins of the whole world; but they suffer only for their own, and what they have deserved themselves.</hi> To which I answer, that the argument is of very good force upon our <hi>hypothesis,</hi> though it would not be upon theirs. For if we suppose him to be <hi>a meer man</hi> that suffered, then there could be no argument drawn from <note place="margin">C</note> his sufferings to ours, but according to the exact proportion of sins and punishments: but supposing that he had a <hi>divine</hi> as well as <hi>humane nature,</hi> there may not be so great a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sins of the world to the sufferings of Christ, as of the sins of a particular person to his own sufferings; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the argument from one to the other doth still hold. For the measure of punishments must be taken with a proportion to the dignity of the person who suffers them. And <hi>Crellius</hi> himself confesseth elsewhere, <hi>that the dignity of the person is</hi>

                        <hi>punishment of one that is very great, may do much more to deter men from sin, than a greater punishment of one much less.</hi> But he yet further urgeth, <hi>that the severity of God</hi>

                        <hi>against sinners may be discovered in the sufferings of Christ, because Gods hatredagainst sin is discovered therein.</hi> But if we ask how Gods hatred against sin, is seen in the sufferings of one perfectly innocent and free from sin, and not rather his hatred of innocency, if no respect to sin were had therein? he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, <hi>that Gods hatred against sin was manifested, in that he would not spare his only Son to draw men off from sin.</hi> For <note place="margin">E</note> answer to which, we are to consider the sufferings of Christ as an innocent person, designed as an exemplary cause to draw men off from sin; and let any one tell me, what hatred of sin can possibly be discovered, in proposing the sufferings of a

most innocent person to them without any consideration of <note place="margin">A</note> sin as the cause of those sufferings? If it be said, <hi>that the Doctrine of Christ was designed to draw men off from sin; and that God suffered his Son to dye to confirm this Doctrine, and thereby shewed his hatred to sin.</hi> I answer, 1. This is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the dispute off from the present business, for we are not now arguing about the design of Christs Doctrine, nor the death of Christ as a means to confirm that, but as a <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, and what power that hath without respect to our sins as the cause of them, to draw us from sin, by discovering Gods hatred to it. 2. The Doctrine of Christ according to their <note place="margin">B</note> 
                        <hi>hypothesis,</hi> discovers much less of Gods hatred to sin than ours doth. For if God may pardon sin without any compensation made to his Laws or Honour, if repentance be in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a sufficient satisfaction for all the sins past of our Lives; if there be no such thing as such a Justice in God which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires punishment of sin committed; if the punishment of sin depend barely upon Gods will; and the most innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may suffer as much from God without respect to sin as the cause of suffering, as the most guilty; let any rational man judge whether this Doctrine discovers as much Gods abhorrency <note place="margin">C</note> of sin, as asserting the necessity of vindicating Gods honour to the World, upon the breach of his Laws, if not by the suffering of the offenders themselves, yet of the Son of God as a sacrifice for the expiation of sin, by undergoing the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our iniquities, so as upon consideration of his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, he is pleased to accept of repentance and sincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as the conditions upon which he will grant remission of sins; and eternal life. So that if the discovery of Gods hatred to sin be the means to reclaim men from it, we assert upon the former reasons, that much more is done upon our <note place="margin">D</note> Doctrine concerning the sufferings of Christ, than can be upon theirs. So much shall suffice to manifest in what sense Christs death may be a <gap reason="foreign">

He made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. To which <hi>Crellius</hi> replies, ``That as there is no necessity, that by the name of sin, when applied to sufferings, <note place="margin">Crell. cap. 1. sect. 60.</note> any more should be implied, than that those sufferings were occasioned by sin, no more is there when it is applied to the person; nay, much less, for he saith, ``No more is required <note place="margin">B</note> to this, but that he should be handled as sinners use to be, and undergo the matter of punishment, without any respect to sin, either as the cause or occasion of it. So he saith, The name <hi>Sinner</hi> is used, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 21. and in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the name of sin in the first clause is to be understood, as of righteousness in the latter; and as we are said to be righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in him, when God deals with us as with righteous persons, so Christ was said to be sin for us, when he was dealt with as a sinner. And the Sacrifices for sin under the Law were so called, not with a respect to the punishment of <note place="margin">C</note> sin, but because they were offered upon the account of sin, and were used for taking away the guilt of it, or because men were bound to offer them, so that they sinned if they neglected it. So that all that is meant by <hi>Esaias</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> is, That Christ was made an expiatory Sacrifice, or that he exposed himself for those afflictions which sinners only by right undergo.</q> But let <hi>Crellius</hi> or any others of them tell me, if the <hi>Scripture</hi> had intended to express, that the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ were a punishment of our sins, how was it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do it more Emphatically than it is done by these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions <note place="margin">D</note> (the custom of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) not only by saying, that <hi>Christ did bear our sins,</hi> but, <hi>that himself was made sin for us?</hi> those phrases being so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly used for the punishment of sin. Let them produce any one instance in Scripture, where those expressions are applied to any without the consideration of sin? that place 1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 21. is very far from it; for in all probability, the design of <hi>Bathsheba</hi> in making <hi>Solomon King</hi> was already discovered, which was the reason that <hi>Adonijah</hi> his elder Brother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himself <hi>King,</hi> invited not him with the rest of the <note place="margin">E</note>

offenders;</hi> i. e. saith <hi>Crellius, We shall be handled as</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A</note> 
                        <hi>offenders, we shall be destroyed:</hi> But surely not without the supposition of a fault; by them which should inflict that punishment upon them: The plain meaning is, they should be accused of Treason, and then punished accordingly. But we are to consider, that still with a respect to them, who were the inflicters, a fault or sin is supposed as the reason of their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, either of their own or others. But of our Saviour it is not said, <hi>That he should be counted as an offender by the Iews;</hi> for although that doth not take away his innocency, yet it supposeth an accusation of something, which in it self <note place="margin">B</note> deserves punishment. But in <hi>Esai.</hi> 53. 10. it is said, <hi>He made his soul sin;</hi> and 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>That God made him sin for us,</hi> which must therefore imply, not being dealt with by men only as a sinner, but that with a respect to him who inflicted the punishment, there was a consideration of sin as the reason of it. We do not deny but Gods suffering him to be dealt with as a sinner by men, is implied in it, for that was the method of his punishment designed; but we say further, that the reason of that permission in God, doth suppose some ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent cause of it: For God would never have suffered his only <note place="margin">C</note> Son, to be so dealt with by the hands of cruel men, unless he had made himself <hi>an offering for sin;</hi> being willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo those sufferings, that he might be an expiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the sins of the world. And although <hi>Socinus</hi> will not yield, <hi>That by being made sin for us should be understood</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Soc. l. 1. c. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>Christs being an expiatory Sacrifice for sin;</hi> yet <hi>Crellius</hi> is contented <hi>it should be so taken in both places:</hi> Which if he will grant, so as by vertue of that Sacrifice, the guilt of sin is expiated, we shall not contend with him about the reasons, why those Sacrifices were called <hi>sins,</hi> although the most proper <note place="margin">D</note> and genuine must needs be that, which is assigned by the Law, that the sins of the people were supposed to be laid upon them, and therefore they were intended for the expiation of them: But it is very unreasonable to say; <hi>That Expiatory Sacrifices were called sins, because it would have been a sin to neglect them:</hi> For on the same account, all the other Sacrifices must have been called so too; for it was a sin to neglect any where God required them, and so there had been no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Sacrifices for sin and others. To that reason of <hi>Crellius, from our being made righteous, because dealt with as such,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">E</note> 
                        <hi>to Christs being made sin only, because dealt with as a sinner,</hi> we need no more than what this parallel will afford us; For as <hi>Crellius</hi> would never say, that any are dealt with as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous persons, who are not antecedently supposed to be so;
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:97974:155"/>
so by his own Argument, Christ being dealt with <hi>as a sinner,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A</note> must suppose guilt antecedent to it; and since the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares it was not his own, in those words, <hi>Who knew no sin,</hi> it follows that it must be the consideration of ours, which must make him be dealt with as a sinner by him, who made him to be sin for us. But to suppose that Christ should be said to be <hi>made sin,</hi> without any respect <hi>to sin,</hi> is as much as if the <hi>Latins</hi> should call any one <hi>Scelus,</hi> and mean thereby a very honest man; or a <hi>Piaculum,</hi> without any supposition of his own or others guilt. But we are to consider, that the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ, seeming at first so inconsistent with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation <note place="margin">B</note> to God as his only Son, which the Apostles assert con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, they were obliged to vindicate his innocency as to men, and yet withal to shew, that with a respect to God, there was sufficient reason for his permission of his undergoing these sufferings. That <hi>he knew no sin,</hi> was enough to clear his innocency as to men; but then the question will be asked, If he were so innocent, why did God suffer all those things to come upon him? Did not <hi>Abraham</hi> plead of old with God, <hi>That he would not slay the righteous with the wicked,</hi> because <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 25.</note> it was repugnant to the righteousness of his nature to do so; <note place="margin">C</note> 
                        <hi>That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee; shall not the Iudge of all the earth do right?</hi> How then comes God to suffer the most perfect innocency to be dealt with so, as the greatest sins could not have deserved worse from men? Was not his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness the same still? And <hi>Abraham</hi> did not think the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of <hi>calamities</hi> and <hi>punishments,</hi> enough to vindicate Gods proceedings, if the righteous should have been dealt withall as the wicked. And if that would hold for such a <note place="margin">D</note> measure of righteousness as might be supposed in such who were not guilty of the great abominations of those places, that it should be enough, not only to deliver themselves, but the wicked too; how comes it that the most perfect obedience of the Son of God, is not sufficient to excuse him from the greatest sufferings of Malefactors? But if his sufferings had been meerly from men, God had been accountable only for the bare permission; but it is said, that <hi>he fore-ordained and determined these things to be,</hi> that Christ himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that <hi>God had forsaken him;</hi> and here, <hi>that he made</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">E</note> 
                        <hi>him sin for us:</hi> and can we imagine all this to be without any respect to the guilt of sin, as the cause of it? Why should such an expression be used of <hi>being made sin?</hi> might not many others have served sufficiently to declare the indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:97974:155"/>
and sufferings he underwent, without such a phrase as <note place="margin">A</note> seems to reflect upon Christs innocency? If there had been no more in these expressions than our Adversaries imagine, the Apostles were so careful of Christs honour, they would have avoided such ill-sounding expressions as these were; and not have affected <hi>Hebraisms,</hi> and uncouth forms of speech, to the disparagement of their Religion. But this is all which our Adversaries have to say, where words are used by them out of their proper sense, <hi>that the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles affected tricks of wit, playing with words, using them sometimes in one sense, and presently quite in another.</hi> So <note place="margin">B</note>

To which <hi>Crellius</hi> replies, <q>That if the force of these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles not being joyned with sufferings, may be taken for the final and not for the impulsive cause, they may retain the same sense when joyned with sufferings, if those sufferings may be designed in order to an end; but if it should be granted, that those phrases being joyned with sufferings, <note place="margin">Sect. 14. p. 17.</note> do always imply a meritorious cause, yet it doth not follow, it should be here so understood because the matter will not bear it.</q> To this a short answer will at present serve: for, <note place="margin">B</note> It is not possible a meritorious cause can be expressed more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically than by these words being joyned to sufferings: so that we have as clear a testimony from these expressions as words can give; and by the same arts by which these may be avoided any other might; so that it had not been possible for our Doctrine to have been expressed in such a manner, but such kind of answers might have been given as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries now give. If it had been said in the plainest terms, <hi>that Christs death was a punishment for our sins,</hi> they would as easily have avoided the force of them as they do of these; <note place="margin">C</note> 
                        <q>they would have told us the Apostles delighted in an Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naclasis, and had expressed things different from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral use of the words by them; and though punishment were sometimes used properly, yet here it must be used only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically because the matter would bear no other sense.</q> And therefore I commend the ingenuity of <hi>Socinus</hi> after all the pains he had taken to enervate the force of those places which are brought against his Doctrine; he tells us plainly, <q>That <note place="margin">Socin. de ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat. l. 3. c. 6.</note> if our Doctrine were not only once, but frequently men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture; yet he would not therefore believe the <note place="margin">D</note> thing to be so as we suppose. For, <hi>saith he,</hi> seeing the thing it self cannot be, I take the least inconvenient interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words; and draw forth such a sense from them, as is most consistent with it self and the tenor of the Scripture.</q> But for all his talking of the tenor of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> by the same reason he interprets one place upon these terms, he will do many, and so the tenor of the <hi>Scripture</hi> shall be never against him: and by this we find, that the main strength of our Adversaries is not pretended to lye in the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> all the care they have of them is only to reconcile them if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">E</note> with their <hi>hypothesis;</hi> for they do not deny but that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural force of the words doth imply what we contend for; but because they say the Doctrine we assert is inconsistent with reason, therefore all their design is to find out any other possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

This therefore is enough for our present purpose, that if it had been the design of Scripture to have expressed our sense, it could not have done it in plainer expressions than it hath done, that no expressions could have been used, but the same arts of our Adversaries might have been used to take off their force, which they have used to those we now urge against them, and that setting aside the possibility of the thing, the Scripture doth very fairly deliver the Doctrine we contend for; or, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing in point of reason there may be arguments enough to <note place="margin">B</note> make it appear possible, there are <hi>Scriptures</hi> enough to make it appear true. <note place="margin">C</note>

And if there appear to be nothing repugnant in the Nature of the thing, or to the justice of God, then all their loud clamors will come to nothing; for on that they fix, when they talk the most of our Doctrine being contrary to reason. This therefore we now come more closely to examine, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">E</note> to which we must carefully enquire what it is, they lay the charge of injustice in God upon, according to our belief of Christs sufferings being a punishment for our sins.</p>

That punishment may be intended for those who can have no sense at all of it;</hi> as <hi>Crellius</hi> asserts in the case of <hi>Sauls sons,</hi> 2 Sam. 21. 8, 14. that <note place="margin">D</note> 
                        <note place="margin">Crell. ib. sect. 11. sect. 19.</note> the punishment was mainly intended for <hi>Saul,</hi> who was ahea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy dead. From these concessions of <hi>Crellius</hi> in this case, we may take notice, 1. That a remote conjunction may be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for a translation of penalty, <hi>viz.</hi> from one Generation to another. 2. That sins may be truly said to be punished in others, when the offenders themselves may escape punishment, thus the sins of Parents in their Children, and Princes in their Subjects. 3. That an act of dominion in some may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed as a proper punishment to others. 4. That the nature of punishment is not to be measured by the sense of it. Now <note place="margin">E</note> upon these concessions, though our Adversaries will not grant, that Christ was properly punished for our sins, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny but that we may very properly be said to be <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> for our sins in <hi>Christ,</hi> and if they will yield us this, the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:97974:159"/>
other may be a strife about words. For surely there may be <note place="margin">A</note> easily imagined as great a conjunction between Christ and us, as between the several Generations of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that last which was punished in the destruction of <hi>Hierusalem:</hi> and though we escape that punishment which Christ did undergo, yet we might have our sins punished in him, as well as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces theirs in their Subjects, when they escape themselves; or rather as Subjects in an innocent Prince, who may suffer for the faults of his people; if it be said, <hi>that these are acts of meer dominion as to such a one,</hi> that nothing hinders but granting it, yet our sins may be said to be punished in him; as <note place="margin">B</note> well as Parents sins are punished properly in meer acts of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon their Children; if it be laid, <hi>that can be no punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where there is no sense at all of it,</hi> that is fully taken off by <hi>Crellius;</hi> for surely we have as great a sense of the sufferings of Christ, as the first Generation of the <hi>Iews</hi> had of the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the last, before the fatal destruction of the City, or as <hi>Saul</hi> had of the punishment of his Sons after his death. So that from <hi>Crellius</hi> his own concessions, we have proved, that <hi>our sins may very properly be said to be punished in Christ,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he will not say, that Christ could be properly punished <note place="margin">C</note> for our sins; nay he and the rest of our Adversaries not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, but earnestly contend, that it is very unjust to suppose it, and repugnant to the rectitude of Gods nature to do it.</p>
                     <p>And so we come to consider the mighty arguments that are <note place="margin">§. 3. <hi>Crellius</hi> his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> insisted on for the proof of this, which may be reduced to these three; <hi>viz. 1. That there can be no punishment but what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, but no man can deserve that another should be punished. 2. That punishment flows from revenge, but there can be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge where there hath been no fault. 3. That the punishment of one, cannot any ways be made the punishment of another; and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">D</note> 
                        <hi>in case it be supposed possible, then those in whose stead the other is punished, must be actually delivered upon the payment of that debt which was owing to God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>That one man cannot deserve anothers punishment,</hi> and therefore one cannot be punished for another; for there is no just punishment, but what is deserved. This being the main Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment insisted on by <hi>Crellius,</hi> must be more carefully considered; but before an answer be made to it, it is necessary that a clear account be given in what sense it is he understands it, which will be best done, by laying down his principles, as to the justice of <note place="margin">E</note> punishments, in a more distinct method than himself hath done; which are these following: 1. That no person can be justly punished, either for his own or anothers faults, but he that hath deserved to be punished by some sin of his own: For he
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:97974:160"/>
still asserts, <q>That the justice of punishment ariseth from a <note place="margin">A</note> 
                           <note place="margin">Crell. c. 4. sect. 3 p. 239, 240.</note> mans own fault, though the actual punishment may be from anothers: But he that is punished without respect to his own guilt, is punished undeservedly; and he that is punished unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly, is punished unjustly.</q> 2. That personal guilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing supposed one mans sin may be the <hi>impulsive cause</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers punishment, but they cannot be the <hi>meritorious.</hi> The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them he thus explains, <q>The cause, is that which makes a thing to be; the impulsive, that which moves one to do a thing, without any consideration of right that one hath to do it: Merit, is that which makes a man worthy of a <note place="margin">B</note> thing, either good or bad, and so gives a right to it; if it be good, to himself; if bad, to him at whose hands he hath deserved it. Now he tells us, that it is impossible, That one mans sins should make any other deserve punishment, but the person who committed them; but they may impel one to punish another, and that justly, if the person hath otherwise deserved to be punished, unjustly if he hath not.</q> The reason he gives of it is, <q>That the vitiosity of the act, which is the proper cause of punishment, cannot go beyond the person of the offender; and therefore can oblige none to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">C</note> but him that hath committed the fault.</q> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he asserts, <q>That no man can be justly punished beyond the desert of his own sins, but there may sometimes be a double impulsive cause of that punishment; <hi>viz.</hi> His own and other mens, whereof one made that they might be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Crell. ib. sect. 18.</note> punished, the other that they should be actually: but the later, <hi>he saith,</hi> always supposeth the former, as the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of just punishment; so that no part of punishment could be executed upon him, wherein his own sins were not suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as the meritorious cause of it.</q> These are his two main prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <note place="margin">D</note> which we must now throughly examine, the main force of his book lying in them. But if we can prove, that it hath been generally received by the consent of mankind, that a person may be punished beyond the desert of his own actions; if God hath justly punished some for the sins of others, and there be no injustice in one mans suffering by his own consent for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then these principles of <hi>Crellius</hi> will be found not so firm as he imagines them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it hath been generally received by the consent of <note place="margin">§. 4.

saults, and people for their Princes, and that corporal punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">A</note> might be born by one for another, did appear by the <hi>Persians</hi> punishing the whole family for the fault of one.

Thence the right of killing hostages among the most civilized nations; and of sureties being punished in Capital matters, if the guilty <note place="margin">B</note> appear not, who were thence called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

We are now to consider what <hi>Crellius</hi> doth answer to this: 1. As to their acknowledgements of Gods punishing Children for their Parents faults, he gives the same answer which he doth to the examples recorded in <hi>Scripture</hi> to that <note place="margin">C</note> purpose, <hi>That either they were punished for the sins of others, but their own sins deserved the punishment; or that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were punished in the Children, but the Children were not properly punished.</hi> 2. As to punishments among men, he answers two things; 1. <q>That such persons were truly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, but not justly: for he acknowledges, That in <note place="margin">Crell. c. 4. sect. 5. p. 244.</note> such a case it is a proper punishment, and that it is enough in order to that, that any fault be charged upon a person, whether his own or anothers, whether true or false, on the account of which he is supposed worthy to be punished: <note place="margin">D</note> And that such a conjunction is sufficient for cruel, angry, or imprudent men; for where ever there is a place, <hi>saith he,</hi> for anger, there is likewise for punishment.</q> So that he consesseth, there may be <hi>a true punishment,</hi> and that which answers all the reason and ends of punishment assigned by him, where there is <hi>no desert</hi> at all of it in the person who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes it. But then he adds, <hi>that this is an unjust punishment,</hi> to which I reply, That then the reason of punishment assigned by <hi>Crellius</hi> before is insufficient; for if this answers all the ends of punishments assigned by him, and yet be unjust, <note place="margin">E</note> then it necessarily follows, that those ends of punishment are consistent with the greatest injustice. For he before made punishment to have a natural respect to anger, and makes the ordinary end of punishment to be a satisfaction of the desire of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:97974:161"/>
revenge in men, yet now grants, that these may be in an unjust punishment. Neither can it be said, <hi>that he considered punishment</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A</note> 
                        <hi>only naturally, and not morally;</hi> for he tells us, <hi>that this is the nature of divine punishments,</hi> which are therefore just, because designed for these ends; but in case there be no sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of a fault at all, then he denyes that it is a punishment, but only an asfliction, and an exercise of dominion. So that according to him, where-ever there is a proper punishment, it must be just, when-ever God doth punish men: and the only difference between God and man supposable in this case is, that we have assurance God will never use his dominion unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but that men do so when they make one to suffer for anothers <note place="margin">B</note> fault, notwithstanding a consent and conjunction between the man that committed the fault, and the person that suffers for him. But this is begging the thing in question, for we are debating, whether it be an unlawful exercise of power or no? for we have this presumption, that it is not unlawful, because it may answer all the ends of punishments, and what way can we better judge, whether a punishment be just or no, than by that?</p>
                     <p>But we are to consider, that we do not here take the person we speak of, abstractly <hi>as an innocent person,</hi> for then there <note place="margin">C</note> 
                        <note place="margin">§. 5. Objections answered.</note> is no question, but anger and punishment of one as such is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just; but of an innocent person as supposed under an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his own consent to suffer for another. And in this case we assert, since according to <hi>Crellius</hi> the natural and proper ends of punishments may be obtained, and the consent of the person takes away the wrong done to him in the matter of his sufferings, so far as he hath power over himself, that such a punishment is not unjust. For if it be, it must suppose some <hi>injury</hi> to be done; but in this case let them assign where the injury lies; it cannot be to the <hi>publick,</hi> if the ends of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments <note place="margin">D</note> may be obtained by such a suffering of one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by a valid consent of the suffering party; it cannot be to the <hi>person</hi> in <hi>whose room</hi> the other suffers, for what injury is that to escape punishment by anothers suffering; it cannot be to <hi>the suffering person,</hi> supposing that to be true, which the Heathens still supposed, <hi>viz.</hi> that every man had a power <note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <hi>jus as Vossius</hi> tells us, <hi>ut dign us sit cui tribui aliquid aequum est:</hi> so that where there is an equity in the thing, there is a dignity in the person, or he may be said to be <hi>worthy</hi> to undergo it. <hi>But doth not this lay open the greatest innocency to as great a desert of sufferings, as the highest guilt?</hi> By no means. For we make a lyableness to punishment, the natural consequent of guilt: and he that <note place="margin">B</note> hath committed a fault, cannot but <hi>deserve</hi> to be punished, so that no sufferings of others can take away the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of a bad action, which is a <hi>desert of punishment;</hi> So that as we say, a wicked action cannot but deserve to be punished, <hi>i. e.</hi> there is an agreeableness in reason and nature, that he who hath done ill, should suffer ill; so we say like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there is necessity in nature and reason, that he that hath thus deserved it, must unavoidably suffer it. And on the other side, we say, <hi>no man by his innocency can deserve to be punished,</hi> i. e. no mans innocency makes him by vertue of <note place="margin">C</note> that obnoxious to punishment; but yet we add, that <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his innocency,</hi> the circumstances may be such that he may be <hi>justly</hi> punished, and in that sense <hi>deservedly.</hi> So that the Question is strangely mistaken, when it is thus put, <hi>Whether an innocent person considered as such, may be justly punished;</hi> for no one asserts that, or is bound to do it; but the true question is, <hi>whether a person notwith stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his innocency may not by some act of his own will oblige himself to undergo that punishment which otherwise he did not deserve? which punishment, in that case is just and agreeable</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">D</note> 
                        <hi>to reason:</hi> And this is that which we assert and plead for. So that innocency here is not considered any other ways, than whether that alone makes it an unlawful punishment, which otherwise would be lawful, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether the Magistrate in such cases, where substitution is admittable by the Laws of Nations (as in the cases we are now upon) be bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard any more than that the obligation to punishment now lies upon the person, who by his own act hath substituted himself in the others room; and if he proceeds upon this, his action is justifyable and agreeable to reason. If it be said, <note place="margin">E</note> 
                        <hi>that the substitution is unjust, unless the substituted person hath before hand deserved to be punished;</hi> it is easily answered, that this makes not the matter at all clearer; for either the person is punished for the former fault, and then there is no
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:97974:162"/>
substitution; or if he be punished by way of substitution; then <note place="margin">A</note> there is no regard at all had to his former fault, and so it is all one as if he were perfectly innocent.</p>
                     <p>And by this <hi>Crellius</hi> his answer to the instances both in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">§. 6. The instances of Scripture considered.</note> and elsewhere concerning Childrens being punished for their Parents faults, will appear to be insufficient, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>That God doth never punish them for their Parents faults beyond the desert of their own sins, and therefore no argument can be drawn from thence, that God may punish an innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for the sins of others, because he hath punished some for what they were innocent:</q>  For the force of the argument doth <note place="margin">B</note>not lye in the supposition of their innocency, as to the ground of punishment in general, for we do not deny, but that they may deserve to be punished for their own faults: but the argument lies in this, whether their own guilt were then considered as the reason of punishment, when God did punish them for their fathers faults? And whether they by their own sins did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be punished not only with the punishment due to their own miscarriages, but with the punishment due to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too? If not, then some persons are justly punished, who have not deserved that punishment they undergo; if they did <note place="margin">C</note> deserve it, then one person may deserve to be punished for anothers sins. If it be said, as it is by <hi>Crellius, That his own sins make him capable of punishment, and God by occasion of others sins doth execute that punishment, which he might not have done for his own.</hi> I answer, we are not enquiring into the bare capacity of punishing, but into the reason of it: was the reason of punishment his own or his fathers sins? If his own, then he was punished only for his own sins; if his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then the punishment may be just which is inflicted without consideration of proper <hi>desert</hi> of it; <hi>for no man</hi> (say they) <note place="margin">D</note> 
                        <hi>can deserve to be punished, but for his own sins.</hi> But it's said, <hi>that the sins of Fathers are only an impulsive cause for God to punish the Children according to the desert of their own sins, which he might otherwise have forborn to punish.</hi> Then, the sins of the Fathers are no <hi>reason</hi> why the Children should be punished; but their own sins are the <hi>reason,</hi> and their Fathers the <hi>bare occasion</hi> of being punished for them. But in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> the <hi>reason</hi> of punishment is drawn from the <hi>Fathers sins:</hi> and not from the <hi>Childrens:</hi> For then the words would have run thus, <hi>if the Children sin, and deserve punishment</hi>

                        <hi>by their own iniquities, then, I will take occasion from their Fathers sins to visit their own iniquities upon them:</hi> Whereas the words refer to the <hi>Fathers sins</hi> as the reason of the <hi>Childrens</hi> punishment. So in the words of the Law, wherein the reason

of punishment ought to be most expresly assigned, it is not, <note place="margin">A</note> I will certainly punish the Children, if they continue in the Idolatry of their Fathers; but, <hi>I will visit the sins of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth Generation</hi>

                        <hi>of them that hate me:</hi> If it were only because of <hi>imitation</hi> of the Fathers sins by the Children, there could be no reason for the limitation to the third and fourth Generation; for then the reason of punishment would be as long as the <hi>imitation</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, whether to the fourth or tenth Generation: And as <hi>Alphonsus à Castro</hi> observes, <q>If the reason of punishment were the imitation of their Fathers sins, then the Children <note place="margin">Alph. à Castro de justâ haeret. punit. l. 2. c. 10.</note> 
                           <note place="margin">B</note> were not punished for their Fathers sins, but for their own; for that imitation was a sin of their own, and not of their Fathers.</q> Besides, if the proper reason of punishment were the sins of the Children, and the Fathers sins only the occasion of it, then where it is mentioned that Children are punished for their Parents sins, the Childrens <hi>sins</hi> should have been par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly expressed, as the proper <hi>cause</hi> of the punishment: But no other reason is assigned in the Law, but the sins of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> no other cause mentioned of <hi>Canaans</hi> punishment, <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 25.</note> but his Fathers sin; nor of the punishment of the people in <note place="margin">C</note>

                        <note place="margin">A</note> 
                        <hi>the Lord God of their Fathers:</hi> To say, that this was done in <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> and bare outward compliance, is to speak without book; and if the reason of so severe punishments had been their hypocrisie, that ought to have been mentioned; but not only here, but afterwards it is said, that the reason of Gods destroying <hi>Iudah,</hi> was <hi>for the sins of Manasseh; viz.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 3, 4.</note> his Idolatries and Murther, which it is said, <hi>the Lord will not pardon.</hi> And if he would not pardon, then he did punish for those sins, not barely as the <hi>occasion,</hi> but as the <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cause</hi> of that punishment. What shall we say then? Did <note place="margin">B</note> the people in <hi>Iosiah</hi>'s time, deserve to be punished for the sins of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> Grandfather to <hi>Iosiah?</hi> Or was God so highly provoked with those sins, that although he did not punish <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseh</hi> himself upon his repentance, yet he would let the world see, how much he abhorred them, by punishing those sins upon the people afterwards; although according to the usual proportion of sins punishments, the sins and of the people in that age did not exceed the sins of others ages, as much as the punishments they suffered, did exceed the punishments of other ages: which is necessary according to <hi>Crellius</hi> his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; <note place="margin">C</note> for if God never punisheth by occasion of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sins, the Children beyond the <hi>desert</hi> of their own <hi>sins;</hi> then it is necessary, that where judgements are remarkably greater, the sins must be so too; the contrary to which is plain in this instance. By which we see, that it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Justice of God in punishing, to make the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some on the account of others sins, to exceed the <hi>desert</hi> of their own; measuring that <hi>desert,</hi> not in a way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all sin; but when the <hi>desert</hi> of some sins is compared with the desert of others: For it is of this latter we speak of, <note place="margin">D</note> and of the method which God useth in punishing sin here, for the demonstration of his hatred of it, according to which the greatest punishments must suppose the greatest sins, either of their own, or others which they suffer for.</p>

To which I answer, These words are to be considered, as an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to a complaint made by the <hi>Iews,</hi> soon after their going into Captivity, which they imputed to Gods severity in <note place="margin">E</note> punishing them for their Fathers sins. Now the complaint was either true or false; if it were true, then though this was looked upon as great severity in God, yet it was no injustice in him; for though God may act severely, he cannot act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly:
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:97974:163"/>
If it was false, then the answer had been an absolute <note place="margin">A</note> denial of it, as a thing repugnant to the Justice of God. Which we do not find here, but that God saith unto them, <hi>v. 3. Ye shall not have occasion any more to use this Proverb in</hi> Israel: if the thing had been plainly unjust, which they complained of, he would have told them, they never had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to use it. But we find the <hi>Prophets</hi> telling them before hand, that they should suffer for their Fathers sins, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 15. 3, 4, where he threatens them with destruction and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, because of the <hi>sins of Manasseh in Ierusalem;</hi> and in the beginning of the captivity they complain of this, <hi>Lam.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">B</note> 5. 7. <hi>Our Fathers have sinned, and are not, and we have born their iniquities.</hi> And <hi>Ierem. 31. 28.

                        <hi>his own iniquity.</hi> Which place is exactly parallel with this in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and gives us a clear account of it, which is, that now indeed God had dealt very severely with them, by making <note place="margin">C</note> them suffer beyond, what in the ordinary course of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence their sins had deserved; but he punished them not only for their own sins, but the sins of their <hi>Fathers:</hi> But lest they should think, they should be utterly consumed for their iniquities, and be no longer a people enjoying the Land which <hi>God</hi> had promised them, he tells them by the <hi>Prophets,</hi> though they had smarted so much, by reason of their <hi>Fathers</hi> sins, this severity should not always continue upon them; but that God would visit them with his kindness again, and would plant them in their own Land, then they should see no reason <note place="margin">D</note> to continue this Proverb among them; for they would then find, <hi>Though their Fathers had eaten sowre grapes, their teeth should not be always set on edge with it.</hi> And if we observe it, the occasion of the <hi>Proverb,</hi> was concerning the <hi>Land of Israel,</hi>

                        <hi>super terra Israel,</hi> as the <hi>Chaldee Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrast</hi> renders it more agreeable to the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> than the <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 2.</note> other Versions do. So that the <hi>Land of Israel</hi> was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Proverb,</hi> by their being banished out of it for their Fathers sins: Now God tells them, they should have no more occasion to use this Proverb concerning the <hi>Land of Israel;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">E</note> for they, notwithstanding their Fathers sins, should return into their own <hi>Land.</hi> And even during the continuance of their captivity, they should not undergo such great severities for the future, but they should find their condition much more

tolerable than they imagined; only, if any were guilty of <note place="margin">A</note> greater sins than others, they should themselves suffer for their own faults, but he would not punish the whole Nation for them, or their own posterity. This I take to be the genuine meaning of this place; and I the rather embrace it, because I find such insuperable difficulties in other Interpretations that are given of it: For to say as our Adversaries do, <hi>That what God saith, should not be for the future, was repugnant to his nature and justice ever to do,</hi> is to charge God plainly with injustice in what he had done: For the <hi>Prophets</hi> told them they should suffer for the sins of their <hi>Fathers:</hi> Which suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <note place="margin">B</note> were the ground of their complaint now, and the answer here given must relate to the occasion of the complaint; for God saith, <hi>They should not have occasion to use that Proverb:</hi> Wherein is implied, they should not have the same reason to complain which they had then. I demand then, Do not these words imply, That God would not do for the future with them, what he had done before; if not, the proper answer had been a plain denial, and not a promise for the future he would not; if they do, then either <hi>God</hi> properly punished them for the sins of their <hi>Fathers,</hi> and then God must be <hi>unjust</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">C</note> in doing so; or it was just with <hi>God</hi> to do it, and so this place instead of overthrowing will prove, that some may be justly punished, beyond the desert of their own sins: or else, <hi>God did only take occasion by their Fathers sins, to punish them according to the desert of their own iniquities:</hi> But then they had no cause to complain, that they were punished for any more than their own iniquities; and withal, then God doth oblige himself by his promise here, never to punish men for the future <hi>by the occasion of others sins:</hi> which is not only contrary to their own Doctrine, but to what is plainly seen after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">D</note> in the punishment of the <hi>Iews</hi> for their <hi>Fathers sins,</hi> mentioned by our <hi>Saviour</hi> after this: And if this be a certain rule of equity which God here saith, that he would never vary <note place="margin">Matth. 23. 35.</note> from, then the punishing of some on the occasion of others sins, would be as unjust, as our <hi>Adversaries</hi> suppose the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing any beyond the desert of their own sins to be. <hi>But is it not implyed, that Gods ways would be unequal, if he ever</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>did otherwise than he there said he would do?</hi> No, it is not, if by <hi>equal</hi> he meant <hi>just,</hi> for his ways never were, or can be so unequal; but here if it be taken with a respect to the main <note place="margin">E</note> dispute of the Chapter, no more is implied in them, but that they judged amiss concerning Gods actions, and that they were <hi>just,</hi> when they thought them not to be so: or if at least, they thought his ways very severe, though just, God by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:97974:164"/>
of this severity, would shew that he was not only <note place="margin">A</note> 
                        <hi>just,</hi> but <hi>kind;</hi> and so they would find his ways <hi>equal,</hi> that is, always agreeable to themselves, and ending in <hi>kindness</hi> to them, though they hitherto were so severe towards them in their banishment and captivity. Or if they be taken with a respect to the immediate occasion of them both, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.—33. They do not relate to this dispute about <hi>Childrens suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their Fathers sins;</hi> but to another, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 20.</note> a righteous mans sinning and dying in his sins, and a wicked mans repenting, and living in his righteousness; which were directly contrary to the common opinion of the <note place="margin">B</note> 
                        <hi>Iews</hi> to this day, which is, that God will judge men accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the greatest number of their actions good or bad: as appears by <hi>Maimonides</hi> and others. Now they thought it a very hard case, for a man who had been righteous the far greatest part of his time, if he did at last commit iniquity, that his former righteousness should signifie nothing, but he must dye in his iniquity. To this therefore God answers, that it was only the inequality of their own ways, which made them think Gods ways in doing so unequal. This then doth not make it unequal, for God either to punish men, upon the occasion, <note place="margin">C</note> or by the desert of other mens sins, supposing such a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between them, as there is in the same body of people, to those who went before them. And <hi>Crellius</hi> himself grants, <q>That <hi>Socinus</hi> never intended to prove, that one mans suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for anothers sins was unjust in it self, from this place: <note place="margin">Crell. c. 4. sect. 15.</note> no, not though we take it in the strictest sense, for one suffering in the stead of another.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having thus far cleared, how far it is agreeable to Gods Justice, to punish any persons either by reason of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <note place="margin">§. 8. The delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the guilty by the sufferings of an innocent person by his own consent, makes not the punishment unjust.</note> or the conjunction of persons, for the sins of others, <note place="margin">D</note> and consequently whether any punishment may be undergone justly beyond the proper desert of their own sins, I now return to <hi>the consent of Mankind</hi> in it, on supposition either of a neer conjunction, or a valid consent which must make up the want of dominion in men without it. And the question still pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon the supposition of those things, that there be a proper dominion in men over that which they part with for others sakes, and that they do it by their free consent; and then we justifie it not to be repugnant to the principles of Reason and Justice for any to suffer beyond the <hi>desert</hi> of their <note place="margin">E</note> own actions. And <hi>Crellius</hi> his saying, that such a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is true punishment, but not just; is no answer at all to the consent of Nations that it is so. And therefore finding this answer insufficient; he relies upon another, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q>That

For he saith, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Socinus</hi> nor he do deny that one man may be punished for anothers sins; but that which they deny is, that ever the innocent were punished so as the guilty were freed by it, <hi>and so he answers,</hi> in the case of Hostages and Sureties, their punishment did never excuse the offenders themselves. And to this purpose <hi>he saith, Socinus</hi> his argument doth hold good, that though one mans money may become anothers, yet one mans sufferings cannot become anothers: For, <hi>saith</hi> 
                           <note place="margin">B</note> 
                           <hi>he,</hi> if it could, then it would be all one who suffered, as it is who pays the money due: And then the offender must be presently released, as the Debtor is upon payment of the debt.</q> This is the substance of what is said by him upon this Argument. To which I reply; 1. That this gives up the matter in dispute at present between us; for the present question is, Whether it be unjust for any one to suffer beyond the desert of his own actions? <hi>Yes</hi> saith <hi>Crellius, it is, in case he suffers so, as that the guilty be freed by his sufferings.</hi> But we are not enquiring, Whether it be just for another person to be freed <note place="margin">C</note> for a mans suffering for him? but whether it be just for that man to suffer by his own consent, more than <hi>his own</hi> actions, without that consent deserved? The release of another person by vertue of his sufferings, is a matter of another considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Doth the freeing or not freeing of another by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, add any thing to the <hi>desert</hi> of suffering? He that being wholly innocent, and doth suffer on the account of anothers fault, doth he not suffer as <hi>undeservedly,</hi> though another be not freed, as if he were? As in the case of <hi>Hostages</hi> or Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, doth it make them at all the more guilty, because the <note place="margin">D</note> persons they are concerned for, will be punished notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, if they come under the power of those who exacted the punishment upon them, who suffered for them? Nay, is not their <hi>desert</hi> of punishment so much the less, in as much as the guilty are still bound to answer for their own offences? If we could suppose the guilty to be freed by the others suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, it would be by supposing their guilt more fully translated upon those who suffer, and consequently, a greater obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to punishment following that guilt. From whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that if it be just to punish, when the person is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered <note place="margin">E</note> from whom the other suffers, it is more just when he is; for the translation of the penalty is much less in the former case, than in latter; and what is just upon less grounds of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, must be more just upon greater. I look on this
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:97974:165"/>
therefore but as a shift of <hi>Crellius,</hi> hoping thereby to avoid <note place="margin">A</note> the consent of mankind in one mans suffering for another, without attending to the main argument he was upon; <hi>viz.</hi> The justice of one person suffering for another. 2. It is a very unreasonable thing, to make an action unjust for that, which of it self is acknowledged by our <hi>Adversaries</hi> to be very just; <hi>viz.</hi> The pardoning the offenders themselves. If it were just to suffer, if the other were not pardoned, and it were just to pardon, whether the other were punished or no, how comes this suffering to be unjust, meerly by the others being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by it: nay, is it not rather an Argument, that those <note place="margin">B</note> sufferings are the most just, which do so fully answer all the ends of punishments; that there is then no necessity that the offender should suffer; but that the Supreme Governor having obtained the ends of Government, by the suffering of one for the rest, declares himself so well pleased with it, that he is willing to pardon the offenders themselves. 3. Many of those persons who have had their sins punished in others, have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves escaped the punishment due to the desert of their sins. As is plain in the case of <hi>Ahab,</hi> whose punishment was not so great as his sins deserved, because the full punishment of them was <note place="margin">C</note> reserved to his posterity. If it be said, as it is by <hi>Crellius, That</hi> Ahab <hi>was not wholly freed, his life being taken away,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Crell. c. 4. sect 25. 1 King 21. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>for his own sins:</hi> That gives no sufficient answer; for if some part of the punishment was deferred, that part he was delivered from; and the same reason in this case will hold for the whole as the part. As is plain in the case of <hi>Manasseh,</hi> and several others, the guilt of whose sins were punished on their posterity, themselves escaping it. 4. Our Adversaries confess, that in some cases it is lawful and just for some to suffer, with a design that others may be freed by their suffering for them. Thus <note place="margin">D</note> they assert, <hi>That one Christian, not only may, but ought to lay down his life for another, if there be any danger of his denying the truth, or be judges him far more useful and considerable than himself: so likewise a son for his Father, one Brother for another, or a Friend, or any, whose life he thinks more useful</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Crell. cap. 6. sect. 39.</note> 
                        <hi>than his own.</hi> Now I ask, whether a man can be bound to a thing that is <hi>in its own nature unjust?</hi> if not, as it is plain he cannot, then such an obligation of one man to suffer for the delivery of another cannot be unjust, and consequently the suffering it self cannot be so. But <hi>Crellius</hi> saith, <hi>The injustice</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">E</note> 
                        <hi>in this case lies wholly upon the Magistrate who admits it:</hi> but I ask wherefore is it unjust in the Magistrate to admit it? is it because the thing is in it self unjust? if so, there can be no obligation to do it; and it would be as great a sin to undergo
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:97974:166"/>
it as in the Magistrate to permit it; but if it be just in <note place="margin">A</note> it self, we have obtained what we contend for; <hi>viz.</hi> that it may be just for a man to suffer beyond <hi>the desert</hi> of his own actions; for he that lays down his life for his Brethren, doth not deserve by his own actions that very punishment which he undergoes. And if the thing be in it self just, how comes it to be unjust in him that permits it? 5. The reason why among men the offenders themselves are punished, is because those were not the terms, upon which the persons suffered. For if they had suffered upon these terms that the other might be freed, and their suffering was admitted of by the Magistrate on that consideration, then in all reason and <note place="margin">B</note> justice the offenders ought to be freed on the account of the others suffering for them. But among men the chief reason of the obligation to punishment of one man for another, is not, that the other might be freed, but that there may be security given to the publick, that the offenders shall be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and the reason of the sureties suffering is not to deliver the offender, but to satisfie the Law, by declaring that all care is taken that the offender should be punished, when in case of his escape, the surety suffers for him. But it is quite another thing when the person suffers purposely that others might be <note place="margin">C</note> freed by his suffering, for then in case the suffering be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the release of the other is not only not unjust, but becomes due to him that suffered, on his own terms. Not as though it followed <hi>ipso facto</hi> as <hi>Crellius</hi> fancies, but the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of release doth depend upon the terms which he who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for them, shall make in order to it. For upon this suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of one for another upon such terms, the immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent of the suffering is not the <hi>actual discharge</hi> but the <hi>right</hi> to it which he hath purchased; and which he may dispense upon what tèrms he shall judge most for his honour. 6. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">D</note> one persons sufferings cannot become anothers so as one mans <hi>Money</hi> may; yet one mans sufferings may be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient consideration on which a benefit may accure to another. For to that end a donation, or such a transferring right from one to another as is in <hi>Money,</hi> is not necessary, but the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation which it hath from him who hath the power to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. If he declare that he is so well pleased with the sufferings of one for another, that in consideration of them, he will pardon those from whom he suffered; where lies the impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility or unreasonableness of the thing? For <hi>Crellius</hi> grants, <note place="margin">E</note> 
                        <note place="margin">Crell. ib. sect. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>that rewards may be given to others than the persons who did the actions in consideration of those actions;</hi> and why may not the sufferings of one for others, being purposely undertaken for
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:97974:166"/>
this end, be available for the pardon of those whom he suffered <note place="margin">A</note> for? For a man can no more transfer the right of his good actions, than of his sufferings. From all which it follows, that one person may by his own consent, and being admitted thereto by him to whom the right of punishing belongs, suffer justly; though it be beyond the desert of his own actions; and the guilty may be pardoned on the account of his sufferings. Which was the first thing we designed to prove from <hi>Crellius,</hi> in order to the overthrowing his own <hi>hypothesis.</hi> For it being confessed by him that such sufferings have all that belongs to the nature of punishments, and since God hath justly punished <note place="margin">B</note> some for the sins which they have not committed; since all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have allowed it just for one man by his own consent to suffer for another; since it cannot be unjust for the offender to be released by anothers sufferings, if he were admitted to suffer for that end, it evidently follows, contrary to <hi>Crellius</hi> his main Principle, that <hi>a person may be justly punished beyond the desert of his own actions:</hi> And so that first argument of <hi>Crellius</hi> cannot hold, <hi>that one man cannot by his own consent suffer for another, because no man can deserve anothers pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and no punishment is just but what is deserved.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">C</note> His second argument from the nature of <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>revenge</hi> hath been already answered in the first Discourse about the nature and ends of punishments, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>s third argument, <hi>that one mans punishment cannot become anothers,</hi> immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And so we have finished our first consideration of the <hi>sufferings of Christ</hi> in general, as <hi>a punishment of our sins,</hi> which we have shewed to be agreeable both to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi>

                           <hi>e Death of Christ considered as an Expiatory Sacrifice for sin. What the expiation of sin was by the Sacrifices under the Law; twofold, Civil and Ritual.

                     </argument>
                     <p>WE come now to consider the death of Christ, <note place="margin">§. 1. The death of Christ consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as an Expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for sin.</note> as an <hi>Expiatory Sacrifice for the sins of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:</hi> Which is as much denied by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, as that it was a punishment for our sins. For though they do not deny, <hi>That Christ as a Priest did offer up a Sacrifice of Expiation for the sins of men;</hi> yet they utterly deny, <hi>That this was performed on earth,</hi> or that <note place="margin">D</note> 
                        <hi>the Expiation of sins did respect God, but only us;</hi> or, <hi>that the death of Christ, had any proper efficacy towards the expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sin, any further than as it comprehends in it all the consequences of his death,</hi> by a strange <hi>Catechresis.</hi> I shall now therefore prove, that all things which do belong to a proper Expiatory Sacrifice, do agree to the death of Christ. There are three things especially considerable in it: 1. A Substitution in the place of the Offenders. 2. An Oblation of it to God. 3. An Expiation of sin consequent upon it. Now these three, I shall make appear to agree fully to the death of <note place="margin">E</note> Christ for us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>A Substitution in the place of the Offenders.</hi> That we are to prove, was designed in the <hi>Expiatory Sacrifices</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> and that <hi>Christ</hi> in his death <hi>for us,</hi> was <hi>substituted</hi> in our place.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:97974:167"/>
1. That in the Expiatory Sacrifices under the Law, there was <note place="margin">A</note> a <hi>Substitution</hi> of them <hi>in the place</hi> of the Offenders. This our Adversaries are not willing to yield us, because of the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency which is so plain in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those Sacrifices, and that which was offered up by Christ. We now speak only of those Sacrifices, which we are sure were appointed of old for the expiation of sin, by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. As to which the great rule assigned by the Apostle was, <hi>That without shedding of blood there was no remission.</hi> If we <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22.</note> yield <hi>Crellius</hi> what he so often urgeth; <hi>viz. That these words are to be understood, of what was done under the Law:</hi> They <note place="margin">Crell c. 10. sect. 14.</note> 
                        <note place="margin">B</note> will not be the less serviceable to our purpose; for thereby it will appear, that the means of Expiation lay in the <hi>shedding of blood:</hi> Which shews, that the very <hi>mactation</hi> of the beast to be sacrificed, was designed in order to the expiation of sin. To an inquisitive person, the reason of the slaying such multitudes of beasts in the Sacrifices appointed by God himself among the <hi>Iews,</hi> would have appeared far less evident than now it doth, since the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> hath given us so full an account of them. For it had been very unreasonable to have thought, that they had been meerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted <note place="margin">C</note> out of compliance with the customs of other Nations, since the whole design of their Religion, was to separate them from them: and on such a supposition the great design of the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> signifies very little; which doth far more explain to us the nature and tendency of all the Sacrifices in use among them, that had any respect to the expiation of sins, than all the customs of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or the Commentaries of the latter <hi>Iews.</hi> But I intend not now to discourse at large, upon this subject of Sacrifices, either as to the nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of them in general, or with a particular respect to the <note place="margin">D</note> Sacrifice of Christ, since a learned person of our <hi>Church,</hi> hath already undertaken <hi>Crellius</hi> upon this Argument, and we hope ere long will oblige the world with the benefit of his pains. I shall therefore only insist on those things which are necessary for our purpose, in order to the clearing the Substitution of Christ in our stead, for the expiation of our sins by his death; and this we say was represented in the Expiatory Sacrifices, which were instituted among the <hi>Iews.</hi> If we yield <hi>Crellius</hi> what he after <hi>Socinus</hi> contends for; <hi>viz. That the Sacrifice</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Crell. c. 10. sect. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>of Christ was only represented in the publick and solemn Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>

                        <hi>Sacrifices for the people, and especially those on the day of Atonement:</hi> We may have enough from them to vindicate all that we assert, concerning the Expiatory Sacrifice of the blood of Christ.</p>

                        <pb n="316" facs="tcp:97974:168"/>
For that those were designed by way of <hi>Substitution</hi> in the <note place="margin">A</note> place of the offenders, will appear from the circumstances and <note place="margin">§. 2. What the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For while men assert, that the expiation was wholly typical, and of the same nature with that expiation which is really obtained by the death of Christ, they easily prove, <hi>That all the expiation then, was only decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and did no more depend on the sacrifices offered, than</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">B</note> 
                        <hi>on a condition required by God, the neglect of which would be an act of disobedience in them; and by this means it could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present,</hi> say they, <hi>no more than such an expiation to be by Christ;</hi> viz. <hi>Gods declaring that sins are expiated by him, on the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of such a condition required in order thereto, as laying down his life was.</hi> But we assert another kind of expiation of sin, by vertue of the Sacrifice being slain and offered; which was real, and depended upon the Sacrifice: And this was two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, a <hi>Civil,</hi> and a <hi>Ritual</hi> expiation, according to the double ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity in which the people of the <hi>Iews</hi> may be considered, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">C</note> as members of a Society, subsisting by a body of <hi>Laws,</hi> which according to the strictest <hi>Sanction</hi> of it, makes death the penalty of disobedience, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. but by the will of the Legislator, did admit of a relaxation in many cases, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by himself; in which he declares, That the death of the beast designed for a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> should be accepted, instead of the death of the offender; and so the offence should be fully expiated, as to the execution of the penal Law upon him. And thus far, I freely admit what <hi>Grotius</hi> asserts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Grot. de Satisf. c. 10.</note> this subject, and do yield that no other offence could be <note place="margin">D</note> expiated in this manner, but such which God himself did particularly declare should be so. And therefore no sin which was to be punished by cutting off, was to be expiated by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; as <hi>wilful Idolatry, Murther, &amp;c.</hi> Which it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for those to give an account of, who make the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation wholly <hi>typical;</hi> for why then should not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sins much rather have had sacrifices of <hi>expiation</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them: because the Consciences of men would be more solicitous for the pardon of greater than lesser sins; and the blood of Christ represented by them, was designed <note place="margin">E</note> for the expiation of all. From whence it is evident, that it was not a meer <hi>typical</hi> expiation; but it did relate to the civil constitution among them. But besides this, we are to consider the people with a respect to that mode of Divine
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:97974:168"/>
Worship which was among them; by reason of which, the <note place="margin">A</note> people were to be purified from the <hi>legal</hi> impurities which they contracted, which hindred them from joyning with others in the publick Worship of <hi>God,</hi> and many Sacrifices were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed purposely for the expiating this <hi>legal guilt,</hi> as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, <hi>the ashes of the red heifer,</hi> Numb. 19. 9. which is there called <hi>a purification for sin.</hi> And the <hi>Apostle</hi> puts <hi>the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 12, 13.</note> 
                        <hi>blood of Bulls and of Goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the unclean,</hi> together; and the effect of both of them, he saith, was <hi>to sanctifie to the purifying of the flesh;</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that there was some proper and immediate effect of these <note place="margin">B</note> sacrifices upon the people at that time, though infinitely short of the effect of the blood of Christ upon the <hi>Consciences</hi> of men. By which it is plain, the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth not speak of the same kind of <hi>expiation</hi> in those sacrifices, which was in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ, and that the one was barely typical of the other; but of a different kind of <hi>expiation,</hi> as far as <hi>purifying the flesh</hi> is from <hi>purging the Conscience.</hi> But we do not deny, that the whole dispensation was <hi>typical,</hi> and that <hi>the Law had</hi>

There are two things which the Apostle asserts concerning the Sacrifices of the <hi>Law:</hi> First, that they had an effect upon the Bodies of men, which he calls <hi>purifying the flesh;</hi> the other is, that they had no power to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate for the sins of the soul, considered with a respect to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of another life, which he calls <hi>purging the Conscience from dead works;</hi> and therefore he saith, <hi>that all the gifts</hi>

                        <hi>doth not of it self imply a commutation,</hi> yet he grants, <hi>that the circumstances of the places do imply it.</hi> 2. He denies, <hi>that there is any proper surrogation in Christs</hi>

But notwithstanding all these fair words, <hi>Crellius</hi> means no more than <hi>Socinus</hi> did; and though he would allow the words which <hi>Grotius</hi> used, yet not in the sense he understood them in; for <hi>Crellius</hi> means no more by all this, but that <hi>the death of Christ was an antecedent condition to the expiation of sins in Heaven, Grotius</hi> understands by them, that <hi>Christ did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate sins by becoming a Sacrifice for them in his death.</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">B</note> However, from hence it appears, that our Adversaries can have no plea against the death of Christs being an expiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacrifice (from want of a substitution in our room) since they profess themselves so willing to own such a substitution. But if they say, that there could be no <hi>proper substitution,</hi> because <hi>the death of Christ was a bare condition, and no punishment,</hi> they then express their minds more freely; and if these places be allowed to prove a substitution, I hope the former discourse will prove that it was by way of punishment. Neither is it necessary, <hi>that the very same kind of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

                        <hi>be undergone in order to surrogation,</hi> but that it be sufficient in order to the accomplishing the end for which it was designed. For this kind of <hi>substitution</hi> being in order to the delivery of another by it, whatever is sufficient for that end, doth make a <hi>proper surrogation.</hi> For no more is necessary to the delivery of another person than the satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ends of the Law and Government, and if that may be done by an aequivalent suffering, though not the same in all respects, then it may be a proper surrogation. If <hi>David</hi> had obtained his wish, that he had died for his Son <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solom,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">D</note> it had not been necessary in order to his Sons escape, that he had <hi>hanged by the hair of his head,</hi> as his Son did; but his death, though in other circumstances, had been sufficient. And therefore when the Lawyers say, <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatum, sapit naturam ejus in cujus locum subrogatur: Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varruvias</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Covarru To. 1. p. 1. sect. 4 n. 3.</note> tells us, it is to be understood <hi>secundum primor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialem naturam non secundum accidentalem;</hi> from whence it appears, that all circumstances are not necessary to be the same in <hi>surrogation;</hi> but that the nature of the punishment remain the same.

                     <argument>
                        <p>The notion of a sacrifice belongs to the death of Christ, because of the Oblation made therein to God. <hi>Crellius</hi> his sense of Christs Oblation proposed. Against him it is proved, that the Priestly office of Christ had a primary respect to God, and not to us. Expiatory Sacrifices did divert the wrath of God. Christ not a bare Metaphorical High-Priest. <hi>Crellius</hi> destroys the Priesthood of Christ by confounding it with the exercise of his Regal Power. No proper expiation of sin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs <note place="margin">B</note> to Christ in Heaven, if <hi>Crellius</hi> his Doctrine be true. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 2. proves the death of Christ an Expiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and an Oblation to God. The Phrase of <hi>a sweet-smelling savour,</hi> belongs to expiatory Sacrifices; <hi>Crellius</hi> his gross notion of it. His mistakes about the kinds of Sacrifices. Burnt-offerings were Expiatory Sacrifices both before and under the Law. A new distribution of sacrifices proposed. What influence the mactation of the Sacrifice had on Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The High-Priest only to slay the Sin-offering on the day of Atonement; from whence it is proved, that Christs <note place="margin">C</note> Priesthood did not begin from his entrance into Heaven. The mactation in Expiatory Sacrifices no bare preparation to a Sacrifice, proved by the Iewish Laws, and the customs of other Nations. Whether Christs Oblation of himself once to God, were in Heaven, or on Earth? Of the proper notion of Oblations under the Levitical Law. Several things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served from thence to our purpose. All things necessary to a legal Oblation, concur in the death of Christ, His entrance into Heaven hath no correspondency with it; if the blood of Christ were no sacrifice for sin. In Sin-offerings for the <note place="margin">D</note> People, the whole was consumed; no eating of the Sacrifices allowed the Priests, but in those for private Persons. Christs exercise of Power in Heaven, in no sense an Oblation to God. <hi>Crellius,</hi> his sense repugnant to the circumstances of the places in dispute. Objections answered.</p>

                           <hi>Grotius</hi> towards the conclusion of his book, <note place="margin">E</note> makes a twofold oblation of Christ, parallel to that of the Sacrifices under the Law, the first of Mactation, the second of Representation; whereof the first was done in the Temple, the second in the Holy of Holies; so the first

of Christ was on Earth, the second in Heaven; the first is <note place="margin">A</note> not a bare preparation to a Sacrifice, but a Sacrifice: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not so much a Sacrifice, as the commemoration of one already past. Wherefore, since appearing and interceding are not properly sacerdotal acts, any further than they depend on the efficacy of a sacrifice already offered, he that takes away that Sacrifice, doth not leave to Christ any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Priesthood, against the plain authority of the Scripture, which assigns to Christ the office of a Priest distinct from that of a Prophet and a King.</q> To which <hi>Crellius</hi> replies: <hi>That the expiation of sin doth properly belong to what Christ doth</hi>

                        <hi>for them, he is said to offer up himself, and intercede for them, and by that means he dischargeth the Office of a High-Priest for them. For his Priestly Office,</hi> he saith, <hi>is never in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture mentioned as distinct from his Kingly, but is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under it; and the great difference between them is, that one is of a larger extension than the other is, the Kingly Office extending to punishing, and the Priestly only to expiation.</hi> This is the substance of what <hi>Crellius</hi> more at large discourseth upon this subject. Wherein he asserts these things. 1. That the Priestly Office of Christ doth not in reference to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation <note place="margin">D</note> of sins respect <hi>God</hi> but us; his Intercession and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein he makes the sacerdotal function of Christ to consist, being the exercise of his power for the good of his People. 2. That Christ did offer up no Sacrifice of expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God upon Earth, because the <hi>mactation</hi> had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to expiation, any other than as a preparation for it; and Christ not yet being constituted a <hi>High-Priest</hi> till after his Resurrection from the dead. Against these two assertions I shall direct my following discourse, by proving; 1. That the Priestly Office of Christ had a primary respect to God, and <note place="margin">E</note> not to us, 2. That Christ did exercise this Priestly Office in the Oblation of himself to God upon the Cross.</p>

                     <p>For the <hi>Apostle</hi> both proves, that he was a true and proper, and not a bare <hi>Metaphorical High-Priest,</hi> and that in such a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, <note place="margin">§. 3. Christ no barely meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical High-Priest.</note> he very far exceeded the <hi>Priests</hi> after the order of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi> But how could that possibly be, if he failed in the primary <note place="margin">C</note> Office of a <hi>High-Priest;</hi> viz. <hi>In offering up gifts and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to God?</hi> If his Office as <hi>High-Priest</hi> did primarily respect men, when the Office of the <hi>Aaronical Priest</hi> did respect <hi>God?</hi> To avoid this, <hi>Crellius</hi> makes these words to be <q>only an allusion to the Legal Priesthood, and some kind of simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude <note place="margin">Crell. cap. 10. sect. 3.</note> between Christ and the Aaronical Priests;</q> but it is such a kind of allusion, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> designs to prove, Christ to be an <hi>High-Priest</hi> by it; and which is of the greatest force, he proves the necessity of Christs having somewhat to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from hence: <hi>For every High-Priest is ordained to offer gifts,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">D</note> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>and sacrifices; wherefore it is of necessity, that this man have somewhat also to offer.</hi> This is that which he looks at as the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar and distinguishing character of a <hi>High-Priest;</hi> for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding for others, and having compassion upon them, might be done by others besides the <hi>High-Priest;</hi> but this was that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he could not make good his name, what order soever he were of. If Christ then had no proper sacrifice to offer up to God, to what purpose doth the <hi>Apostle</hi> so industriously set him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to prove, that he is our <hi>High-Priest?</hi> when he must needs fail in the main thing, according to his own assertion? How easie <note place="margin">E</note> had it been for the <hi>Iews,</hi> to have answered all the <hi>Apostles</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments concerning the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Christ, if he had been such a <hi>Priest,</hi> and made no other Oblation than <hi>Crellius</hi> allows him? When the <hi>Apostle</hi> proves against the <hi>Iews,</hi> that there was
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:97974:176"/>
no necessity, that they should still retain the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, <note place="margin">A</note> because now they had a more excellent <hi>High-Priest</hi> than the <hi>Aaronical</hi> were; and makes use of that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a <hi>High-Priest,</hi> that <hi>he was one taken out from among men, in things pertaining to God to offer gifts and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for sins:</hi> 
                        <q>Well, <hi>say the Iews,</hi> we accept of this character, but how do you prove concerning Christ, that he was such a one? Did he offer up a <hi>Sacrifice for sin</hi> to God upon earth, as our <hi>High-Priests</hi> do?</q>  No, saith <hi>Crellius,</hi>
                        <hi>his sufferings were only a preparation for his Priesthood in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> 
                        <q>But did he then offer up such a Sacrifice to God in <note place="margin">B</note> Heaven?</q> 
                        <hi>Yes,</hi> saith Crellius, <hi>He made an Oblation there.</hi> 
                        <q>But is that Obligation such a Sacrifice to God for sin, as our <hi>High-Priests</hi> offers?</q> Yes, saith <hi>Crellius,</hi> it may be called so <hi>by way of allusion.</hi> 
                        <q>Well then, say they, you grant that your <hi>Iesus</hi> is only a <hi>High-Priest</hi> by way of <hi>allusion,</hi> which was against your first design to prove; <hi>viz.</hi> That he was a true <hi>High-Priest,</hi> and more excellent than ours. But suppose it be by way of allusion, doth he make any Oblation to God in Heaven or not?</q> 
                        <hi>No,</hi> saith <hi>Crellius, really and truly he doth not: for all his Office doth respect us,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">C</note> 
                        <hi>but the benefits we enjoy coming originally from the kindness of God, you may call it an Oblation to God if you please.</hi> 
                        <q>But how is it possible then, say the <hi>Iews,</hi> you can ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that he is any <hi>High-Priest,</hi> or <hi>Priest</hi> at all, much less, that he should ever exceed the <hi>Aaronical High-Priests</hi> in their Office? for we are assured, that they do offer <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices for sin,</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> is attoned by them: but if your <hi>High-Priest</hi> make no atonement for sin, he falls far short of ours, and therefore we will still hold to our <hi>Levitical Priesthood,</hi> and not forsake that for one barely Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, <note place="margin">D</note> and having nothing really answering the name of a High-Priest.</q> Thus the force of all the <hi>Apostles</hi> Arguments is plainly taken away, by what <hi>Crellius</hi> and his Brethren assert concerning the Priesthood of Christ.

                     <p>But what that oblation of Christ in Heaven was, which <note place="margin">§. 4. <hi>Crellius</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys the Priesthood of Christ.</note> had any correspondency with the Sacrifices under the Law, our Adversaries can never assign; nay, when they go about it, they speak of it in such a manner, as makes it very evident they could heartily have wished the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had said as little of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as they say, any other part of the New Testament doth. Thence <hi>Smalcius</hi> and <hi>Crel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> insist so much upon <hi>the Priesthood of Christ, being distinctly</hi>

                        <hi>mentioned by none but the Author to the Hebrews; which,</hi> say they, <hi>had surely been done, if Christ had been a proper Priest, or that Office in him distinct from his Kingly.</hi> Which suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently discovers what they would be at; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> is but a single Testimony in this matter; and in truth, they do (as far as is consistent with not doing it in express words) wholly take away the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Christ: For what is there which they say his <hi>Priesthood</hi> implies, which he might not have had, supposing he had never been called a <hi>Priest?</hi> His <hi>being in Heaven,</hi> doth <note place="margin">C</note> not imply that he is a <hi>Priest,</hi> unless it be impossible for any but <hi>Priests</hi> ever to come there: <hi>His Power and Authority over the Church,</hi> doth not imply it; for that power is by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves confessed to be a Regal power: <hi>his readiness to use that power,</hi> cannot imply it, which is the thing <hi>Smalcius</hi> insists on; for his being a King of the Church, doth necessarily imply his readiness to make use of his power for the good of his Church. His <hi>receiving his power from God,</hi> doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that he was a Priest, although <hi>Crellius</hi> insists on that, unless all the Kings of the Earth are Priests by that means too, <note place="margin">D</note> and Christ could not have had a subordinate power as King, as well as Priest. But <hi>his death is more implied,</hi> saith <hi>Crellius, in the name of a Priest, than of a King;</hi> true, if his death be considered as a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but not otherwise: For what is there of a <hi>Priest</hi> in bare dying, do not others so too? <hi>But this represents greater tenderness and care in Christ, than the meer title of a King:</hi> What kind of <hi>King</hi> do they imagine <hi>Christ</hi> the mean while, if his being so, did not give the greatest encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all his subjects? nay, it is plain, the name of a <hi>King</hi> must yield greater comfort to his people, because that implies <note place="margin">E</note> his power to desend them, which the bare name of a <hi>Priest</hi> doth not. So that there could be no reason at all given, why the name of a <hi>High-Priest</hi> should be at all given to Christ, if no more were implied in it, than <hi>the exercise of his power
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:97974:177"/>
with respect to us,</hi> without any proper oblation to <hi>God:</hi> For here <note place="margin">A</note> is no proper Sacerdotal act at all attributed to him; so that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>hypothesis,</hi> the name of <hi>High-Priest,</hi> is a meer insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant title used by the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> without any foundation at all for it. <hi>By no means,</hi> saith <hi>Cellius, for his expiation of sin is implyed by it, which is not implyed in the name of King:</hi> True, if the expiation of sin were done by him in the way of a <hi>Priest</hi> by an oblation to God, which they deny; but though they call it <hi>Expiation,</hi> they mean no more than <hi>the exercise of his divine power</hi> in the delivering his people. But what parallel was there to this in the <hi>expiation</hi> of sins by the <note place="margin">B</note> 
                        <hi>Levitical Priesthood?</hi> that was certainly done by a Sacrifice offered to <hi>God</hi> by the <hi>Priest,</hi> who was thereby said <hi>to expiate</hi>

                        <hi>the sins of the people:</hi> how comes it now to be taken quite in another sense, and yet still called by the same name?</p>
                     <p>But this being the main thing insisted on by them, I shall prove from their own Principles, that no <hi>expiation</hi> of sin in <note place="margin">§. 5. No proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of sin belongs to Christ in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if <hi>Crellius</hi> his doctrine be true.</note> their own sense can belong to Christ in Heaven, by vertue of his Oblation of himself there, and consequently that they must unavoidably overthrow the whole notion of the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Christ. For this we are to consider, what their notion of the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">C</note> of sins is, which is set down briefly by <hi>Crellius</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his discourse of <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> 
                        <q>There is a twofold <note place="margin">Crell. cap. 10. sect. 2.</note> power, <hi>saith he,</hi> of the sacrifice of Christ towards the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of sin, one taking away the guilt and the punishment of sin, and that partly by declaring, that God will do it, and giving us a right to it, partly by actual deliverance from punishment; the other is by begetting Faith in us, and so drawing us off from the practice of sin:</q> Now the first and last <hi>Crellius</hi> and <hi>Socinus</hi> attribute to the death of Christ, as that was a confirmation of the Covenant God made for the <note place="margin">D</note> remission of sin; and as it was an argument to perswade us to believe the truth of his Doctrine; and the other, viz. <hi>the actual deliverance from punishment,</hi> is by themselves attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>the second coming</hi> of Christ; for then only, they say, the just shall be actually delivered from the punishment of sin, viz. <hi>eternal death;</hi> and what expiation is there now left to the Oblation of Christ in Heaven? Doth Christ in Heaven declare the pardon of sin any other way than it was declared by him upon Earth? What efficacy hath his Oblation in Heaven upon perswading men to believe? or is his <hi>second coming,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">E</note> when he shall sit as Judge, the main part of his <hi>Priesthood;</hi> for then the expiation of sins in our Adversaries sense is most proper? And yet nothing can be more remote from the notion of Christs <hi>Pristhood,</hi> than that is; so that expiation of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:97974:178"/>
sins according to them can have no respect at all to the Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">A</note> of Christ in Heaven, or (which is all one in their sense) his continuance in Heaven to his second coming. <hi>Yes,</hi> saith <hi>Crellius, his continuance there, is a condition in order to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Crell. cap. 10. sect. 3. p. 476.</note> 
                        <hi>the expiation by actual deliverance, and therefore it may be said, that God is as it were moved by it to expiate sins.</hi> The utmost then, that is attributed to Christs being in Heaven, in order to the expiation of sins, is that he must continue there without doing anything in order to it; for if he does, it must either respect God or us: but they deny (though contrary to the importance of the words, and the design of the places <note place="margin">B</note> where they are used) that the terms of <hi>Christs interceding for us,</hi> or <hi>being an Advocate with the Father for us,</hi> do <note place="margin">H b. 7. 25. Rom. 8. 3. 1 John 2. 1.</note> note any respect to God, but only to us; if he does any thing with respect to us in expiation of sin, it must be either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, perswading, or actual deliverance; but it is none of these by their own assertions; and therefore that which they call <hi>Christs Oblation,</hi> or <hi>his being in Heaven,</hi> signifies nothing as to the <hi>expiation</hi> of sin: and it is unreasonable to suppose that a thing, which hath no influence at all upon it, should be looked on as a condition in order to it. From whence <note place="margin">C</note> it appears, that while our Adversaries do make the exercise of <hi>Christs Priesthood</hi> to respect <hi>us</hi> and not <hi>God,</hi> they destroy the very nature of it, and leave Christ only an empty name without any thing answering to it: But if Christ be truly a <hi>High-Priest,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> asserts that he is, from thence it follows that he must have a respect to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>offering up gifts and sacrifices for sin:</hi> which was the thing to be proved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That Christ did exercise this <hi>Priestly Office</hi> in the Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">§. 6. <hi>Ephes</hi> 5. 2.

Because the death of Christ is said <hi>to be an offering and a sacrifice to God,</hi> which is plain from the words of St. <hi>Paul, as Christ also hath loved us, and given himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God, for a sweet-smelling savour.</hi> Our Adversaries do not deny that the death of Christ is here called an <hi>Oblation,</hi> but they deny, <q>That it is meant of an Expiatory Sacrifice, but of a free will <note place="margin">E</note>

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:97974:178"/>
that which was properly expiatory in it, <hi>viz.</hi> the offering up of the blood, for no smell, <hi>saith he,</hi> went up from thence, but to the burning of the fat, and the kidneys, which although required to perfect the expiation, yet not being done till the High-Priest returned out of the Holy of Holies, hath nothing correspondent to the expiatory Sacrifice of Christ, where all things are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sected before Christ the High-Priest goes forth of his Sanctuary.</q> How inconsistent these last words are with what they assert concerning the <hi>expiation</hi> of sin by actual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance at the great day, the former discourse hath already <note place="margin">B</note> discovered. For what can be more absurd, than to say, <hi>that all things which pertain to the expiation of sin are perfected before Christ goes forth from his Sanctuary,</hi> and yet to make the most proper <hi>expiation</hi> of sin to lye in that act of Christ which is consequent to his going forth of the <hi>Sanctuary, viz.</hi> when he proceeds to judge the quick and the dead. But of that already. We now come to a punctual and direct answer, as to which two things must be enquired into. 1. What the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the phrase of a <hi>sweet-smelling savour</hi> is? 2. What the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are to which that phrase is applyed? 1.

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:97974:180"/>
or the whole there,</hi> that it was designed for the expiation of <note place="margin">A</note> sin. From whence it follows, that the phrase of a <hi>sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smelling savour,</hi> being applied under the Law to <hi>Expiatory Sacrifices,</hi> is very properly used by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning Christs giving up himself for us: so that from this phrase, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be inferred contrary to the Expiatory nature of the death of Christ, but rather it is fully agreeable to it.</p>
                     <p>But <hi>Crellius</hi> hath yet a farther Argument, to prove that Christs death cannot be here meant as the Expiatory Sacrifice; <note place="margin">§. 8. What i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>God, to which the mactation is but a bare preparation;</hi> which he proves, <hi>Because the slaying the sacrifice might belong to others besides the Priests,</hi> Ezek. 44. 10, 11. <hi>but the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only to the Priests.</hi> To this I answer, 1. The <hi>mactation</hi> may be considered two ways, either with a respect to the bare <hi>instrument</hi> of taking away the life, or to the design of the <hi>Offerer</hi> of that which was to be sacrificed: As the <hi>mactation</hi> hath a respect only to the instruments, so it is no otherways to be considered than as a <hi>punishment;</hi> but as it hath a respect to him that designs it for a Sacrifice, so the shedding of the blood, <note place="margin">C</note> hath an immediate influence on the expiation of sin. And that by this clear Argument, <hi>The blood is said to make an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the soul;</hi> and the reason given is, because <hi>the life</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Levit. 17. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>of the flesh is in the blood:</hi> So that which was <hi>the life,</hi> is the great thing which makes the <hi>Atonement;</hi> and when the <hi>blood</hi> was shed, the <hi>life</hi> was then given; from whence it follows, that the great efficacy of the sacrifice for <hi>Atonement</hi> lay in the <hi>shedding of the blood</hi> for that end. Thence the <hi>Apostle</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes remission of sins to the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>From all which being thus laid together, we shall observe se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <note place="margin">§. 10. All things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to a legal oblation concur in the death of Christ.</note> things, which are very material to our purpose: 1. That in the oblations which were made for expiation of sins, the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between the mactation and the oblation, did arise from the <note place="margin">D</note> difference between the <hi>Priest</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> For the <hi>Priests</hi> Office was to <hi>atone,</hi> but he was to <hi>atone</hi> by the <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> on which account, although the <hi>Priest</hi> were to offer the Sacrifice for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, yet the oblation did not lie in the bare presenting himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but in the presenting the <hi>blood</hi> of that Sacrifice, which was shed in order to expiation. If we could have supposed, that the <hi>High-Priest</hi> under the Law, instead of offering a Goat for a <hi>Sin-offering</hi> for the people, on the day of <hi>Atonement,</hi> should have made an oblation of himself to God, by dying for the expiation of their sins: In this case, his death being <note place="margin">E</note> the Sacrifice, and himself the <hi>Priest,</hi> the <hi>mactation,</hi> as it relates to his own act, and his <hi>oblation</hi> had been one and the same thing. For his death had been nothing else, but the offering up himself to God, in order to the expiation of the sins
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:97974:183"/>
of the people; and there can be no reason, why the oblation <note place="margin">A</note> must be of necessity something consequent to his death, since all things necessary to a perfect <hi>oblation</hi> do concur in it. For where there is something solemnly devoted to God, and in order to the expiation of sins, and by the hand of a <hi>Priest,</hi> there are all things concurring to a legal oblation; but in this case, all these things do concur, and therefore there can be no imaginable necessity of making the oblation of Christ, only consequent to his Ascension, since in his death all things concur to a proper oblation. In the Law, we grant that the oblation made by the <hi>Priest,</hi> was consequent to the death <note place="margin">B</note> of the beast for Sacrifice; but the reason of that was, because the beast could not offer up it self to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> had made it necessary, that the Priest should expiate sins, not by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but by those Sacrifices, and therefore the oblation of the blood was after the Sacrifice was slain; neither could this have been solved barely <hi>by the Priests slaying of the Sacrifices;</hi> for this being an act of violence towards the beasts that were thus killed, could not be a proper oblation, which must suppose a consent antecedent to it. All which shewed the great imperfection of the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> in which so many several <note place="margin">C</note> things were to concur, to make up a <hi>sacrifice for sin; viz.</hi> The <hi>first offering</hi> made by the <hi>party</hi> concerned, of what was under his dominion; <hi>viz.</hi> The beast to be sacrificed <hi>at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation:</hi> but the beast not being able to offer up it self, it was necessary for the offering up its <hi>blood,</hi> that it must be <hi>slain</hi> by others; and for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter understanding, not only of the efficacy of the <hi>blood,</hi> but the concurrence of the <hi>Priest</hi> for <hi>expiation,</hi> he was <hi>to take the blood, and sprinkle some of it on the Altar,</hi> and pour out the rest at the foundation of it. But since we assert a far more <note place="margin">D</note> noble and excellent Sacrifice, by the Son of God freely offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up himself, to be made a Sacrifice for the sins of the world, why may not this be as proper an <hi>oblation</hi> made unto <hi>God,</hi> as any was under the <hi>Law,</hi> and far more excellent, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Priest</hi> and the <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> why should his oblation of himself then be made only consequent to his death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection? Which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>latter, being by our Adversaries made not his own act, but Gods upon him, and his entrance into Heaven, being given him (as they assert) <hi>as a reward of his sufferings,</hi> in what tolerable sense can that be called an <hi>obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">E</note> of himself, which was confer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed upon him as a reward of his former sufferings? From whence it follows, that upon our Adversaries own grounds, the death of Christ may far more properly be called the <hi>oblation</hi> of himself, than his <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:97974:184"/>
into Heaven;</hi> and that there is no necessity of making <note place="margin">A</note> the oblation of Christ consequent to his death, there being so great a difference between the Sacrifice of Christ, and that of the Sacrifices for sin under the <hi>Levitical Law.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. We observe, That the oblation as performed by the <hi>Priest,</hi> did not depend upon his presenting <hi>himself</hi> before <hi>God,</hi> but upon the presenting the <hi>blood</hi> of a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which had been already <hi>slain</hi> for the expiation of sins. If the <hi>Priest</hi> had gone into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> and there only presented himself before the <hi>Mercy-seat,</hi> and that had been all required in order to the expiation of sins, there had been some pretence for our <note place="margin">B</note> Adversaries making Christs presenting himself in Heaven, to be the oblation of himself to God; but under the Law, the efficacy of the <hi>High-Priests</hi> entrance into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> did depend upon the <hi>blood</hi> which he carried in thither, which was the <hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>Sin-offering,</hi> which was already slain for the expiation of sins: And in correspondency to this, Christs efficacy in his <hi>entrance into Heaven,</hi> as it respects our <hi>expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> must have a respect to that Sacrifice which was offered up to God antecedent to it. And I wonder our Adversaries do so much insist on the <hi>High-Priests entring into the most holy</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>by his own blood, having obtained Eternal Redemption for us.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. We observe, That there was something correspondent in the death of Christ, to somewhat consequent to the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">D</note> under the Law, and therefore there can be no reason to suppose, that the oblation of Christ must be consequent to his death: for that destroys the correspondency between them. Now this appears in this particular, in the solemn <hi>Sacrifices for sin,</hi> after the <hi>sprinkling</hi> of <hi>the blood,</hi> which was carried into the <hi>Holy place to renconcile withal,</hi> all the remainder of the Sacrifice was <hi>to be burnt without the Camp,</hi> and this held on the <hi>day of Atonement,</hi> as well as in other <hi>Sin-offerings</hi> for the Congregation.

                     <p n="4">4. We observe, That the Oblation in Expiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices under the Law, by the Priest, had always relation to the <hi>consumption</hi> of what was offered: Thus the offering of the <hi>blood,</hi> in token of the destruction of the life of the beast, whose blood was offered; for no <hi>blood</hi> was to be offered of a <hi>living creature,</hi> nor of one killed upon any other account, <note place="margin">B</note> but for that end to be a <hi>sacrifice for sin,</hi> and after the <hi>sprinkling</hi> and pouring out of the blood, the <hi>inwards</hi> of some, and all of the other, were to be consumed by fire. And it is observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the greater the <hi>Sacrifice for sin</hi> was, always the more was <hi>consumed</hi> of it; as appears plainly by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned difference of the <hi>Sin-offerings</hi> for <hi>private persons,</hi> and for the <hi>people;</hi> of the former, the <hi>Priests</hi> were allowed to eat, but not at all of the latter.

So that the greater the offering was to God, the <note place="margin">A</note> more it implied the <hi>Consumption</hi> of the thing which was so offered: How strangely improbable then is it, That the Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ should not (as under the Law) have respect to his death and sufferings; but to his <hi>entrance into Heaven,</hi> wherein nothing is supposed to be consumed, but all things given him with far greater power, as our Adversaries suppose, than ever he had before. But we see the <hi>Apostle</hi> parallels Christs <hi>suffering</hi> with the <hi>burning of the Sacrifices,</hi> and his <hi>blood</hi> with the <hi>blood</hi> of them, and consequently his offering up himself, must relate not to <hi>his entrance into Heaven,</hi> but <note place="margin">B</note> to that <hi>act</hi> of his whereby he suffered for sins, and offered up <hi>his blood</hi> as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for the sins of the world.</p>

For 1. on the very same reason that his entrance into Heaven is made an <hi>Oblation,</hi> his death is so too; viz. <hi>Because it was the way whereby he obtained the power of expiation;</hi> and far more properly so than the other, since they make Christs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance and power the reward of his sufferings, but they never <note place="margin">D</note> make his sitting at the right hand of God, the reward of his <hi>entrance into Heaven.</hi> 2. His offering up himself to God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Cross, was his own act, but his entrance into Heaven was <hi>Gods,</hi> as themselves acknowledge, and therefore could not in any propriety of speech be called <hi>Christs offering up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi> 3. If it were his own act, it could not have that respect to the <hi>expiation</hi> of sins, which his death had; for our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries say, <hi>that his death was by reason of our sins,</hi> and that he suffered to purge us from sin; but his <hi>entrance into Heaven</hi> was upon his own account, to enjoy that power and authority, <note place="margin">E</note> which he was to have at the right hand of God. 4. How could <hi>Christs entrance into Heaven,</hi> be the way for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying that power which was necessary for the expiation of sin, when Christ before his entrance into Heaven, saith, <hi>that all

                        </gap>ned on that account in <hi>Scripture.</hi> 5. If the death of Christ were no expiatory Sacrifice, the entrance of Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven could be no <hi>Oblation</hi> proper to a <hi>High-Priest;</hi> for his <hi>entrance into the Holy of Holies,</hi> was on the account of the <hi>blood</hi> of the <hi>sin-offering</hi> which he carried in with him. If there <note place="margin">B</note> were then no Expiatory Sacrifice before, that was slain for the sins of men; Christ could not be said to make any <hi>Oblation in Heaven,</hi> for the Oblation had respect to a Sacrifice already slain; so that if men deny that Christs death was a proper Sacrifice for sin, he could make no Oblation at all in Heaven, and Christ could not be said to enter thither, as the <hi>High-Priest</hi> entred into the Holy of Holies with the blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; which is the thing which the <hi>Author</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> asserts concerning Christ.</p>

That the <hi>Apostle</hi> always speaks of the offering of Christ <hi>as a thing past and once done, so as not to be done again;</hi> which had been very improper, if by the Oblation of Christ, he had meant the continual appearance of Christ in Heaven for us, which yet is, and will never cease to be till all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies be made his foot-stool. 2. That he still speaks in allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Sacrifices which were in use among the <hi>Iews,</hi> and <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 12, 13. 10. 4, 5.</note> therefore the Oblation of Christ must be in such a way as was <note place="margin">B</note> agreeable to what was used in the <hi>Levitical Sacrifices,</hi> which we have already at large proved he could not do in our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries sense. 3 That the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks of such <hi>a Sacrifice for sins</hi> to which the <hi>sitting at the right hand of God</hi> was conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; so that the Oblation antecedent to it must be properly that Sacrifice for sins which he offered to God; and therefore <hi>the exercise of his power for expiation of sins,</hi> which they say is meant <hi>by sitting at the right hand of God,</hi> cannot be that <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 12.</note> Sacrifice for sins: Neither can <hi>his entrance into Heaven</hi> be it, which in what sense it can be called a <hi>Sacrifice for sins,</hi> since <note place="margin">C</note> themselves acknowledge it had no immediate relation to the <hi>expiation</hi> of them, I cannot understand. 4. The <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks of such an Offering of Christ once, which if it had been repeated, doth imply, that <hi>Christs sufferings</hi> must have been repeated too. <hi>For then must he often have suffered since</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 26.</note>

He speaks of the offering up of that body which God gave him <hi>when he</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 5, 10</note> 
                        <hi>came into the World;</hi> but our Adversaries deny, that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the same Body into Heaven, and therefore he must speak not of an offering of Christ in Heaven, but what was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed here on Earth. But here our Adversaries have shewn us a tryal of their skill, when they tell us with much confidence that the <hi>World</hi> into which Christ is here said <hi>to come,</hi> is not <note place="margin">Crell. cap. 10. sect. 53.</note> to be understood of <hi>this World,</hi> but of <hi>that to come,</hi> which is not only contrary to the general acceptation of the word <note place="margin">E</note> when taken absolutely as it is here, but to the whole scope and design of the place. For he speaks of that <hi>World,</hi> wherein <hi>Sacrifices and Burnt-offerings were used, and the Levitical Law</hi> was observed, although not sufficient for perfect expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:97974:186"/>
and so rejected for that end; and withal he speaks of that <note place="margin">A</note> 
                        <hi>World</hi> wherein the chearful obedience of Christ to the will of his Father was seen, for he saith, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will O God,</hi> which is repeated afterwards; but will they say, that <note place="margin">Heb 10. 7, 9.</note> this <hi>World</hi> was not the place into which Christ came to obey the <hi>Will</hi> of his Father? and how could it be so properly said of the future World, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will;</hi> when they make the design of his ascension to be the receiving the reward of his doing and suffering the will of God upon Earth?</p>

Expiation attributed to the Sacrifice of Christ, in the same sense that it was to other Sacrifices: and from thence, and the places of Scripture which mention it, proved not to be meerly declarative. If it had been so, it had more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonged to his Resurrection than his death.

No distinction in Scripture of the effects of Christs entrance into Heaven from his sitting at the right hand of God.

Why were not an inward sorrow for sin, and tears and prayers rather made the only conditions of Expiation, than such a burthensome and chargeable service imposed upon them, which at last signified nothing, but that a command being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, they would have sinned if they had broken it? But up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our supposition, a reasonable account is given of all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory Sacrifices; <hi>viz.</hi> That God would have them see, how <note place="margin">D</note> highly he esteemed his Laws, because an expiation was not to be made for the breach of them, but by the sacrificing of the life of some Creature which he should appoint in stead of the death of the Offender; and if the breach of those Laws which he had given them must require such an expiation, what might they then think would the sins of the whole world do, which must be expiated by a Sacrifice infinitely greater than all those put together were; <hi>viz.</hi> The death and sufferings of the Son of God for the sins of men? But if the offering Sacrifice had been <hi>a bare condition required of the person who commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>

                        <hi>the fault, in order to expiation;</hi> Why is it never said, That the person who offered it, did expiate his own fault thereby? For that had been the most proper sense; for if the expiation did depend on the offering the Sacrifice, as on the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:97974:190"/>
condition of it, then the performing the condition, gave him <note place="margin">A</note> an immediate right to the benefit of the promise. If it be said, <hi>That his own act was not only necessary in bringing the Sacrifice, but the Priests also in offering up the blood:</hi> This will not make it at all the more reasonable; because the pardon of sin should not only depend upon a mans own act, but upon the act of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he could not in reason be accountable for, if he mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried in it. If the Priest should refuse to do his part, or be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to do it, or break some Law in the doing of it, how hard would it seem that a mans sins could not be expiated, when he had done all that lay in his own power in order to the expiation <note place="margin">B</note> of them, but that another person, whose actions he had no command over, neglected the doing his duty? So that if the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice had no other influence on expiation, but as a part of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, in all reason the expiation should have depended on no other conditions but such as were under the power of him, whose sins were to be expiated by it.</p>

But the <hi>Apostles</hi> words and way of Argumentation doth imply, that there was a peculiar efficacy both in the one and the other, in order to Expiation; although a far greater in the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ, than could be in the other; as the thing typified, ought to exceed that which was the representation of it. From hence we see, <note place="margin">C</note> that the <hi>Apostle</hi> attributes what Expiation there was under the Law, not immediately to God, as belonging properly to him, but <hi>to the blood of Bulls and Goats, and the ashes of an Heifer, sprinkling the unclean.</hi> Which he had very great reason to do, since <hi>God</hi> expresly saith to the <hi>Iews,</hi> that the blood was given them <gap reason="foreign">

For the execution or discharge of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment belonging to him, he may be said in that sense to <note place="margin">E</note> expiate, because it is only in his power to discharge the sinner from that obligation to punishment he lies under by his sins.

any punishment which is impossible to suppose; but that <note place="margin">A</note> where it is attributed to a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as the means of <hi>Atonement,</hi> there we say it doth not imply a bare condition, but such a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of one in the place of another, that on the account of that, the fault of the offender himself is expiated thereby.</p>

That the expiation is <note place="margin">B</note> attributed to the Sacrifice of Christ in the same sense that is attributed to other Sacrifices, and as the words in themselves do signifie. 2. That what is so attributed doth belong to the Sacrifice of Christ in his death, antecedent to his entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven. 1. That the <hi>expiation</hi> is to be taken in a proper sense, when it is attributed to the Sacrifice of Christ. <hi>Crellius</hi> tells us, <hi>the controversie is not about the thing,</hi> viz. <hi>whether</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Crell. c. 10. sect. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>expiation in the sense we take it in for purging away guilt, and aversion of the wrath of God, doth belong to the Sacrifice of Christ, for he acknowledges it doth; but all the question is about</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">C</note> 
                        <hi>the manner of it:</hi> which in the next Section he thus explains: <hi>There are three senses in which Christ may be said to expiate sins; either by begetting Faith in us, whereby we are drawn off from the practice of sin, in which sense,</hi> he saith, <hi>it is a remoter antecedent to it; or as it relates to the expiation by actual deliverance from punishment,</hi> so he saith, <hi>it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate antecedent to it: or as he declares that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated, but this,</hi> he saith, <hi>doth not so properly relate to Christ as a Sacrifice, but as a Priest.</hi> But never a one of these senses comes near to that which <hi>Crellius</hi> grants to be the proper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance <note place="margin">D</note> of <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, as applyed to a Sacrifice, viz. <hi>the purging away guilt, and the aversion of the wrath of God, and punishment,</hi> not any way, but by the means of the Sacrifice offered. For in the <hi>Legal Sacrifices</hi> nothing can be more plain than that the expiation was to be by the Sacrifice offered for <hi>Atonement:</hi> supposing then that in some other way (which could be by no means proper to those Sacrifices) Christ may be said to expiate sins, what doth this prove that there was an expiation belonging to his Sacrifice agreeable to the Sacrifices of old? But as I urged before in the case of <hi>Christs</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">E</note> being <hi>High-Priest,</hi> that by their assertions the <hi>Iews</hi> might ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ly deny the force of any argument used by the <hi>Author</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to prove it: so I say as to the expiation by Christs Sacrifice, that it hath no analogy or correspondency at all
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:97974:193"/>
with any Sacrifice that was ever offered for the expiation of <note place="margin">A</note> sins. For by that they always understood something which was immediately offered to <hi>God</hi> for that end, upon which they obtained remission of sins; but here is nothing answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it in their sense of Christs Sacrifice; for here is no Oblation at all made <hi>unto God</hi> for this end; all the efficacy of the Sacrifice of Christ, in order to expiation doth wholly and immediately respect us; so that if it be a proper Sacrifice to any, it must be a Sacrifice to us, and not to God: for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is always said to be made to him whom it doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately respect; but Christ in the planting Faith, in actual <note place="margin">B</note> deliverance, in declaring to us this deliverance, doth wholly respect us, and therefore his Sacrifice must be made to men, and not to God. Which is in it self a gross absurdity, and repugnant to the nature and design of Sacrifices from the first institution of them; which were always esteemed such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate parts of divine Worship, that they ought to respect none else but God, as the object to which they were directed, though for the benefit and advantage of Mankind. As well then might Christ be said <hi>to pray for us,</hi> and by that no more be meant but that <hi>he doth teach us to understand our duty;</hi> as be <note place="margin">C</note> made an expiatory Sacrifice for us, and all the effect of it only respect us and not God. And this is so far <hi>from adding to the perfection of Christs Sacrifice above the Legal</hi> (which is the thing pleaded by <hi>Crellius)</hi> that it destroys the very nature of a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> if such a way of expiation be attributed to it <note place="margin">Crell. c. 10. sect. 26.</note> (which though conceived to be more excellent in it self) yet is wholly incongruous to the end and design of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for <hi>Expiation.</hi> And the excellency of the manner of expiation ought to be in the same kind, and not quite of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for, will any one say, that a <hi>General</hi> of an <hi>Army</hi> hath <note place="margin">D</note> a more <hi>excellent conduct</hi> than all that went before him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he can make <hi>finer speeches;</hi> or that the <hi>Assomanaean</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily discharged the Office of <hi>Priesthood</hi> best, because they had a <hi>greater power</hi> over the people; or that <hi>Nero</hi> was the most <hi>excellent Emperour</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> because he excelled the rest in <hi>Musick</hi> and <hi>Poetry:</hi> by which we see that to assert an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of one above another, we must not go to another kind, but shew its excellency in <hi>that</hi> wherein the comparison lies: So that this doth not prove the excellency of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> because he hath a greater power to perswade, deliver <note place="margin">E</note> and govern, than any <hi>Sacrifice</hi> under the Law; for these are things quite of another nature from the consideration of a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice:</hi> But therein the excellency of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated, that it excells all other in the proper end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>design
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:97974:193"/>
of a <hi>Sacrifice, i. e.</hi> if it be more effectual towards <hi>God</hi> for <note place="margin">A</note> obtaining the expiation of sin; which was always thought to be the proper end of all <hi>Sacrifices</hi> for expiation. Although then Christ may be allowed to excell all other <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in all imaginable respects but that which is the proper intention of a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> it may prove far greater excellency in Christ, but it doth withal prove a greater imperfection in his Sacrifice, if it fail in that which is the proper end of it. So that if we should grant that the expiation attributed to Christs Sacrifice signified no more than reclaiming men from their sins, or their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance by his power, or a declaration of Gods decree to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <note place="margin">B</note> this may prove that there are better arguments to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the remission of sins now under the Gospel; but they do not in the least prove that <hi>Christ</hi> is to be considered as a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;</hi> much less that he doth far excell in the notion of an Expiatory Sacrifice all those which were offered up to God for that end under the Law.</p>
                     <p>But we must now further consider, whether this be all attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Christ in order to expiation in <hi>Scripture; i. e.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">§. 7.

                        <note place="margin">Crell. cap. 10. sect. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>it self, may very conveniently be taken only for the declaration</hi>

                        <hi>of it, when the performance of the thing doth follow by vertue of that declartaion: which then happens, when the declaration is made of the thing decreed by another, and that in the name and by the command of him who did decree it. And in this sense, Christ by his blood may be said to deliver us from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of our sins, by declaring or testifying to us the will and decree of God for that purpose.</hi> But this answer is by no means sufficient, upon these considerations; 1. Because it doth not reach the proper and natural sense of the words, as <hi>Crellius</hi> himself confesseth; and yet he assigns no reason <note place="margin">D</note> at all, why we ought to depart from it, unless the bare possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of another meaning be sufficient. But how had it been possible for the efficacy of the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ for <hi>purging away the guilt of our sins,</hi> to have been expressed in clearer and plainer terms than these, which are acknowledged of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to signifie as much as we assert? If the most proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions for this purpose, are not of force enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade our Adversaries, none else could ever do it: so that it had been impossible for our Doctrine to have been delivered in such terms, but they would have found out ways to evade <note place="margin">E</note> the meaning of them. It seems very strange, that so great an efficacy should not only once or twice, but so frequently be attributed to the blood of Christ for expiation of sin, if nothing else were meant by it, but that Christ by his death
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:97974:194"/>
did only declare that God was willing to pardon sin? If there <note place="margin">A</note> were danger in understanding the words in their proper sense, why are they so frequently used to this purpose? why are there no other places of Scripture that might help to undeceive us, and tell us plainly, that Christ dyed only to declare his Fathers will? but what ever other words might signifie, this was the only true meaning of them. But what miserable shifts are these, when men are forced to put off such Texts which are confessed to express our Doctrine, only by saying that they may be otherwise understood? which destroys all kind of certainty in words; which by reason of the various use <note place="margin">B</note> of them, may be interpreted to so many several senses, that if this liberty be allowed, upon no other pretence, but that <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning is possible,</hi> men will never agree about the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of any person in speaking. For upon the same reason, if it had been said, <hi>That Christ declared by his death Gods readiness to pardon,</hi> it might have been interpreted, <hi>That the blood of Christ was therefore the declaration of Gods readiness to pardon, because it was the consideration upon which God would do it:</hi> So that if the words had been as express for them, as they are now against them, according to their way of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering <note place="margin">C</note> places, they would have been reconcileable to our opinion. 2. The Scripture in these expressionś, doth attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute something <hi>peculiar</hi> to the <hi>blood of Christ;</hi> but if all that were meant by it were no more, than the <hi>declaring Gods</hi> will to pardon, this could in no sense be said to be peculiar to it. For this was the design of the Doctrine of Christ, and all his miracles were wrought to confirm the truth of that part of his Doctrine, which concerned remission of sins as well as any other: but how absurd would it have been to say, that the <hi>miracles</hi> of Christ <hi>purge us from all sin,</hi> that <note place="margin">D</note> through <hi>Christ healing the sick, raising the dead, &amp;c.</hi> we have <hi>redemption, even the forgiveness of sins,</hi> which are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the <hi>blood of Christ?</hi> but if in no other respect, than as a testimony to the truth of the Doctrine of Remission of sins, they were equally applicable to one as to the other. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if this had been all intended in these expressions, they were the most incongruously applied to the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ; nothing seeming more repugnant to the Doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, which was declared by it, than that very thing by which it was declared, if no more were intended by it: <note place="margin">E</note> For how unsuitable<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <note place="margin">10.</note> The Reconciliation here mentioned, is attributed to the death of Christ in the same sense, that it is mentioned before; <note place="margin">C</note> but there it is not mentioned as a <hi>bare condition intervening</hi> in order to something farther; but as the great instance of the love both of <hi>God and Christ;</hi> of God, in sending his Son; of Christ, in laying down his life for sinners, in order to their being justified by his blood. But where is it that St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that the death of Christ had no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the expiation of our sins, but as a bare condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion intervening in order to that power and authority where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he should expiate sins? what makes him attribute so much to the death of Christ, if all the benefits we enjoy <note place="margin">D</note> depend upon the consequences of it; and no otherwise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, than meerly as a preparation for it? what pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>emphasis</hi> were there in Christs <hi>dying for sinners, and for the ungodly;</hi> unless his death had a particular relation to the expiation of their sins? Why are men said <hi>to be justified by his blood,</hi> and not much rather by his <hi>glorious Resurrection,</hi> if the blood of Christ be only considered as antecedent to the other? And that would have been the great demonstration of the love of God which had the most immediate influence upon our advantage: which could not have been the death <note place="margin">E</note> in this sense, but the life and glory of Christ. But nothing can be more absurd than what <hi>Crellius</hi> would have to be the meaning of this place, viz. <hi>that the Apostle doth not speak of the proper force of the death of Christ distinct from his life; but
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:97974:196"/>
that two things are opposed to each other for the effecting of</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">A</note> 
                        <hi>one of which the death of Christ did intervene, but it should not intervene for the other;</hi> viz. <hi>it did intervene for our reconciliation, but it should not for our life.</hi> For did not the death of Christ equally intervene for our <hi>life</hi> as for our <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation?</hi> was not our eternal deliverance the great thing designed by Christ, and our reconciliation in order to that end? what opposition then can be imagined, that it should be necessary for the death of Christ to intervene in order to the one than in order to the other? But he means, <hi>that the death of Christ should not intervene anymore;</hi> what <note place="margin">B</note> need that, when it is acknowledged by themselves, that Christ dyed only for this end before, that he might have power to bestow eternal life on them that obey him? But the main force of the Apostles argument lies in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison between <hi>the death of Christ</hi> having respect to us <hi>as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> in order to <hi>reconciliation,</hi> and the <hi>life of Christ</hi> to us considered as <hi>reconciled;</hi> so that if he had so much kindness for enemies, to dye for their reconciliation, we may much more presume that he now living in Heaven will accomplish the end of that reconciliation, in the eternal salvation <note place="margin">C</note> of them that obey him. By which it is apparent that he speaks of the death of Christ in a notion proper to it self, having influence upon our reconciliation; and doth not consider it <hi>metonymically</hi> as comprehending in it, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents of it.</p>

                        <hi>Christ</hi> in point of efficacy for expiation of sin, with the <hi>blood</hi> of the Legal Sacrifices: whereas if the expiation meant by him had been sound by <hi>Christs Oblation</hi> of himself in Heaven, he would have compared <hi>Christs entrance into Heaven</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it, with the <hi>entrance of the High-Priest into the Holy of Holies,</hi> and his argument had run thus. For if the <hi>High-Priest</hi> under the Law did expiate sins by entring into the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; How much more shall the Son of God entring into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven expiate the sins of Mankind: but we see the <hi>Apostle</hi> had no sooner mention'd the <hi>redemption</hi> obtained for us; but he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently <note place="margin">C</note> speaks of the efficacy of the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ in order to it, and as plainly asserts the same, v. 15. <hi>And for this cause he is the Mediator of the New Testament that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions which were under the first Testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</hi> Why doth the <hi>Apostle</hi> here speak of the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>the expiation of sins by the means of death;</hi> if he had so lately asserted before that the redemption or expiation was found not by his death, but by his entrance into Heaven? and withal the <hi>Apostle</hi> here doth not speak of such a <note place="margin">D</note> kind of expiation as wholly respects the <hi>future,</hi> but of <hi>sins that were under the first Testament,</hi> not barely such as could not be expiated by vertue of it, but such as were committed during the time of it, although the Levitical Law allowed no expiation for them. And to confirm this sense, the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth not go on to prove the necessity of <hi>Christs entrance into Heaven;</hi> but <hi>of his dying,</hi> v. 16, 17, 18. But granting that he doth allude to the <hi>High-Priests</hi> entring into the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> yet that was but the representation of a Sacrifice already offer'd, and he could not be said to find expiation by his entrance; but that was already <note place="margin">E</note> found by the <hi>blood</hi> of the Sacrifice, and his entrance was only to accomplish the end for which the blood was offer'd up in sácri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.

and whatever effect was consequent upon his entrance into the <note place="margin">A</note> Sanctuary, was by vertue of the blood which he carried in with him, and was before shed at the Altar. Neither can it with any reason be said, that if the redemption were obtained by the blood of Christ, <hi>there could be no need of his entrance into Heaven;</hi> since we do not make the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Christ to expire at his death; but that he is in Heaven a merciful High-Priest in negotiating the affairs of his People with God, and <hi>there ever lives to make intercession for them.</hi>

                        <hi>entrance into Heaven, and offering himself to God there, by which means he obtained his sitting on the right hand of the Majesty on high, and thereby the full Power of remission of sins,</hi>

                        <hi>and giving eternal life.</hi> To which I answer, 1. That the <hi>Sri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> never makes such a distinction between <hi>Christs entrance into Heaven, and sitting at the right hand of God;</hi> which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter implying no more but the glorious state of Christ in Heaven, his entrance into Heaven doth imply it: For therefore <hi>God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him to be a Prince and a Saviour;</hi> and the reason of the power and authority given him in Heaven is no where attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his <hi>entrance</hi> into it as the means of it; but our Saviour before that tells us <hi>that all power and authority was committed to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 28. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>him;</hi> and his very entrance into Heaven was a part of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; <note place="margin">D</note> and given him in consideration of his sufferings; as the <hi>Apostle</hi> plainly asserts; <hi>and he became obedient to death, even the death of the Cross, wherefore God hath highly exalted him,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8, 9.</note> There can be then no imaginable reason to make the entrance of Christ into Heaven, and presenting himself to God there, a condition or means of obtaining that power and authority which is implyed in his <hi>sitting at the right hand of God.</hi> 2. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing, we should look on these as distinct, there is as little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to attribute the expiation of sin to his <hi>entrance,</hi> conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as distinct from the other: For the expiation of sins in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <note place="margin">E</note> being by <hi>Crellius</hi> himself confessed to be by the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Christs power, and this being only the means to that power, how could Christ expiate sins by that power which he had not? But of this I have spoken before, and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:97974:197"/>
shewed that in no sense allowed by themselves the expiation <note place="margin">A</note> of sins can be attributed to the entrance of Christ into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as distinct from his sitting at the right hand of God. Thus much may suffice to prove, that those effects of an Expiatory Sacrifice, which do respect the sins committed, do properly agree to the death of Christ.</p>
                     <p>I now come to that which respects the person, considered as <note place="margin">§. 11. Of the Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made by Christs death.</note> obnoxious to the wrath of God by reason of his sins; and so the effect of an Expiatory Sacrifice is <hi>Atonement</hi> and <hi>Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation.</hi> By the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> I mean, the reason which God hath from the holiness and justice of his nature, to punish sin <note place="margin">B</note> in those who commit it: by the means of <hi>Atonement</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation,</hi> I mean, that in consideration of which, God is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to release the sinner from the obligation to punishment he lyes under by the Law of God, and to receive him into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, upon the terms which are declared by the Doctrine of Christ. And that the death of Christ was such a means of <hi>Atonement</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation</hi> for us, I shall prove by those places of Scripture which speak of it. But <hi>Crellius</hi> would seem to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, <note place="margin">Crell. c. 7. sect. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>That if</hi> Grotius <hi>seem to contend for no more, than that Christ did avert that wrath of God which men had deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

                        <hi>by their sins, they would willingly yield him all that he pleads for:</hi> but then he adds, <hi>That this deliverance from the wrath to come, is not by the death, but by the power of Christ.</hi> So that the question is, Whether the <hi>death of Christ</hi> were the means of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement and Reconciliation between God and us? and yet <hi>Crellius</hi> would seem willing to yield too, <hi>that the death of Christ may be said to avert the wrath of God from us, as it was a condition in order to it;</hi> for in that sense it had no more influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon it than his <hi>birth</hi> had: but we have already seen, that the Scripture attributes much more to the <hi>death and blood</hi>

                        <hi>of Christ,</hi> in order to the expiation of sin.

                        </gap>. To this I answer; 1.

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as well said of the Priest, as it is of God? From whence <hi>Grotius</hi> his sense of <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 17. <gap reason="foreign">

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be parallel with that phrase, where God himself is said, <note place="margin">E</note>

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:97974:199"/>
doth thus interpose in order to the Atonement of the offended <note place="margin">A</note> party, something is alwayes supposed to be done or suffered by him, as the means of that Atonement.

                        </gap>. So the <hi>shedding of the blood of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> before and under the Law, was the means of <hi>atoning God</hi> for the sins they committed. What reason can there be then why so received a sense of <hi>Atonement,</hi> both among the <hi>Iews,</hi> and all other Nations at that time when these words were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, must be forsaken; and any other sense be embraced, which <note place="margin">B</note> neither agrees with the propriety of the expression, nor with so many other places of Scripture, which make the blood of Christ to be a Sacrifice for the Expiation of sin?</p>
                     <p>Neither is it only our Atonement, but our Reconciliation is attributed to Christ too, with a respect to his Death and <note place="margin">§. 12.

                        <note place="margin">Crill. c. 7. sect. 15, 16, 17, 18, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>it is no where said that God was reconciled to us, but that we are reconciled to God, and therefore this reconciliation doth not imply any averting of the anger of God. 2. That none of these places do assert any reconciliation with God antecedent to our conversion, and so that the Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mention'd implyes only the laying aside our enmity to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">E</note> 
                        <hi>God by our sins.</hi> I begin with the first of these, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which we are to consider not barely the phrases used in Scripture, but what the nature of the thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes; as to which a difference being supposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:97974:199"/>
God and man on the account of sin, no reconciliation <note place="margin">A</note> can be imagined but what is mutual. For did man only fall out with God, and had not God just reason to be displeased with men for their Apostasie from him? If not, what made him so severely punish the first sin that ever was committed by man? what made him punish the old World for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties by a deluge? what made him leave such Monuments of his anger against the sins of the World in succeeding Ages? what made him add such severe sanctions to the Laws he made to the people of the <hi>Iews?</hi> what made the most upright <note place="margin">Psal. 6. 1. 38. 1.

Levit. 26. 30.</note> among them so vehemently to deprecate his wrath and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure <note place="margin">B</note> upon the sense of their sins? what makes him declare not only his hatred of the sins of men, but of the persons of those who commit them; so far as to express the greatest ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency of them? Nay, what makes our Adversaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to say, <hi>that impiety is in its own nature hateful to God, and stirrs him up to anger against all who commit it?</hi> what <note place="margin">Crell. de Deo &amp; Attrib. l. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>. c. 30.</note> means, I say, all this, if God be not angry with men on the account of sin? Well then; supposing God to be averse from men by reason of their sins, shall this displeasure always continue or not; if it always continues, men must certainly suffer the <note place="margin">C</note> desert of their sins; if it doth not always continue, then God may be said to be <hi>reconciled</hi> in the same sense that an offended party is capable of being reconciled to him who hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him. Now there are two ways whereby a party justly offended may be said to be <hi>reconciled</hi> to him that hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him. First, when he is not only willing to admit of terms of agreement, but doth declare his acceptance of the mediation of a third person, and that he is so well satisfied with what he hath done in order to it, that he appoints this to be published to the World to assure the offender, that if the <note place="margin">D</note> breach continues, the fault wholly lies upon himself. The second is, when the offender doth accept of the terms of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment offered, and submits himself to him whom he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, and is upon that received into favour. And these two we assert must necessarily be distinguished in the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation between God and us. For upon the death and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Christ, God declares to the World he is so well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with what Christ hath done and suffered in order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation between himself and us, that he now publishes remission of sins to the World upon those terms which the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator <note place="margin">E</note> hath declared by his own doctrine, and the <hi>Apostles</hi> he sent to preach it: But because remission of fins doth not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follow upon the death of Christ, without supposition of any act on our part, therefore the state of favour doth
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:97974:200"/>
commence from the performance of the conditions which are <note place="margin">A</note> required from us. So that upon the death of Christ <hi>God</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring his acceptance of Christs mediation, and that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle did not lye upon his part; therefore those Messengers who were sent abroad into the world to perswade men to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of these terms of agreement, do insist most upon that which was the remaining obstacle, <hi>viz.</hi> the sins of Mankind, that men by laying aside them, would be now reconciled to God, since there was nothing to hinder this reconciliation, their obstinacy in sin excepted. Which may be a very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable account why we read more frequently in the writings <note place="margin">B</note> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> of mens duty in being reconciled to God; the other being supposed by them as the foundation of their preaching to the world, and is insisted on by them upon that account, as is clear in that place to the <hi>Corinthians, That God was in Christ reconciling the World to himself, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting</hi>

Lastly, what force or dependance is there in the last words, <hi>For he made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin,</hi> &amp;c. if all he had been speaking of before had only related to Christs preaching?

The first is, <hi>That God was reconciled before he sent his Son, and therefore Christ could not dye to reconcile God to us.</hi> The second is, <hi>That the Doctrine of Satisfaction asserted by us, is inconsistent with the freeness of Gods grace in the remission of sins:</hi> Both which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> admit of an easie Solution upon the principles of the foregoing discourse. To the first I answer, That we assert nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent <note place="margin">B</note> with that love of God, which was discovered in sending his Son into the world; we do not say, That God hated mankind so much on the account of sin, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible he should ever admit of any terms of Reconciliation with them, which is the only thing inconsistent with the greatness of Gods love, in sending Christ into the world; but we adore and magnifie the infiniteness and unexpressible great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his love, that notwithstanding all the contempt of the former kindness and mercies of Heaven, he should be pleased to send his own Son to dye for sinners, that they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled <note place="margin">C</note> to him. And herein was the great love of God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, that <hi>while we were enemies and sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ers, Christ dyed for us,</hi> and that for this end, that we might be reconciled to God by his death. And therefore surely, not in the state of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or Reconciliation with God then. But it were worth the while, to understand what it is our Adversaries mean, when they say, <hi>God was reconciled when he sent his Son, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not dye to reconcile God to us.</hi> Either they mean, that God had decreed to be reconciled upon the sending his son, or that he was actually reconciled when he sent him: if he <note place="margin">D</note> only decreed to be reconciled, that was not at all inconsistent with Christs dying to reconcile God and us in pursuance of that decree: if they mean, he was actually reconciled, then there was no need for Christ to dye to reconcile God and us; but withal, actual Reconciliation implies pardon of sin; and if sin were actually pardoned before Christ came, there could be no need of his coming at all, and sins would have been pardoned before committed; if they were not pardoned, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that love of God, then it can imply no more, but that God was willing to be reconciled. If therefore the <note place="margin">E</note> not remission of sins were consistent with that love of God, by which he sent Christ into the world, then notwithstanding that he was yet capable of being reconciled by his death. So that our Adversaries are bound to reconcile that love of God,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:97974:201"/>
with not presently pardoning the sins of the world, as we are <note place="margin">A</note> to reconcile it with the ends of the death of Christ, which are asserted by us.</p>
                     <p>To the other Objection, <hi>Concerning the inconsistency of the</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">§. 13. The freeness of Grace as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, destroys not satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> 
                        <hi>Freeness of Gods Grace, with the Doctrine of Satisfaction.</hi> I answer, Either Gods Grace is so free as to exclude all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, or not: If it be so free, as to exclude all conditions, then the highest <hi>Antinomianism</hi> is the truest Doctrine; for that is the highest degree of the Freeness of Grace, which admits of no conditions at all. If our Adversaries say, <hi>That the Freeness of Grace is consistent with conditions required on our part,</hi> Why <note place="margin">B</note> shall it not admit of conditions on Gods part? especially, when the condition required, tends so highly to the end of Gods governing the world, in the manifestation of his hatred against sin, and the vindication of the honour of his Laws by the Sufferings of the Son of God in our stead, as an Expiatory Sacrifice for our sins. There are two things to be considered in sin, the dishonor done to God, by the breach of his Laws, and the injury men do to themselves by it; now remission of sins, that respects the injury which men bring upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by it; and that is <hi>Free,</hi> when the penalty is wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, <note place="margin">C</note> as we assert it is by the Gospel to all penitent sinners: but shall not God be free to vindicate his own Honor, and <hi>to declare his righteousness to the world,</hi> while he is <hi>the Iustifier of them that believe?</hi> Shall men in case of Defamation, be bound to vindicate themselves, though they freely forgive the Authors of the slander, by our <hi>Adversaries own Doctrine?</hi> and must it be repugnant to <hi>Gods Grace,</hi> to admit of a <hi>Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory Sacrifice,</hi> that the world may understand, that it is no such easie thing to obtain pardon of sin committed against God; but that as often as they consider the bitter Sufferings of Christ, <note place="margin">D</note> in order to the obtaining the forgiveness of our sins, that should be the greatest Argument to disswade them from the practice of them? But why should it be more inconsistent with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ, for God freely to pardon sin, than it was ever presumed to be in all the Sacrifices of either Jews or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles? who all supposed Sacrifices necessary in order to <hi>Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and yet thought themselves obliged to the goodness of God in the Remission of their sins?
