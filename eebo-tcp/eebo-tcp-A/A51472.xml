         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis being the firſt ſitting of this Term at the Kings Bench Bar for the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Liberties thereof, after ſeveral Trials the long expected Trial of <hi>Nathaniel Thompſon, William Paine,</hi> and <hi>John Farwell,</hi> according to the Adjournment of the laſt Tearm came to an Iſſue. Firſt the Jury were ſworn, <hi>viz. Peter Hubland</hi> Fore-man, Mr. <hi>Ellis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Barry,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brooks,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bifeild,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lee,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitwood,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sambrook, William Jacob, John Denew,</hi> Mr. <hi>Baly,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Howard,</hi> all ſubſtantial Citizens, and Men of Worth; whereupon Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> Counſellour at Law, opened the heinouſneſs of the Fact, inſiſting that <hi>Nath. Thomſon</hi> had Printed and Publiſhed Two Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the firſt directed to Mr. <hi>Miles Praunce,</hi> about his Evidence in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Death of Sir <hi>Edmund-bury Godfrey,</hi> the other in anſwer to the Ghoſt, both dated in <hi>March</hi> laſt; In which he not only went about to make the People believe that Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey</hi> murthered himſelf, but alſo arraigned the Juſtice of the Nation, the Papers being produced in Court, Sir <hi>Philip Floyd,</hi> Sir <hi>John Nicols,</hi> and <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Bridgman</hi> were called, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that <hi>Thompſon</hi> had owned the Printing of them, and that <hi>Farwell</hi> declared he brought him the one, and <hi>Paine</hi> the other, before the Council. After the general Paragraphs were read in his Intelligence, wherein he ſeemed to juſtifie the former Letters, and that he could bring a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of Witneſſes to prove that Sir <hi>Edmund-bury Godfrey</hi> killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or to that purpoſe; whereupon Serjeant <hi>Mainard,</hi> Counſel for the King, opened the Cauſe more at large, laying open the nature of the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deſign, which he ſaid was to inſinuate into the People a belief, that that worthy perſon killed himſelf, and thereby to take off the <hi>Odium</hi> from the Papiſts, whoſe Intereſt thoſe men ſtrove to advance, who ſhould dare to arraign the Juſtice of the Nation. After which <hi>Thompſon, Paine,</hi> and <hi>Farwell</hi> were called to bring in their Witneſſes, but the latter only made his perſonal appearance, being brought up in the Cuſtody of a Tipſtaff, and Counſel in the behalf of <hi>Thompſon,</hi> endeavoured to make his Defence, he not appearing in Court. After the Council for the King had given the Charge, Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> declared, that <hi>William Paine</hi> had been drawn into the unfortunate Action, and that he did abſolutely diſown it in its particular Circumſtances, making ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Apologies for his Client; but withal declaring, that if he thought him wilfully Guilty of ſo Notorious a Crime, he would not have appeared in his Cauſe; after him Mr. <hi>Yeaulding</hi> pleading for <hi>Thompſon,</hi> and then <hi>Eliz. Curtis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> the Conſtable, and others had ſworn that they gave in their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at the Tryal of <hi>Green, Berry,</hi> and <hi>Hill,</hi> and that the Record of their Conviction was, Read, and their Execution ſworn to by Capt. <hi>Richardſon,
<pb facs="tcp:64120:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Farewell</hi> proceeded to call his Witneſſes; <hi>viz.</hi> one Mr. <hi>Hazard,</hi> who depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that upon the firſt brute of the finding the Body of Sir <hi>Edmund Bury Godfry,</hi> Mr. <hi>Farwell</hi> deſired him to go with him to ſee it, whereupon they went; when as Mr. <hi>Farwell</hi> conducted him the neareſt way to the place where the Body had lain, it being then removed to the White Houſe, ſome diſtance thence, and that he perceived ſome Blood ſcattered about the place, and whether it was the Blood of his Body, or not, he was ignorant; after him Mr. <hi>Leazenby,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> two Chyrurgions, were ſworn, who depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that by ſeveral Symptoms they found about the Deceaſed, they verily believed he was firſt Strangled, and afterwards Run thorow; the Defendant thereupon alledging, that his Coller made the Impreſſion in his Neck; but the Chyrurgions, as well as others; declared their Opinions, that there was another Impreſſion than what the Coller made; and that by the colour in his Face when Dead it was apparent that he had been Strangled, and the Cord or Handkerchief left about his Neck till the Blood was ſettled. After this he called <hi>William Balſon,</hi> to prove the great quantity of Blood that was found upon the place, he declared that he believed in his Conſcience that the Blood was laid there, there appearing no Blood upon his Cloaths, unleſs a ſmall quantity on his Shirt behind: Then he deſired one <hi>Rawſon</hi> and his Wife to be called, who lived at the White Houſe, and demanded of them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Mouth and Eyes of the Deceaſed were not Fly-blow'd; to which they anſwered, they perceived no ſuch thing: Then my Lord Chief Juſtice was pleaſed to ask them, whether they perceived the Flies buſie at that time of the year (it being not only in the middle of <hi>October,</hi> but likewiſe Froſty weather) to which they anſwer, they perceived none then. <hi>Farwell</hi> alledged, that the Friends of the Deceaſed refus'd to let him be opened, and that the Coroner at firſt was doubtful whether it was <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> or that he was Murthered, and thereupon offered to produce the Journals of the Houſe of Lords, to prove that Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> did not agree in their Evidence: After which he again called Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> the Conſtable, who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon Oath, that Mr. <hi>Farwell</hi> had been tampering with him, and told him, he had not given in his <hi>Affidavit</hi> right, and offered to inſtruct him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but he was wiſer than to be Ruled by him; and in concluſion, he called ſeveral other Witneſſes, as Mr. <hi>Paulet,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fiſher,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whinyard,</hi> &amp;c. who for the moſt part made againſt him, their Evidence being contrary to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; all or moſt of them declaring they did verily believe that Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfry</hi> was Murthered by the Papiſt; and that what Blood was ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, was brought thither. As for <hi>Nath. Thompſon,</hi> notwithſtanding his boaſt of 60 Witneſſes, his Council endeavoured to excuſe him, by declaring that he had voluntarily diſcovered his Authors, and that <hi>Paine</hi> and <hi>Farwell</hi> had put it upon him, and brought him into that Premunire. After all the Witneſſes called by <hi>Farwell</hi> were ſworn (not any appearing for <hi>Thompſon</hi> and <hi>Paine,</hi> Mr. Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> offered to call Witneſſes for the King, as Mr. <hi>Prance,</hi> Dr. <hi>Oats,</hi> &amp;c. but my Lord Chief Juſtice declared, it needed not, for that he only gave the Defendants all imaginable Liberty to ſee how far they would drive on the Deſign, the which, could they make any waies piauſible, it would certainly pleaſe the Papiſts that had undeniably ſet them on work, to obliterate their Plot againſt the Nation, which was ſo open, and at this day apparent to all men of reaſon and underſtanding; whereupon <hi>Farwell</hi> declared, he was no Papiſt, and offered to call Witneſſes to prove what he ſaid; whereto my Lord Chief Juſtice Replied, He verily believed he was of no Religion, as by his Actions in the preſent Cauſe was apparent; for that it was a malicious Deſign to Arraign the Juſtice of the Nation, and to vindicate thoſe that had legally ſuffered, which he by no means ought to do; and after his Lordſhip had given an Excellent Charge to the Jury, they, without going from the Bar, gave in their Verdict, that <hi>Nathaniel Thompſon, William Paine,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Farwell,</hi> were Guilty of the Treſpaſs and Misbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour for which they were Tryed; whereupon followed ſuch a Shout as made the Court ring; and afterwards <hi>Farewell</hi> was conveyed to the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> Priſon, from whence he came, there to continue till he be Fined for the Matter aforeſaid.</p>
