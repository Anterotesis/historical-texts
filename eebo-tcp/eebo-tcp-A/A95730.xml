            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To which end we deſire thee (Chriſtian Reader) not only to make what is here offered of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, but alſo of thy Council, by taking all down to dwell with thee, yea in thee by diligent Reading and Meditation. All is but little for bulk, but leſs than all is big, and goes with much matter of worth and weight; no leſs uſeful for the direct aſpect it hath upon the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical parts of Godlineſs according to truth, than grateful by reaſon of

            <p>Therefore, not to hinder thee from paſſing along thorough the
<pb facs="tcp:152445:4"/>
Porch of a brief Preface into the Houſe, and viewing the ſeveral Rooms adorned with the Glory of Divine Truths, we ſhall only advertiſe thee of theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p>That theſe Miſcellanies of Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, Queſtions and Caſes, are preſented to publick view as they were left to us by that Holy man Mr. <hi>William Thomas</hi> without any Addition, Subſtraction or Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The very ſame body now appears in the very ſame dreſs into which it was put by the Reverend Authour now with God; except any exceſſes or literal defects hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to it by the preſs, or a queſtion or two be Tranſplaced for Methods ſake or the greater advantage of the Reader.</p>
            <p>That theſe Queſtions and Caſes were no other than Family-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes either propounded by him, or to him, and anſwered by himſelf, only when alone with thoſe of his
<pb facs="tcp:152445:5"/>
own houſe: and being Houſhold-impartments were deſigned to be imparted to the houſhold of Faith; for the aſſiſtance of younger Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by furniſhing them with many materials for buildings; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for the help of Houſholders and all honeſt-hearted private Chriſtians, who have too little time to lay out in Reading the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous diſcourſes of Caſuiſtical Divines, or conſult with many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters about the ſence of ſuch Scriptures as are <hi>hardly underſtood,</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">2 Pet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 16.</note> 
               <hi>eaſily wreſted,</hi> and here clearly opened. The great plainneſs and familiarity of the Phraſe and Style, together with the direct tendency every particular hath to practice, are undeniable evidences that the whole was intended for the profit of ſuch people.</p>
            <p>That ſome of theſe things are layd out more largely as the matter required, and time gave leave; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are confined within a narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb facs="tcp:152445:5"/>
compaſs; for the ſame difficulties occur not in every caſe, nor intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in every Queſtion or Scripture: but there is nothing offered that coſt the Authour nothing. All his Writings ſmell of the Lamp, and theſe Anſwers and Reſolutions are full of Labour. Though this Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man never liked the expence of precious time on formal curioſities, and was wont to be much diſpleaſed with thoſe Preachers who confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the tedious builders of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na's</hi> Temple for the magnifying of their Art; yet he was always very curious of his matter, and thought that what grew up in a night like <hi>Jonah's Gourd</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">Jonah 4. 6, 7.</note>, was fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue no longer than it did which periſhed in a night: He that builds for Eternity had need be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in his preparations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly induſtrious in his works.</p>
            <p>To end, whatſoever is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to thy view is the Child of many Prayers as well as much Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation;

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Firſt,</hi> No doubt but a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Mouth is a ſpringing Well of living Water; *<note place="margin">2 Chron. 32. 8.</note> and the fuller that Well, and the freer that Spring is, the 
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152445:9"/>
better it is. All therefore ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that they do not hinder themſelves or others of this Water.</p>
               <p>This may be done divers ways, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. On their part whoſe Mouth is a Well, and that are able to ſupply much life unto others, becauſe <hi>a Stone is rolled on the wells mouth, Gen.</hi> 29. 2, 8, 10. And there be ſome good men to whom there is not an eaſie acceſs; Hence the Sheep of Chriſt are not watered as they might and ſhould be (eſpecially the weaker and lower of them that cannot roll the ſtone from the wells mouth), albeit, when the ſtone is rolled away, there will be water enough.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On their part that have need to come to the Well, and that are near to it; And that two ways:</p>
               <p n="1">1. For want of provocation and giving occaſion to ſpeak; As Pumps be divers times dry for want of putting ſome water in to get up more.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For want of proſecution, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome more pains to procure and pump out that which is to be had in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, and yet, not with eaſe nor
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152445:9"/>
without ability and diligence in enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, asking queſtions, <note n="*" place="margin">1 Kings 10. 1, 3.</note> moving doubts. There be ſome <note n="†" place="margin">John 4. 11.</note> deep Draw-wells; and if men have nothing to draw with, How ſhall they come by the water? See for this, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 5. with <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Too much on both parts, becauſe the wells be <hi>ſtop'd with earth,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 15. that is, becauſe for want of an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mind; want of conſcience to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the time, and make the beſt of every good opportunity, common conference comes in ſo faſt, and is reliſhed ſo well, that ſpiritual <hi>wells</hi> are not look'd after; and if men of good minds open their mouths and ſomething ſpring forth, it's like water ſpilt on the ground, loſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not priz'd, and ſo there is ſcarce any care to bring a Veſſel to receive and keep it.</p>
               <p>But, for all this, Righteous men as they ought to have, ſo they will have many good words; for they ſpeak <hi>oft one to another, Mal.</hi> 3. 16. and in many ſuch meetings there cannot be few words; Miniſters eſpecially are to uſe <hi>many words, Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 9. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 40. &amp; 20. 11.</p>
               <p>Nor are words ſinful, meerly becauſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152445:10"/>
they are many; for there is a ſinful ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence aſwel as a ſinful ſpeaking; and to ſpeak too-little, a fault aſwel as to ſpeak too-much, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1. 6.</p>
               <p>This may be ſaid with reſpect to the 11 <hi>verſe. Secondly,</hi> for the 19 <hi>verſe,</hi> It is true alſo, that <hi>in the multitude of words there wanteth not Sin.</hi> It is not ſaid, In the multitude of <hi>righteous mens</hi> words (whoſe mouth is <hi>a well-ſpring of life),</hi> nor, in many words that be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with good advice; but in many words, when no reſtraint is put upon the lips, and when the mouth is not watched and governed by the wiſdom that is in the heart; <note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 3.</note> then it's true, that it is like an over-flowing River that gathers dirt. It is not to be denied but that many words may be ſpoken by ſome men to very good purpoſe, as by <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 28. 23. but yet, Take people as they are ordinarily (yea, put divers good people among them) and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience will tell us, that it is neither eaſie nor uſual to ſpeak much of much weight, the tongue in many being too quick for the head, and the mouth running before the mind; And herein, this is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that albeit much may be ſpoken
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152445:10"/>
well, out of occaſion, and when there is a buſineſs that requires it; yet when words are multipli'd out of a talkative diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a mind to ſpeak rather than a juſt cauſe of ſpeaking, then ſin is not like to be wanting, but in many things it doth and will ſhew it ſelf; Namely, In theſe Particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In ſpeaking much of other mens Perſons, whom, if talking people diſlike, they quickly call their good, evil; If they <note place="margin">Iſa. 5. 20:</note> like; their evil, good. And (howſoever) they are more bold and buſie with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers behind their back, than they would be, or could defend if they were before their face.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In ſpeaking of other mens matters; for which, if they come to ſuffer (as divers times they do) there's little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for them, becauſe the Rule is that none ſhould ſuffer as <hi>a buſie body in other mens matters,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 15. What haſt thou to do with another mans buſineſs any more than with another mans Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 14. 4.</note> to judg and thruſt in thy Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict without any juſt cauſe and call?</p>
               <p n="3">3. In ſpeaking of things generally, irregularly, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Untruly, becauſe haſtily, without
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152445:11"/>
due enquiry. Any ſleight Report and Tale will ſerve the turn to ſet a work the tongue of a ſudden ſpeaker. We may ſee this fault in worſe men, as the misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 15. yea, and herein, a want of warineſs in better men, as in the holy <hi>Brethren, John</hi> 21. 23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Unwiſely, unſavourily, unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly without due conſideration of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and ſo <hi>unacceptably, Prov.</hi> 10. 32. (as divers will huddle up a great deal of buſineſs, and mar all by not-minding how they do it) ſuch words are like a Cart that's off its wheels, or a Door that's off its hinges, when a word ſpoken <hi>upon his wheels, Prov.</hi> 25. 11. is like <hi>Apples of gold in pictures of ſilver;</hi> Not as Vinegar on nitre, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25. 20.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Idlely and unprofitably; a world of words that do no good in the world, and cart-loads, in buying and ſelling, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 36. Here's folly by heap; whereas, <hi>He that refraineth his lips is wiſe;</hi> that is, He that refraineth from ſpeaking.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>When</hi> he ought not, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 1. <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 13.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now, To abſtain from ſpeaking, when a man cannot, or liſt not, is no vertue; To abſtain, when a man ſhould not abſtain, is a vice, and may deprive others of that which is as pretious as Silver, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. as neceſſary as food, <hi>ver.</hi> 21. as deſirable as life; as before in this Verſe, where the lips are called <hi>a Well-ſpring of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, To refrain ſo, as to be able to ſay, This I might, this I could; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, this I would, and have a great mind to ſpeak; but I forbear, becauſe I find it is not fit to ſpeak it; this is true Wiſdom.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152445:17"/>
Child, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14. It's a <hi>good man</hi> that leaves an Inheritance to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Children as <hi>David</hi> did, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 28. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 27, 29. as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 15, 16.

Thus it is the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe a good Man uſeth his own good endeavours to augment his Eſtate. And that two ways; For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He uſeth a good Conſcience in getting what he hath, in a lawful, ſolid, and approved way, and not by vanity and unlawful ſhifts, which whoſoever uſeth may look to have his Eſtate dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. and not to hold out to the third Heir, as the good Mans gettings do, <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Prov.</hi> 20. 21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He uſeth labour and diligence, and that is followed with encreaſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. By this means a poorer Man hath much Food; for by his diligence, he beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth experience and diſcretion for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of his Affairs. When he that hath more, hath leſs, to wit, for <hi>want of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to make the beſt of that he hath, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> By being good Parents],
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:152445:17"/>
ſo they provide well for their Childrens good in two eſpecial Ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By their godly Inſtructions and wiſe Laws, as here, <hi>v.</hi> 1. &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 14. &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 1. The Fathers Piety is the Childs Portion; inaſmuch, as by his good Education, he walks in Gods way to make him godly; and if once he can be brought to godlineſs, that godlineſs will (according to Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.) bring in enough of the things of this life. A ſanctified Son ſhall have a <hi>ſatisfied Soul,</hi> and it's the <hi>belly of the wicked that wants, v.</hi> 25. Yea, however the Children of a godly Father prove, yet we find an outward advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for Wife and Children, when it could be ſaid, <hi>Thou knoweſt thy Servant</hi> (the Husband, the Father) <hi>feared the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By their loving, reſolute, diſcreet and ſeaſonable Correction]. To ſpare the Rod is to ſpoil the Child, <hi>v.</hi> 24. for as the Earth is full of briars and thorns, ſo are Children, of corruption by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s Sin, which quickly ſhews it ſelf in actual Sin. Now as it is ſome ſharp Inſtrument that muſt get out briars and thorns; ſo ſome ſeverity muſt be uſed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152445:18"/>
to get out ſinful fooliſhneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 15. Hence ariſeth a neceſſity of correction, and that for inſtruction and better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation; For who would ſow among thorns?</p>
               <p>A ſpecial circumſtance of this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is the uſing of it <hi>betimes;</hi> for by that means it works more eaſily, while the Child is tender, and Vice not ſettled; and more effectually, the Cure being moſt throughly wrought, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Diſeaſe beſt prevented by taking it at firſt. This is ſo neceſſary that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith here, <hi>He</hi> (and ſo that ſeemingly-loving <hi>Shee) that ſpares the Rod, hates the Son;</hi> not that there is the affection of hatred in them, but there is the effect of it on the uncorrected Child. And while fondneſs works as ill an effect as the worſt hatred would do, Is it not juſtly called hatred? What could Parents do worſe, if they hated their Children never ſo much, than to bring them to the Gallows, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forbearing the Rod, and timely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking of their vitious diſpoſition, brings them, there to make a Sermon (with a Rope about their neck) and that againſt their Parents, for ſuffering them to have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152445:18"/>
their will ſo much in the beginning of their time, warning all other Parents to take heed of the like child-pleaſing, and child-undoing courſe.</p>
               <p>Which alſo ſhould teach all Children to ſubmit to correction; for if one ſhould ask them, Whether would you have your Parents love you or hate you? what Child hath ſo little wit, but will anſwer, he would have their Love? he muſt not therefore refuſe their Rod.</p>

receive the Prophetical Inſpirations, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 15. ſo that it concerns all Chriſtians in point of Conſcience to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be chearful.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of God], becauſe he loves a chearful Giver, requires joy in his ſervice, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 7. and utterly diſlikes tears on his Altar, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 13.</p>

               <p>That which is oppoſed to this merry and chearful heart, is a <hi>broken ſpirit,</hi> which is ſo far from doing good to the body <hi>like a Medicine,</hi> as that (like the worſt Diſeaſe) it <hi>drieth the bones,</hi> it preys upon and conſumes that natural and radical moiſture whereby life is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.

though we be ſorry for his pain, yet we fear not his life; for, <hi>a ſound Heart is the life of the Fleſh, Prov.</hi> 14. 30. but when the Spirit is once broken, (and broken it is by the ſorrow of the Heart, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 13.) then <hi>the bones will rot,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it can be healed, there's little hope of any long life, and no hope of health; for, a Spirit very ſad, will <hi>eat no Bread,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 5.

               <p n="1">1. The Cauſes of Sadneſs are;</p>
               <p n="1">1. Natural], a black and melancholy conſtitution inclining to ſadneſs upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, yea, upon no occaſion, unto which there is a great addition; and whereof there is a more diſmal opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by Satan that knows our tempers, and labours to make uſe of this humour for his own advantage, by ſinking the ſpirits of ſuch Perſons, hindring their ſervice, and tempting them by ſadder thoughts to ſadder and horrid acts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moral] ariſing from ſome cauſe that we think reaſonable, whether out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or ſpiritual.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Outward] As an earneſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive

longing after what we have a mind to, when it is not to be had, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 3, 4.—or Fears of wanting what we ſhall need; This divides, depreſſeth, teareth and tireth the heart with thoughts and cares and doubtings, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 23, 25, 29. or of loſing what we have, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 7, 8, &amp; 42. 36, 38.—And generally, any afflicting thing that we do, or are like to undergo, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 38, 39, 40. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="2">2. The effects of ſorrow &amp; deep ſadneſs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The general Effect of it, is that <hi>it makes the heart to ſtoop, Prov.</hi> 12. 25. and (as it is here) <hi>to break.</hi>

holy Duties and the exerciſes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 19. as Hearing the Word, <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 9.—Meditation] it's hard to heave up an heavy heart; ſorrow clips the wings that it cannot mount up to Heaven-ward—So alſo, watching and praying, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 45.—or thanksgiving, though there be never ſo great occaſion of it, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 9. Beſides that the burden is ſo great, as that it preſſeth ſinful nature to take unlawful courſes to get it off, as it did <hi>Saul,</hi> on whom God laid a heavy burden, and he went to the Devil to obtain eaſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 5, 7, 15. And this alſo hinders Men in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Calling (for the heavy-hearted are ſlack-handed); It makes them unfit to appear in, and very uncomfortable to humane ſociety, as <hi>David</hi>'s ſorrow by reaſon of the death of <hi>Abſalom</hi> did him, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 1, 4, 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Outward: It drieth the bones;</hi> for even as in joy, the blood is diſpers'd through all parts of the body, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 30. ſo in ſorrow, the blood being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal'd by nature that looks moſt to the vitals, and moſt noble parts, the bones (wherein notwithſtanding the ſtrength of the body lies) are left without moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,

Now</p>
               <p n="3">3. For the Cure of this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it proceed from nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, natural and reaſonable means are to be uſed, as Phyſick, full Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment]; for when ſad perſons are ſolitary, and left to the workings of their own hearts, their thoughts, like circles after a ſtone is once thrown into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, multiply, are widened and enlarged in their heart-ſtraitning way—And to both the former may be added the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of chearful company: I mean, with a calling, imployment and buſineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; for idleneſs, vanity, luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, are not a Medicine for Sorrow, but the matter of it; or if they be, they are like to prove at laſt a Medicine worſe than the Diſeaſe.</p>

2. For moral Sadneſs, ariſing from ſaddening occaſions and occurrences, Reaſon will be a remedy (as with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 8.) againſt the exceſſive degrees of it, and continuance of it; as we ſee in the ſame <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 22. Hence <hi>Elkanah</hi> ſo reaſoneth the caſe with <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
               <p>Reaſon and diſcretion will teach us not to be ſad.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Out of humour, to be affectedly ſowr.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Out of phanſie and fear of this or that which now is not, and perhaps will never be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Out of feebleneſs, faint-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for every trifling thing that ſhould be leap'd over, and devoured, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 10.</p>

               <p>Now for ſatisfaction in this and the like Caſes, It may be obſerved:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Scripture-Writers have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reſpect to mens Souls and Salvation, yea, to their outward good alſo; and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:152445:27"/>
in order thereunto, give Rules for their ordinary behaviour, that by pleaſing their Senſes they may not hurt their Souls, or Bodies, or Eſtates. <hi>Solomon</hi> is ever and anon looking into, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, diſorderly Families, faults and feuds of near Relations, the ſluggards Field; Sureties folly, the ſin and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of Tale-bearers; of angry and contentious Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the truth is, the work of a Miniſter (unto whom <hi>Solomon,</hi> acting the part of a Prophet may be a Patern) I ſay, the work of a Miniſter lies much in this, to be a Guide and <hi>Monitor</hi> in reference to the ordinary carriages and miſcarriages of thoſe with whom he hath to do; who either will take no notice of, or find ways to ſhift from general inſtructions, and things ſpoken in the air. And we ſee he that was greater than <hi>Solomon,</hi> even our Lord Jeſus Chriſt purpoſely applies himſelf to Table-diſcourſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 7, to <hi>v.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Is it a ſmall matter that People make their belly their God, when that ends in damnation? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. 19.</p>

                  </note> they be advanced (as <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 29.) to look to themſelves as thoſe that be in a brittle and dangerous condition. More particularly, his intent may be, to move Men to conſider ſeriouſly the common errour, and attractive to the Courts of Kings and Company of great Men; to wit, the promotions and pleaſing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions that are there; <hi>I ſhall have the honour to fit with Rulers,</hi> (Eſther 5. 12.) <hi>I ſhall fare as they fare, and enjoy with credit all the contents of nature.</hi> Now it's a great folly to intrude into, or aſpire unto the Court, and high Places upon theſe Conſiderations; not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Mens Souls <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 141. 4.) but of their State, the ſtanding is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, the Meat on the Table is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful; the Ruler, even when they ſit at Table with him, draws out their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, pries into their purpoſes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects their inſufficiencies, obſerves if they any way be like to thwart his Pleaſure and Deſigns, and then he will deal with them thereafter. Hence many, that might have lived comfortably, plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and honourably in their own Places and proper Seats, have ruined
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:152445:28"/>
themſelves by looking after things too high for them.</p>
               <p>This may ſerve to ſhew there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here unworthy the Wiſdom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> or the Spirit of Wiſdom by which he ſpake.</p>
               <p>But what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of Rulers-Feaſts (and afterwards of Miſers-Feaſts, <hi>v.</hi> 6.) hath matter of Caution in it in reference to Feaſting (eſpecially to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and higher Feaſts) in the generality, wherein our carnal luſts ſtir ſo ſtrongly, that it is not eaſie to keep them within due bounds.</p>

2. In regard of the End] when a man makes it his ultimate end, and chief aim to be rich, This cannot be good; for Wiſdom muſt be the <hi>principal thing, Prov.</hi> 4. 7. And our labour ſhould be,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In obedience to Wiſdom requiring us to be diligent in our Calling, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 23.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here is laid down the root of this Errour], to wit, an Errour in judgment, which is this, that the Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt man is the happieſt man; and therefore he is the wiſeſt man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows his labour, ſo as to get the beſt outward eſtate about him; And ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, worldly men judg, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 10. 3. &amp; 49. 18.) though God ſay, <hi>Thou fool, Luke</hi> 12. 20. and both Scripture and Reaſon refute that Errour.</p>

uſe to do worſt and ſpeed worſt; for in all things agreeable to corrupt nature, nature ſpeaks firſt and worſt: And though right Reaſon, and eſpecially ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Reaſon and Grace, may afterward ſpeak better things; yet a former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement is a great detainment from obeying later and better thoughts; for ſuch is the pride of ſinful Man, that he will rather adventure upon the danger of proſecuting a worſe way, than incur the diſhonour of changing, though it be for a better; when he hath once <hi>gone forth haſtily,</hi> he's very loth to make a a retreat, though <hi>back again be the better way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For help in this Caſe; a Man that is about to go out in a ſtriving way, ſhall do well to entertain a four-fold Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

               <p>Yea, and in point of Reaſon this is to

be conſidered alſo, that more may be ſpent in time and charge than the matter is worth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In point of Charity, whether an offer of peace and friendly agreement have been made, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 20. 10. for it is not meet to deal as <hi>delighting in War, Pſal.</hi> 68. 30.</p>

In point of Providence, whether there be a probability of prevailing, (the cauſe being good, and a good cauſe being like to find favour) elſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forbear, and (foreſeeing an ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs) prevent Strife by patience, than end it with ſhame.

                  <hi>Secondly, Solomon</hi> adviſeth to <hi>debate the cauſe,</hi> where three Things are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That it's good to end Differences.</item>
                  <item>2. By what Courſe.</item>
                  <item>3. With what Caution.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">1. It's good to end things privately]. If there be a Strife, yet <hi>Go not forth,</hi> Go not far, not to the Court, to the Bench; rather Go in, than go forth, that is into thy Neighbours houſe, or into a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours houſe; that's likeſt to put an end
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:152445:36"/>
to Strife, and prevent that expence of time and money, yea, of love and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity alſo which every Law-ſuit carries with it; yea, more evil than men given to ſtrife are aware of: For Law-ing is like Building, that will coſt twice ſo much as a man thinks of before-hand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The courſe is <hi>Debating;</hi> That's the beſt Compoſer of Controverſies; for, They commonly ariſe (at leaſt, riſe to get higher) not ſo much out of a deſire to try what's right and obtain what's juſt (in which debating and the opening of all things as indeed they are, is very help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful); As from,</p>

               <p>Or, 2. From Paſſion; and Debating (eſpecially neighbourly and with offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded neighbours themſelves) calls up Reaſon to judg of the Controverſie and cries down Paſſion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Caution is, Debate with him <hi>himſelf;</hi> without neceſſity, Go not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15.

If haply (thy Neighbour and thou not agreeing between your ſelves) the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be propounded to another that will be indifferent to both, then keep cloſe to the matter, if any thing (not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to thy Neighbour) hath paſs'd ſecretly between thee and him when you ſtood upon good terms; or if there have been ſome worſe and more paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate paſſages in the heat of Contention, which touch not the cauſe, and no man knows but thou and he, diſcover not any ſuch ſecrets (that are beſides the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs) to a third perſon, to ingratiate thy ſelf and cauſe, to make him the more on thy ſide, by making thy Neighbour vile; for ſuch blabbing, ſuch unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, enmity, and inhumanity, will <hi>put</hi> (not thy Neighbour, but) <hi>thee to ſhame</hi> before a good-natur'd Perſon (whether an Arbitrator or an Auditor only); And whereas by ſuch an one, thy Neighbour's infirmity will be buried and kept ſecret, he will blame and ſhame thee for want of ſecrecy; and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy

                  <hi>Secondly, For Sin],</hi> This Vanity is found in the Creatures that be not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, they being appointed for Mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, profit, honour, but are abuſed by ſinful men to covetouſneſs, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, vain-glory—and ſo become <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Vanity of the Creatures appears in Four Things:</p>

Things made for natural neceſſities, are abuſed to carnal exceſſes; from this they deſire to be free.</p>

3. IN that they fail Men in their ends, not for which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them, but which they (without God) ſet to them. They look they ſhould ſecure them in the day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 11. but that they ſhall not, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 4. and for full ſatisfaction from them, whereas the Creatures ſhould not have ſatisfied <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency, Man being a Creature not ſatisfiable with any thing but that which is heavenly, and he being to be tranſlated for his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. IN that they tend to diſſolution:</p>
               <p>For 1. They periſh in the uſing, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. 22. eat meat and it's gone, no more meat can be made of that which is eaten, Ground arable wears in the uſing.</p>

                  <p>Namely, 1.

                  <p n="2">2. IN being over-ſolicitous for keeping that, the loſs whereof cannot make them miſerable, nor the holding of it, happy; Is not this a vexing Vanity?</p>

                  <p n="4">4. IN regard of mens own End; for after all the imployment of Wit, ſtrength, ſtate and time, about theſe earthly things, there is [then, that is, at death] no difference (in regard of theſe externals) between Wiſe Men and Fools, between Rich Men and Beggars; yea, between Men and Beaſts, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 28.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Negatively, in two Things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Solomon</hi>'s meaning is not that ſome times are not worſe than others; for Chriſts own words (if we ſpeak of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) ſhew the contrary, telling us of ſuch tribulation <hi>as was not from the beginning of the world to that time, no nor ever ſhall be, Mat.</hi> 24. 21. And (if we ſpeak of Sin) the deſcription of the laſt times by the Apoſtle, ſhews the contrary, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor is it his meaning, that if the Times be corrupt, they ſhould not be diſliked, and the iniquity thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and cried out againſt, or the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity thereof bewailed; for that's a Duty, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Poſitively, in divers Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A Man muſt not complain of the Times, as looking for a felicity in this world, and to enjoy ſuch Times as will have nothing in them to complain of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. None ſhould quarrel with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Times out of vain reſpects, out of

an humour of worldlineſs and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedneſs, when the Times they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of are in truth better than the Times they commend, and the Time they commend worſe than the time they condemn.

And ſo ſome old ignorant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures have us'd to proclaim the Times of Popery here in <hi>England</hi> better than the latter Times of the Goſpel, becauſe then all things were cheap; when the cauſe of their ſaying ſo, is the regarding of their Purſe or Paunch more than their Souls.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Sure, it hath reference to his obſervation in the Verſe going before, <hi>viz. That a juſt Man periſheth in his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and a wicked Man prolongeth his life in his wickedneſs,</hi> according to which theſe Verſes muſt be interpreted.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion therefore may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Negatively], certainly when it is ſaid, <hi>Be not righteous overmuch,</hi> it is not to give a check to any ſtrictneſs which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:152445:50"/>
the Word of God requires whether in opinion or practice; for No man can be over-righteous by ſticking cloſe to the Rule of Righteouſneſs, any more than the Maſon by rearing his Wall preciſely according to his Rule and Plummet; Nay, to diminiſh from the Word, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 2. to depart from the way of the Word to the right hand or the left, is a deſtructive thing, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 32. &amp; 6. 14, 17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Poſitively]. The former being not <hi>Salomon</hi>'s meaning, the Queſtion is what his purpoſe is in theſe words. There is therefore a double more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interpretation.</p>
               <p>The firſt reſpecteth the ſubjects or the perſons here ſpoken of with reſpect to their carriage and behaviour under Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providences.</p>
               <p>The firſt Advice then is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Be not righteous overmuch],</hi> that is, conſidering that a juſt Man periſheth in his righteouſneſs, do thou look to thy righteouſneſs, that thou mayſt not by any miſtake therein expoſe thy ſelf to a periſhing condition: If Men periſh in a good righteouſneſs by others, Do not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:152445:50"/>
thou deſtroy thy ſelf by a bad and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Now, This Errour and exceſs in Righteouſneſs may ariſe two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In matter of Opinion], by adding to the Word, ſetting up, and ſtanding ſtifly upon that which the Word of God doth not warrant; but, though it may ſeem to be an high thing, and to have much of righteouſneſs in it, yet, being well ſearch'd, there's nothing in it but a wiſdom and righteouſneſs of a mans own making. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpared for Sacrifice, wherein they <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 15, 22.</note> might ſeem religious, but they held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themſelves a falſe light, <hi>viz.</hi> that to ſacrifice was better than to obey: Thus alſo <hi>Peter</hi> (by miſtake and meaning to be righteous) was righteous overmuch, when he ſaid, <hi>Not ſo Lord, Acts</hi> 10. 14. That which ſeems high righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs may be high unrighteouſneſs if a Man make himſelf his own Lawgiver, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Upon this it may be infer'd, <hi>Why ſhouldſt thou deſtroy thy ſelf?</hi> for ſuch a danger there is if a man do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and think right things, but ſpeak
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:152445:51"/>
and act upon miſconceits; as we ſee in the Friends of <hi>Job</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Job 42. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, 18.</note>, againſt whom <hi>Gods Wrath was kindled,</hi> ſo that there needed a Sacrifice that God might not deal with them according to their folly, which deſerved deſtruction; and yet they thought they pleaded the cauſe of God and the cauſe of Righteouſneſs; but God ſaith, they ſpake not <hi>right,</hi> they were overmuch righteous in aſcribing ſo much to humane righteouſneſs, as to think God muſt ſtill make much of ſuch in an outward way; and therefore that <hi>Job</hi> could not be a righteous man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God dealt ſo ſeverely with him. This made God angry, unto which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying is next, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 20. Thus he that would not ſmite the Prophet (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that might ſeem an unrighteous and horrid thing, yet) becauſe he prefer'd his own reaſon before the ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God at that time, was ſlain by a Lion, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 35, 36. <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> ſeems to ſay there was no ſeemlineſs in Chriſts being baptized by him, and there ſeemed to be good reaſon for it; but Chriſt lets him know that what he thought was not right, but it became Him to be baptized of <hi>John</hi> upon the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:152445:51"/>
account of righteouſneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 14, 15. And <hi>John</hi> thereupon, yielded quickly, and ſo prevented that dreadful check, which was returned over-righteous and over-reſolute <hi>Peter</hi> in the like caſe, <hi>John</hi> 13. 6, 7, 8. Any Man that ſuffers or is deſtroy'd for this fault, though it be by the hand of God, yet may be ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy himſelf, becauſe himſelf is the cauſe of it, as <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In matter of practice and carriage] ſo he is righteous overmuch, that is, rigid overmuch in his dealing with others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence and name of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as <hi>Saul</hi> muſt needs kill <hi>Jonathan,</hi> under a pretence of zeal for God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the (improvident) curſe under which he had bound the People, though <hi>Jonathan</hi> heard it not, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 27, 28, 29. And ſuch a kind of zeal he had in ſlaying the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> (as ſeeming to reſpect the honour of God's people with whom ſuch were not fit to be mixt) whereby he deſtroyed ſeven of his Sons (a part of himſelf) 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 2, 6, 9. So the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that were negligent at firſt, did over-do at laſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:152445:52"/>
The Second Advice is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be not overmuch wicked];</hi> Where</p>
               <p n="1">1. We may obſerve (as in the former Precept) that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s meaning here is not to give way to any to be wicked in ſome leſs degrees; no more than it follows that a Man may be angry as much as he will till the Sun go down, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let not the Sun go down upon your wrath, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 26. Or that men need not pay leſs Tithes, ſo they look to weightier matters, becauſe Chriſt frowns upon the hypocriſie that was in the one while they omitted the other, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 23. ye ought (ſaith Chriſt) to have done the greater and the leſs both; ſo all wickedneſs (whether little or much) is to be avoided, becauſe it makes us liable to the Curſe of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This then may be the meaning; Do not, becauſe a wicked Man <hi>prolongeth his days in his wickedneſs,</hi> give thy ſelf the rains, to be wicked in the higheſt degree, over and above what is in other wicked men, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 28. ſo that this ſeems to agree with what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:152445:52"/>
afterward; <hi>Becauſe Sentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil,</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 11. to be brimful of wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Be not wicked overmuch</hi> (ſaith the Wiſe-man) <hi>neither be thou</hi> (in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo wicked) <hi>fooliſh,</hi> and an enemy to thy ſelf: For, this ſinning with an high hand, however God prolong the life of other wicked men, may make him cut off thee out of hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 23. <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 7. 8.</p>
               <p>Now, If the words in theſe two Verſes be taken in their latitude; the former Precept may be extended to all thoſe that in any thing overſhoot them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by leaning to their own wiſdom (yea, howſoever they aim at righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs in it) ſo far as to go beyond that which the Wiſdom of God will warrant.</p>
               <p>And the latter Precept may alſo be applied to all thoſe, who leaning to their own fooliſhneſs, enlarge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in wickedneſs, under the hope of impunity.</p>
               <p>But yet, There is a ſecond Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theſe words, which ſeemeth
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:152445:53"/>
more agreeable to the context, which ariſeth not ſo much from the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſons here ſpoken to, in reference to their carriage or miſcarriage under Divine Providences, as to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of theſe perſons in regard of God himſelf that ordereth out theſe Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, inaſmuch as they run croſs to the ſenſe, and corrupt reaſon of ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men.</p>
               <p>And then, The meaning of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Precept, will be this; when thou ſeeſt a juſt man periſh in his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Be not thou overmuch righteous,</hi> to wit, in charging God fooliſhly, as if he did not govern the world equally, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 22. (He's always righteous overmuch, that makes as if God were not righteous enough), <hi>Why ſhouldeſt thou deſtroy thy ſelf,</hi> by quarrelling his adminiſtration? <hi>Job</hi> 9. 4. &amp; 34. 17. &amp; 33. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, the Second Precept will ſound to this ſenſe; when thou ſeeſt a wicked man prolong his days in his wickedneſs, <hi>Be not thou wicked overmuch;</hi> as if God did let all alone, and ſo wink at the carriage of men, as that they may be as bad as they will, and yet fare never the worſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 21. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 17. &amp; 3. 14,15.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:152445:53"/>
In brief, it may be ſaid, that theſe two Sayings ſet forth two ſins:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The accuſing of Providence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the juſt periſh, expreſs'd by, <hi>Be not righteous overmuch, neither make thy ſelf over-wiſe,</hi> as if thou couldſt deviſe a wiſer way of ordering the world.</p>
               <p>And 2. The abuſing of Providence, and of Gods Patience towards wicked men unto all licentiouſneſs, expreſſed by, <hi>Be not wicked overmuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto both theſe Extreams, the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt (upon the ſame workings of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that are here deſcribed, <hi>ver.</hi> 15.) ſheweth our proneneſs, who on the one ſide are ready to condemn the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the righteous, that is, to charge God becauſe he putteth them under ſuch bitter Providences, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 13, 14, 15. And on the other ſide, are ready to warp and nod towards the profane world becauſe they proſper, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 10, 11, 12. If godly Men go ſo far, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel if the ungodly come quite over too, and are bold in both theſe Extreams.</p>

               <p>But howſoever the things of this life befalling good and bad men be the ſame in themſelves, yet if we judg of the

works of God by the Word of God; there is in regard of the Perſons of good and bad men a very great difference, both here and hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> here] in regard of the Cauſe, Concomitants, and the End and Effect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of the Cauſe and Root out of which outward Diſpenſations do ariſe. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for good Men, if they have theſe outward good things, they have them out of Gods love, <hi>(Jer.</hi> 31. 2, 3. 4. 20, 21.) and mercy, as <hi>Jacob</hi> had his two bands, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 9, 10. &amp; 33. 5. And if they want them, it is out of love that they want them (as it is out of love that a Father will not fill his Childs purſe) becauſe they would be like to be worſe for them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 8, 9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for bad Men, they have great outward enjoyments.</p>

thoſe dear Servants of his, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 21. as <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 18, 20. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 9.</p>

               <p n="2">2. In regard of the things accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying theſe outward enjoyments or afflictions; For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we ſpeak of good and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table things; Good men have,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A better Title to them, enjoying them in Chriſt, the Heir of all things, by a more ſpecial and ſweet right than any out of Chriſt have, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 5. who have them out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon kindneſs rather than Covenant-love.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And a gift and ſuch grace from God to uſe them for Gods glory and their own comfort as others have not, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2. 26.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They have alſo much more content in the enjoyment of them, than world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings have, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 5, 6. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 22. with <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6.</p>

2. If we ſpeak evil, that is, of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting things and an hard outward condition, even in that alſo Good men differ very much from graceleſs men;</p>
               <p>For, In all afflictions, 1. They that fear God have that gracious Preſence of God that others have not; what-ever waves ariſe, yet Chriſt is in the Ship with them; and if they be ſick (yea, though of the Plague, that others dare not come near them) yet God will be ſo near to them, as to make all their beds in their ſickneſs, turning and toſſing, changing and altering it (as the Original word ſignifies) for their greater eaſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 3. Or, If they be in Priſon, it is better with them than with other men. <hi>Joſeph</hi> and other the Kings Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners were bound in the ſame Priſon, but the Lord was with <hi>Joſeph</hi> in a far more gracious manner than with them, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 39. 21, 22, 23.) making him the Ruler there, and all he did to proſper.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Godly, in their diſtreſs have ſuch promiſes as others have not, yea, even in regard of the things of this life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. as, that he will ſtrengthen them on their bed of languiſhing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. 3. and lay no more upon them in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:152445:56"/>
any kind than they ſhall be able to bear, and will find out a way for them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. and make all to work for good unto them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 27. ſuch Promiſes are good mens Priviledges, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3. 10, 11. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 12, 13. for unto a wicked man God ſaith, <hi>What haſt thou to do to take my Covenant in thy mouth?</hi> Pſal. 50. 16.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the Children of God have ſuch Providences alſo, and workings of Gods hand for their ſupport and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (however their troubles be very great) as others have not. Thus <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> obſerves and ſpeaks as if he were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly comforted with the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking of <hi>Laban</hi> in his behalf, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 42. <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> were in the ſame Battel, but <hi>Ahab</hi> though he ſought and thought to avoid the danger by his diſguiſing was ſlain, and <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> by the hand of Heaven was reſcued; for it was <hi>the Lord that helped him and moved the Enemy to depart from him,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. 29, 31, 33.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They have grace alſo to keep them from that ſin into which others (being preſs'd with affliction) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 7, 8, 20. &amp; 24. 13. &amp; 26. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They have ſuch a Comforter <hi>as the world knows not,</hi> and that is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, which <hi>dwelleth in them, and ſhall be with them, John</hi> 14. 16, 17. ſo that in whatſoever Priſon or preſſure they are, therein that Comforter is with them alſo; and being <hi>the Spirit of Truth,</hi> it comforts them ſtill by one Truth of Scripture or other, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 50. unto which is added his inward Seal and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>with their Spirits,</hi> of their good and happy eſtate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16, 17.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whereas worldly Men, when their troubles are very great, are ſunk in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, Gods Children when they are in the higheſt diſtreſs here, have their higheſt comfort in their Redeemer moſt

imprinted and engraven upon their hearts, <hi>Job</hi> 19. 25, 26, 27. 28.</p>
               <p>Thus there is a difference in what accompanieth the diſaſters of good and bad men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a difference in the end, effects and conſequences of the condition of good and evil men; for the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of good men build them up ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 71. and keep them from being condemned with the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32. And are their way to glory, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 22. But the proſperity of the ungodly ſlays them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 32. becauſe thereby they ſin ſo much the more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 6, 9. and ſo lay up for themſelves a greater treaſure and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of wrath againſt the laſt day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Theſe things make a great difference here.</p>

For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Carnal and voluptuous Men do not uſe to ſpeak altogether in ſuch a language as is here uſed:</p>
               <p>As 1. Laying this down, in the firſt

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="1">1. In a generality, and in way of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; as if he had ſaid, It appeareth that God favoureth thee, bleſſeth and proſpereth thee in thy imployments and enjoyments; therefore Be merry.</p>
               <p>Or 2. Particularly, and in a way of approbation, in regard of the chearful uſe of the Creatures here ſpoken of: <hi>[now]</hi> God accepteth thy works, that is, He is well-pleaſed with what thou <hi>now</hi> doſt, whilſt thou eateſt and drinkeſt, and makeſt the beſt of theſe earthly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; as He was pleas'd with <hi>Eſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her's</hi> Feaſts and royal Apparel; even
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:152445:59"/>
theſe outward works God accepteth when his glory is reſpected in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31.</p>
               <p>Now, which way ſoever the words be taken, carnal and graceleſs men look not to Gods acceptation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas <hi>[the days of the life of thy Vanity]</hi> is here once and again men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, carnal and jovial men, (enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fulneſs of outward things do not look on this life as a life of Vanity, but rather as a ſtate of Felicity. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s aim in all this Book, is to prove all things below to be Vanity; and when he hath ſaid all, proſperous world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings will not be perſwaded it is ſo.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p>Thus it may appear by the words ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that ſenſual and bruitiſh men do not ſpeak them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may further appear, becauſe if <hi>Solomon</hi> had inſerted this as ſpoken by
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:152445:60"/>
men given up wholly to earthly delights, and encouraging themſelves in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of carnal pleaſure, then it's very probable he would have joined with it ſome rebuke or other of it, and caution againſt it, as <hi>chap.</hi> 11. 9. but inſtead of that, he is ever and anon mentioning this joyful uſe of our enjoyments as the beſt thing that is to be had from them, that is, while the joy is joined with, and made ſubſervient unto the ſerving of God in our places, which in the tenth Verſe is intimated, and ſtill to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; See <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 24. &amp; 3. 12, 13, 22. &amp; 5. 18. &amp; 8. 15.</p>

what is ſaid here is to be regulated and reſtrained.</p>
                  <p>As 1.

               <p n="2">2.

                     <hi>Calv.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtit. l. 40. S. 4.</note> is to be underſtood; and unto theſe two ends, the Vow of <hi>Jacob, Jepthah, Hannah,</hi> and others <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 132. 2, 3. with 2 Sam. 7. 2. So 1 Chro. 4. 10.</note> may be refer'd.</p>
               <p>So that the thing which is to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the Scriptures that ſpeak of <hi>Vowing</hi> in the Old Teſtament, is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the <hi>Jews;</hi> that they were to Vow (ſuch of them as had juſt cauſe <note n="†" place="margin">See <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> Caſ. c. 14. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit not all Jews had a command to Vow in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but only ſuch as had juſt cauſe to make a Vow, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they had liberty to abſtain from Vowing. Deut. 23. 22.</note> to do it) and (abſolutely) to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Vows, and bring Preſents to God according to the preſcribed way of God, that was in uſe and in force in thoſe times.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to us; to look to the ſubſtance, that is, to vow obedience to God in our Baptiſm (which is a thing that belongs to all); And to Vow otherwiſe (as we find juſt occaſion upon due deliberation) in the way and according to the Rules of the New Teſtament, that is, for
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:152445:67"/>
our help in doing the will of God, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying of our thankfulneſs; yea, the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo were to look principally unto that ſubſtance of obedience which is required both in the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; for God never regarded their outward Sacrifices as they were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, <hi>(Jer.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 6, 7, 8.) but as in them they made a Covenant, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 50. 5.) offered and engaged themſelves in all holy obedience that they might become his humble Servants for the great favour and mercy he affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them; In this <hi>David</hi> is plain, when he ſaith, <hi>O Lord, I am thy Servant, Pſal.</hi> 116. 16.</p>
               <p>To illuſtrate this in one inſtance; <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> (to help his Faith, when he was in a ſtrait, and to aſſiſt and declare his thankfulneſs before-hand) Voweth three things. The Firſt is, Moral, <hi>Then ſhall the Lord be my God, Gen.</hi> 28. 20, 21. The Second is, Ceremonial, <hi>This Stone ſhall be Gods Houſe;</hi> that is, a place holy and conſecrated to God for his Altar-worſhip, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. 7. The Third is, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial, auxiliatory, teſtificatory; that is, a voluntary engagement to declare his thankfulneſs in giving without fail
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:152445:67"/>
unto God <hi>the Tenth</hi> of all that which God ſhould give to him.</p>
               <p>The Firſt of theſe belongs to us who are bound to make every ſpecial mercy a new obligation, acceſſion, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive to aſſiſt us (unto whom God can never be dear enough) in lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord and cleaving to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 1, 2. whereunto it is not unlawful for us, but may be uſeful to us, to bind our ſelves by a ſpecial Vow upon ſpecial occaſion; or by a ſpecial renewing of our Baptiſmal-Covenant before God, and re-obliging our ſelves thereunto.</p>
               <p>The Second, of building an Altar and offering Sacrifices, belonged to the Times of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>As to the Third, that which concerns us therein, is, to teſtifie our thankfulneſs when God frees us from our great fears, and grants our earneſt deſires, by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring the Lord with our Riches, and by Vowing (if we be convinced that ſuch an help is needful to prevent our trifling with God) to give ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of our Eſtates to ſuch uſes as whereby God may have it moſt. Now if we ſhall thus Vow and engage our
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:152445:68"/>
ſelves before-hand in a kind of conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal way, we muſt always ſee that our meaning be not to indent with God, as if he ſhould have nothing from us unleſs we have what we need from him (God ſhould have been <hi>Jacob</hi>'s God though he had not granted his requeſt); but it muſt be to wreſtle with God the better, and to ſtrengthen our weak faith as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the hearing of our prayer; it being an argument to move the Lord to do for us, or (to ſpeak more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) to perſwade our ſelves and make our ſelves believe he will do for us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are ſincerely willing to bind our ſelves to do for him: Not becauſe our doing is any thing to him, <hi>(Job</hi> 35. 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 2.) but becauſe we have cauſe to hope that God will crown that grace of his in us whereby we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do things of moment for him, and are careful to provide for his glory when he provides for our comfort.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of Grounds of Vowing from Nature and Scripture; There may be added another Ground, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. From Reaſon agreeable both to Nature and Scripture; For Vows right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, as they are great Declarations
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:152445:68"/>
of our reverent thoughts of God, ſo alſo they may be great aſſiſtances to us in the Duties we owe unto him, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they proceed from weighty cauſes (for light matters are not the matter of a Vow), and the Bond thereof is ſo ſtrait a Bond, that Conſcience trembles to tranſgreſs the bounds to which by a Solemn Vow, we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined our ſelves. It's good Diſcipline that keeps all in order, and Vows diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly made are a Chriſtians voluntary Diſcipline, and the hedg of Holineſs * <note place="margin">Votum eſt Sepes Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniae.</note>, whereby he reſtrains himſelf from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies; as on the other ſide, he lays by them a willing conſtraint on himſelf, to do thoſe important Duties which nature otherwiſe is untoward unto and treacherous in. Now if a Vow be an aſſiſtance, (truly and juſtly ſo) it is, as it were, demanded in the Duty it aſſiſteth, which ſuppoſeth and impoſeth the getting of all helps for the better performance of it. Yea, This Vowing hath ſo near and ſo helpful a conjunction and conſociation with Prayer, that they paſs in <hi>Hebrew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> under the ſame Name <note n="*" place="margin">Neder, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Votum.</note>; the Reaſon whereof is, becauſe when we
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:152445:69"/>
deſire any thing more ardently, we are ſtill ready to add a promiſe to the prayer that in that way we may look to have it the more hopefully.

               <p>By theſe things the lawfulneſs of a Vow appears, and that there is therein an agreeableneſs with the will of God revealed in his Word. Now,</p>
               <p>If the Queſtion further be, Whether there be any command for this Vowing?</p>
               <p>To this I Anſwer, that, though there be everywhere commands for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of lawful Vows when they were made, yet I find not any-where (no not in the Old Teſtament where Vows are moſt mentioned) any very clear Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for the making of them <note n="*" place="margin">Ad Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia illa Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta non quidem ex man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dato tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur, erant enim li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bera &amp; ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea; ſed tamen certo Verbo preſcriptum erat, quae &amp; quomodo De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us in hoc genere ſibi voveri vellet. <hi>Chemnit.</hi> Exam. p. 3. c. 60.</note>, but ſtill they are ſpoken of as voluntary things; only there is one place where the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion looketh likeſt to a Command, to wit, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76. 11. <hi>Vow and pay;</hi> To which two Things may be ſaid.</p>

1. That it is not a Command or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, but a Suppoſition, <hi>Vow and pay,</hi> that is, If thou Vow, be ſure to pay. As when it is ſaid, <hi>Be ye angry and ſin not, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 26. It is not a Command to be angry, but to ſee to it, if there be anger, that it be not ſinful anger; and though the repetition in the latter part of the Verſe, <hi>Let all that be round about him bring Preſents to him,</hi> ſeem to be indeed a Precept, yet that alſo may be thus underſtood: If thou doſt Vow the preſenting of any thing to him, then do not dally with him, but be ſure to <hi>bring</hi> it to him (as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, I will <hi>ſurely</hi> give the Tenth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 22.) whereof the Reaſon followeth, for <hi>he ought to be feared;</hi> and therefore muſt not be mocked, which is agreeable to that in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 7. Be not vain in thy Vows ſo as not to provide for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them, <hi>but fear thou God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That which may be ſaid to that Scripture, Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> lays down thus; <hi>If</hi> David <hi>ſpeaks of Moral Duties, then</hi>

                  <hi>the Command concerns every Man; becauſe the thing commanded is a part of Gods Worſhip: but if it be meant of Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Duties, it binds the Jews only; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>howbeit</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:152445:70"/>
                  <hi>not all, but only ſuch as had juſt cauſe to Vow; for otherwiſe they had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to abſtain from Vowing,</hi> Deut. 23. 22.</p>
               <p>Unto which Anſwer of his, this alſo may be annexed, That if it be taken for a Precept to ſuch Perſons as have juſt cauſe to Vow for Moral Ends, then (though the matter of the Vow be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in the Old and New Teſtament) yet in regard of the End, it is reſolved into a Moral Vow, and ſo may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto the Times of the Old and New Teſtament; but then it muſt be conſidered, that (being ſo taken) it is not a Precept in the generality binding all Men, but only ſuch and ſuch Men as have juſt cauſe to Vow for the help of their infirmity in the doing of that which God requireth.</p>
               <p>So that the ſubſtance which can be gathered from that Scripture in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Goſpel-times, is, that it binds Men to bind themſelves in a generality to do the will of God according to their Baptiſmal Vow; and further, that it binds them to Vow that in indifferent things, which they find neceſſary for themſelves for their better fulfilling of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:152445:70"/>
the will of God, as namely, for the thankful acknowledgment of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in great and glorious deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances, ſuch as that Pſalm ſpeaketh of, <hi>ver.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>And if the Words be taken thus, that is, for Vowing obedience, and Vowing aſſiſtance; the obedience that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, and that aſſiſtance which (as to us) the obedience requires (according to the Rules of the Old Teſtament to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the order and way of the New Teſtament, to us) I ſee not but they are, and continue ſtill a Command for Vowing <note n="*" place="margin">Vota Moralia eadem ſunt in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento, <hi>Chemmit.</hi> exam. par. 3. c. 60.</note>; I ſay, a Command ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all in regard of the Moral O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and to all again in regard of the neceſſary aſſiſtance for that Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; I mean, in the generality, but not this or that aſſiſtance in the particular; which though this or that Man may be bound to, in regard of himſelf, becauſe he cannot be ſo obedient, unleſs he take up and bind upon himſelf ſuch an help; yet other Men are free that need it not, or that can better help themſelves other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>

               <p>Hereunto, there is ſubordinate, yea, in this is included, another general Bond, to wit, to uſe (as hath been often ſaid before) all needful helps for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of that Obedience and Duty, to which there is a prae-ingagement in the Covenant of Baptiſm, and a re-ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the renewings thereof. That we are and are to be thus bound, may
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:152445:71"/>
appear from the Expoſition of the Ten Commandments, and that extent that is aſcribed to every Precept, to wit, that <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Rivet</hi> Explic.

               <p>The former of theſe is ſo neceſſary, that to deſire any grace of God, without a purpoſe to uſe the means which God putteth into our hands for the obtaining of it; or to ſeek any good from God (eſpecially any ſpecial mercy) without <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Ames</hi> Caſ. c. 16. lib. 4. queſt. 2.</note> a ſincere intention to ſerve and glorifie him, if we obtain it from him, is no leſs than (in a ſort) to mock God.</p>

For Children living with their Parents, to Vow Marriage with ſuch or ſuch againſt or without their Parents conſent, is to do that which they have a will to do, but not which they have a power to do: for they are under the power of their Parents, to whom it belongs (as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 7. 3.

                     <p>There's enough in this and the former Rule againſt Romiſh Vows, they being

The Vow of regular Obedience, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt that Scripture, <hi>Ye are bought with a price: be not the ſervants of men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 23. for in that Vow they bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even in the things belonging to the worſhip of God, to be obedient to their Superiours Will; yea, to eat, drink, ſleep, be apparelled, according to a Rule given them, wherein <hi>Luther</hi> relates that in his time there was ſuch rigor, that if a little Fleſh would ſave his life that was tied to Fiſh, he muſt not take it; and that he ſaw many, ſtrong for their age, yet ſo extremely pale and weak (walking with

                     <p>And beſides this unlawfulneſs, they conſider not how little power they have to bear what they bind themſelves unto; which alſo adds to the unlawfulneſs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We ſhould bind our ſelves by a Vow then only when it is truly needful for us, and in ſuch things as wherein we ſee juſt and great cauſe to lay a willing conſtraint upon our ſelves for God, and our Souls good; For (as hath been ſaid) a Vow in external things is grounded very much upon a conviction within our ſelves, that, howſoever others may do well without it (and therefore are not bound as we are to it), yet we cannot want it without being wanting in the Duty we owe unto God, unto which we are bound and prae-obliged by our Moral Vow alſo: We are not to make Vows trivial things, but to uſe the higheſt Medicines in the higheſt Maladies.</p>

Or, to be like <hi>Saul,</hi> who, in all haſte, brake off from his enquiring of God, and bound the People under a Curſe to eat no Food till the Evening; which was not only againſt Charity (as was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before) but againſt wiſdom and all good advice; for the matter of the Oath hindred the end of the Oath, to wit, a greater ſlaughter of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 24, 30.

                        <p>Now indeed, the Vowing againſt a ſpecial and natural corruption, is another matter. If we have faln once and again into ſuch evils, we may not Vow never to be overtaken more; for ſin we ſhall while we are here; and if any ſin over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

us, it will be our natural and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution-ſin: but we may Vow, not to give way to it for the natural pleaſure that there is in it, or out of diffidence or diſtruſt of the power of God for getting the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, or as, lying down in deſpair, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſuch <hi>Goliah</hi>'s: we may alſo Vow, carefully and watchfully to avoid the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions that may (with attending on our Calling) be avoided, of falling into them; (as <hi>Joſeph</hi> would not be with her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 10. and yet went into the Houſe to do his buſineſs, <hi>v.</hi> 11.) as alſo, to uſe all good means to keep our ſelves from our iniquity. It's but a folly for a Man to Vow he will never be overcome by a powerful Enemy; but yet to uſe all good means not to be overcome, that he may, and uſually Men do reſolve upon; ſo here, if ſuch company, meats, drinks, dalliances, compliances, give ſtrength to a Maſter-ſin, and make it more Maſter; all ſuch things one may zealouſly (and yet cautelouſly) Vow againſt: And, let this be the caution; Try for a time (as the <hi>Nazarites</hi> Vow was temporary), as, for a week, a month, a quarter; and in ſuch a meaſure, (not the higheſt and hardeſt degrees at firſt). Thus by diſuſing, thou mayſt by little and little (and ſo more

and more) wean thy ſelf from, and give a Bill of divorce unto thoſe things that hurt thee and hold thee, and which thou haſt been longer (as it were) married unto.

And by this Juſtification through Faith, there is inward peace filling the heart with joy in all outward troubles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3. 2. There is the peace of Sanctification by thoſe gifts and graces which Chriſt, as an aſcending King <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 66. 18.</note> beſtows upon all thoſe that are His by the Spirit <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 5. 22. Fruit of Spirit, peace.</note> of grace <hi>(Job.</hi> 7. 39.) and by which he rules in their hearts and ſouls; for <hi>the Kingdom of God is within us, Luke</hi> 17. 21. This peace of Sanctification hath two branches; for it ariſeth,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:152445:98"/>
1. From the mortification of our Luſts, which when they prevail there is fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 10. but when they are prevailed over, much tranquillity of mind as we ſee in <hi>David,</hi> who was freed from grief of heart, and greatly rejoiced in God when by <hi>Abigail</hi> he got the better of his irregular paſſion, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 31, 32, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus Chriſt rules when the peace of God rules in our hearts, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing of all thoſe unruly paſſions that are the make-bates between Man and Man, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Peace ariſeth, not only from the ſubduing of our Luſts, but from the quickening of us to newneſs of life, from an holy frame of heart, and a lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Chriſtian graces in our whole carriage. Thus by Faith there is perfect peace, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 3. and by the teſtimony of a good conſcience in the faithful diſcharge of our duties, much rejoicing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. and by patience, a poſſeſſing of our ſouls in peace, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a Perſonal peace of relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, union and intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt; as Men are much quieted if they have a friend nearly related <note n="*" place="margin">3 John 10. 6. 1 Sam. 11. 9.</note> and dearly affected to them, and that is able in every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give them help, that hath enough
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:152445:98"/>
in him for their uſe. Thus it is with us in regard of Chriſt; yea, much better than thus, inaſmuch as his love and power is infinitely greater, and the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and him nearer (though ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual) than that of our kinred according to the fleſh; therefore Chriſt (that his troubled Servants may have peace) calls them to himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 16. 33. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 4, 12, 13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is the peace of inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation by that Spirit which is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, to allay and take away all heart-trouble, <hi>John</hi> 14. 26, 27. Hereby Jeſus (as <hi>Jonathan,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 16.) ſtrengthens the hands and hearts of his Servants in God.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p>Thus of the perſonal Peace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is, by a reigning Chriſt, a ſocial-Peace, or a ſociety-Peace; And that, 1. By our own Regeneration, whereby

our ſpirits are made peaceable towards others. 2. By others Converſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their ſpirits are made peaceable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us: Both theſe we find, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 6, &amp;c. Thus was the raging ſpirit of <hi>Saul</hi> calmed, and thereby the whole Church alſo had much more reſt and quiet, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 31. yea, by the convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Word upon the hearts of wiſer Men (though they be not converted) there ariſeth a peace to the People of God by an over-ruling Chriſt; and Thus by <hi>Gamaliel</hi>'s counſel (upon a ground of Religion, to wit, that it was dangerous <hi>to fight againſt God, Acts</hi> 5. 39.) that bloody company were ſo convinced, that the Apoſtles had their lives, and were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd with a comfortable meaſure of peace. Unto all which we may add, that Chriſt (to whom all power is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) bends and binds the hearts, tongues and hands of Enemies, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 42. &amp; 33. 10. raiſeth up inſtruments, and ordereth out benign Providences as he pleaſeth for his Churches peace. Hence ſomething they do againſt the Children of God, and more they cannot do, though they would never ſo fain, and though they be never ſo like to do it; as we ſee in <hi>Herod, Acts</hi> 12. 2 3, 4, 5, 6—11.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> By <hi>judgment</hi> is meant in Scripture, not only the adminiſtration of Juſtice, but a juſt adminiſtration of all things, or a ſetting of every thing right, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 15. <hi>Judgment ſhall return to righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, Whereas the ordering and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of things here below hath ſeemed to ſwerve from, take its leave of, and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from righteouſneſs, God will ſo

bring things about, that it ſhall apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in the ſight of all return to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; all ſhall ſee the Government of God, and the Righteouſneſs of God met together, and follow them with joy. Now to ſhew judgment, or <hi>bring forth judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is to lay down the Law for ſetting every thing right that is out of order. This is done by the preaching of the Word, and in ſpecial the doctrine of the Goſpel, which is the juſt and right rule of Faith and life, and ſo may be expreſſed by the name of <hi>judgment,</hi> which ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both a right ſtate and frame of things, and the right rule and means by which they are ſo framed; as Judgment and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in a Land, includeth the Laws which are the rules of Ruling.</p>
               <p>But to come nearer, the Gentiles before Chriſts coming, were, and all men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are, out of order four ways:</p>

up at the feet of <hi>Gamaleel,</hi> was fooliſh and mad, till Chriſt by Goſpel-revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made him wiſer, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 9, 11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16.</p>

Now as the Underſtanding is ſet right by the Doctrine of the Goſpel, ſo are the Affections by the directions and Grace of the Goſpel; for the Goſpel of Grace teacheth us to deny all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to abſtain from all fleſhly luſts, <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 4. 3, 4, 5. Iſa. 11. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11, 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11. And the Grace of the Goſpel enableth us ſo to do. Thus men are freed from the corruption that is in the world through luſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. So that in thoſe in whom the Goſpel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 31.</note> the beſt things are their deſire, <note place="margin">Iſa. 8. 12, 13.</note> the holy God is their fear, ſin is their ſorrow, Chriſt is their joy, Heaven is their <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 10.</note> hope, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 13. <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. In regard of their converſation and actions. Before Chriſt comes and brings forth judgment, there's <hi>all uncleanneſs with greedineſs,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 19.

                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:152445:111"/>
4. In regard of their Conſolations. Before men be acquainted with Chriſt, food and fruitful ſeaſons make them glad, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 17. Now Chriſt ſets men right this way by bringing them to walk <hi>in the comforts of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Act. 9. 31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 13. 48, 52. Briefly, Chriſt did ſet the Gentiles in order both in reſpect of their Religion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 8. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 9. and their Converſation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. As for thoſe in the Church he brings forth judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby all they might be ſet in order, (and much more orderly we may ſay they are than thoſe out of the Church, by the convincements of the Word), but becauſe many are dealt with in a way of means only without inward grace, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are like <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> they are not right, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By bringing forth judgment to truth,</hi> may be underſtood the miniſtring of true judgment, or of judgment according to the truth of the Word, (as judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men is a true judgment when it is adminiſtred according to the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law.) For, Chriſt was all for truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 37. As he was a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Circumciſion <hi>for the truth of</hi>

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:152445:111"/>
is the adminiſtrator of judgment accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the truth revealed in the Word, and ſo he brings forth <hi>judgment to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 94. 15. It is in <hi>Mathew</hi> [to victory] and that's all one, and followeth upon the other, for truth will be always victorious. Now there is a double judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the revelation of the Word, this is victorious two ways: 1. In the World, for how did the Goſpei conquer and prevail there notwithſtanding all <note place="margin">Pſal. 110. 2, 3.</note> encounters? <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 20. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 6. 2. In the Elect, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24, 25. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the operation and regeneration of the Spirit in the hearts of Gods Children. As for others, judgment is brought forth <hi>to them,</hi> but as for them, it is brought forth <hi>within them,</hi> for the Kingdom of God is <hi>within them,</hi> Luk. 17. 21. Yet in them there is a combate, the part unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate riſeth up, and is loth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhould be the Judg and King, and lay down the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. but Chriſt brings judgment into victory, by making the regenerate and judicious part, the faith and grace of his children to prevail over all their corruptions and tentations, <note place="margin">See Pſal. 119. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. 4.</p>
               <p>But here it muſt neceſſarily be added,

that this word <hi>judgment</hi> containeth alſo the execution of judgment, and Chriſts judiciary proceeding for his Church, and againſt his and their enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. 5, 6, 7. For he rides in his Majeſty proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly (conquering and to conquer) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of truth,</hi> whereby <hi>his enemies fall under him,</hi> Pſal. 45. 4, 5.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p>This is a matter of ſo great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that no marvel if much be ſaid of it, for whereas other Sins oppoſe the Word and revealed Will of God, this ſin of Idolatry doth not only oppoſe that, as it is made known in the firſt, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond great Commandments of the firſt Table, but alſo doth more immediately and eminently ſtrike at the very nature and eſſence of God. In particular there are two reaſons that may be given why the Lords Prophets are ſo copious in this Argument, in ſpecial, <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe though <hi>Sennacherib</hi> were ſo worſted and deſtroyed in the Temple of his god, to ſhew the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Idol, and the true God, by beating him on his own dunghil, and killing <hi>Sennacherib</hi> under his noſe; yet <note place="margin">Iſa. 37. 37, 38.</note> afterward the <hi>Babylonians</hi> prevailed ſo far as to conquer and captivate the whole people of God, deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that was the City of God, and burn the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that was the Houſe of God, which
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:152445:113"/>
the World obſerving, <hi>(Babylon</hi> eſpecially, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 11.) and withal being ſtill ready to aſcribe ſuch ſucceſſes to their Idols, as <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. 24. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46. 1. they might therefore imagin that their Heathen gods were of ſo great power that the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (on whom they profeſſed they reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their ſafety) was not able to ſtand before them: Hence the Lord declareth that what Heathens did, and the great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories they obtained was not by the power of their Idol-gods, but by his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and for the fulfilling of what he had before hand purpoſed and determined, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 26, 27. And that he at length would be revenged on them and all their graven images, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46. 1, 2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 44, 52.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Church and People of God being under ſo heavy judgments, ſo woful a captivity, and that for ſo long a time, they might thereby be tempted to queſtion the Omnipotency, the Goodneſs, the Righteouſneſs of their God, and ſo let go their Faith and their God, which was their life, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4. Hereupon the Lord uſeth ſo many weighty words, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth ſo many unanſwerable arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Idols, deſcribeth ſo fully the folly and madneſs of Idolaters, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſieth <note place="margin">Iſa. 46. 7, 8.</note>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:152445:114"/>
of ſo many executions upon the enemies of his Church, and upon the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols of thoſe enemies, that hereby the Faith of his People might be confirmed, and their hearts eſtabliſhed in an holy and firm confidence in his All-ſufficiency, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the ſad and long-laſting calamities that ſhould come upon them, yea, in the midſt and height of them, which was the uſe of that excellent and animating Song which the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> left with them, <hi>chap.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>It is not to be ſpoken what weak and corrupt creatures we are, (as theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhew, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 45. 9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 49. 24. <hi>&amp; Jer.</hi> 33. 24.) and how apt to idolize it with Idolaters, when they have eminent ſucceſſes, and we are under hatches. If <note place="margin">Ezek. 20. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>Amaziah</hi> bowed himſelf to the gods that could not deliver their own People, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 14, 15.) how much more will men be apt to do ſo when thoſe gods ſeem to carry all before them, and the People of God to be delivered into their hands to do what they will with them? No marvel therefore if God ſpeak ſo much in ſo great weakneſs, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſo great wickedneſs. Even as our Saviour, in the 14, 15, 16, Chapters of St. <hi>John,</hi> ſpake abundantly and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably

For ſo provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is God our Saviour for his Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches peace, that he lays in Comforts and Cordials before hand, that by a continual recourſe unto them, their fainting ſpirits may be revived in the midſt and weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Soul-depreſſing ſufferings.

               <head>Q. <hi>WHence is it that the bowing of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knee to God is ſo remarkably (yea with a Divine Oath) Propheſied of in this Text?</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> For opening this Text, obſerve that as the Gentiles were invited to Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. ſo in this verſe their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming-in, and coming under God in Chriſt, is aſſerted and aſſured. The ſum therefore is this, That it is a certain truth that every perſon and creature ſhall be ſubjected to the Government of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now to God our Saviour there is a threefold Subjection:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By External Profeſſion; ſo <hi>Anani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Sapphira, Simon Magus,</hi> and falſe Brethren, yield a formal but a feigned <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 4.</note> Subjection, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13. 44.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By real Converſion; ſo <hi>Saul,</hi> the Jaylor, and others ſubmitted, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37, 41. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26. 30.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By an over-ruling Power; ſo all
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:152445:115"/>
Men, Creatures, and Devils, are and ſhall be put under his feet, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 12.</p>
               <p>The particular here expreſſed of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the knee, is an External Declaration of this Subjection, like that of kiſſing the Son, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 12. and ſhutting the mouth at him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 15. as <hi>Job</hi> 29. 9, 22.</p>
               <p>See of this bowing the knee, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 43. <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. 29. This was eminently accompliſhed in the ſubduing power of Goſpel-preaching after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and ſhall be moſt univerſally and fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed at the laſt day when all ſhall ſtand before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10, 11, 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 25, 27.</p>
               <p>The Confirmation and further Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this we have, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11. where by bowing at the Name of Jeſus, (it is not ſaid at the naming <note n="*" place="margin">Nomen, non eſt vox Jeſus quae appellatio erat in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitate, ſed ſublimitas quae erat poſt reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectionem.</note> as if that were a duty of the Text, but at the Name), I ſay by bowing at the Name is meant the acknowledgment of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and eminency, and to be ſubject to the authority of that perſon; as Name is taken otherwhere, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 21. <note n="†" place="margin">So in all languages, <hi>Jaceb ſine nomine truncus.</hi> In the Kings Name denotes his Authority and Political Name, not perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal appellation, which only declares who it is that is inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with the Regal Power.</note>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:152445:116"/>
                  <hi>Bowing the knee</hi> therefore may ſignifie in general that office which is due from every Creature as ſubjected to an exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (though ſometimes a depreſſed and deſpiſed) Jeſus, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 53. 3. But withal it denotes an outward manifeſtation of Subjection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it muſt be to the glory of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 11. So that the body muſt not be bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an Idol, when Proteſtants come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Popiſh Countries on pretence the heart is kept for God <note n="*" place="margin">Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitae inter Deum &amp; Diabolum partiuntur, ut animam alteri aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignent, corpus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri, dum Miſſis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſunt.</note>: But on the contrary, our bodies muſt be given to God, and to Chriſt who is God; which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture urgeth, not only from the power which Chriſt hath over us, but from the price he hath paid for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20.

                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond fault in the Phariſees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout creature-Swearing was, that they made ſome of thoſe Oaths binding, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers not-binding, according as themſelves pleaſed; yea, they made thoſe leſs binding, and made men more debtors (in regard of the higher nature of them) to a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful performance of them, <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. or (as ſome expreſs it) they held it was not ſuch an Oath as
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:152445:120"/>
would make a man perjured, if the Name of God were not directly uſed in it, but the name of a creature: well therefore might our Saviour ſay, Swear not at all, viz. ſo abuſively.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The other Corruption was in their common Swearing, unneceſſarily, Idlely without a due call and cauſe. Unto this that of our Saviour is applied, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 37. where (for the preventing of Raſh Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) he ſaith, <hi>let your word or communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that is, your ordinary Communication in your dealings one with another, be <hi>yea yea,</hi> (when a matter is to be affirmed) and <hi>Nay Nay,</hi> (when it is to be denied,) and <hi>what is above theſe,</hi> that is, is added by vain and ſuperfluous Swearing, cometh of evil.

               <p n="1">1 The Reaſon of it,</p>
               <p>It is, becauſe there be ſo few to whom <hi>the arm of the Lord,</hi> that is, that eminent Power of the Lord, and the Excellency reſiding and putting forth in the Perſon and Kingdom of Chriſt, <hi>is Revealed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein two things are included, viz.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is a great might in the Goſpel, for the <hi>arm of the Lord,</hi> is in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24, 25. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. <note place="margin">* Pſ. 98. 13.</note>

2. But this arm is hid and revealed to few, <hi>John.</hi> 1. 11, 14. It's like the River <hi>Siloah</hi> that runs ſoftly, and is not ſo much obſerved, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46. 45. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 6. or like the hoſt compaſſing <hi>Dothan,</hi> not diſcerned till God, opened mens eyes, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 7.</p>

and flouriſh in an ordinary way, but by <hi>a dew frow the Lord, Mica.</hi> 5. 7. Which as it waiteth not for, ſo it is not expoſed to, the eye of the ordinary ſons of men; He came into the world when the Family of <hi>David</hi> was very low.

No marvel therefore if the world could ſee nothing that would take with them, in this (outwardly) hopeleſs Shrub, wherein the meanneſs was apparen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. By the meanneſs of his Condition while he had his abode in the world.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is here deſcribed; 1.

He (and ſo his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom) were both of them beautileſs to a carnal eye. No marvel therefore if they that judged according to the appearance, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. 24. were unwilling to own him, and if ſuch be ſtill averſe from his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ways, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Matt.</hi> 13. 55, 56, 57. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 14. for only called men chooſe Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22, 23, 24. O how many Learned men can ſee a beauty in <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Aquinas,</hi> and (perhaps) in great <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (not in his Sanctity, but in his Learning and Sufficiency.) And yet if a man preach in the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit, he will be accounted by men that are graced with Learning, but not made wiſe by Grace, a paſſing poor Preacher, and his Sermon a dry Sermon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is deſcribed affirmatively: As Chriſt had but little (in outward ſhew) of that which was deſirable. So he did in his Life, Courſe, and whole Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his Office, lie under that which was, to a carnal eye, horrible; For <hi>(verſ.</hi> 3.)

                  <p>This is done by declaring the true cauſe, and the ſingular good iſſue and ſucceſs of our Saviour's low, ſad, and ſuffering Condition.</p>
                  <p n="1">1, Cauſe.

by works <hi>(Tit.</hi> 3. 5.) but by words, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 14. and are juſtified, not by any thing we can do, but by what he hath done and ſuffered for us, laid hold on by Faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 20. as it is made known to us in the doctrin of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2, 3</p>
                  <p>Now beſides this poſterity, perpetuity and proſperity, there is accrewing unto Chriſt from his low eſtate, the higheſt <hi>Glory, v.</hi> 12. <hi>Therefore,</hi> that is, <hi>becauſe he hath poured out his Soul unto Death, he was numbered with tranſgreſsors,</hi> Mark. 15. 28. <hi>bare the Sin of many,</hi> Mat. 26. 28. <hi>and made interceſſion for the tranſgreſſors, Luk.</hi> 23. 34. In a word, becauſe he hath fully undergon and done all that was to be don and ſuffered by him according to the will of God, and that with much patience and a gracious interceſſion, for thoſe that took away his life; Therefore <hi>will I divide him a portion with the great,</hi> that is, I will highly exalt him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 27. <hi>John</hi> 3. 35. make him higher than the Kings of the earth, yea give all into his hands, <hi>John.</hi> 3. 35. <hi>and he</hi> (being perfectly Victorious over all enemies) <hi>ſhall,</hi> as Conquerors uſe to do, <hi>divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong;</hi> as great and ſtrong and the moſt Victorious Warriors uſe to do: if they divide, he ſhall
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:152445:127"/>
divide alſo with and above the beſt of them; ſee <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 21. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. Now all this is for our benefit alſo. If <hi>Joſeph</hi> have all in his hand, <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall not want a portion; when he divides the ſpoil, we ſhall fare the better, for he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives</hi> to give us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 18. yea, they that tarry by the Stuff, and are willing but not able to do as others do, ſhall have a part in the Son of <hi>Davids</hi> ſpoil, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 24. If he live after the pouring forth of his Soul unto death, we ſhall live alſo, <hi>John.</hi> 14. 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. and becauſe he was numbred among tranſgreſſors, and no interceſſion of <hi>Pilate</hi> (or his Wife <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 19.) could get him off, but die he muſt, therefore he ever lives to make interceſſion for us, which without a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and blood he could never have done, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. &amp; 8. 9. 24, 25.</p>
                  <p>The Review of all this will ſhew ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how little a reaſon there is to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Croſs of Chriſt, at any meanneſs, ſhame or ſorow that befel him: And that, upon the Conſideration of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All of it was neceſſary in regard of the will and love of God. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord thus to bruiſe him, v.</hi> 10. and it was alſo Voluntary in regard of the love of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:152445:128"/>
Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 15. <hi>John.</hi> 10. 15. 17, 18. and his will to do his Fathers will, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It was neceſſary in regard of us, for we could be ſaved no other way and delivered from our loſt Condition, any more than there was cure to be had in the wilderneſs any other way but by the braſen ſerpent, <hi>John.</hi> 3. 14, 15. <hi>John.</hi> 11. 50. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And therefore, all that was laid upon him, was not for any fault in him, but was for our faults, by reaſon of our ſinful and damnable Condition, that he might ſuffer in our place and ſtead, and as our Surety, what we deſerved, and thereby prevent our periſhing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This way of God was as effectual as neceſſary for mans reſtoring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12. &amp; 10. 14.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Albeit he lay (upon this ground) under all this ſhame and ſuffering, yet the Lord put much honour upon him in his ſufferings, as many other ways, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 6 <hi>Matt.</hi> 27. 17. 52, 53, 54. ſo by <hi>Pilate's</hi> commanding his body to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to a decent and diſtinguiſhing and choice burial, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 58. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, in and by his reſurrection he was much more glorious, there being
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:152445:128"/>
thereby an admirable increaſe, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 110. 3. of his ſeed, and after it an everlaſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in life, both in his Perſon and in his members.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. After he had endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2. and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown it all by his reſurrection, He tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly aſcended into Heaven, and there ſitteth on the right hand of God, dividing his ſpoils, giving gifts to men, even to the rebellious alſo, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the rich priviledges of his paſſion, together with the benefits of his Kingly Power, exerciſing alſo his ever-abiding Interceſſion in the behalf of all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Now conſidering thus the cauſe of the low eſtate of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the honour and benefit that follows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to him, and flows therefrom to us, what reaſon can there be of rejecting; how great reaſon is there of receiving the Goſpel-report? eſpecially conſidering further, that if any reject the report up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence that God's way to ſave them is not good enough, they cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly eſcape everlaſting damnation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>John.</hi> 3. 28. 36.</p>

                     <hi>A.</hi> What they ſay, they pray; that is, they ſpeak it not peremptorily but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſively, and are upon their knees (as it were) all the while they ſpeak it: It is not a ſtout and ſtomachful imputation, as if God were in fault for it, but an humble and faithful expoſtulation, becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God to deliver from it, of which expoſtulation and wreſtling with God, there is ſpecial reaſon, inaſmuch as this erring and hardning may be ſaid to be of God divers ways; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Permiſſively; whereas he might hinder it, prevent it, and all the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, by his power.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Privatively; when he might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it by his grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Paenally; as an act of his Juſtice, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 39. (which in a meaſure and for caſtigation, may be exerciſed upon his Children.) But where ever theſe things are, we muſt remember that the hardneſs is ours though the hardning be Gods; and if there be erring upon any temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the error is our own, but leaving to it, yea giving up is aſcribed to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 24. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 11. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 31.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Occaſionally; for there is a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential hardning and cauſing to err, God putting men into ſuch a condition (and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:152445:130"/>
that juſtly) as theſe here into a ſeventy-years Captivity, whereby their hearts are mightily deaded and apt to deviate:</p>
                  <p>As 1. By the removal of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and ſpiritual help, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By being caſt among Idolaters, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane men, ſubjected to a power, and compaſſed with a company tempting to ſin, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 25, 32.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By being put into a joyleſs and hopeleſs eſtate, under wicked and cruel enemies, living in all eaſe and proſperity, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 10. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 13. Propitious and proſperous Providence is a quickener, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. 5, 6. Paenal, and dejecting Providence is a deader, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 137. 4. Now hereby God may be ſaid (in a ſort) to cauſe to err, not that God is the author of any ſin (which it is horrible to imagin) but becauſe God is the orderer of ſuch Providences, as whereupon through mans weakneſs and corruption, ſin and wandring from the right way enſueth: Hence <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>That they that drove him from the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Lord, ſaid, Go ſerve other gods,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 19. Not that they ſaid ſo, but expelling him from the Ordinances of God, and forcing him to fly for his life among Idolaters, amounted to that; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:152445:130"/>
of the great temptation there was in it. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 64.</p>
                  <p>But beſides that erring and hardning may be ſaid to be of God in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects which are common to wicked men, there are ſome reſpects wherein this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining and humble caſting of theſe things (in a ſort) upon God, is proper to the Children of God, who are imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened to do it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In regard of Gods Covenant, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference whereto it may be ſaid that they err, not only when God could hinder it, but when he hath bound himſelf to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 21. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. Since therefore he hath promiſed to make them go in the path of his Commandments, he is humbly queſtioned by his erring and grieving ſervants, as if he made them go out, for how could they go out if he caus'd them, and made them to go in? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 35. So <hi>hardning from his fear,</hi> is put (by the boldneſs and familiarity of Faith) upon his account, becauſe he hath promiſed to get hardneſs out, and put his fear in and into the hearts of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon faithful and holy men preſs God with theſe grievances, ſo as no wicked men can who have no right to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:152445:131"/>
and to whom, if they ſhould plead as they do here, God might ſay, I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from you what I am no way tied to give you; and if you be in an erring and hardned ſtate, what do you tell me of it? (to wit, continuing in a ſtate of unbelief and ungodlineſs) I am not bound by any promiſe I have made to help you who regard not the conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant on your part, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16. Lay not the blame upon me if you live and die in a ſad ſtate, it's you that are enemies to your own good.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In regard of Gods wonted ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dealing with his people, whereupon they may ſay, Why doſt thou <hi>cauſe to err,</hi> for want of working as thou was wont to do to hinder it? Wilt thou forſake the work of thine own hands? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138. 8. Is not thy former an engagement for thy future working? <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. Now wicked men cannot plead this, that God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to build, they are not able to deſign a better time, and to ſay, Lord, it was not wont to be ſo; but as for Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, an inchoation is an obligation, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 21. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39. 29. They may ſay, Work (O our God) as thou waſt wont in us and for us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 12. Withal ſince they had a promiſe of return out of the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:152445:131"/>
Captivity (wherein while they were ſhut up, their hearts were much ſhut up as the earth in an hard froſt when a thaw opens it), therefore they might ſay and pray, <hi>Return, O Lord, and graciouſly alter our ſad and heartleſs condition, ſo will we not go back, and err from thy ways: O quicken us and we will call upon thy Name,</hi> Pſal. 80. 14, 18. Our hearts ſhall not be hardened from thy fear; ſome life in our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on putting life into our affection, we will ſtir up our ſelves to take hold of thee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 7.</p>
                  <p>Now that this Prayer belongs to the faithful appears (as by the fervency of it all along, ſo) by this very complaint, for none are griev'd with erring that have not a mind to go in the right way, nor doth a ſtone complain of its hardneſs; complaint of hardneſs ſhews there is ſome ſoftneſs, and a deſire of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, a lothneſs to live without him.</p>

And ſo the meaning of the words is conceived to be this; That the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> being come, and the Goſpel being preached among the Gentiles, all the ceremonies of the Law figuring out the things of the Goſpel (whereof the Ark was chief, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4. 21, 22.) ſhould ceaſe and be aboliſhed; and the multitude of the Chriſtian Church, conſiſting both of Jews and Gentiles (but owned by the Jews from whom that Word by which the Gentiles were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, proceeded <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 20, 21, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The former expoſition makes the words a Prophecy of the Uniting of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Old-Teſtament Service appointed of God.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:152445:136"/>
which they had been ſo long ſeparated the one from the other.</p>
               <p>This latter expoſition ſeems the more probable:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the uſing of ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions (as it were) for the outing of the Ark, may be conceived to ſuggeſt and ſignifie rather the decay and vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Old-Teſtament Worſhip, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 13. than a concurrence in it; and that in the days of the Meſſiah, when by the preaching of the Goſpel Believers ſhould be multiplied, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 14. all thoſe old ceremonial things that formerly were highly prized (becauſe ordained of God, and of very good uſe to the people of God then ſhould (as the words import * <note place="margin">c Marg.</note> in the laſt part of this verſe) be <hi>no more magnified,</hi> as they were before, by the peoples viſits from all parts; I ſay, they ſhould be no more magnified, nor men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in compariſon with that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God in ſpirit and truth which the Goſpel ſhould bring in, <hi>Job.</hi> 4. 23, 24. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 3, 4, 5, 8. So that will be ſomewhat like that other Prophecy (extended alſo to Goſpel-times) <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 7, 8. <hi>They ſhall no more ſay, The Lord liveth that brought the children out of Egypt,</hi> but <hi>that brought</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:152445:136"/>
                  <hi>them out of the North,</hi> that is, one ſhould not be named (as it were) on the ſame day with the other. No more ſhould the Old-Teſtament Adminiſtration being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the New-Teſtament Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the time of Reformation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. or rather (becauſe the deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> is ever to be remembred as a real help to Faith and Obedience in all ages) it is like that of the Prophet <hi>Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai, Chap.</hi> 2. 7, 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9. who informs us that the latter Houſe ſhould be incomparably, greater than the former; becauſe though there was abundance of Silver and Gold in the firſt Temple built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> yet the ſecond Temple was far more glorious and deſirable, becauſe Chriſt the deſire of all Nations came to it: So that the more of Chriſt there is in any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hing the leſs conſiderable it makes any other thing wherein he is not, or wherein he is leſs; what was the Ark to <hi>Noah</hi> (the Jewel laid up in that Cab net) O what is any Ark, and how unworthy to be named in compariſon of Jeſus Chriſt!</p>
               <p n="2">2. This latter Expoſition may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, becauſe though the Tribe of <hi>Judah</hi> returned out of Captivity and did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and multiply in their own Land; yet the body of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not return (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:152445:137"/>
there were ſome of that body mixed with them) to join with <hi>Judah</hi> in the Temple-Service.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe it is ſaid here that <hi>all the nations ſhall be gathered to the name of the Lord, v.</hi> 17. which tho ſome apply to the ten Tribes as being a numerous company, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13. 8. yet becauſe of the latitude of the expreſſion, and the uſe of it in other parts of Scripture, it ſeems more properly to denote all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons generally, or all nations indifferently, and ſo to include both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> meeting together and cloſing one with another in the Evangelical Worſhip, in that new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is the mother of us all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26.</p>
               <p>Yet theſe two Expoſitions may be in ſome ſort conjoined, if we make the Conjunction of the <hi>Jews</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that returned with them out of Captivity and their aſſociating one with another in the <hi>Jeruſalem-</hi>worſhip, a glympſe, Fore-runner, and fore-ſhewer of that greater gathering together both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the latter days.</p>
               <p>So that the deſires of all Nations in Goſpel-times ſhould be, not the ſhadows of Chriſt, but Jeſus Chriſt himſelf and that Name of his which is as Ointment
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:152445:137"/>

               <p n="2">2. God did never command Sacrifices abſtractively, that is, as ſeparated from the Spiritual Subſtance, but in relation thereunto, and as fruits and furtherances thereof. Sacrifices ſet before them</p>

Sacrifice; requiring Sacrifices only as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances of Covenanted Obedience. We may obſerve alſo in Scripture, that the ſpiritual ſubſtance hath been accepted without the outward Ceremony, even then when Ceremonies were moſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 18, 19.) but when Sacrifice hath been pleaded without Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or to be a protection for diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, God hath extreamly diſliked it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God never ſo commanded Sacrifices and outward Ceremonies, as if he would be the God of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and they ſhould be his people, and all ſhould be well with them, if they brought him Sacrifices and Burnt-offerings: he never agreed with them upon ſuch terms, but (as it is here ſaid) upon the <hi>obeying of his voice, and walking in all the ways that he commanded them,</hi> v. 23.

               <p>Now, though that deſcription of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> Iſa. 8. 6. may ſeem to favour the former ſenſe (as alſo that <hi>Jer.</hi> 49. 19.) conſidering how like it is to the cloſe of this verſe, yet this latter is choſen by moſt

                  <hi>A.</hi> For the anſwer of this Queſtion, two things are to be conſidered: 1. What is meant by ſeeking, and ſeeking to God for the peace of that City. 2. For what reaſon they were to do it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In this ſeeking and praying for the peace of the City, two things are comprehended.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Seeking, ſtudying and praying for, the peace of the King, whoſe Subjects now they were, becauſe God delivered
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:152445:152"/>
them, and expreſly required them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver themſelves into his hand, <hi>Jer.</hi> 21. 8, 9.

Nor is it in vain in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Subjects themſelves; becauſe by this means, 1. God is engaged in his own way of Prayer, for their better go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, and that thoſe under them may lead a quiet and a peaceable life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. Hence even Pagan Princes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and do leſs evil, and more good; as upon <hi>Daniel's</hi> prayers, his and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows lives were ſaved; and they by his means (through the good ſucceſs of his and their prayers with God, relating to the King, and the action then in hand) were received into favour and promoted, no doubt to the benefit and faring bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the whole Church of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 18, 23, 46, 48, 49. In this way alſo King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> reverſed his own Decree, at leaſt made a contrary Decree, and ſo <hi>Eſther, Mordecai,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> were delivered, and <hi>Haman</hi> hanged. Thus alſo praying, <hi>Neh.</hi> 4. 9. <hi>Nehemiah (Chap.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. 4.) had favour and aſſiſtance from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then-King for building the Walls of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi>

2. Such Prayers may work for the Converſion of Church-oppreſſing Princes (eſpecially in Goſpel-times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God would have all (of what Nation or Condition ſoever) to be ſaved, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. 3.

Yea, the praying Captives at length ſo prevailed, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 12, 13, 14. that they had free liberty to return out of Captivity into their own Country and City to repair it, and to build a ſecond Temple there, <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. 2, 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. 12, 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This contains not only praying for the King, on whom depends the welfare of the State, but alſo for the State of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> on which depended the welfare of the King. This proſperity of the State may be ſet forth by <hi>the peace of the City,</hi> the glory and ſafety of the State being therein ſeated, <hi>Pray for the peace of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:152445:153"/>
Pſal. 122. 6. is (in effect) to pray for <hi>Iſraels</hi> welfare, and for the whole ſtate of the <hi>Jews;</hi> for inferiour places are the Daughters, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 48. the chief City is the Mother, and the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſtand or fall with the Mother-city. If the principal City be left, though many other Cities be taken, there may be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, but all's loſt when that's ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Empire was when this City <hi>Babylon</hi> was taken, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 30, 31. <hi>Func.

               <p>Thus we ſee what they were to ſeek and pray for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Followeth the reaſon why they were ſo to do, <hi>for in the peace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ye ſhall have peace:</hi> So that when they prayed for the peace of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they prayed for themſelves, and for the Church of God now imbodied there; where alſo they were (by Gods command here, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6.) to build, plant, marry, and be encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and where they became (afterward) ſo well accommodated, that they were loth to come from thence (though at Gods call) into their own Country, beſet with enemies; foreſeeing that they might abide in <hi>Babylon</hi> with more eaſe, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 6. But whilſt Gods will was that they ſhould be there, his will alſo was that they ſhould
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:152445:153"/>
ſeek the peace of that which was now their own place; as a man bound in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hath reaſon to pray for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Priſon, leſt if that be fired, he be burnt; and ſo <hi>Jonah</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> for the preſervation of the Ships wherein they ſailed.</p>
               <p>This Command may mind us of ſome other things, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is not unlawful, but allowed us to pray for our own peace and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 10. but eſpecially it is a great duty to pray for the Churches peace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122. 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 51. 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 137. 5, 6. Yet is there a further end to be aimed at in this, that is the glory and ſervice of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 122. 9. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 21, 22.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That when we cannot have the peace we would have, we muſt pray to God for the peace we may have. If we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have peace in <hi>Zion,</hi> we muſt ſeek (and therefore thank God for <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 15.) peace in <hi>Babylon,</hi> peace in a Priſon, and praiſe God the more if he give it there, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 25.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And we may mind this alſo, that it runs croſs to this Command, not to wiſh well to and pray heartily for the State and Land in which we live, eſpecially where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:152445:154"/>

               <p>It's true that when there is a ſad differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and diſpute between two Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Nations, there are two things (even by the prevailing party), to be mourned for: 1.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that which he ſaith of it, is, 1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> that it is <hi>a new Covenant,</hi> not for ſubſtance; for it was included and ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily

But though the ſubſtance be the ſame, yet there is divers ways a difference; and namely in two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of a new manner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and thereby a new carriage and management of this Covenant, the Sacraments and Seals of the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing different in the old and new-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Service alſo; that of the Old-Teſtament being external and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. this of the new, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 23, 24. yea the ſpiritual Law of God was then written only in Tables of ſtone, ſo that the ſpirituality lay <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 14.</note> in the Law: But as the Tables on which the Law was written, remained ſtones ſtill; ſo the Heart (if we look only to that diſpenſation in which Grace was given, but not by which) was left (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that the Law ſaid) hard and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:152445:155"/>
carnal: but now in this new Covenant, there is not only an outward word but an inward ſpiritual work; and a print is left upon the ſpirit and inward parts, ſo that a regenerate Perſon ſaith truly, <hi>Thy law is within my heart, it's in the midſt of my bowels,</hi> Pſal 40. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of the meaſure of grace, much more is given, and it's given unto more both Jews and Gentiles, <hi>Joel.</hi> 2. 28. with <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 16, 17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 17. and from hence it is that there are more alſo of the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 4. and 61. 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The benefits of this new Covenant may be thus ſum'd-up.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here's Juſtification and pardon of ſin, which though it be left to the laſt place, yet it's the bottom-promiſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes in with a <hi>For, v.</hi> 34. as the foundation of all, and from whence flows the main and marrow of the Covenant, <hi>viz.

                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:152445:156"/>
2. Here's Sanctification] <hi>viz.</hi> as Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is taken in it's latitude, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. ſo as to comprehend in it the whole work of Grace and change that there is in the new creature; ſo we may refer to it that which is here mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 33, 34. to wit, renovation and illumination.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Inward and <hi>ſpiritual renovation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>I will put my Law into their inward parts.</hi> In the Old-Teſtament the Law was written in ſtone, and <hi>they brake it,</hi> (though they had all the reaſon in the World to keep it, being newly brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> and God being ſuch a Lord to them as that he was alſo an Husband) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 5. Herein the Law was in no fault, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12. Nor were they without fault; for their breaking of it aroſe from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of their hearts, for which God paid them home and ſhook them off, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 9. But notwithſtanding that they, through their wilful and froward Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-breaking, became altogether inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable; yet a further thing alſo is to be conſidered, to wit, that that (more legal) Covenant required all things ſtrictly, but gave not from it ſelf (as legal and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſeparated from this new Covenant) ſtrength to do any thing: That Miniſtry was but a Miniſtry <hi>of the letter,</hi> wherein
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:152445:156"/>
they might read much commanded, but it had no Spirit in it to help them to keep it, and ſo it kild them for not keeping it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. The Lord therefore in this new Covenant, takes a new courſe; here's the Miniſtry of the Spirit; whereby,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He makes the Tables himſelf (as he did the firſt Tables, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 22.) only, whereas they were Tables of ſtone, now he makes fleſhy Tables, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. and having made them fit to receive his impreſſions,</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth in two Tables, to wit, the mind and the heart and bowels, write not a new Law, but the ſame Law by his bleſſed Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. whereby the heart of a regenerate man is formed and conformed in all Obedience to the holy Law of God. So that he is not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and kept in order by the Law in his Book without, but by a ſuitable Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in his mind and heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. &amp; 8. 2. The Law ſaith, this is thy duty; true, (ſaith the regenerate Perſon) for I find it written in my heart, and my duty is my delight. <hi>I delight in the law of God after the inward man,</hi> Rom. 7. 22. Pſal. 40. 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 30, 31.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beſides this inward and ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:152445:157"/>
there is added (we may ſay as that from which renovation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation comes; for Chriſt gives life by giving light, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 14. and which alſo comes from regeneration and renovation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2) I ſay, there is added <hi>ſpecial illumination,</hi> the Spirit in that way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the work of Sanctification, <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>They ſhall no more teach every man his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God, John</hi> 6. 45. and by reaſon of the Spirit, (the inward Teachers, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 27.) there ſhall be no ſuch need as there was wont to be of outward Teaching. Ordinary People ſhall be like Prophets, <hi>Joel.</hi> 2. 28. and Prophets did not uſe to go to their Neighbours to ſeek knowledg; yet the meaning of this is not, that in the time of the Goſpel, there ſhould be no ſeeking or getting knowledg of others: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The prophecy of Goſpel-times ſhews they ſhould call upon one another to go to be taught, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We find in the hiſtory of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel that <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> took <hi>Apollo</hi> (an eminent Preacher) to give him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and that not without need, for he knew only the Baptiſm of <hi>John, Act.</hi> 18. 25, 26.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Apoſtle requires the rich and

right in-dwelling of the Word of God in the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> that they <hi>might teach and admoniſh one another,</hi> Coloſs. 3. 16.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And eſpecially God that doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without need, appointed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to go and <hi>Teach</hi> all Nations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. and ſtill they taught, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 20. yea we find that they that were taught had need to be <hi>taught again, Heb.</hi> 5. 12. yea, to be put in remembrance of what they know, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. And (to ſtrike all dead) God hath appointed the calling of the Miniſtry for conſtant Teaching to the end of the World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. ſo that the meaning 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 27. is not abſolutely, <hi>No need</hi> but <hi>no ſuch need.</hi> As a Child asks his Father and fellows about every thing, being come to diſcretion, he doth not ſo: But (for all that) every wiſe-man asks advice. The Jews were children, We grown, who yet need to ask, but not <hi>as they.</hi> This will be more fully reſolved by obſerving that the Scripture uſeth to expreſs that <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> which is to be underſtood only <hi>Comparatively:</hi> As <hi>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice;</hi> when yet ſacrifice was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly required, but not principally, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 22, 23. ſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 41. &amp; 15. 22.

In the Old Teſtament Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not ſo plain; it was obſcurely ſhadowed in Sacrifices, but the chief Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was not come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. 9.

all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. Not that their ſins were not pardoned in the Old Teſtament, or that <hi>David</hi> was not (and all other faithful men with him) made <hi>white as ſnow,</hi> Pſal. 51. 7. but that was not by vertue of thoſe Sacrifices, (their ſin remained ſtill for any thing they could do) but by vertue of Chriſt's Sacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 6, &amp;c. And withal, they ſaw not their forgiveneſs ſo clearly but that there was need every year to take a new view of it in their Typical Sacrifices, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting that Atonement of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 11. And as Juſtification was not ſo plain; ſo,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sanctification was not ſo plentiful; the Spirit that is <hi>poured</hi> now was but dropt then; they had it as the Apoſtles had it when Chriſt lived, but O how much more had the Apoſtles of it, and others alſo when Chriſt was glorified! <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 39. <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 8, 31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. 3.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:152445:161"/>
the Covenant of Works) did in ſome ſort lie on that People.</p>
                     <p>But how were they bound? I anſwer two things:</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That they were bound <hi>as to their ſenſe;</hi> as we ſee in a Child put by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under Tutors and Governours, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1. there's the bond of the Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Covenant lying heavily upon him, to wit, <hi>If you learn well and do well,</hi> you ſhall have this and that, elſe a <hi>Ferula,</hi> a rod, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I ſay, this Covenant lies on the Child, and ſtraitens him, and <hi>to his ſenſe,</hi> (at leaſt ſo much to his ſenſe) there is no other; yet all this while, there is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace and Love between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Child that is tyed ſo hard to it, but that's very dark, and in the Childs minority hidden from his ſight (by the Fathers wiſdom) for his better education. So it is here, the <hi>Jews</hi> were put under <hi>Moſes</hi> his Diſcipline, and under the Law as a Schoolmaſter. This Law (with the rod of Ceremonies in its hand) was ever in the ſight of the <hi>Jew,</hi> by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there was a bondage upon his Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. to wit, the Covenant of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Grace being hid from him under the vail of the Law, and the Paedagogy of the Old Teſtament; ſo that he could not
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:152445:161"/>
look to the bottom, the end, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. and accompliſhment of that Ceremonial frame, which is now aboliſhed, 2 <hi>Gor.</hi> 3. 13. But I add,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That they were not bound by that ſubſervient and ſimilitudinary Covenant, <hi>as to their ſtate;</hi> (1) So as that they were to ſtand or fall, live or die, be ſaved or damned according to that Covenant; but when the Law was rougheſt with them, they might take out a prohibition, and appeal to Chriſt unto whom the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were to give place at his coming, they being but acceſſories annexed to the Covenant of Grace; and yet becauſe thoſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> rites and preſcripts were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of adminiſtring it, therefore (ſaith <hi>Calvin)</hi> the name of <hi>Covenant</hi> is given to them, <hi>Calv.

The Jews began their day in the evening, the firſt part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of therefore was dark, the later light, yet it was but one natural day; and ſo but one Covenant of Grace in the darker ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Old-Teſtament, and the brighter of the new.

                     <p n="1">1. That the ſecond Covenant is <hi>better,</hi> as the Sun is better to us in Summer than in Winter; for then it is vailed and cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but in Summer bright: So the firſt adminiſtration was clouded with many ceremonies, ours is bright and glorious; yet the ſame Covenant ſtill, as the ſame Sun: And <hi>(better promiſes)</hi> doth not imply promiſes better for the matter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. and ſubſtance, for there cannot be a
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:152445:165"/>
better promiſe than the firſt promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. which runs through all the Old-Teſtament; but better for the clearneſs, fulneſs, ſweetneſs, and efficacy of them under the ſecond adminiſtration.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Whereas the firſt Covenant is ſaid to be <hi>Faulty: (Faulty)</hi> doth not ſignifie that which is leſs right but leſs perfect; not that which is leſs and inferiour as to approbation, (both being ordained of God) but as to operation, not leſs juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable but leſs clear and comfortable, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this the good and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Covenant of Grace lay at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As for <hi>decaying and vaniſhing away,</hi> that ſhews not a different Covenant; for all the vaniſhing is in the adminiſtration, the ſubſtance is ſtill left: To conclude this prolix diſcourſe, 1. The Covenant of Works (made with <hi>Adam</hi> in his Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) was ſwallowed up in that Covenant of Grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. by which it ſo ceaſed that no man can now be ſaved by it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his inability to keep it: Nor ſhall be condemned by it, if by Faith he lay hold upon Chriſt that hath kept it; only it is reſumed in the Old-Teſtament, not as contracted for the ſubſtance of

               <p n="4">4.

Looking to his greatneſs alſo, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (it ſeems) to keep a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him; yet the godly among them had a gracious fear; others were affrighted with puniſhment, but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly came not thus far, <hi>v.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That there was no hope of keeping the City in a way of reaſon, the enemy being ſo much too ſtrong for them, all help failing them, and they being utterly diſabled to ſuſtain the Siege, there being no more bread in the City, <hi>v.</hi> 9.

               <p n="2">2. The Caſe here makes all clear, for whereas when <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was beſieged by <hi>Senacherib,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 32, 33, 34. the Lord ſaid he would take away, and did take away that proud enemy by one of the Heavenly Hoſt, ſo that he returned by the way he came, and did not, could not, come into the City: Here the caſe was clean contrary, for God made known by his own Word, that it was abſolutely certain and reſolved on in Heaven, that the Army of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> ſhould take the City, and burn it with fire if they ſtood out with him. Albeit therefore it
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:152445:169"/>
were not yet actually done, yet it was all one as if it had been done becauſe it was certainly and ſuddenly to be done.</p>
               <p>Now although Subjects are to ſtand for their King and Country to the utmoſt drop of their blood as long as there is any hope; yet if there be none, but Gods pleaſure is revealed for their being under another King by giving him the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all, they may and ſhould yield to Gods will in it, to whom it belongeth to diſpoſe of the Kingdoms of the World as he pleaſeth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 27. 6, 7, 11, 12. And in ſuch a caſe all Oaths and Obligations to the former King ceaſe, and the preſent powers that have got all into their hands, are to be ſubmitted to as long as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God ſo to order it, though it be for the ſpace of ſeventy years; for why ſhould we be the Authors of our death and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery by our obſtinacy? <hi>Jer.</hi> 27. 12, 13.</p>

                  <hi>Jeremy</hi> in his Diſcourſe with the King and advice to him, ſpeak according to the Word of God, <hi>v.</hi> 21. and no doubt by the Spirit of God; yet we do not find that he had any ſpecial Command from God to go and deliver theſe words unto him, though he had formerly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaid from God the ſame things for ſubſtance, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Jer.</hi> 27. 12. It's one thing for a Prophet to deliver Gods mind (when a queſtion is propounded to him) in way of <hi>Counſel, v.</hi> 15. another to deliver it by ſpecial Command and as a Meſſenger ſent from God to ſay ſuch words. This may be cleared by <hi>Pauls</hi> manner of ſpeaking when the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> wrote to him to be reſolved; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſaith, <hi>Not I, but the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 10. ſometimes, <hi>I not the Lord,</hi> v. 12. &amp; 25. <hi>I have no commandment of the Lord.</hi> Yet he ſpake what was very agreeable to the Word of God, and as one that <hi>had the Spirit of God,</hi> v. 40. but he had not ſuch an expreſs Command for one thing
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:152445:170"/>
whereof he ſpeaks as for another: Now, if it were thus here (which I leave to the Learned and judicious to judg of, then <hi>Jeremy</hi> might be leſs reſolute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe leſs armed with a ſpecial Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God: and therefore as he got from the King, Security for his life before he gave him counſel, <hi>v.</hi> 15. ſo here he takes the counſel the King gave him as the likelieſt way to ſecure it with the Princes; when in that which God gave him a direct charge to ſpeak, he did not uſe to caſt any ſuch perils, but ſhewed himſelf moſt couragious in the confidence of Gods <hi>ſending him to ſpeak all that he ſpake in their ears,</hi> Jer. 26. 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the thing it ſelf, he ſpake that which was true; for we find before <hi>(Chap.</hi> 37. 20.) that he did preſent his Supplication to the King, that he might not return to <hi>Jonathans</hi> houſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he renewed the ſame Petition at this meeting (though it be not expreſs'd) to wit, that whatſoever oppoſition of him ſhould ariſe, yet he might not be put by his Adverſaries into that diſmal Priſon. It may be ſomewhat probable (I ſay) that <hi>Jeremy</hi> now renewed this Petition becauſe the King here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:152445:171"/>
it; And if he did, why might not <hi>Jeremy,</hi> ſpeaking part of the Truth, conceal the reſt, which it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Princes to know (rather it might have put them on a great ſin, that is, the killing of <hi>Jeremy)</hi> and dangerous to himſelf to make known?</p>
               <p n="3">3. (To ſpeak a little more fully and diſtinctly) The Princes might ask <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> either,</p>
               <p n="1">1. More looſely, <hi>viz.</hi> what he ſaid to the King when he was within, and then, the anſwer the King put into his mouth, might ſerve the turn, and excuſe <hi>Jeremy,</hi> it being truly ſpoken; or</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Princes might examin him ſtrictly, of all that paſſed between the King and him, according as the King deſcribes it in <hi>v.</hi> 25. of this Chapter: If they did ſo, <hi>Jeremy</hi> cannot be excuſed but will appear weak as another man; For</p>
               <p n="1">1. He went not to the King to preſent any Petition, but the King ſent to him to hear what he would ſay to him; <hi>v.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If <hi>Jeremy</hi> did not preſent that Petition now, but it muſt reſt upon this that he did it in another meeting, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time and at another place (for ſo
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:152445:171"/>
was that that is recorded, <hi>Chap.</hi> 37. 20. it was at another time, when <hi>Jeremy</hi> was in the Dungeon, <hi>Jer.</hi> 37. 16. This, when in the Court of the Priſon, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. 13. And in another place; That in the Kings houſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 37. 17. This in Gods houſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 38. 14.) I ſay, If <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> did not preſent that Petition at this meeting, the buſineſs in that regard, is much more queſtionable on <hi>Jeremie's</hi> part: But</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though he did preſent it now, and ſo ſpake a clear truth (as to that point) yet he ſpake not all, nor the greateſt part, but rather concealed all, that is, that whole ſubſtance of the buſineſs, which they by their queſtioning with him, deſired to have diſcovered; I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe therefore that they did not ſtrictly enquire of him, nor ſtay long upon the enquiry; for then, either he muſt have been ſilent, and that Princes cannot bear (they look to have their queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons anſwered) <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 9, 10. or he muſt have ſpoken ſome untruth, ſeigned ſomething that was not, and that a <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> could not bear; or elſe expoſe himſelf to their cruelty and rage, of which notwithſtanding the Text ſaith nothing, but rather declares that the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:152445:172"/>
buſineſs with the Prophet was calmly concluded and left off, <hi>v.</hi> 27. yea, <hi>the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not perceived,</hi> and therefore it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they did not get from <hi>Jeremy</hi> what paſs'd between the King and him. Indeed it's a wonder that the Princes (that did ſo eye and pry into <hi>Jeremy</hi> and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>v.</hi> 25.) ſhould handle ſuch a matter as this, ſo ſlightly; but herein the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Power and Providence of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that ſubtil and fierce men are not always like themſelves; God caſts a miſt before their eyes, that they cannot find the door, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 11. and ſee their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages: He ſtupifies their minds <hi>(Herod</hi> ſends not a Meſſenger with the wiſe-men to bring him word where Jeſus was, but truſts to them and is baffled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 16.)

               <p n="2">2. <hi>One Rule</hi> is the principal means of effecting and eſtabliſhing it.

their diſſents are brought into a narrow room: But ſuch meetings are to be mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with care and prayer, that they that are unſound in the Faith, may not make (by their parts and ſubtilties) thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound that are in the right, nor weaken them in the truth; and (on the other ſide) that they may not hearten others in their Errours with whom they confer, by ill handling a good cauſe.</p>

               <p n="2">2. We find that in <hi>Aſa</hi> his time they <hi>fell to him out of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in abundance;</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> afterward ſent his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>throughout all</hi> Iſrael, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 1, 5, 6. and divers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came in, and made up a great Congregation, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 13, 18.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Albeit many might come to the Paſſover and return to their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and habitations again; yet it is very probable that when <hi>Tiglath pileſer</hi> had carried away ſo many of the Ten Tribes captives, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 29.

               <p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:152445:177"/>
Now, to apply this to the preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the firſt remarkable time of their coming more cloſely together, was, at their return out of the Captivity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had been ſcattered. The <hi>Iſrael-it's</hi> that mixed themſelves with <hi>Judah</hi> came (it's very like) out of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity when they did, partaking therein of the priviledg of the better party to whom they had joined themſelves; which appeareth alſo in the genealogy of thoſe that returned out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> among whom not only <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin,</hi> but divers of other Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are expreſly reckoned, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9. 3. <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. 2. &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 70. albeit they dwelt for preſent, not in the cities of <hi>Samaria,</hi> but of <hi>Judah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> (to come to the ſecond peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od) Although the ten Tribes (if we ſpeak of the generality and the Body of them) returned not out of Captivity (as <hi>Judah</hi> did) to their own country; yet under Chriſt, (to whom this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Covenanting is to be extended, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 50. 20.) they came together, when the Goſpel was preached, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Head, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 11. Hence we read, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 5. of Jews, <hi>out of every Nation under Heaven,</hi> they being ſcattered by
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:152445:177"/>
the <hi>Aſſyrian Babylonian,</hi> and other ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Kings into far diſtant places. There alſo we find the Apoſtle ſpeaking to the <hi>whole Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>v.</hi> 36. and that at the ſame time, three thouſand were converted, that is, united together in Chriſt, <hi>v.</hi> 41. That of St. <hi>James</hi> is clearer, who writes expreſly <hi>to the twelve Tribes ſcattered abroad,</hi> that is, ſcattered by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Babylonians</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus:</hi> So as that they returned not with others to their own Land; yet, to the Faith of Chriſt they were converted, and therefore <hi>James</hi> writes to them as to thoſe who had received the Faith, though they did not, as they ought, ſhew it in the fruits. St. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo points to the ſame Perſons when he writes <hi>to the Strangers,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 1. that is, to thoſe of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> diſperſed here and there where they lived as Strangers, but yet he writes to them as Perſons come into Jeſus Chriſt, and conjoined on that corner-ſtone, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there is another period of time that we expect, and that is, when the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be called and come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a conſiderable Body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25, 26. unto and under Chriſt the Head of the whole Church; unto which time

                  <hi>A.</hi> Men (and ſo the Church) may weep, albeit there be cauſe of rejoycing before them, for divers reaſons, namely, out of joy, or, becauſe of Afflictions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying their comforts, or for their ſins.</p>

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:152445:178"/>
Thus, when <hi>Archedamus</hi> ſent word of a great victory with much Loſs to the enemy, but of none on their part, the <hi>Spartans</hi> hearing of it, fell all a weeping; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſq adeo Lacrumae, tum laetitiae tum dolori ſunt communes, Xenoph. Lib</hi> 7. <hi>Sect.</hi> 620.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe of manifold afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons accompanying their comforts: As here in their return.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they had been ſo long abſent from God, as Friends, met at laſt, weep becauſe they have wanted one another ſo long: When they ken'd a returning God, it might well grieve them that they had wanted his ſight Seventy years.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe divers of their brethren were ſcattered here and there, and abode ſtill in <hi>Babylon,</hi> as not able or not willing to return, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 6. Now every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mourns when it wants its company.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe their Countrey was ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and waſted. A great Comfort it was to ſee <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> builded as a <hi>City com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact, Pſalm.</hi> 122. 3. but to ſee it burnt and broken and conſum'd, that was a weeping buſineſs, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe they were to meet with ſo many Enemies and Oppoſitions in their own Countrey; for though God made Heathen Kings to be for them; yet they
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:152445:179"/>
had to do with malevolent men round about them, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2. 10. that would do them all hurt with all their heart, but no good, nor ſuffer to have any, but againſt their will. This they might foreſee when they went to <hi>Zion</hi> and grieve at it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And eſpecially, becauſe the Temple was burnt, and the Lord had never an Houſe to dwell in with them; we may ſee the ſadneſs of this in the mournful poſture of thoſe fourſcore men, <hi>Jer.</hi> 41. 5, 6. that are ſaid indeed, to come with Offerings to the Houſe of the Lord; yet it is not probable that the news of the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Houſe had not ſounded ſo far as <hi>Sechem</hi> and <hi>Shilo:</hi> They came there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to preſent their piety, not ſo much in the Houſe as in the place where the Lord had had an Houſe, which becauſe it ſtood not now as before, therefore they were ſo ſad; for what's <hi>Canaan</hi> without <hi>Jeruſalem? Jeruſalem</hi> without <hi>Zion? Zion</hi> without God? and where was God then (moſt eminently) but in his Holy Temple?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Becauſe, though after their return, there was a new Temple erected, yet that fell ſo ſhort of the former that they came therefore weeping, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2. 33. To which we may add.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:152445:179"/>
7. Becauſe they were never like to ſee things in their Countrey reſtored to any ſuch Beauty as they had ſeen it in former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; to wit, looking on things with an eye of Senſe, and moſt had not the eye of Faith to look to Chriſt, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. 7. yea, all generally had a dim eye in thoſe days as to things Spiritual.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There was cauſe enough to mourn for their Sin. In regard whereof,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was a mourning making way for their coming out of Captivity, for the Lord hears <hi>Ephraim</hi> bemoaning, and then reſolves on their return, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18, 19, 20,</p>
               <p n="2">2. When they came to their Countrey they had cauſe to weep for that ſo long continued, and ſo like to be continued Deſolation that was there becauſe of their Sin. It was mentioned before as a great part of their afflictions; but here it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated as reflecting on, and the fruit of, their Sin; which they ſaw they had great cauſe to lament when they had viewed it in that Looking-glaſs, that is, in the Nations ruine: as <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren mourned for the ill and moſt ſinful uſage of their Brother, when they were ſo harſhly uſed themſelves. See <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 8. 12, 13. 18. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="340" facs="tcp:152445:180"/>
3. Though they rejoyced in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they had in their return, yet even that Mercy gave them cauſe ſo much to mourn for their ſin againſt ſo good a God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 8, 9, 10, 13, 14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. After they were come into their Countrey they ſinned grievouſly on a ſudden and in many things, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1. 4. and ſo had reaſon to come to the Houſe of the Lord (it ſeems before it was quite finiſhed) with trembling and weeping, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 1, 9. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. 7, 10, 17.</p>
               <p>Howſoever therefore they returned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6. 12, <hi>laſt;</hi> Looking to their enjoyment of God and his Goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; yet it was with weeping al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, looking upon themſelves and their Sin, the impreſſions whereof they ſaw in their many-ways ſad Condition. We find on the ſame day, weeping in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and <hi>great Mirth</hi> on another, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 9, 12.</p>
               <p>But here three things may be added:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this (as we ſaid in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer queſtion) may be referred to the times of Chriſt, unto whom many came in weeping in regard of their Sin? <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 38. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. and 16. 39.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="341" facs="tcp:152445:180"/>
2. And it may well be extended to that time when the Nation of the Jews ſhall be called, (in <hi>futurum tempus complen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da haec prophetia ad huc reſtat.</hi> Oecolamp.) when no doubt they ſhall come in weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for their infinite deſpight done to him, whom they ſhall know then to be the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> and not a malefactor, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 10. &amp; 13. 1. Then ſhall that pierce the Nation to the heart which hath pricked ſo many of the Nation alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. 41.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And it's ordinary for God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſtill, to come in to God weeping in their firſt Converſion, yea and afterward alſo when they deal ill with God, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. 8. 17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 75. for though they know their Sin to be pardoned, yet it's a woful thing <hi>Pſalm</hi> 88. 15. to endure the hidings of Gods face, the terrours and perplexities of Spirit that a pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sinner (whom God will never ſend to Hell) may be put to undergo; And withal, they mourn the more with tears of Love becauſe their ſins are forgiven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 47. Laſtly, In any ſpecial ſtrait which puts the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God to a wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God, how much, in how many, is that wreſtling accompanied with <hi>weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> as well as managed with Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 4.</p>

               <p>Firſt, the end is to ſeek the Lord <hi>their God</hi> as the Wife doth her own dear Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band whom ſhe dearly wants, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. and 5, 6. <hi>John</hi> 20. 13, 15.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon thereof is, becauſe they and their God had been long ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5. 14, 15. It's true that God is every-where even in <hi>Babylon,</hi> as we ſee in the caſe of <hi>Eſther, Mordecai, Daniel,</hi> and the three Children; Inſomuch that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then enemies could ſay, out of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, of Gods appearing for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:152445:181"/>
that if <hi>Mordecai</hi> were of the ſeed of the Jews, <hi>Haman</hi> ſhould ſure fall before him, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 6. 13. But yet, God is not every-where as he was in <hi>Zion,</hi> of which it is ſaid, <hi>This is my reſt for ever and here will I dwell,</hi> Pſal. 132. 14. Indeed, they ſaw his power in <hi>Babylon</hi> and his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but not his Face and Countenance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8. 17. and 45. 15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 6, 7. Not but that they might ſee God in their Captivity if they looked after him with an eye of Faith, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 23. and thereby they lived while they were in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 4. but they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the beauty of the Lord in ſenſible manifeſtations as they did in the courts of his Houſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 4. Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſeek him that they may ſee his Power and his Glory, <hi>So as they have ſeen him in his Sanctuary,</hi> Pſal. 63. 2. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Here's the way to enjoy their God as they had done, that is, by getting to <hi>Zion,</hi> which that they might do, they <hi>ask the way:</hi> Now there is a double asking,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By way of Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. and ſo theſe Jews, when they had Liberty to return from <hi>Babylon</hi> to their owncoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, <hi>ſought,</hi> that is, <hi>beſought</hi> from God <hi>a</hi>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:152445:182"/>
                  <hi>right way,</hi> that is, a ſafe and ready way to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Zion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By way of enquiries, where-ever direction might be obtained. And ſo, there is a threefold asking the way to <hi>Zion,</hi> to wit,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the earthly <hi>Zion,</hi> for they were to go thither by uncouth and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known places; which the eldeſt of them, though they had gone once before, yet it was 70 years ago, and then, perhaps, not in the direct way, but ſuch ways as the enemy pleaſed to carry them: And the younger never went it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To the Spiritual mount <hi>Zion,</hi> that is, to the communion of the Chriſtian Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 26. So divers Jews of old have enquired how to get into Chriſt, and come to a Chriſtian State, <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> 9. 36. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 36, 37, 38, 41. &amp; 9. 6. And this alſo the ſo long rejected Jews will do, whenſoever it ſhall pleaſe God to call them; they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that is, come into Chriſt and the Chriſtian Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 26, 27, 31. for Baptiſm (which is an ingraffing into Chriſt and imbodying into the Church) ſtill goeth along with Believing, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. and <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 12, 13. 36, 37.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the Heavenly <hi>Zion,</hi> which come
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:152445:182"/>
in upon Coming to God and to Chriſt Spiritually and by Faith, as the happy end of it, <hi>John</hi> 10. 27, 28. <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 42, 43. The Thief that thus applied himſelf unto Chriſt, hath preſently a promiſe and a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of paradiſe: He that is a good member of the Church ſhall receive <hi>the bleſſing from the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 24. 3, 5. <hi>even Life for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 133. 3. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35. 10. coming to mount <hi>Zion</hi> firſt, brings to the Spirits of juſt men made perfect: at laſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23. To this may be referred the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> her enquiry of the place and way of worſhip, <hi>John</hi> 4. 19, 20, 21. it's like it was as looking after her Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore Chriſt tells her, <hi>Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of the Jews,</hi> v. 22. and the way to it is not to go to mount <hi>Gerizzim,</hi> but to mount <hi>Zion;</hi> ſo ſhe calls out her City to the Saviour that was there, for <hi>Saviours come upon mount Zion,</hi> Obad. v. 21.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here's their firm reſolution to come to <hi>Zion,</hi> ſet forth in their carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, poſture and deportment: It is <hi>with their faces thitherward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This implieth three things: 1. That their intent was to get thither, as men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to travel thither whither they ſet <note place="margin">See Luke 9. 51. Ezek. 4. 3.</note> their faces, not to that place on which
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:152445:183"/>
they turn theirs backs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their great deſire to be there; the way and the journeys end are <hi>in their hearts,</hi> Pſal. 84. 5. Which is therefore accompanied with a ſuitable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and a contending againſt all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And the conſtancy alſo of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to go on ſtill till they come thither, as they were wont to go from ſtrength to ſtrength till they met together <hi>in Zion to appear before God there,</hi> Pſal. 84. 7. They did fill up to follow after God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 24. with, <hi>v.</hi> 4.

If God be not to be had in the Kingdom of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> they put the Key under the door, and go to <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 Chron. 11. 16. 2. They never reſt till they have found him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 4. If this be not he, they will ſeek for another, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>John</hi> 20. 15. <hi>Moſes</hi> cannot find him in <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> court, and therefore he goes to ſeek him amongſt Gods afflicted people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.

24, 25. and there he found him.</p>
               <p>They never lived with God really, that can live without him quietly.</p>

into an Oath as it were, to ſtick faſt unto Jeſus Chriſt, as his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Soldiers unto their Lives end: So alſo the rejected <hi>Jews</hi> (ſo long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined) when the Lord ſhall pleaſe to call them, ſhall be joined to the Lord, or (as the Scripture ſpeaks) be <hi>graſſed again,</hi> Rom. 11. 23, 24.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe this hath ever been Gods way of Conjunction with himſelf; to wit, by a Covenant of Works before man's fall, and then a Covenant of Grace, which hath been ſince, and which will ever be, for it is an everlaſting Covenant: ſo, at Chriſt's coming, when the Jews were invited to Chriſt and to Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it was done by preſenting unto them the Promiſes, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39. and they were called upon under the Title of the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Covenant, Act.</hi> 3. 25, 26. when the Gentiles alſo came unto the Church, it was in a way of Covenant, and upon Covenant-terms, thus expreſſed, <hi>I will call them my People that were not my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> Rom. 9. 25, 26.

now expected a reſtauration by the pardon of their ſin, and reſtoring of their ſtate, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 7, 8. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14. 4, 5. Now the forgiving of ſin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 34. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of danger and recovery from Church-calamity, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 32. hath ſtill been in a way of Covenant <hi>(Levit.</hi> 26. 42.) according to the Law of God called <hi>the book of the Covenant,</hi> 2 King. 23. 2. ſee 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. 12. &amp; 29. 10. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 31, 32. <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 2; 3. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 38.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p n="4">4. Becauſe, at Chriſt's coming (to which this Prophecy refers) the whole Church, conſiſting of <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles, was to be joined to the Lord in a New-Teſtament, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 8. 10, 11, 12, 13. and 9. 15.) that is, in a new-adminiſtration of the old and ever-abiding Covenant of Grace: So that comprehending Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-times
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:152445:185"/>
within this Prophecy, and thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that came in them, there was a new Work to be done, and a new way of God to be walked in, though not for ſubſtance; that is, a reformed and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. unto which they that would then join themſelves to the Lord muſt apply themſelves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this is deſcribed to be a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Covenant never to be forgotten,</hi> which is true of every Covenant made with God according to his will; but two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be given why this expreſſion is here uſed, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the old Covenant, that is, the Covenant in the old adminiſtration, was broken and forgotten by the Body of the Jews, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 32 <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 9. for indeed, they turned it into a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, <hi>Ro.</hi> 9. 32 and ſo break wilfully what they could not keep per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, whereby they were diſregarded and deſtroyed, albeit it was not ſo in thoſe times with the faithful, who look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it as a Covenant of Grace, did by Grace derive it from that done in new-Teſtament-times, acceptably keep it, and obtained pardon through Chriſt for the breaches of it. But now in the new-Teſtament,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:152445:186"/>
there is (for thoſe that be really and inwardly within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) Grace to keep it, ariſing from what hath been done in theſe Goſpel-times, and from Goſpel-diſpenſations, when the Law impoſed an hard task and gave no ſtraw or ſtrength whereby to perform it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 19. And withal now there is a greater meaſure of Grace both for Obedience and Perſeverance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Covenant becomes more clearly, than ever heretofore, a perpetual Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, not only in regard of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious reſolution of thoſe that be in it to keep it and to keep cloſe to God for ever; not only in regard of a greater Power of Grace to make good this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, but alſo by a clearer manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that God himſelf will make it good: for thus the Covenant runs; I will make an <hi>everlaſting Covenant,</hi> for <hi>I will not turn away from them and I will put my fear into their hearts that they ſhall not depart from me, Jer.</hi> 32. 40. ſince therefore it cannot fail on either part, it muſt needs be <hi>perpetual.</hi>
               </p>

Now particular Perſons are not known to be ſuch by ordinary men, but by ſuch as have an extraordinary Spirit of diſcerning; ſuch as the Prophets had: hence there are ſuch fearful imprecations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. wherein there is an eye on the Perſon of <hi>Judas,</hi> v. 8. <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 20. And ſuch alſo as the Apoſtles had, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder if <hi>Paul</hi> prayed againſt the Perſon, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. of <hi>Alexander</hi> Copperſmith, of whoſe wickedneſs there was not only an Experimental manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, but the ſtate of whoſe Perſon alſo might be known to <hi>Paul</hi> by Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſuch as men have not in theſe days; And yet, from experimental indications, and eminent evidences, that <hi>Julian</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate committed the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, the Church, in thoſe days prayed God to confound him, (though he were their Liege Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and though they pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for other Heathen and perſecuting Emperours;) and ſo he did.</p>
               <p>Now there ought to be in thoſe that pour forth ſuch dreadful prayers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a Spirit of diſcerning, an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently-compoſed Spirit, having in it a pure Zeal of Gods Glory: So it was with the Prophets; by the ſame Spirit whereby they propheſied, by the

ſame they prayed againſt the enemies of God and his People. The <hi>Spirit of God</hi> came upon him, <hi>Zechariah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hojada,</hi> who concludes thus with thoſe that oppoſed him and ſlew him. <hi>The Lord look upon it and require it,</hi> 2 Chron. 24. 22. and the Lord heard the prayer, <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24, 25. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> filled with the Holy Ghoſt, ſo thundered againſt <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> that (albeit we find not what he ſaith formed into a Prayer, yet) it had, the ſame ſad effect as if it had been ſo, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Now, we having not ſuch a diſcerning Spirit, nor ſuch a purity of Spirit, as thoſe extraordinary Servants of God had when they were about the Spirits work: we may not take upon us to do as they did, but only pray in general; Lord, whom thou knoweſt to be implacable enemies not belonging to thine election, cut them off: See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79. 12. <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 31.</p>

A Judicial part which was Gods, not by darting any darkneſs into their underſtandings; but by not imparting any light, but leaving them to their fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and darkned hearts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 14. Not by infuſing any malignity into their wills, but by not introducing any conquering Grace and Power. Now becauſe this paenal part is Gods, therefore he is ſaid to give: So that God did not give Laws not good, as a Lawgiver; but as a judg, by giving them into the hands of thoſe that gave them and promoted them, and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:152445:194"/>
by giving them up that would not obey him to obey them: And thus it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity with this wicked Peoples good-will and reſolution to comply, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 20. 3. 23. 9. And thus it is ſtill when an incorrigible Church is caſt under Popiſh or Pagan Governours. Oh! it is their juſt and ſaddeſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be given up to Laws not good, that will not obey the holy, juſt, and good Laws of God: As an enraged Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays to an incurable Son be gone, <hi>(Abi hinc in malam Rem)</hi> and ſo leaves him to the Laws of Harlots and Varlots that will be his Companions, Counſellors, yea and Commanders alſo, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 26.

How much better is it to be given up to ſtate-undoing, or body-tormenting judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than to be given up to Soul-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing Laws and Luſts? The greateſt evil of ſuffering is leſs than the leaſt evil of Sin.</p>

               <p>Firſt, the ſtate of the buſineſs, now in hand, which was this; when the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Princes (that envied him) could find no fault or unfaithfulneſs in him, in regard of his carriage in his place, and the Kings affairs, they reſolved to try whether they could find out any thing againſt him in reference to the law of his God; for they ſaw well they had no other way to have their will of him. This being their deſign, they ſo contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and carried it on by a Decree which they drew the King to confirm, that it was brought to this iſſue; Either <hi>Daniel</hi>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:152445:195"/>
muſt deſert the law of his God, or be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Den of Lions: So that his caſe ſeems to be much like that of <hi>Morde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cai,</hi> who was ſingled out as Gods Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion to enter the liſts with <hi>Haman,</hi> that was ſuffered to procure a Church-ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Decree, out of a purpoſe that the Lord had to advance his Church and himſelf (the God of the Church) in the eyes of all the world; This being the caſe with <hi>Mordecai,</hi> he will bow to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:</hi> This being the caſe of <hi>Daniel,</hi> he will bow to God, come what will come of it. No marvel: ſince, for him to yield or diſſemble now, was to ſhew that he durſt not ſtand to the Law and Worſhip of his God, and therefore utterly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; the divine rule being this, as to give to <hi>Caeſar</hi> that which is <hi>Caeſars</hi> (which he had ſtill done) ſo to give unto God that which is Gods; which he was now to do, and not leave God without witneſs, eſpecially in a thing that was not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of Scripture, but of nature alſo; for againſt that it was to leave God un-ſerved (or un-ſerved as to the notice of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo as not to dare to do it in their ſight) for a moneth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

therefore had great cauſe to ſay (as <hi>Nehemiah, cap.</hi> 6. 11.) <hi>ſhould ſuch a man as I flee?</hi> Should ſuch a man as I Flinch?

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe now there was more need to own God than at other times, there being ſo few that durſt do it: The leſs reaſon therefore there was why <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhould deſiſt, whom all men knew to have done it.</p>

as it was by the three Children <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Moreover</hi> (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and to ſpeak to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more fully) if we compare <hi>Daniels</hi> caſe with others, we muſt obſerve that in his caſe, there was not only required, 1. an act of Religion, that is, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God in Prayer; but alſo, 2. an acknowledgment of Religion, and of the God he prayed to: Briefly, Not only a worſhipping of him, but a witneſſing for him. In regard of the former (and if nothing but that had been now requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) it might have been enough for him to have prayed to God in ſecret; that might have quieted his Conſcience as to the worſhipping of God: But becauſe he was alſo to give a teſtimony to his God, and to his Religion; therefore a ſecret Worſhip, would not ſatisfie the caſe, and reach to that duty which was now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon him: Hence it will follow that whereſoever there is the like caſe, there is an Obligation to the like courſe (at leaſt for ſubſtance): when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not only a prayer but a profeſſion, and calls us forth to be his witneſſes, we muſt come into the open Court; for though his Worſhip be performed, yet the ſecrecy of it, is a ſacriledg, and robbeth God of his full due.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:152445:199"/>
But otherwiſe a great difference there is, between the caſe here and other more ordinary caſes of confeſſion: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here was a Catholick cauſe] It's true that <hi>Daniels</hi> particular Perſon and perdition was ſpecially aimed at; yet their ſpight was not only againſt him: It was the Law of his God alſo, which they ſought to wound through his ſides, and make the Lions devour him and his Religion both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This cauſe was to be managed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Heathens, that called in queſtion the Power of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo it amounted and roſe up to this height, whether their Gods were as good as his, or his were the only true God: And this became the Iſſue of it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 26.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here (as in the caſe of <hi>Mordecai)</hi> there was an eminent and extraordinary (at leaſt providential) Call; ſo that both of them were ſingled out to be the Lords Champions, to enter the liſts with his Pagan-enemies; And therefore the ſame God that did (as it were) provoke the Devil to a combate with <hi>Job</hi> his Champion, irritating Satan with his Commendation, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 8. So ordered the matter alſo in <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> his days, that thoſe heroick Perſons
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:152445:200"/>
ſhould even dare the enemies of the Church to do their worſt. Thus it was in the caſe of <hi>Mordecai,</hi> more plainly, for that cauſed and provoked to a diſmal Decree: Now, its true that here in the caſe of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Decree was paſſed before he knew of it (or at leaſt, was called to have any thing to do with it) and yet the opening of his Windows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be thought to provoke to it: But (howſoever) ſo far <hi>Daniel</hi> ſtird the Coals, and blew up the fire that was made, as to try it out to their teeth, and to do what he ſhould (and what he was accuſtomed) let them do what they could and the Lions to help them. The Cauſe was moſt glorious and the Call was moſt clear.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God did arm (together with his call) thoſe ſelect Servants and Witneſſes of his, with extraordinary abilities and courage to carry on and hold forth to the World, the Cauſe and Intereſt of God, and to fight as his combatants) ſo good and glorious (though ſo dangerous) a fight: Now when God puts ſuch a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude into the Spirits of his Worthies (as into <hi>Luthers</hi> he did) this ſpeaks (as it were from heaven) to them more than to others, to ſtand up in the cauſe
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:152445:200"/>
of God like that renowned <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 26. 29. and <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 17. 16.</p>
               <p>By this it may appear that the cauſe and caſe here ſtands upon different terms than are ordinarily preſented in in the courſe of Providence: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore few in all Ages, are ſo remarkably called out to Confeſſion as <hi>Daniel</hi> was.</p>
               <p>Yet is Confeſſion and ſtanding for God (as to the ſubſtance of it, and when there is juſt cauſe for it) a common and a ſtanding duty, <hi>Math.</hi> 10. 32, 33.</p>
               <p>But it belongeth not to the negative Precepts (like that, <hi>Thou ſhall not kill, nor commit Adultery, nor ſteal,</hi> &amp;c. unto the obſervation whereof all are <hi>at all times</hi> bound) but it is to be referred to the Affirmative Precepts, (ſuch as thoſe are, <hi>to pray, Viſit the ſick, give alms)</hi> which bind <hi>at all times,</hi> but not <hi>to all times.</hi> The meaning then is not that a man muſt never forbear to give in his teſtimony, or that a man is always bound to divulge what he thinks of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, though a Den or Death will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follow upon it; but the time and ſeaſon when God calls for it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 13. is to be obſerved: Then therefore <hi>Eliſha</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for God, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 28. and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazi</hi> (not obſerving the time) did the contrary, <hi>v.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:152445:201"/>
Only, It belongs to the negative Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epts thus far, that there muſt never be a perfidious diſſimulation though we be not always tied to an open Confeſſion; nor always to the utmoſt Confeſſion: If a man flie in time of perſecution, though this be not ſo high an appearing for God and Religion as reſiſting to blood is, yet it hath in it a real Confeſſion (in Oppoſition to the enemies of Religion) becauſe he leaves his Country, Friends, State, and ſo ſuffers many ways, rather than that the cauſe of God ſhould ſuffer by his abiding under tentation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn to any thing that ſhould be a prejudice to it. The queſtion then will be double.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Nor any juſt cauſe for it; but it will rather do hurt than good: Thus <hi>Mordecai</hi> will not have <hi>Eſther</hi> to ſhew her kinred or her people, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 2. 10. for thereby (the Nation of the Jews being
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:152445:201"/>
ſo hated of the Heathen, <hi>Eſth.</hi> 9. 1.) She and the Church of God might have fared the worſe; but the ſame <hi>Mordecai</hi> at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time told them he was a <hi>Jew,</hi> Eſth. 3. 4. becauſe then the cauſe of God was to be tried, and all the world was to be given to underſtand that there was no need to fear to own the name of a Jew. See <hi>Eſth.</hi> 6. 13. when the Glory of the God of the Jews lay at Stake.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon Chriſt oft comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Silence to others, becauſe it would obſcure his doctrine, (which he would have eſteemed moſt) by a leſs profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, ſeaſonable, and leſs ſolid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding of his Miracles; And partly, becauſe they did thereby ſo preſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him for bodily cures, that it was an hindrance to his preaching, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 45. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 4. and 9. 30.</p>
                  <p>And for this cauſe alſo, Chriſt was ſilent himſelf to admiration, <hi>Matt.</hi> 27. 12, 14. <hi>John</hi> 19. 9, 10. Some things being ſo frivolous that they were not worthy an anſwer; but eſpecially becauſe he would not hinder his ſuffering by his pleading and that real confeſſion which was to be made by his death for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God in the Salvation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
