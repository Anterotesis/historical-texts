            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You were the firſt ouer whom I euer had any miniſteriall charge. To this charge by your free choice was I called. Among you haue I ſpent <note n="*" place="margin">Since Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſommer. 1608.</note> almoſt two full prentiſhips.

My deſire is (if ſo it may ſeeme good to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prouidence) to ſpend all my daies among you: and, while I am among you, to helpe forward your ſpirituall edification. This is the maine end of my calling, and the marke, which, as in the ordinary courſe of my Miniſtry, ſo in the publiſhing of theſe <hi>Eight Treatiſes of Domeſticall Duties,</hi> and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to you, I haue aimed at. As in teſtimony of Loue and Dutie I haue preached in your hearing, and publiſhed in your name theſe Duties, ſo doe you manifeſt your kinde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of my former, and latter paines, by a conſcionable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing of them, ſo farre forth as they are agreeable to Gods word: that all who know you, may know by that euident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, how well you haue reliſhed and approued them. Thus ſhall you gaine much profit, and my ſelfe much comfort by my paines. Oh if the head and ſeuerall members of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily would be perſwaded euery of them to be conſcionable in performing their owne particular duties, what a ſweet ſociety, and happy harmony would there be in houſes?

Be you like vnto God, who, if there be firſt a willing mind, accepteth according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. Though for ſuch a matter as is handled in theſe Treatiſes, the worke may ſeeme at firſt ſight to be too copious, yet I hope the obſeruant Reader

The firſt Treatiſe (which is a fourth part of the booke) containeth a Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary on that part of Scripture out of which <hi>Domeſticall Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> are raiſed: wherein the Apoſtle ſetting forth Chriſt and the Church as patternes to husbands and wiues, liuely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the great loue of Chriſt to his Church, and the neere vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt them, together with other deepe myſteries, the vnfolding whereof hath a little the longer detained me. But as I haue a while inſiſted on maine matters of much moment, ſo haue I very briefly paſſed ouer other points. The other Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, wherein the Duties themſelues are handled, are euery of them much ſhorter then the firſt. In them I haue barely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and briefly proued the truth and equity of the ſeuerall duties, except ſome choice points which are of eſpeciall vſe, or at leaſt through diſuſe much queſtioned: and them I haue more largely handled. And becauſe contraries laid together <note place="margin">

For many that heare the duties thinke all well enough, till they heare alſo the contrary vices, whereby in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they are moſt conuinced. Concerning the many faults and vices of bad Husbands, Wiues, Parents, Children, Maſters and Seruants, taxed in theſe Treatiſes, let me intreat you, not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them too generally to all Husbands, Wiues, Parents, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Maſters and Seruants. Hath not wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> much taxed the lightneſſe, ſhrewiſhneſſe, pride, flattery, and other vices of women? And ſhall ſober, meeke, humble, honeſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men thinke themſelues taxed thereby? By like reaſon might vnchaſte ſtrumpets, vntruſty goſsips, vnquiet ſhrewes, and proud dames thinke themſelues commended by thoſe excellent commendations which be giueth of good women. Let euery
<pb facs="tcp:3442:4"/>
one, as their conſcience (an impartiall Iudge) ſhall beare them witneſſe, make a right application of euery thing to themſelues. Thus ſhall we Miniſters be freed from many euill ſurmizes. I remember that when theſe <hi>Domeſticall Duties</hi> were firſt vttered out of the pulpit, much exception was taken againſt the application of a wiues ſubiection to the reſtraining of her from diſpoſing the common goods of the family without, or againſt her husbands conſent. But ſurely they that made thoſe exceptions did not well thinke of the <hi>Cautions</hi> and <hi>Lamitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which were then deliuered, and are now againe expreſly noted: which are, that the foreſaid reſtraint be not extended to the <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Parapherna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</hi> Treat. 3. §. 21.</note> 
               <hi>proper goods of a wife,</hi> no nor ouerſtrictly to ſuch <note n="b" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>goods as are ſet apart for the vſe of the family,</hi> nor to <note n="c" place="margin">Treat. 3. §. 22.</note> 
               <hi>extraordinary caſes,</hi> nor alwaies to an <note n="d" place="margin">Treat. 3. §. 19.</note> 
               <hi>expreſſe conſent,</hi> nor to the <note n="e" place="margin">Treat. 3. §. 18.</note> 
               <hi>conſent of ſuch husbands as are impotent, or farre and long abſent.</hi> If any other war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable caution ſhall be ſhewed me, I will be as willing to admit it, as any of theſe. Now that my meaning may not ſtill be peruerted, I pray you, in reading the reſtraint of wiues power in diſpoſing the goods of the family, euer beare in minde thoſe Cautions. Other exceptions were made againſt ſome other particular duties of wiues. For many that can pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently enough heare their duties declared in generall termes, cannot endure to heare thoſe generals exemplified in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular branches. This commeth too neere to the quicke, and pierceth too deepe. But (to interpret all, according to the rule of loue, in the better part) I take the maine reaſon of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exceptions which were taken, to be this, that wiues duties (according to the Apoſtles method) being in the firſt place handled, there was taught (as muſt haue beene taught, except the truth ſhould haue beene betrayed) what a wife, in the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt extent of that ſubiection vnder which God hath put her, is bound vnto, in caſe her husband will ſtand vpon the
<pb facs="tcp:3442:4"/>
vttermoſt of his authority: which was ſo taken, as if I had taught that an husband might, and ought to exact the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and that a wife was bound in that vttermoſt extent to doe all that was deliuered as dutie, whether her husband ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act it or no. But when I came to deliuer husbands duties, <note n="f" place="margin">Treat. 4. §. 18.</note> I ſhewed, that he ought not to exact whatſoeuer his wife was bound vnto (in caſe it were exacted by him) but that he ought to make her a ioynt Gouernour of the family with himſelfe, and referre the ordering of many things to her diſcretion, and with all honourable and kinde reſpect to carrie himſelfe towards her. In a word, I ſo ſet downe an husbands duties, as if he be wiſe and conſcionable in obſeruing them, his wife can haue no iuſt cauſe to complaine of her ſubiection. That which maketh a wiues yoake heauy and hard, is an husbands abuſe of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: and more preſsing his wiues dutie, then performing his owne: which is directly contrary to the <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 33. See Treat. 1. §. 95.</note> Apoſtles rule. This iuſt Apologie I haue beene forced to make, that I might not euer be iudged (as ſome haue cenſured me) <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>an hater of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> Now that in all thoſe places where a wiues yoke may ſeeme moſt to pinch, I might giue ſome eaſe, I haue to euery head of wiues duties made a reference, in the margin ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, to the duties of husbands anſwerable thereunto, and noted the reference with this marke *, that it might the more readily be turned vnto. Yea I haue further parallel'd, and laid euen one againſt another in one view, the heads of husbands and wiues duties, as they anſwer each other: and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the contrary aberrations: with a reference made vnto the particular ſections where they are handled: that ſo on the one ſide it may appeare, that if both of them be conſcionable and carefull to performe their owne duty, the matrimoniall yoke will ſo equally lie on both their necks, as the wife will be no more pinched therewith then the husband, but that it will be like Chriſts ſpirituall yoke, <hi>light</hi> and <hi>eaſie:</hi> and that on the <note place="margin">

               <pb facs="tcp:3442:5"/>
other ſide it may be manifeſt that there is commonly as much failing by husbands in their duties, as by wiues in theirs. This parallel and euen-ſetting out of each of their duties, and of the contrary aberrations, I haue annexed next to this epiſtle. And further I haue added thereto a table of the ſeuerall heads of thoſe points that are handled in the eight following Treatiſes, that by this helpe you may the more readily finde out ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular points as you deſire moſt eſpecially to read. To ſhew that the duties preſcribed to Husbands, Wiues, Parents, Children, Maſters, and Seruants, are ſuch as in conſcience they are bound vnto, I haue endeuoured to ſhew how they are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the word of God, and gathered from thence. To auoid prolixity, I haue referred moſt of the quotations to the margin. If your leiſure will ſerue you, you may doe well to ſearch them out. Two things haue beene eſpeciall helpes to me for finding out the many duties noted in theſe Treatiſes, &amp; vices contrary thereunto: <hi>Obſeruation</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition. Obſeruation</hi> both of ſuch duties as the Scripture commendeth and contrary vices as it condemneth: and alſo of ſuch commendable virtues as I well liked in thoſe Husbands, Wiues, Parents, Children, Maſters, and Seruants, that I came among, and ſuch vnſeeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vices as I diſliked in them: and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> of one point after another in the beſt order that I could. My method and manner of proceeding brought many things to my minde, which otherwiſe might haue ſlipped by. For by method ſundry and ſeuerall points appertaining to one matter are drawne forth, as in a chaine one linke draweth vp another. There is no better way to finde out many obſeruations in a text, then by a methodicall reſolution thereof. As method is an helpe to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention,</hi> ſo alſo to <hi>retention.</hi> It is as the thread or wier whereon pearles are put, which keepeth them from ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. And if a man by abundance of matter be caſt into a laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, by the helpe of method he may eaſily and readily finde

To reſolue this doubt, we muſt firſt diſtinguiſh betwixt <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſubiection of <hi>reuerence,</hi> and ſubiection of <hi>ſeruice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Subiection of reuerence</hi> is that whereby one teſtifieth an eminencie and ſuperioritie in them whom he reuerenceth, and that in ſpeech, by giuing them titles of honour; or in geſture, by ſome kinde of obeyſance; or in action, by a ready obeying of their commandement. This is proper to inferiours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Subiection of ſeruice</hi> is that whereby one in his place is <note place="margin">Difference betwixt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence</hi> and <hi>Seruice.</hi>
                  </note> ready to doe what good he can to another. This is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Chriſtians: a dutie which euen ſuperiours owe to inferiours, according to the fore-named extent of this word <hi>one another:</hi> in which reſpect euen the higheſt gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on earth is called a <hi>miniſter,</hi> for the good of ſuch as <note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, we muſt put difference betwixt the <hi>worke</hi> it <note place="margin">Difference betwixt the <hi>worke</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</note> ſelfe, and the <hi>manner</hi> of doing it. That worke which in it ſelfe is a worke of ſuperioritie and authoritie, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing it may be a worke of ſubmiſſion, viz. if it be done in humilitie and meekneſſe of minde. The Magiſtrate by ruling with meekneſſe and humilitie, ſubmitteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to his ſubiect. In this reſpect the Apoſtle exhorteth that <hi>nothing</hi> (no not the higheſt and greateſt workes that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 3.</note> can be) <hi>be done in vaine-glory, but in meekneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt the ſeuerall places wherein men are: for euen they who are ſuperiours to ſome, <note place="margin">Euery one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 9.</note> are inferiours to others: as he that ſaid, <hi>I haue vnder me, and am vnder authoritie.</hi> The maſter that hath ſeruants vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, may be vnder the authoritie of a Magiſtrate. Yea, God hath ſo diſpoſed euery ones ſeuerall place, as there is not any one, but in ſome reſpect is vnder another. The wife, though a mother of children, is vnder her husband. The husband, though head of a family, is vnder publike Magiſtrates. Publike Magiſtrates one vnder another, and all vnder the King. The King himſelfe vnder God and his word deliuered by his Ambaſſadours, whereunto the higheſt are to ſubmit themſelues. And Miniſters of the word, as ſubiects, are vnder their Kings and Gouernours.

He that ſaith, <hi>Let euery ſoule be ſubiect to the higher powers,</hi>

               <p>The reaſon why all are bound to ſubmit themſelues one <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Euery ones Office for the good of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</note> to another is, becauſe euery one is ſet in his place by God, not ſo much for himſelfe, as for the good of others: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Apoſtle exhorteth, that <hi>none ſeeke his owne, but euery man anothers wealth.</hi> Euen Gouernours are aduanced <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 24.</note> to places of dignitie and authoritie, rather for the good of their ſubiects then for their owne honour. Their callings are in truth offices of ſeruice, yea burdens vnder which they muſt willingly put their ſhoulders, being called of God, and of which they are to giue an account concerning the good which they haue done to others: for the effecting whereof, it is needfull that they ſubmit themſelues.</p>

               <p>First, feare of God is an awfull reſpect of the diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie. <note place="margin">1. What the feare of God is. The cauſes of it.</note> Sometimes it ariſeth from faith in the mercy and goodneſſe of God: for when the heart of man hath once felt a ſweet taſte of Gods goodneſſe, and found that in his fauour only all happineſſe conſiſteth, it is ſtrucken with ſuch an inward awe and reuerence, as it would not for any thing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe <note place="margin">Two effects of a filiall feare of God.</note> his Maieſtie, but rather doe whatſoeuer it may know to be pleaſing and acceptable vnto him. For theſe are two effects which ariſe from this kinde of feare of God:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A carefull endeuour to pleaſe God,</hi> in which reſpect <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deum timere eſt nulla mala fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, &amp; nulla bona quae faci enda ſunt praete rire. Bernar. de modo benè vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. ſer.</hi> 4.</note> good king <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> hauing exhorted his Iudges to execute the iudgement of the Lord aright, addeth this clauſe as a motiue thereunto, <hi>Let the feare of the Lord be vpon you:</hi> implying thereby that Gods feare would make them ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to approue themſelues to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A carefull auoiding of ſuch things as offend the Maieſty of God,</hi> and grieue his ſpirit: in which reſpect the Wiſeman <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 19. 6, 7.</note> ſaith, <hi>The feare of the Lord is to hate euill:</hi> and of <hi>Iob</hi> it is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 8. 13.</note> ſaid that he <hi>fearing God departed from euill.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes againe, awe and dread of the diuine Maieſtie ariſeth from diffidence: For when a mans heart doubteth of Gods mercy, and expecteth nothing but vengeance, the very thought of God ſtriketh an awe or rather dread into him, and ſo maketh him feare God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:3442:17"/>
From this double cauſe of feare, whereof one is contrary <note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt filiall and ſeruile feare.</note> to another, hath ariſen that vſuall diſtinction of a <hi>filiall</hi> or ſonne-like feare, and a <hi>ſeruile</hi> or ſlauiſh feare: which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is grounded on theſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>ye haue not receiued the ſpirit of bondage againe to feare</hi> (this is <note place="margin">Bernard. loc. citat.</note> a ſeruile feare) <hi>but ye haue receiued the ſpirit of adoption</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>whereby we cry, Abba, father:</hi> this cauſeth a filiall feare. The <hi>filiall</hi> feare is ſuch a feare as dutifull children beare to their fathers. But the <hi>ſeruile</hi> feare is ſuch an one as bondſlaues beare to their maſters. A ſonne feareth ſimply to offend or diſpleaſe his father: ſo as <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſt timor ne amittatur gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia beneficij. Hic timor caſt us eſt, non eum chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas eijcit, ſed aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcit. Auguſt. epiſt.</hi> 120.</note> it is accompanied with loue. A bondſlaue feareth nothing but the puniſhment of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; ſo as it is ioyned with hatred: and ſuch an one fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not to ſinne, but to burne in hell for ſinne. Faithfull <hi>Abraham</hi> like a gratious childe feared God (as Gods An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell beareth witneſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 12.) when he was ready rather to ſacrifice his only ſonne, then offend God by refuſing to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Qui gehennas metuit, non pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care metuit ſed ardere. Aug. epiſt.</hi> 144.</note> obey his commandement. But faithleſſe <hi>Adam</hi> like a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile bondſlaue feared God (as he himſelfe teſtifieth againſt himſelfe <hi>Gen.</hi> 3 10.) when after he had broken Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, he hid himſelfe from the preſence of God. This ſlauiſh feare is a plaine diabolicall feare (for <hi>the deuils</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 19.</note> ſo feare as they <hi>tremble:)</hi> It maketh men wiſh there were no hell, no day <hi>of Iudgement,</hi> no Iudge, yea no God. This is that feare <hi>without which</hi> we muſt ſerue the Lord. In this <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 74.</note> feare to ſubmit ones ſelfe is nothing acceptable to God: It is therefore the <hi>filiall feare</hi> which is here meant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, of this feare God is the proper <hi>obiect,</hi> as by <note place="margin">2. How God is the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of feare.</note> this and many more teſtimonies of Scripture is euident, where the feare of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>the Lord</hi> is mentioned. This feare hath ſo proper a relation vnto God, as the Scripture ſtileth God by a kinde of proprietie, with this title <hi>Feare:</hi> for where <hi>Iaakob</hi> mentioneth <hi>the feare of Iſaak,</hi> he meaneth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 42, 53.</note> the Lord whom <hi>Iſaak</hi> feared.</p>
               <p>It is then vnlawfull to feare any but God? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>
               </p>
               <p>No: Men alſo may be feared, as Princes, Parents, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> How men are to be feared.</note> and other ſuperiours; For the Apoſtle exhorting to giue euery one their due, giueth this inſtance, <hi>feare,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:3442:18"/>
                  <hi>to whom feare is due.</hi> But yet may God notwithſtanding be ſaid to be the proper obiect of feare, becauſe all the feare that any way is due to any creature, is due to him in and for the Lord whoſe image he carrieth: ſo as in truth it is not ſo much the perſon of a man, as the image of God placed in him, by vertue of ſome authoritie or dignitie appertaining to him, which is to be feared. If there ſhould fall out any ſuch oppoſition betwixt God and man, as in fearing man our feare would be withdrawne from God, then the rule of Chriſt is to take place, which is this, <hi>feare not them which</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>kill the body, but are not able to kill the ſoule: but rather feare him which is able to deſtroy both ſoule and body in hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the extent of this true filiall feare of God is <note place="margin">3. Euery dutie to be ſeaſoned with a feare of God.</note> very large. No one point throughout the whole Scripture is more vrged than this <hi>feare of the Lord.</hi> It is oft added to other duties, as that whereby they are ſeaſoned, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they cannot well be performed: wherefore we are commanded to <hi>ſerue the Lord in feare, to perfect holineſſe</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The reaſon why the Holy Ghoſt ſo much vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth <hi>the feare of God,</hi> and that in ſo large an extent as hath

beene ſhewed, I take to be this; to ſhew a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt that integritie and perfection of Gods image which was at mans creation firſt planted in him, and the renoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof while here he liueth in this world.

               <p>Great reaſon there is that all ſeruice ſhould be limited <note place="margin">1. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> God the higheſt Lord.</note> with the <hi>feare of God:</hi> for God is the higheſt Lord to whom all ſeruice primarily and principally is due: whatſoeuer ſeruice is due to any man, high or low, is due in and for the Lord. The Lord hath ſet ſuperiours in the places of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie, wherein they beare the image of God. The Lord alſo hath ſet inferiours in their places, and commended them as his charge to the gouernment of thoſe who are ouer them. He that obeyeth not thoſe who are ouer him <hi>in the feare of God,</hi> ſheweth no reſpect of Gods image: and he who gouerneth not thoſe who are vnder him <hi>in the feare of God,</hi> ſheweth no reſpect of Gods charge.</p>
               <p>Beſides, God is that great Iudge to whom all of all ſorts, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> God the Iudge of all.</note> ſuperiours and inferiours are to giue an account of their ſeruice. Though by our ſeruice we haue neuer ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued our ſelues to men, yet if we haue not therein had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vnto God, and approued our ſelues to him, with what face may we appeare before his dreadfull iudgement ſeat? <note place="margin">1. <hi>Vſe.</hi> The folly of all thoſe who feare man more than God.</note> Can the fauour of thoſe whom we haue pleaſed in this world, protect and ſhelter vs from the fury of Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure?</p>

themſelues to the fancie of their people, yea though it be againſt the Lord and his word. This was <hi>Adams</hi> folly, who <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6.</note> at his wiues motion did eat of the forbidden fruit. This was <hi>Aarons</hi> folly, who to pleaſe the people, erected an <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 1.</note> Idoll. And this was <hi>Sauls</hi> folly, who againſt Gods expreſſe <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 21.</note> prohibition ſuffered his people to take ſome of the ſpoile of the Amalekites. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> who <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 24 7.</note> hearkned to his Princes to ſet vp Idols: and of <hi>Pilate,</hi> who <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Marke</hi> 15. 15.</note> to pleaſe the people, againſt his conſcience, deliuered Chriſt to be crucified. The fearefull iſſue of this their ſubmiſſion, not ſeaſoned with a feare of God, but contrary thereunto, may be a warning to all ſuperiours, to take heed how they ſeeke to pleaſe them that are vnder them, more than God who is aboue them. The iſſue of <hi>Adams, Aarons, Sauls,</hi> and <hi>Ioaſh</hi> his baſe ſubmiſſion, is noted by the Holy Ghoſt in their ſeuerall hiſtories. Of <hi>Pilate</hi> it is recorded, that being <note place="margin">

               <p>Neither is it to be accounted folly only in ſuperiours to ſubmit themſelues to their inferiours againſt the Lord, but alſo in inferiours to their ſuperiours: for thereby they ſhew that they feare man more than God, which Chriſt expreſly <note place="margin">

All the places in Scripture which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire family-duties, are proofs of the truth of this doctrine.</p>
               <p>The reaſons of this doctrine are cleere; for the family is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reaſon.</hi> The familie a ſeminarie.</note> a ſeminary of the Church and common-wealth. It is as a Bee-hive, in which is the ſtocke, and out of which are ſent many ſwarmes of Bees: for in families are all ſorts of people bred and brought vp: and out of families are they ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church and common-wealth. The firſt beginning of mankinde, and of his increaſe, was out of a family. For firſt did God ioyne in mariage <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> made them husband and wife, and then gaue them children: ſo as huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife, parent and childe, (which are parts of a family) were before magiſtrate and ſubiect, miniſter and people, which are the parts of a Common-wealth, and a Church. When by the generall deluge all publike ſocieties were deſtroyed, a familie, euen the family of <hi>Noah,</hi> was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3442:22"/>
preſerued, and out of it kingdomes and nations againe rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. That great people of the Iewes which could not be numbred for multitude, was raiſed out of the family of <hi>Abram.</hi> Yea euen to this day haue all ſorts of people come from families, and ſo ſhall to the end of the world. Whence it followeth, that a conſcionable performance of domeſticall and houſhold duties, tend to the good ordering of Church and common-wealth, as being meanes to fit and prepare men thereunto.</p>
               <p>Beſides, a familie is a little Church, and a little common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Reaſon.</hi> A familie is a repreſentation of Church and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> at leaſt a liuely repreſentation thereof, whereby triall may be made of ſuch as are fit for any place of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or of ſubiection in Church or common-wealth. Or rather it is as a ſchoole wherein the firſt principles and grounds of gouernment and ſubiection are learned: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are fitted to greater matters in Church or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. Wherupon the <note n="f" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5.</note> Apoſtle declareth, that a Biſhop that cannot rule his own houſe, is not fit to gouerne the Church. So we may say of inferiours that cannot be ſubiect in a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie; they will hardly be brought to yeeld ſuch ſubiection as they ought in Church or common-wealth: inſtance <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> and <hi>Adoniah, Dauids</hi> ſonnes.</p>
               <p>This is to be noted for ſatisfaction of certaine weake <note place="margin">1 <hi>Vſe.</hi> Priuat callings in a familie ſufficient cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</note> conſciences, who thinke that if they haue no publike cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they haue no calling at all; and thereupon gather that all their time is ſpent without a calling. Which conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence if it were good and ſound, what comfort in ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their time ſhould moſt women haue, who are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any publike function in Church or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? or ſeruants, children, and others who are wholly imployed in priuate affaires of the familie? But the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named doctrine ſheweth the vnſoundneſſe of that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Beſides, who knoweth not that the preſeruation of families tendeth to the good of Church and common-wealth? ſo as a conſcionable performance of houſhold du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in regard of the end and fruit thereof, may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a publike worke. Yea, if domeſticall duties be well and throughly performed, they will be euen enough to take vp
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3442:22"/>
a mans whole time. If a maſter of a family be alſo an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of a wife, and a father of children, he ſhall finde worke enough: as by thoſe particular duties, which we ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhew to belong vnto maſters, husbands, and parents, may eaſily be proued. So a wife likwiſe, if ſhe alſo be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a miſtris, and faithfully endeuour to doe what by vertue of thoſe callings ſhe is bound to doe, ſhall finde enough to doe. As for children vnder the gouernment of their parents, and ſeruants in a familie, their whole calling is to be obedient to their parents and maſters, and to doe what they command them in the Lord. Wherefore if they who haue no publike calling, be ſo much the more diligent in the functions of their priuate callings, they ſhall be as well accepted of the Lord, as if they had publike offices.</p>
               <p>Yet many therebe, who hauing no publike imployment, thinke they may ſpend their time as they liſt, either in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Vſe.</hi> Reproofe of ſuch as hauing no publike of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, thinke themſelues freed from all dutie.</note> or in following their vaine pleaſures and delights day after day, and ſo caſt themſelues out of all calling. Such are many maſters of families who commit all the care of their houſe either to their wiues, or to ſome ſeruant, and miſpend their whole time in idleneſſe, riotouſneſſe, and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. Such are many miſtreſſes, who ſpend their time in lying a bed, attiring themſelues, and goſhipping. Such are many young gentlemen liuing in their fathers houſes, who partly through the too-much-indulgencie and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of their parents, and partly through their owne headſtrong affections, and rebellious will, runne without reſtraint whither their corrupt luſts lead them. Theſe, and ſuch other like to theſe, though by Gods prouidence they be placed in callings, in warrantable callings, and in ſuch callings as miniſter vnto them matter enough of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet make themſelues to be of no calling.

               <p>Firſt, The husband and wife were the firſt couple that <note place="margin">1. Man and wife were the firſt couple.</note> euer were in the world. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> were ioyned in

mariage, and made man and wife before they had children, or ſeruants. So falleth it out for the moſt part euen to this day in erecting, or bringing together a familie: the firſt couple is ordinarily an husband and a wife.</p>
               <p>Secondly, moſt vſually the husband and his wife are the <note place="margin">2. Man and wife are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the chiefeſt in a familie.</note> chiefeſt in a familie, all vnder them ſingle perſons: they go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours of all the reſt in the houſe. Therefore moſt meet it is, that they ſhould firſt know their dutie, and learne to practiſe it, that ſo they may be an example to all the reſt. If they faile in their dutie one to another, they giue occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all the reſt vnder them to be careleſſe, and negligent in theirs. Let an husband be churliſh to his wife, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe her, he miniſtreth an occaſion to children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to contemne her likewiſe, and to be diſobedient vnto her: yea, to be churliſh and froward one to another, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to their vnderlings. Let a wife be vntruſtie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull to her husband, let her filch and purloine from him, children and ſeruants will ſoone take courage, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther boldneſſe from her example priuily to ſteale what they can from their father, and maſter. Thus is their breach of <note place="margin">Bis peccat qui exemplo peccat.</note> dutie a double fault: one in reſpect of the party whom they wrong, and to whom they denie dutie: the other in reſpect of thoſe to whom they giue occaſion of ſinning.</p>
               <p>Know therefore, O husbands and wiues, that yee, aboue <note place="margin">Vſe.</note> all other in the familie, are moſt bound vnto a conſcionable performance of your dutie. Greater will your condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be, if you faile therein. Looke to it aboue the reſt: and by your example draw on your children and ſeruants (if you haue any) to performe their duties: which ſurely they will more readily do, when they ſhall behold you as guides going before them, and making conſcience of your ioynt and ſeuerall duties.</p>

                  <p>I denie not but that it is a farre more difficult and hard matter to gouerne well than to obey well. For to rule and <note place="margin">Greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie in ruling well, than in obeying.</note> gouerne requireth more knowledge, experience, wiſdome, care, watchfulneſſe, diligence, and other like vertues, than to obey and be ſubiect.

For naturally there is in euery one much <note place="margin">Ambition is it which maketh inferiours loth to be ſubiect.</note> pride and ambition, which as duſt caſt on the eies of their vnderſtanding, putteth out the ſight thereof, and ſo maketh them affect ſuperiority, and authority ouer others, and to be ſtubborne vnder the yoke of ſubiection: which is the cauſe that in all ages, both by diuine, and alſo by humane lawes, penalties and puniſhments of diuers kinds haue beene ordained, to keepe inferiours in compaſſe of their dutie: and yet (ſuch is the pride of mans heart) all will not ſerue.

                  <p>Beſides, the Apoſtle would hereby teach thoſe who are

vnder authority, how to moue them that are in authority ouer them, to deale equally and kindly, not hardly and cruelly with them, namely, by endeuouring to performe their owne dutie firſt. For what is it that prouoketh wrath, rage, and fury in gouernours? What maketh them that haue authority, to deale roughly, and rigorouſly? is it not for the moſt part diſobedience, and ſtoutneſſe in thoſe that are vnder gouernment? though ſome in authority be ſo proud, ſo ſauage, and inhumane, as no honour done to them, no performance of duty can ſatisfie and content them, but they will (as <note n="i" place="margin">

                  <p>There are many weighty reaſons to moue gouernours <note place="margin">Reaſons why gouernours ought firſt to performe their duties.</note> firſt to begin to doe their dutie. For,</p>

                  <p>Secondly, by reaſon of their place they ought to goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch as are vnder them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, a faithfull performance of their duty, is an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall means to keepe their inferiours in compaſſe of theirs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, their failing in duty is exemplary: it cauſeth others vnder them to faile in theirs, and ſo it is a double ſin.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, their reckoning ſhall be the greater: for of them who haue receiued more, more ſhall be required.</p>

               <p>Theſe words <hi>(and he is the Sauiour of the body)</hi> as they doe declare the office of Chriſt, and the benefit which the Church reapeth, ſo they note the end why an husband is appointed to be the head of his wife, namely that by his prouident care he may be as a ſauiour to her.

If the particular branches of this gouernment which is giuen by papiſts vnto the Pope by vertue of his headſhip be obſerued, we ſhall finde that to be verified in him, which the Apoſtle hath foretold concerning Antichriſt, that <hi>as God he ſitteth in the temple of</hi>

O how happie a thing is it for the Church that it hath ſuch an head! an head that doth not tyrannize ouer it, nor trample it vnder foot: an head that doth not pole, or peele the Church: but procureth peace and ſafetie to it.

               <p>This <hi>waſhing of water</hi> here mentioned, being applied to an inward ſpirituall cleanſing, what can it elſe ſet forth but the Sacrament of Baptiſme, wherein both <hi>water</hi> and <hi>waſhing</hi> is vſed?</p>

For the ioyning of the word and Sacrament here ſpoken of is, that they who are baptiſed, or who preſent children to be baptiſed, and anſwer for them, or are preſent at the adminiſtring of Baptiſme, or liue in the places where it vſeth to be adminiſtred, ſhould be inſtructed in the Goſpell, and taught the couenant which Baptiſme ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vp. Beſides, the liturgie and publike forme preſcribed for the adminiſtring of Baptiſme both in our Church and other reformed Churches, laieth downe the nature, efficacy, end, vſe, and other like points appertaining to that Sacrament, &amp; plainly declareth the couenant of God ſealed vp thereby: ſo as in our and other like Churches where ſuch formes are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be alwaies vſed, the word is neuer ſeparated from Baptiſme, though at the adminiſtring of Baptiſme there be no Sermon.</p>
                  <p>The Church of Rome doth directly tranſgreſſe againſt the <note place="margin">Papiſts ioyne not the word and ſeale.</note> forenamed rule of ioyning the word and Baptiſme together. For though they haue a publike forme preſcribed, yet it being in an vnknowne tongue, not vnderſtood of the people, nor expounded to them, it is all one as if there were no forme at all, no word at all: for that which is not vnderſtood is all one <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> as if it were not vttered.</p>
                  <p>Much more hainous is their tranſgreſſion who liue vnder the Goſpell, where it is preached plainly to the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and capacity of the meaneſt, and yet are careleſſe in com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming to it, or in attending vnto it, and ſo remaine as ignorant as if they liued in places where the word is not preached at all, or in an vnknowne tongue.

               </head>
               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>EPHES. 5. 29.</bibl>
                  <q>For no man euer yet hated his owne fleſh: but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, euen as the Lord the Church.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THe former patterne of a mans ſelfe is here further ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. For firſt the Apoſtle proueth, that a man loueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and then he ſheweth how he loueth himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Two arguments are vſed to proue the point.</p>
               <p>One is taken from the contrarie: <hi>No man euer yet hated his owne fleſh. Therefore he loueth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other is taken from the effects of loue: <hi>To nouriſh and cheriſh ones fleſh is a fruit of loue: But euerie man nouriſheth and cheriſheth his fleſh. Therefore he loueth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This latter argument ſheweth the manner of a mans louing himſelfe: and therein a mans loue of himſelfe is a rule to teach him how to loue his wife.</p>
               <p>This indefinite particle <hi>(no man)</hi> is to be reſtrained to ſuch as haue the vnderſtanding and affection of a man in them: as if he had ſaid, <hi>no man in his right wits:</hi> for furious, franticke, mad, deſperate perſons will cut their armes, legs, and other parts, mangle their fleſh, hang, drowne, ſmother, choake, and ſtab themſelues. Euen ſo they are as men out of their wits, who <note place="margin">

Chriſt. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 25.</note> hate, or any way hurt their wiues: yea, it is the part of a mad man to doubt of louing, and doing good to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Theſe two words (to <hi>nouriſh</hi> and <hi>cheriſh)</hi> comprize vnder them a carefull prouiding of all things needfull for a mans bodie.</p>
               <p>To <hi>nouriſh,</hi> is properly to feed. <note place="margin">

               </p>

               </p>
               <p>The former is done by <hi>food:</hi> the latter by <hi>apparell.</hi> Vnder <note place="margin">Proprie dicitur de galina fouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te oua, quum illis incubat.</note> food, and apparell the Apoſtle comprizeth all things needfull for this life, where he ſaith, <hi>Hauing food andraiment, let vs therewith be content.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This applied to an husband, ſheweth that he ought to haue a prouident care for the good of his wife in all things needfull for her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:3442:53"/>
That he may yet further preſſe this point, he returneth againe to the example of Chriſt <hi>(euen as the Lord the Church)</hi> The Apoſtle thought that this naile of loue had need be faſt beaten into the heads and hearts of husbands, and therefore addeth blow to blow to knocke it vp deepe, euen to the head: before he confirmed Chriſts example with the example of our ſelues: here he confirmeth the example of our ſelues with the example of Chriſt againe. This he doth for two eſpeciall reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The more forcibly to vrge the point: for two exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples adde weight one to another: eſpecially this latter which is ſo farre more excellent as we heard out of <hi>verſ.</hi> 25, 26, 27.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To giue husbands a better direction for their prouidence towards their wiues, whom they muſt nouriſh and cheriſh, not only as their bodies, but as Chriſt nouriſheth and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Church, not only with things temporall, but alſo with things ſpirituall and eternall.</p>

                  <p>That which is naturall is in all by the very inſtinct of nature: and it was at firſt created, and ſtill is by Gods prouidence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued in our nature, and that for the preſeruation of nature. Were there not ſuch a naturall loue of himſelfe in euery one, man would be as careleſſe of himſelfe, as of others, and as loth to take paines for himſelfe, as for others. Wherefore that euery one might haue care at leaſt of one, euen of himſelfe, and ſo the world be better preſerued, God hath reſerued in man this naturall affection, notwithſtanding his corruption by ſin. Yea further becauſe euery one is not able to looke to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, at leaſt when he is young, ſicke, old, or any other way im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, God by his wiſe prouidence hath extended this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection towards otheralſo as they are neerely linked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs by the bonds of nature. The next to a mans ſelfe are (by bloud and bond of nature) children. Admirably much is that which parents doe for their children, which they would neuer doe, if there were not a naturall affection in them to their children. From children againe this affection ariſeth towards their parents, that when parents grow old, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or any way vnable to helpe themſelues, they might haue ſuccour from their children. And becauſe parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not alwaies together, or not able to helpe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or vnnaturall, God hath yet further extended this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection to brethren, couſins, and other kindred. And for a further extent thereof hath inſtituted mariage betwixt ſuch as are not of the ſame bloud, and by vertue of that bond raiſed a naturall affection not only in husband and wife one to another, but alſo in all the alliance that is made therby. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer this affection is wrought in neighbours, friends, fellowes, and other by like bonds knit together, that the bow of Gods prouidence might haue many ſtrings, and if one breake, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might hold. In all theſe kinds, the neerer a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to himſelfe, the more doth this affection ſhew it ſelfe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prouerbe, <hi>Neare is my coat, but nearer is my skin.</hi> God hauing wrought this naturall affection in the ſeuerall

                  <p>Admirable is the comfort which euery true member of the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Vſe.</hi> Comfort.</note> Catholike Church may reape from hence: for ſo long as the wrath and hatred of the Lord is turned from vs, nothing can make vs miſerable: we may in this reſpect reioyce not only in proſperitie, but alſo in all manner of affliction. No calamitie can moue Chriſt to hate his Church, but rather the more to pittie it, as we doe our bodies.

That none may peruert this comfortable doctrine, let me adde two caueats.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That men deceiue not themſelues with a naked name, thinking themſelues to be <hi>of</hi> the Church, when they are only <hi>in</hi> it, <note n="f" place="margin">

Thus then by vertue of this vnion we ſee how on Chriſts ſafety, ours dependeth: if he be ſafe, ſo are we: if we periſh, ſo muſt he.</p>

               <p>THe ſame points which were before laid downe, concerning the neere vnion of man and wife, and of Chriſt and the Church, are here further confirmed by the ancient law of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: which the Apoſtle doth the rather mention, becauſe it followeth vpon that text, whereunto he alluded in the former verſe. For when <hi>Moſes</hi> had alledged theſe words of <hi>Adam</hi> concerning <hi>Eue, This is bone of my bones, and fleſh of my fleſh,</hi> he <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23, 24.</note> addeth this law, <hi>Therefore ſhall a man leaue his father,</hi> &amp;c.

The maine thing which the Apoſtle aimeth at, is to <note place="margin">Inference.</note> ſhew how neerely man and wife are linked together: that thereby they may the rathet be moued to performe thoſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and ſeuerall duties which they owe each to other. But becauſe he propounded to husbands and wiues the examples of Chriſt and the Church, as patternes and motiues to them, to doe their dutie, he applieth that which was firſt ſpoken of man and wife, vnto Chriſt and his Church, to ſhew that there being ſo fit a reſemblance betwixt theſe two couples, the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne propounded is the more pertinent to the purpoſe, and the reaſon enforced from thence the more forcible.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Man</hi> (meaning an husband) is here in particular men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <note place="margin">Meaning of the words.</note> becauſe at the firſt making of this Law the woman was brought to him to ſee how he would like her: and hauing caſt his affection on her, he was to be bound hereby to continue that good liking towards her: as alſo becauſe of the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie which man hath aboue his wife.

               <p>Theſe words <hi>(ſhall leaue father and mother)</hi> are neither <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally</hi> to be taken of all duties, as if no dutie were to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to parents by children after they are maried: nor <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi> as if indeed parents were vtterly to be forſaken: but they are meant,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of that <hi>daily ſeruice</hi> which children vnder their parents gouernment performe vnto them, ſeeking to pleaſe them in all things. When children are maried, then their daily atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance muſt be vpon their wiues, or husbands, taking care how <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 33, 34.</note> to pleaſe them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of <hi>erecting a new family:</hi> for which end their parents houſe muſt be left, and the husband and wife muſt dwell each with other.</p>

               <p>Hereby then the bond of mariage is declared to be the moſt inuiolable bond that can be. For all men know, that the bond betwixt parent and childe is a firme and inuiolable bond: but the bond betwixt husband and wife is more firme and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable.</p>

1. The bond of mariage is more ancient, more firme, more <note place="margin">Reaſon.</note> neere. There was husband and wife before there was parent and child: and there is a time when parents &amp; children may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part one from another, and that while both liue: but no time, wherein man and wife may part aſunder till death part them. And children though they come from the fleſh of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, yet are made two (ſo as <hi>of one are two)</hi> but husbands and wiues though they were two before, yet are made one (ſo as <hi>of two is one.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What wrong then doe ſuch parents vnto their children, as <note place="margin">Vſe.</note> keepe them, euen after they are maried, ſo ſtrait vnder ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, <note place="margin">Parents may not keepe their children being maried too ſtraight.</note> as they cannot freely performe ſuch duty as they ought to their husband, or their wife? This is more then a parents authority reacheth vnto. Yet many thinke that their children owe as much ſeruice to them after they are maried as before: which is directly againſt this law.</p>
               <p>Greater is the wrong, and more ſinfull is the practiſe of <note place="margin">Nor keepe them from husband or wife.</note> ſuch as keepe their children from their husbands, or from their wiues. The match (ſay they) falleth out much worſe then we looked for. But this ſhould haue beene looked to more carefully before hand. After mariage it is too late to ſeeke ſuch a redreſſe.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, there be many children who ſo reſpect <note place="margin">Children may not preferre their parents before huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or wife. <hi>Apud Romanos ſponſa obtecta flammeo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite quum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuliſſet pedem è paternis aedibus, verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur in gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, itaque duceb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> their parents, as they neglect their husband or their wife. Some husbands will beſtow what they can on their parents, and keepe their wiues very bare, ſuffering them to want neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; not caring how they vex and grieue them ſo they pleaſe their parents. Some wiues alſo will priuily purloine from their husbands to beſtow on their parents.</p>
               <p>Others can neuer tarrie out of their parents houſes, but as oft as they can, goe thither. The ancient Romans, to ſhew how vnmeet this was, had a cuſtome to couer the brides face with a yellow veile, and ſo ſoone as ſhe was out of her fathers houſe to turne her about and about, and ſo to carrie her to the houſe of her husband, that ſhe might not know the way to her fathers houſe againe. All thoſe pretenſes of loue to parents are more prepoſterous then pious: and naturall affection beareth more ſway in ſuch, then true religion. Their pretence

of piety to parents is no ruſt excuſe for that iniury they doe to husband and wife.</p>

                  <hi>The vnion betwixt Chriſt and the Church is a great myſterie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle could not haue ſaid more of it then to call it <hi>a myſterie, a great mysterie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>myſterie</hi> is a diuine ſecret. <note place="margin">Of a myſterie ſee more in the whole armour of God, Treat. 3. §. 168. on <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>A <hi>Secret</hi> it is in two reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is not knowne.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it could not haue beene opened but by diuine reuelation.</p>

               <p>It is further ſaid to be a <hi>great</hi> myſterie.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Comparatiuely</hi> in relation to other myſteries: no myſterie reuealed in Gods word comparable to it.</p>
               <p>Let vs not preſume to meaſure it with the line of our owne reaſon. It being <hi>a great myſterie,</hi> it is aboue our capacitie: yet becauſe it is reuealed we muſt beleeue it, as we doe the

myſteries of the Trinitie, of Chriſts eternall generation, of the perſonall vnion of his two natures, of the proceeding of the holy Ghoſt, with the like; becauſe the word hath reuealed them, though we cannot fully ſee the reaſon of them. Herein lieth a maine difference betwixt our eſtate in this world and in the world to come: here we muſt beleeue what we know but in part: there we ſhall perfectly know whatſoeuer is to be beleeued. Preachers can but in part make knowne this myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and hearers can but in part conceiue it, let vs therefore wait for perfect vnderſtanding of it, till all things be perfected in Chriſt: but in the meane time beleeue without doubting or wauering, that which is reuealed of it.</p>

               <p>The dotage of our aduerſaries is here plainly diſcouered. They make our vnion with Chriſt meerely carnall.

Where we may note how the greater number of them, when two abſurdities are queſtioned, are readie to fall into the worſt. Vnder the Law the nonage of the Church needed, and had more Sacraments then vnder the Goſpell: yet that which was in vſe as much vnder the Law as vnder the Goſpell, and had then as much to make it a Sacrament as now, was then none, yet now is one.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As they cannot ſhew where it was ordained for a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo neither can they ſhew what is the Sacramentall ſigne thereof. Some make carnall copulation to be it. But there may be a true mariage, though the parties maried neuer know each other.</p>
               <p>Others make the <hi>Parents giuing</hi> to be the ſigne. But they hold that that is a true mariage, which is done without parents conſent.</p>

               <p n="4">4. If other poſitions deliuered by them concerning matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie be noted, a man would thinke that they ſhould be farre from making it a Sacrament. They preferre virginitie before it. Yea, they account it a kinde of pollution. They hold it vnlawfull for Prieſts, Monks, Nuns, and ſuch like holy orders (as they eſteeme them) to marie: ſo as there is a Sacrament, whereof their holy ones may not partake. The order of

Prieſthood is a Sacrament (in their account) yet that order keepeth from mariage, ſo as one Sacrament fighteth againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.

It is not honour, wealth, learning, or any other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, nor meanes of place, pouerty, want of learning, or any other like thing that can exempt an husband from louing his wife, or a wife from reuerencing her husband. He that ſaith <hi>euery one,</hi> excepteth not <hi>any one.</hi> Therefore <hi>euery one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> doe yee ſo. The like application may be made to all Parents and children, Maſters and ſeruants, concerning their duties.</p>

The law is more generall then
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3442:81"/>
the Apoſtles precept: for the law compriſeth vnder it all thoſe duties which all kinde of inferiours owe to their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, whether they be in family, church, or common wealth: but the Apoſtles precept is giuen only to one kinde of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours in the family: yet the argument is very ſound and good from a generall to a particular, thus, <hi>All inferiours muſt</hi>

                  <hi>honour their ſuperiours, therefore children their parents.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By adding the expreſſe words of the law the Apoſtle ſheweth that the ſubiection which he required of children is no yoke which he of his owne head put on their neckes: but that which the morall law hath put on them: ſo as this may be noted as a third reaſon, namely Gods expreſſe charge in his morall law.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould handle this law according to the full extent thereof, I ſhould wander too farre from the Apoſtles ſcope. I will therefore open it no further then it may concerne the point in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> the duty of children.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Honour</hi> in relation to parents, is vſed for two reaſons eſpecially.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew that parents beare Gods image: for <hi>honour</hi> is properly due to God alone: to the creature it is due, only as it ſtandeth in Gods roome, and carieth his image.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſhew, that it is an honour to parents to haue dutifull children: euen as it is a diſhonour to them to haue diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient children.</p>
               <p>Both <hi>father</hi> and <hi>mother</hi> are expreſly mentioned, to take away <note place="margin">Why both fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> all pretence from children of neglecting either of them: for through the corruption of nature we are prone to ſeeke after many ſhifts to exempt vs from our bounden dutie; and if not in whole, yet in as great a part as we can. Some might thinke if they honour their father, who is their mothers head, they haue done what the law requireth: others may thinke they haue done as much, if they honour their mother who is the weaker veſſell: but the law expreſſing <hi>father and mother,</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:3442:82"/>
condemneth him that neglecteth either of them. Yet to ſhew that if oppoſition ſhould ariſe betwixt them, and by reaſon thereof both could not be obeyed together, the father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding what the mother forbiddeth, the father is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, (eſpecially if it be not againſt the Lord) the <hi>father</hi> is ſet in the firſt place.</p>

               <p>For God layeth no dutie on any man, but therein he aimeth at the good of him who performeth the dutie as well as of him to whom the dutie is performed. Whereby he would ſhew that his Commandements are no ſtrait yokes and heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, but meanes of procuring their good who fulfill them.</p>
               <p>How highly doth this commend the good reſpect that <note place="margin">1. <hi>Vſe.</hi>
                  </note> God beareth to all the ſonnes of men: ſeeking their good in euerie place wherein he ſetteth them, either of authoritie, or ſubiection?</p>

But by the forenamed doctrine we ſee that both may be aimed at: for God commandeth the one, and promiſeth the other.

               <p>Yet becauſe through the corruption of our nature, we are too <note place="margin">Cautions in ſeeking our owne good.</note> prone to ſeeke our ſelues, ſome cautions are in this point care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be obſerued.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we ſeeke not our owne good by any <hi>tranſgreſſion,</hi> for it is promiſed vnto <hi>obedience.</hi>

               <p>THe promiſe mentioned before in generall, is here particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſet downe. The firſt words <hi>(that it may be well with thee)</hi> are not in the Hebrew text <note n="b" place="margin">

Now this part of the promiſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3442:84"/>
                  <hi>(that it may be well with thee)</hi> is prefixed as an amplification of the other part concerning <hi>long life,</hi> which is the moſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall thing intended, as appeareth in that it only is mentioned where the Law is firſt recorded. It ſheweth that the <hi>long life</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Longlife and proſperitie ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> which God promiſeth, ſhall not be a life of woe and miſerie, (for then were it no bleſsing, but the longer life laſted, the worſe it would be) but a life full of comfort and happineſſe: therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> fetteth this former clauſe in the latter place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long life thus <hi>(that thy dayes may be prolonged, and that it</hi>

               <p>Whereas the Apoſtle ſetteth downe the place where the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this promiſe is to be enioyed in a moſt large phraſe, thus <hi>(on earth)</hi> the Law bringeth it to a more narrow compaſſe thus <hi>(in the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee)</hi> meaning the land of Canaan which was giuen of God as a peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to the Iewes: ſo that the promiſe (as the Law ſetteth it downe in peculiar to the Iewes) implieth <hi>long life,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie</hi> in their owne inheritance: for <hi>long life</hi> to the Iewes was counted <hi>no life</hi> out of their owne Countrey. But the Apoſtle writing to all nations, leaueth out that deſcription of Canaan, and retaineth only the generall ſubſtance in this word <hi>(on earth)</hi> which he ſetteth downe to ſhew that euen outward proſperitie, and a <hi>long life</hi> in this world is here promiſed.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. In that parents are prouoked to complaine vnto God of their childrens diſobedience, and God thereby moued both to lay heauie iudgements vpon ſuch children in their life time, and alſo to ſhorten their daies: for parents complaint doth make a loud crie in Gods eares. It is ſaid that God by cutting off <hi>Abimelech</hi> with an vntimely death <hi>rendred the</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. In that, when parents are too indulgent ouer their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, God doth puniſh the ſinne both of parent and childe, by ſhortning the childes daies. Inſtance the examples of <note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 34.</note>

                  <p n="4">4. In that diſobedience to parents, is a ſinne that ſeldome goeth alone: for an vndutifull childe is commonly a verie lewd perſon many other waies.

                  <p>Wherefore in that theſe miſchiefes are auoided by perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming due obedience to parents, it may well be ſaid that <hi>it ſhall be well with obedient children, and they ſhall liue long.</hi>

               <p>The particular branches of Gods promiſe hauing beene <note place="margin">How fitly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and long life are ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> diſtinctly opened, we will conſider them ioyntly together, for they doe exceedingly amplifie one another: <hi>proſperity</hi> ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens long life and makes it acceptable: otherwiſe to liue long, namely in miſery and wretchedneſſe, is very irkſome and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous. Againe, long life added to proſperity maketh it ſo much the greater bleſſing. For a good thing the longer it continueth the better it is. If proſperity were but as a flower, ſoone gone, the very thought of the vanity thereof would much diminiſh the ioy and comfort of it. But both of them ioyned together, doe ſhew that this is no ſmall bleſſing which is promiſed.</p>
               <p>From the connexion of them both together, I obſerue that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God ſo ordereth his fauours as they appeare to be true bleſſings,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God makes his ſauours true bleſſings. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 19.</note> tending indeed to the good of thoſe vpon whom he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them. Thus when God gaue <hi>Abraham</hi> a ſonne, he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed his couenant with him, that this gift might be a true bleſſing.</p>
               <p>The like I might inſtance in all the children of promiſe, as <hi>Sampſon, Salomon, Iohn Baptiſt, &amp;c.</hi> So in other fauours. When God added fifteene yeares to <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> life, he alſo promiſed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 5, 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 39. 8.</note> him deliuerance from his enemies, and peace, and truth all his daies: And when God gaue <hi>Dauid</hi> a kingdome, he gaue him <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> great victories and long life, and eſtabliſhed his kingdome to his poſterity: ſo alſo dealt he with <hi>Salomon.</hi> But not to inſiſt on any more particulars, excellently is this doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the 28 <hi>Pſalme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus God will ſhew that in loue he beſtoweth euen the temporall bleſſings which he giueth to his Saints, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they may eſteeme them, and that their hearts may be the more inlarged both to admire his goodneſſe, and to be thankfull for the ſame.</p>
               <p>This vſe we muſt make of thoſe things which the Lord is <note place="margin">1. <hi>Vſe.</hi>

               <p>Hauing declared ſuch orthodoxall points as this text af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth, I will further note out two hereticall poſitions, which our aduerſaries thence raiſe.

               <p>For full anſwer hereunto, I will firſt ſhew, that the poſition it ſelfe is directly contrarie to the current of Scripture, and then diſcouer the vnſoundneſſe of their conſequence.</p>

               <p>Touching their conſequence <hi>(if a mans time be determined all the promiſes of long life are to no purpoſe)</hi> I anſwer, that God who hath ſet downe the iuſt time and period of mans life, hath alſo ſet downe the meanes of attaining to that period. Now the time he hath kept ſecret to himſelfe, the meanes he hath reuealed to vs. In regard of vs therefore who know not the time appointed of the Lord, it may be ſaid that by vſing ſuch and ſuch meanes we prolong our daies, or by doing ſuch and ſuch things we ſhorten them. Now becauſe theſe meanes only ſhew them to be long, or ſhort, Gods decree remaineth firme and ſtable, and is not altred thereby: yet this worke of leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening or ſhortning is attributed to vs, becauſe we doe what lieth in vs thereto, and that freely without any compulſion. For Gods decree though it cauſe a neceſſitie in the euent, yet it impoſeth no conſtraint on the will of man, but leaueth it as free (in regard of the manner of working) as if there were no decree at all. And herein Gods admirable wiſdome is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, that notwithſtanding his determined purpoſe of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, man hath no ground of excuſe to ſay he was forced to this or that.</p>

All the directions and exhortations throughout the Scripture gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto parents, concerning their dutie, and all the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings denounced, and iudgements executed on parents for neglect of their dutie, are pregnant proofes of this point.</p>
               <p>Though parents be ouer their children, and by them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be commanded, yet they are vnder God: and he it is who hath enioyned them their dutie: ſo as they are bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as they will anſwer it to their Father in heauen.</p>
               <p>The authoritie which parents haue, is not ſo much for their owne aduancement, as for the better gouerning of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which being ſo, their verie gouernment is a dutie.</p>

much bindeth, as if it were expreſſed. It is thus implied. They who haue honour, muſt carrie themſelues worthie of honour. Now the way to carrie themſelues worthie of honour, is to be carefull in doing dutie to them that honour them. This is ſo equall, as it needed not to be expreſt.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let Miniſters follow this patterne of the Apoſtle, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Vſe.</hi> Miniſters muſt prouoke parents to their dutie.</note> and carrie an euen hand towards all of all ſorts: let them not be partiall in laying all the burden of dutie on childrens necks, and none on parents: holding in children verie ſtraitly, but leauing parents to their owne will. Parents are fleſh and bloud as well as children, and as prone to tranſgreſſe in their place, as children in theirs. Yea, Miniſters ought of the two to be more earneſt in vrging parents to performe their dutie, becauſe they are vnder no ſuch power and authoritie as children are. Feare of parents authoritie keepeth children much in awe. There is no ſuch thing to keepe parents in awe. They will be more readie therefore to take the greater libertie, if by feare of God, and by a good conſcience, they be not kept in compaſſe.</p>

For you being elder in yeeres, and more eminent in place, of more experience, and hauing a charge ouer your children, ought to be a light to ſhew them the way, an example to allure them, that they ſeeing you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and conſcionable in performing your dutie, may be the more prouoked to performe theirs, or at leaſt made aſhamed of their neglect of dutie. But if you be careleſſe of your dutie, how can ye expect dutie at their hands? nay if by your ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample they haue beene made negligent, their bloud ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at your hands.</p>

               <p>Becauſe there is yet another order in the family beſides thoſe which haue been noted before, namely the order of Maſters &amp; ſeruants, the Apoſtle preſcribeth alſo vnto them their dutie.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtle is ſomewhat copious in laying forth the duties of ſeruants, and in vrging them to performe their dutie; and that for two eſpeciall reaſons: One in reſpect of thoſe, whoſe maſters were infidels: another in reſpect of thoſe, whoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were Saints.</p>

               <p>Theſe two prepoſterous and preſumptuous conceits doth the Apoſtle intimate, and expreſly meet with in <note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1, 2.</note> another

               <p>Now let maſters take notice hereof: and know that God the great Lord of all hath made this relation betwixt maſter and ſeruant, and hath ſet each of them in their ſeuerall and diſtinct places for the mutuall good of one another, ſo as ſeruants are no more for the good of maſters, then maſters are for the good of ſeruants. Wherefore, as they looke for dutie, let them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme dutie: if ſeruants faile in their dutie, let maſters ſee if they themſelues be not the cauſe thereof, by failing in theirs. Their authoritie will be no excuſe before Chriſt, but a meanes to aggrauate their fault, and increaſe their condemnation: for the greater the talent is, the more diligence is expected, and the ſtraiter account ſhall be exacted.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Theſe words are not to be referred to thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular duties which are proper to ſeruants, but to thoſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rules of equitie which are common to maſters as well as ſeruants; namely, that in their ſeuerall places, <hi>with ſingleneſſe of heart, as vnto Chriſt, not with eie ſeruice as men pleaſers, but as the ſeruants of Chriſt they doe the will of God from the heart.</hi>

2. Thoſe words may be referred to the eight verſe, the verſe going immediatly before, which laieth downe a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule for all men in their ſeuerall places to doe the good things of their places. Now then as ſeruants muſt haue an eie to their places to doe the good things thereof, ſo maſters muſt doe <hi>the ſame things:</hi> that is, <hi>they</hi> muſt haue an eie to <hi>their</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to doe the good things thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe words may be taken without reference to any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words, and expounded of a mutuall, reciprocall, and proportionable dutie that ought to paſſe betwixt maſter and ſeruant: not in the particulars, as if the ſame duties were to be performed by each of them, for that were to ouerthrow the order and degrees which God hath ſet betwixt maſter and ſeruant, to croſſe Gods ordinance, and inferre contradiction: but in generall, that duties are to be performed of each to other: in which reſpect the Apoſtle ſaid <note n="*" place="margin">§. 3.</note> before of all ſorts, ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and inferiours, <hi>Submit your ſelues one to another.</hi> And thus by this phraſe the doctrine before mentioned is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that <hi>Maſters are as well bound to dutie as ſeruants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None of theſe anſwers thwart another, but all of them may well be admitted, and all of them well ſtand together. They all imply a common equitie betwixt maſters and ſeruants, but no equalitie: mutuall duties, but diuers and diſtinct duties, appertaining to their ſeuerall places. Compare with this text, that which the Apoſtle himſelfe hath more plainly and fully noted <hi>(Col.</hi> 4. 1.) and we ſhall obſerue him to expound his own meaning, for that which here he implieth vnder this phraſe <hi>(the ſame things)</hi> that he expreſſeth there vnder theſe two words, <hi>iuſt, equall:</hi> whereof we ſhall <note n="*" place="margin">Treat. 8. §. 20, 44.</note> hereafter more diſtinctly ſpeake.</p>
               <p>Purpoſely doth the Apoſtle infold maſters duties vnder this generall phraſe <hi>(the ſame things)</hi> to preuent a ſecret obiection raiſed from the eminency and ſuperioritie of maſters aboue ſeruants, which maketh them thinke, that ſeruants are only for the vſe of maſters, and that maſters are no way tied to their ſeruants. But if in the generall maſters muſt doe <hi>the ſame things,</hi> then they are for their ſeruants good, as well as ſeruants for theirs.</p>

               <head>§. 16. <hi>Of the reaſons which ſhew how requiſite a contract is.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Many good and weightie reaſons may be alledged to ſhew how requiſite it is that a contract ſhould go before mariage. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. It addeth much to the honour of mariage, that it ſhould be deliberatly and aduiſedly ſtep after ſtep, by one degree after another conſummated and made vp.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It putteth a difference betwixt ſuch as intend mariage in the feare of the Lord, for ſuch holy ends as are warranted in the word, and ſuch as intend it only to ſatisfie their luſt, or for other like carnall ends. For <hi>theſe</hi> can admit no delay, as was noted <note n="*" place="margin">In the end of §. 13.</note> before. But <hi>they</hi> that vſe this ſolemne preparation by a contract before mariage, ſhew that they deſire to haue all things fit for ſo ſacred a matter duly performed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are content to make ſome ſtay for the better effecting thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a meanes of knitting the hearts of the two parties to be maried more firmely and inuiolably together before they come to dwell together. For a contract being the beginning of a mariage, it is an euident demonſtration of Gods counſell concerning the parties contracted, that God hath prepared them each for other to be man and wife: ſo as after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is made, they may ſimply and abſolutely pray each for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that God would bleſſe them one to another, to liue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably and happily together. Before a contract is made, they can but vpon ſuppoſition (if God haue appointed them to be man and wife) pray one for another. For oft it falleth out that after many great hopes and likelihoods of proceeding in ſuch or ſuch a match, by ſome occaſion or other it is cleane broken off: but a lawfull contract knitteth ſo firme a knot as cannot be broken: ſo as a man may conclude that being contracted to a woman ſhe ſhall be his wife: and ſo may a woman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of a man. The conſideration hereof will further moue them more narrowly to obſerue what good qualities, or what other things, which may make them more louely one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are in each other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a meanes to make them before hand prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to perfome ſuch mariage duties as Gods word requireth of man and wife. For a contract giueth them aſſurance of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3442:111"/>
mariage if they liue vnto it: ſo as then they cannot but know that it is high time for them to thinke how they are to carrie themſelues, when they come to liue in houſe together: and withall to conſider, what croſſes ordinarily doe accompanie the maried eſtate, that they may be before hand prepared wiſely to paſſe them ouer, or patiently to vndergoe them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It may be a meanes of diſcouering many hidden and cloſe inconueniences, which otherwiſe would neuer come to light. For many friends fearing leſt the diſcouering of ſome euils which are carried cloſely, ſhould make a breach betwixt themſelues and their friends, will not make them knowne till they ſee ſome vrgent neceſſitie to moue them ſo to doe. Though the euill be ſuch, as being knowne would hinder mariage, yet till they ſee ſome ſure euidence, that they ſhall indeed be maried (if no iuſt exception be put in) they will hope that ſome other occaſion may fall out to hinder the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and in that reſpect conceale their exception. But becauſe a contract is the beginning of mariage, after they haue notice therof, they will not forbeare to diſcloſe what they know. For this end is it, that the contract is three ſeuerall times openly publiſhed in the Church, that if any doe know any iuſt cauſe why ſuch perſons as are contracted may not lawfully proceed to mariage, they make knowne the ſame. A commendable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome: and great pitty, that it is ſo much neglected as it is.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It may preuent many plots and practiſes of inueigling, or ſtealing away maids and widowes. For it oft falleth out, that when parents or other friends haue prouided a good match for their daughter, or for ſome other vnder their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and all things on all parts well concluded, the wedding day appointed, and all things fitted and prepared for the ſolemnizing of the wedding, ſome deſirous to foreſtall that mariage, by ſecret and cunning deuices get the bride a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a few daies before, if not on the very morning of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended wedding day, and mary her out of hand to another. That which maketh men ſo bold is, that they know a clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine mariage being conſummate ſhall ſtand firme in law.

               <p>There are two extremes contrarie to the forenamed doctrine of a contract. One of attributing too much to it: another of derogating too much from it.

Chriſtians, and ſtill is continued among vs. Though we haue neither expreſſe precept, nor particular patterne in Gods word for this manner of ſolemnizing a mariage (for there is no particular forme thereof ſet downe in the Scripture) yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreeable to the generall rules thereof, we ought in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to ſubiect our ſelues thereto.</p>

There are declared the grounds, ends, and vſes of mariage. There open proclamation is made whether any can except againſt the intended mariage. There each partie is ſolemnly charged, that if either of them doe know any impediment, why they may not lawfully be maried, to diſcloſe it. There alſo each partie is openly demanded if freely and willingly they will take one another for man and wife. There the duties of maried perſons are declared, and they ſeuerally asked whether they will ſubiect themſelues thereto or no. All which being openly profeſſed, the parent or ſome in his ſtead is called forth to giue the Bride to the Bridegroome. Then they two actually taking each other to be man and wife, and teſtifying the ſame by expreſſe words, and by mutuall pledges, the Miniſter in Gods name ioyneth them together, pronounceth them to be lawfull husband and wife, and by prayer craueth Gods bleſſing vpon the action, and vpon their perſons. Thus is the mariage conſecrated, and they two made one fleſh, that is, lawfully ioyned together by the inuiolable bond of mariage.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Great reaſon there is why mariage ſhould with ſuch honour be ſolemnized. For it is a moſt honourable thing. Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the inſtitution, ends, priuiledges, and myſterie thereof. No ordinance was more honourable in the firſt inſtitution thereof, as is euident by the <hi>Author</hi> thereof, the <hi>Place</hi> where it was inſtituted, the <hi>Time</hi> when it was inſtituted, the <hi>Perſons</hi> who were firſt maried, and the <hi>Manner</hi> of ioyning them together.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Author</hi> and firſt Inſtitutor of mariage was the Lord <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 18, 21, 22</note> God. Could there haue beene a greater, or any way a more excellent Author?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Place</hi> was Paradiſe; the moſt faire, glorious, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, honourable, commodious, and euery way moſt excellent place that euer was in this world, Place, though it be but a circumſtance, addeth much to the honour of a thing. Solemat ordinances are made in honourable places. Thus with vs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages are ſolemnized in Churches, not in priuate houſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Time</hi> was the moſt pure and perfect time that euer was in the world, when no ſinne or pollution of man had ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, euen the time of mans innocencie. Puritie addeth much to the honour of a thing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Perſons</hi> were the moſt honourable that euer were euen the firſt father and mother of all mankinde, they who had an abſolute power and dominion ouer all creatures, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:3442:115"/>
to whom all were ſubiect. None but they euer had a true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy ouer the whole world.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Manner</hi> was with as great deliberation as euer was vſed in inſtituting any ordinance. For firſt the three glorious <note place="margin">

In this conſultation this ordinance is found to be very needfull: <hi>(It is not good for man to be alone)</hi> thereupon a determination is ſet downe, to <hi>make an helpe meet for man.</hi> For the better effecting hereof the Lord proceedeth thereto very deliberatly, by ſundry ſteps, and degrees.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All the creatures that liued on the earth, or breathed in the aire, are brought before man, to ſee if an helpe meet for him might be found among them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Euery of them being thorowly viewed, and found vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, another creature is made and that out of mans ſubſtance and ſide, and after his image.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This excellent creature thus made is by the maker ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of preſented to man, to ſee how he would like it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Man manifeſting a good liking to her, ſhe is giuen to him to be his wife.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The inuiolable law of the neere and firme vnion of man and wife together is enacted.</p>
               <p>Let all the forenamed branches concerning the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of mariage expreſly recorded by the holy Ghoſt be well weighed, and we ſhall eaſily ſee that there is no ordinance now in force among the ſonnes of men ſo honourable in the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution thereof, as this.</p>

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3442:123"/>
The firſt of theſe is <hi>Loue.</hi> A louing mutuall affection muſt paſſe betwixt husband and wife, or elſe no dutie will be well perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: this is the ground of all the reſt.

                  <hi>bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> which bindeth together all thoſe duties that paſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt partie and partie.

Where <hi>loue</hi> is wanting, there euery duty will either be altogether neglected, or ſo careleſly performed, that as good not be performed at all: in which reſpect the Apoſtle willeth, that <hi>all things be done</hi>

It is like fire, which is not only hot in it ſelfe, but alſo conueigheth heat into that which is neere it: whence ariſeth a reflection of heat from one to another. Note how admirably this is ſet forth betwixt Chriſt and his Spouſe in the <hi>Song of Salomon:</hi> and it is further manifeſted in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all good husbands and wiues noted in the Scripture: they did mutually beare a very louing affection one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>

If this be the ground (as it ought to be) of their mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <note place="margin">That which in <hi>Treat.</hi> 4. §. 2. 9. 11. is ſpoken of an husbands loue and intire affection, may alſo be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in ſome reſpects to a wife: and ſo ſerue to amplifie this common mutuall dutie of loue.</note> loue, their loue will be feruent and conſtant.

               <p>This inſtance I haue the rather mentioned, becauſe in many, <note place="margin">Loue of after venters to be as intire as of former.</note> who are farre from ſetting their affection on ſtrange fleſh, their loue of a former husband or wife departed is ſo faſt fixed in their heart, as they can neuer againe ſo intirely loue any other. They who are ſo minded are not fit to be ioined with another yoke-fellow after they are looſed from one. If they mary againe, and manifeſt ſuch a minde, they plainly ſhew that they reſpect this or that perſon more then Gods ordinance. By Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance man and wife are no longer bound one to another then they liue together. Death is an abſolute diremption, and maketh an vtter diſſolution of the mariage bond. <hi>If the man</hi>

                  <hi>be dead, the wife is deliuered from the law of the man, ſo as ſhee may take another man.</hi> Which liberty is alſo giuen to the man. Being now free, if they mary another (that other being now a true husband or wife) their loue muſt be as intire to that other as it was to the former: yea, and more intire, if there were any defect in the former. For as children maried out of their parents houſe muſt not retaine ſuch a loue of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents as ſhall ſwallow vp their loue of the partie to whom they are maried, but muſt according to the law, leaue father and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3442:124"/>
mother, and cleaue to their yoke-fellow: ſo neither muſt the loue of a former husband or wife be predominant when they are maried to another. This other muſt be as cloſe clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto, as if they had neuer beene ioined to a former. The liuing husband or wife is the preſent pledge of Gods fauour. He is now thine <hi>owne</hi> husband: and ſhe is now thine <hi>owne</hi> wife: and not the partie that is dead. I denie not but the memorie of a vertuous husband or wife ought to be pretious to the ſuruiuing partie: for <hi>the memoriall of the iust is bleſſed.</hi>

This is to giue dominion to the dead ouer the liuing: which is more then the law enioyneth.</p>

               <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> husbands and wiues may in no caſe delight to <note place="margin">1. By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing things of ill report.</note> diſcouer vnto others, and ſpread abroad the infirmities, and imperfections of one another, or any thing that may tend to the diſcredit of either of them: but rather couer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale them as much as they may with a good conſcience. It is expreſſed that <note n="g" place="margin">

                  <hi>Ioſeph being a iuſt man</hi> laboured to conceale that blemiſh which he imagined to be in his wife, ſo as this may ſtand with <hi>iuſtice:</hi> yea alſo it is a part of <hi>Ioue,</hi> for <note n="h" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 8.</note>

               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>ſecond,</hi> husbands and wiues muſt not haue their <note place="margin">2. By cloſing eares againſt ill reports.</note> eares wide opened to heare euery tale and report that ſhall be brought to one againſt the other, but rather ſhew themſelues diſpleaſed and offended with them that are ready to relate things of euill report. If an husband or wife manifeſt a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe to hearken after tales and reports of one another, the deuill will ſtirre vp inſtruments enow to fill their heads with tales, and thoſe for the moſt part both friuolous and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: not only ſtrangers, but children, ſeruants, and they which are of the ſame family will euer be telling ſome tale or other, to currie fauour, as we ſpeake. But an vtter diſlike of ſuch flattering tale-bearers, will take away occaſion from them of telling vntrue, or ſlight reports.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>third,</hi> the iudgement and cenſure which husbands <note place="margin">3. By forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure raſhly.</note> and wiues giue one of another muſt either be very charitable,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:3442:135"/>
or verie ſparing. If one heare reported any notorious crime of the other, they may not be ouer-headie or haſtie to iudge and condemne, no though they thinke they ſee ſome euidence thereof, but rather ſuſpend their iudgement. This ſeemeth to be the minde of <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> though he obſerued <hi>Marie</hi> to be with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 19.</note> childe, yet would he not preſently iudge her to be a notorious adultereſſe, or condemne her for an hypocrite, vnworthie to liue, and therefore would not make her a publike example.</p>
               <p>In briefe, that husbands and wiues may be the more ſparing in cenſuring one another, they muſt not raſhly beleeue any euill report of one another, but rather ſuppreſſe all light ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as much as they can.</p>
               <p>That the iudgement which they giue one of another, may be charitable, in iudging they muſt well obſerue the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of loue, which are 1. To interpret doubtfull things in the better part. 2. To mitigate, ſo farre as truth and iuſtice will ſuffer, the faults which are euident. <hi>Michal</hi> offended againſt <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 20.</note> the firſt in an high degree, and was curſed. <hi>Abigail</hi> obſerued <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 25.</note> the latter, and was bleſſed.</p>

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the husband, while he liueth with his wife, hath the trueſt propertie in them, and the greateſt title vnto them, yet I referre this to thoſe mutuall duties which man and wife owe each to other, in three reſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe in conſcience they appertaine to the vſe of the wife, as well as of the husband.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the wife is by Gods prouidence appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ioynt gouernour with the husband of the familie, and in that reſpect ought to be an helpe in prouiding ſuch a ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the goods of this world, as are needfull for that eſtate wherein God hath ſet them, and for that charge which God hath committed to them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe the wife, if ſhe ſuruiue the husband, ought to haue ſuch a portion of thoſe goods, as are meet for her place and charge.</p>
               <p>In theſe reſpects we ſee it requiſite, yea a bounden dutie, that husband and wife, euen in a mutuall regard one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be as prouident as they can be with a good conſcience in getting, keeping, and diſpoſing competent goods and riches for the mutuall good one of another. Concerning the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands dutie in this reſpect no queſtion is made: the practiſe of all good husbands mentioned in Scripture, the care of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for their <note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8.

                  <hi>a good thing,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth as much: for that which is profitable is called good: and it is one reſpect wherein a wife is termed a <hi>good thing,</hi> that ſhe may by her prouidence and diligence bring much profit to her husband: and therefore in this, among other reſpects, the good wife which <hi>Salomon</hi> deſcribeth, is ſaid <note n="d" place="margin">

From all which, we may inferre theſe two points. Firſt, that this prouident care about outward temporall goods is lawfull, not vnbeſeeming a Chriſtian man or woman. Secondly, that it is a mutuall dutie appertaining both to husband and wife.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, how needfull the goods of this world are for preſeruation of life and health, eſtate of the family, good of Church and Common-wealth, releefe of the poore, with the like vſes, no man can be ignorant. God hath giuen them as bleſſings to his children, and that often times in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; and his children haue accordingly beene thankfull for them: ſo as a prouident care about them is not vnlawfull, but very expedient and needfull.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond, If there ſhould not be a ioint care herein, the care and paines of the one might be altogether in vaine. For ſuppoſe an husband be induſtrious, as <note n="f" place="margin">

In this mutuall prouident care of husband and wife, each of them muſt haue an eye to their owne place:

               <p>Contrary to that dutie, are theſe vices following.</p>

Many wiues are ſo violent herein, that if their deſire and humour be not ſatisfied, their husbands ſhall haue no reſt (forſooth they brought a portion, and maintained they muſt and will be; it skilleth not whether their husbands eſtate can beare it or no) in ſo much as many are forced wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly, for quietneſſe ſake, to ſuffer their eſtate to ſinke. O foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and wretched wiues! how little do they conſider that they were maried to doe their husbands good, and not euill all the daies of their life? is this to be an helpe to man? or rather is it not cleane to thwart Gods counſell, and peruert his purpoſe? can we thinke that God will forbeare, and not be auenged of them? yet much more will God be auenged of the forenamed husbands, becauſe of that image of himſelfe which he hath placed in them, and becauſe of that place and authority where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath ſet them.

reſpect the husband and wife, and are to be performed of each to other. There are other common duties which they are both iointly bound to performe to other perſons: and thoſe either <hi>members</hi> of the family, or <hi>ſtrangers</hi> comming to the family.</p>
               <p>Concerning the <hi>members</hi> of the family, though there be ſome peculiar duties belonging to the maſter, and ſome to the miſtreſſe, ſome to the father, and ſome to the mother, of which we ſhall ſpeake in their due place; yet in generall the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the family, and the ſeuerall members thereof belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the husband and wife both (if at leaſt they haue a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily) and a ioint common dutie it is to be helpfull one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> Seeing it is not neceſſarily required, that a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and wife ſhould haue a family to gouerne, for two may be maried and haue neither children nor ſeruants (as many are) and yet be true husband and wife; why is this care of a family ranked among the duties of husband and wife?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe ordinarily when two are maried they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a family, and are the gouernours thereof: ſo as though it faile in ſome particulars, yet for the moſt part it holdeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the ioint gouernment whereof I ſpeake in this place is by vertue of the mariage-bond: for if a man and a woman ſhould liue together in an houſe, and by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall conſent haue a ioint authority and gouernment, this would be very offenſiue to all that ſhould know it, or heare of it: neither were they by any ordinance of God bound to be ſo helpfull one to another as husband and wife: nor the members of a family ſo bound to ſubiect themſelues to both.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The duty whereof I ſpeake, though it be about the gouernment of a family, yet hath it reſpect to an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band as he is an husband, and to a wife as ſhee is a wife; namely, that by vertue of their mariage-bond, and neere vnion, they be helpfull one to another in well-ordering the things of the family.</p>
               <p>Whether the man ought to look to the good gouernment of
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:3442:140"/>
his houſe is a queſtion without all queſtion.

               <p>Concerning a wife, I denie not but that an husband may be in this kinde ouerburdenſome to her, by being too ioueall, as they ſpeake, and bringing gueſts too often into the houſe, eſpecially if they be gueſts of no good name; and by that meanes make her euen weary of her life: but yet for a wife to refuſe all paines in that kinde, and to be diſcontented when her husband inuites any friends, or when any come (as the three Angels did to <hi>Abraham)</hi> vnawares, argueth not a louing affection, nor a wiuelike ſubiection vnto her husband, to be in her.</p>

               <p>Contrarie is the vnmercifulneſſe of many husbands, who <note place="margin">Vices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</note> are not only hard-hearted themſelues (neuer giuing any thing vnleſſe by the law of the land they be forced, &amp; then they part <note place="margin">1. Vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the husband.</note> with that which is giuen, ſo grudgingly, as it is nothing at all acceptable to God (for <note n="n" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>God loueth a cheerfull giuer)</hi> but alſo tie their wiues hands, and ſuffer them to giue nothing. Wherein <note place="margin">2. Binding his wiues hands.</note> they bring both the cry of the poore, and alſo the groanes and griefe of a mercifull wife who is thus reſtrained, vpon their owne necks, and aggrauate their ſinne in an high degree.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the vnmercifulneſſe of many wiues is alſo contrarie to the forenamed dutie: for there are many, who though they haue libertie to giue of the common goods, and alſo allowance of their owne out of which they may giue, yet couetouſly hoord vp all they can get, giue not a pennies worth, out rather ſuffer victuals and other things to periſh in the houſe, and when they are naught to fling them away, then that any thing whilſt it is good ſhould be giuen out of the houſe. Shall not the creatures which are ſpoiled in an houſe,

The acknowledgement hereof is a maine and principall dutie, and a ground of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties. Till a wife be fully inſtructed therein and truly perſwaded thereof, no dutie can be performed by her as it ought: for ſubiection hath relation to ſuperioritie and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. The very notation of the word implieth as much. How then can ſubiection be yeelded, if husbands be not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged ſuperiors? It may be forced, as one King conquered in battell by another, may be compelled to yeeld homage to the conqueror, but yet becauſe he ſtill thinketh with himſelfe, that he is no whit inferiour, he will hardly be brought willingly to yeeld a ſubiects dutie to him, but rather expect a time when he may free himſelfe and take reuenge of the conqueror.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Courteſie is that vertue whereby a wife taketh occaſion to teſtifie her acknowledgement of her husbands ſuperiority by ſome outward obeyſance to him. <hi>Rebekah,</hi> ſo ſoone as ſhe ſaw <hi>Iſaak,</hi> whom ſhe had taken for her husband, lighted from her Camell and came to him on foot, which was a kinde of obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance. This is not ſo to be taken as if no difference were to be made betwixt the carriage of a ſeruant, or childe, and a wife: or as if a wife ſhould bow at euery word that ſhe ſpeaketh to her husband. Though in the kinde and extent of many duties the ſame things are required of wiues which are required of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and ſeruants, becauſe God hath made them all inferiours, and exacted ſubiection of all: yet in the manner and meaſure of many duties there is great difference: as in this, the obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of children and ſeruants ought to be more ſubmiſſiue, and more frequent. Yet becauſe God hath placed authority in the husband ouer his wife, ſhe is euery way to teſtifie her reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend reſpect of her husband, and therefore at ſome times, on ſome occaſions (as when he is going on a iourney for a time from her, or when he returneth home againe, or when ſhe hath a ſolemne and great ſute to make vnto him, or when he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth an eſpeciall and extraordinary fauour vnto her, or (as I haue obſerued ſuch wiues as know what beſeemeth their place, and are not aſhamed to manifeſt as much) when ſhe ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">1. A wiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like courteſie worketh a good reſpect in her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to her.</note> downe or riſeth vp from table) to declare her reuerence by ſome obeyſance. This cannot but much worke on the heart of a good and kinde husband, and make him the more to reſpect his wife, when he beholdeth this euidence of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to him. Yea it cannot but be a good patterne to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">2. It maketh her husband be honoured of others.</note> and ſeruants, and a motiue to ſtirre them vp to yeeld all ſubmiſſiue obeyſance both to her husband and to her ſelfe.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:3442:151"/>
For it may make them thus to reaſon with themſelues, ſhall <note place="margin">3.

Thus a wiues honouring of her husband by yeelding obeyſance to him, maketh both him and her ſelfe to be more honoured of others.</p>
               <p>Contrarily minded are they, who not only altogether omit <note place="margin">Contrary ſcorne in wiues.</note> this dutie, but alſo gibe and ſcoffe at the very hearing thereof, ſaying, thus wiues ſhall be made no better then children or ſeruants. But though ſcornefull dames deride theſe outward euidences of their ſubiection, yet ſuch wiues as feare the Lord ought not to be hindered thereby from doing their dutie: for by ſuch euill examples they might be diſcouraged from euery good dutie. It is ſufficient that ſuch holy women as truſted in God ſo behaued themſelues.

A wiues modeſtie therefore requireth that her appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell be neither for coſtlineſſe aboue her husbands abilitie, nor for curiouſneſſe vn beſeeming his calling. As a poore mans wife muſt not affect coſtly apparell, ſo neither Miniſters, graue Counſellours, ſage Magiſtrates, no nor conſcionable Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours wiues, hunt after new faſhions, or in light and gariſh ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell attire themſelues.

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:3442:152"/>
ſuperioritie, and ſo ſauour of reuerence. Such are the titles wherewith husbands are named in the Scripture; <note n="*" place="margin">See §. 3.</note> they are ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of honour. Such alſo are the titles which the Church (who by our Apoſtle is made a patterne for wiues in all ſubiection) giueth to her Spouſe Chriſt Ieſus, as may be gathered out of the <hi>Song of ſongs.</hi> It is likely that <hi>Sarah</hi> did vſually giue this title <hi>Lord</hi> to her husband. For hauing occaſion to thinke of him, preſently this title <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord</hi> was in her heart: which would not ſo ſuddenly haue riſen vp, if ſhe had not ordinarily vſed it. According to the vſuall titles which we giue to any, doe we in our hearts name them, when we haue occaſion to thinke of them. Among all other titles the name husband, as it is the moſt vſuall, ſo it is the fitteſt and meeteſt title. It intimateth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and ſauoureth not of niceneſſe &amp; ſingularitie, as theſe titles, <hi>Head, Guide, Maſter, Man,</hi> and the like doe: which though they be lawfull titles, becauſe the Scripture attributeth them to husbands, and they ſignifie ſuperioritie, yet becauſe they are vnuſuall and ſauour of ſingularitie, they are not ſo meet. Common vſe and practiſe hath made the addition of the husbands ſurname to this title <hi>Maſter,</hi> more meet.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6.</note> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> by this argument proueth that <hi>Sarah</hi> obeyed <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe ſhe called him <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contrarie are thoſe compellations which argue equalitie or inferioritie rather then ſuperioritie, as <hi>Brother, Coſen, Friend, Man,</hi> &amp;c. if a ſtranger be in preſence, how can he tell by this manner of compellation, that he whom thou ſpeakeſt vnto is thy husband? If he eſpie any matrimoniall familiaritie betwixt you, what can he iudge of it otherwiſe to be, lightneſſe and wantonneſſe? Remember the fearefull iſſue that had like to haue fallen out by reaſon of ſuch compellations giuen by <note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20. 2.</note>

                  <hi>Rebekah</hi> to their husbands. Not vnlike to thoſe are ſuch as theſe, <hi>Sweet, Sweeting, Heart, Sweet-heart, Loue, Ioy, Deare,</hi> &amp;c. and ſuch as theſe, <hi>Ducke, Chicke, Pigſnie,</hi> &amp;c. and husbands Chriſtian names, as <hi>Iohn, Thomas, William, Henry,</hi> &amp;c. which if they be contracted (as many vſe to contract them thus, <hi>Iack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

his wife, not ſeldome in paſſion, but vſually in ordinarie ſpeech, which are not fit to be giuen to the baſeſt men that be, as <hi>Grub, Rogue,</hi> and the like, which I am euen aſhamed to name, but that the ſins of women are to be caſt as dirt on their faces, that they may be the more aſhamed?</p>

                  </note> That excellent good wife, and notable good houſe-wife that is ſet forth by the Wiſe-man, had ſuch a conſent. For firſt, it is ſaid, <note n="b" place="margin">

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:3442:155"/>
ſhe ordereth all the things of the houſe, whereof many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are there ſpecified. Whence I gather, that her husband obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her to be a godly, wiſe, faithfull, and induſtrious woman, gaue her power and liberty to doe in the houſe-hold affaires, what ſhe thought good, (he being a publike magiſtrate, for <note n="c" place="margin">

                  <hi>he was knowne in the gates, ſitting among the Elders of the land)</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſhe vſed her liberty.</p>
               <p>A particular conſent is that which is giuen to one or more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <note place="margin">2. A particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conſent.</note> things, as that conſent <note n="d" place="margin">

               <p>This particular conſent may be <hi>expreſſed</hi> or <hi>implied.</hi> An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed conſent is when the husband manifeſteth his good liking by word, writing, meſſage, or ſigne, and that whether his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent be asked (as was noted in the example of <hi>Elkanah)</hi> or freely offered.</p>
               <p>An implicit conſent, when by any probable coniecture it may be gathered that the husbands will is not againſt ſuch a thing, <note place="margin">4. An impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit conſent,</note> though he haue not manifeſted his minde concerning that very particular. This implicit conſent may be gathered either by his ſilence when he is preſent to ſee a thing done, or otherwiſe hath knowledge thereof: or elſe when he is abſent, by his former ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage or diſpoſition in other like caſes. The Scripture accounteth an husbands ſilence, when he knoweth a thing and may, but doth not forbid it, to be a conſent: as <note n="f" place="margin">
                     <hi>Num</hi> 30. 8.</note> in the caſe of a wiues vow. For any thing we read to the contrary <note n="g" place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 10, 23.</note> the Shunemite had no other conſent to prepare a chamber for the Prophet, and to goe vnto him, then her husbands ſilence, and not forbidding it when he knew it.</p>
               <p>As for the other kinde of implicit conſent, it may be ſet forth in this following inſtance: ſuppoſe a good wife hath an husband whom ſhe knoweth by his former cariage and diſpoſition to be a pittifull and charitable man, taking all occaſions to ſhew mercy, and in his abſence there falleth out a fit and needfull occaſion of ſhewing mercy; if ſhe take that occaſion to ſhew mercy, ſhe hath an implicit conſent, for ſhe may well thinke that if her husband knew it he would approue what ſhe doth. It is to be ſuppoſed that <note n="h" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Annah</hi> vpon ſome ſuch ground vowed her childe to God.
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:3442:156"/>
For it is not likely that ſhe who would not tarry at home to weine her childe without her husbands conſent, would much leſſe vow him to the Lord (which was a farre greater matter) without ſome perſwaſion of her husbands good liking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Now that a wife may ſhew ſhe dealeth vprightly in this caſe vpon a true perſwaſion of her heart concerning her husbands minde, ſhe ought (when conueniently ſhe can) to make known to her husband what ſhe hath done: as without all queſtion <hi>Annah</hi> did; and ſo much may be gathered out of theſe words which <hi>Elkanah</hi> vttered to <hi>Annah,</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 23.</note>

Note here, how the Lord will rather depart from his owne right (as I may ſo ſpeake) then haue that order which he hath appointed betwixt man and woman broken. The Lords right, was to haue what was vowed to him performed: the order which he appointed, was to haue the wife ſubiect to her husband: rather then the wife ſhould doe that which the husband would not haue done, the Lord remitted a wiues vow in caſe her husband would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to haue it performed. Now then I demand, is the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of goods a greater matter then the performing of a vow? or hath a wife in theſe dayes more libertie then in former? if ſhe haue, by what law? was there euer vnder the Law a ſtraiter charge laid vpon wiues then this, <hi>Let wiues be ſubiect to their husbands in euerie thing.</hi>

               <p>They may not take in, or thruſt out ſeruants againſt their husbands minde. In this point, as in many other, <hi>Sarah</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted her wiue-like obedience; in that <note n="a" place="margin">

It is further noted and approued in the <note n="c" place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 22.</note> Shunemite that ſhe asked her husbands conſent about ſending a ſeruant with her.</p>
               <p>My meaning is not that ſuch wiues as haue ſeruants allowed them to attend vpon them ſhould aske their husbands con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent whenſoeuer they haue occaſion to vſe them; for their husbands by allowing them men for their attendance manifeſt their will and conſent that they may vſe them as they ſee occaſion: but that they ſhould not vſe and imploy their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants in ſuch things as they know their husbands would diſlike, except they can gaine their husbands conſent.</p>

               </head>
               <p>It is a good proofe and triall of a wiues obedience, to abſtaine from doing ſuch things as otherwiſe ſhe would doe, if her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands contrarie will did not reſtraine her: but yet that is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, there muſt be an actiue, as well as a paſſiue obedience yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. That old Law before mentioned <hi>(thy deſire ſhall be ſubiect to thine husband, and he ſhall rule ouer thee)</hi> implieth ſo much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. If ſhe refuſe to doe what he would haue her to doe, her deſire is not ſubiect to him, but to her ſelfe, neither doth he rule ouer her.</p>
               <p>This actiue part of her obedience hath reſpect</p>
               <p n="1">1. To his <hi>commandements,</hi> readily to doe what he lawfully <note place="margin">A wiues actiue obedience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth firſt her husbands commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> commands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To his <hi>reproofes,</hi> carefully to redreſſe what he iuſtly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, ſo farre ought a wife to be from thinking ſcorne to be commanded by her husband, that the very knowledge which by any meanes ſhe hath of her husbands minde and will, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ought to haue the force of a ſtraight commandement with her. This readineſſe to obey is commended in the wiues of <hi>Iaakob,</hi> to whom when <hi>Iaakob</hi> had declared what motiues he had to depart from their fathers houſe, intimating thereby that he meant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and would haue them to goe with him, yet before he parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly expreſſed his will, they readily anſwered, <hi>Whatſoeuer God</hi>

               </head>
               <p>To make this part of a wiues obedience ſomewhat more cleare, I will exemplifie it by two or three particular inſtances, recorded and approued in Gods word.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that <hi>a wife ought to be willing to dwell where her husband will haue her dwell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The wiues of <hi>Abraham, Iſaak,</hi> and <hi>Iaakob,</hi> herein manifeſted their wiue-like obedience: though their husbands brought them from their owne countrey, and from their fathers houſe, yet they refuſed not to goe with them, but dwelt in a ſtrange countrey, and that in tents.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:3442:169"/>
Note in particular what <hi>Iaakobs</hi> wiues ſay to their husband in this caſe, <hi>Is there any portion or inheritance for vs in our fathers</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>houſe?</hi> implying thereby, that ſeeing it was their husbands plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be gone, they would not any longer tarry in their fathers houſe, to looke for any more portion or inheritance there.</p>
               <p>Theſe examples doe further ſhew that if an husband haue iuſt occaſion to remoue from one country to another, and in thoſe countries from place to place, his wife ought to yeeld to goe with him, if he require it at her hands. Note what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>haue we not power to lead about a wife?</hi> That interrogation <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 5.</note> implieth a ſtrong aſſeueration. The husband then hauing power to lead about a wife from place to place, ſhe ought to ſubmit her ſelfe to that power. This clauſe <hi>(as well as other Apoſtles, and as the brethren of the Lord and Cephas)</hi> ſheweth, that this was not only a power which might be vſed, but which was vſed by huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and yeelded vnto by wiues.</p>
               <div type="question">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> The forenamed examples are extraordinary, and that vpon extraordinary occaſions.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet they may be patternes for ordinary occaſions which are lawfull and warrantable. Was it not an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary fact of <hi>Eliah</hi> to pray firſt that there might be no raine, and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 17.</note> then againe that there might be raine? yet is this propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a generall patterne to moue vs to pray for things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p>Now in laying downe this dutie I added the clauſe and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueat of <hi>iuſt occaſion,</hi> to meet both with ſuch as vpon diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, or ſuperſtition, leaue the land where the true Goſpell is maintained, and preached, and goe into idolatrous places: and alſo with ſuch wandring giddy heads as only to ſatisfie their owne humour, and to ſee faſhions, as we ſpeake, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reſt in a place, but are continually remouing from countrey to countrey, and from place to place: I thinke (to vſe the words of the Apoſtle) <hi>a wife is not vnder bondage in ſuch caſeſ.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 15.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if a man be ſent of an ambaſſage by his Prince, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: or if a Preacher or Profeſſor be called into another countrey, as <hi>Bucer</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> were into England in King <hi>Edwards</hi> daies (which to this day is vſuall in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries) or if a man be adiudged vnto long impriſonment, and
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:3442:169"/>
vpon theſe and other like occaſions ſhall require his wife to be with him, ſhe ought in dutie to yeeld vnto his demand.</p>
                  <p>Contrary is the minde and practiſe of many wiues, who <note place="margin">Contrary, when a wife makes her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band dwell where ſhe will.</note> being affected and addicted to one place more then another, as to the place where they were bred and brought vp, where their greateſt, beſt, and moſt friends dwell, and where they haue good acquaintance, refuſe to goe and dwell where their husbands calling lieth, though he require, and deſire them ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo much. Thus many husbands are forced to their great dammage for peace ſake to yeeld vnto their wiues, and ſo either to relinquiſh their calling, or to haue two houſes; whence it followeth, that ſometimes they muſt neglect their ſeruants and calling, and ſometimes be abſent from their wiues, if not from their children alſo. Some wiues pretend that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure the ſmoake of the citie, other that they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the aire of the countrie: whereas indeed their owne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and conceit ſtuffes them more then either citie ſmoake or countrie aire. I cannot call ſuch the <hi>daughters of Sarah</hi> herein: <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5, 6.</note> they are not like thoſe forenamed <hi>holy women that truſted in God, and were ſubiect to their husbands,</hi> but rather like to that light houſewife of the Leuite, who would not dwell in her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands <note place="margin">

Let this be taken for a fault, and it will be the ſooner amended.</p>

There be ſome that ſeeme to be very good wiues till they be tried by the touch-ſtone of reproofe: but then though the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe be for matter moſt iuſt, for manner moſt milde, and that in priuate betwixt their husbands and themſelues, yet they grow ſo impatient, or rather mad, as they forbeare not to giue their husbands the moſt ſcornfull ſpeeches that they can inuent, vſing withall bitter imprecations and execrations, and threaten to drowne or hang themſelues if they be croſſed of their wills.

Euill may be laid on any, and ſo they forced to beare it: but they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue it, who are content with it. Now in that he vſeth the plurall number (WE) and ſpeaking to his wife ſaith <hi>(ſhall not we receiue euill)</hi> he ſheweth that his wife ought as well as he to haue reſt contented in that poore and miſerable eſtate: For</p>

If after mariage his eſtate decay, and wax meaner then it was, ſhe is to be perſwaded that by God it was ſo ordered, and that God aimed at <hi>her</hi> humiliation as well as <hi>his:</hi> and thereupon ſhe ought in her dutifull ſubmiſſion to Gods ouer-ruling proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be patient and content: this <hi>Iob</hi> implieth vnder this phraſe, <hi>ſhall we not receiue euill at the hand of God?</hi> and vnder this, <hi>The Lord taketh away.</hi>

               <p>To know the <hi>limitation</hi> of a wiues obedience, and the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> how ſhe ought to yeeld ſubiection vnto her husband, two things muſt be conſidered:

place is to his wife in Chriſts ſtead: which is further more plainly laid downe in theſe words following, <hi>the husband is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23.</note> 
                  <hi>the head of the wife, as Chriſt is the head of the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The wiues place is intimated in theſe words, <hi>as the Church</hi>

                  <hi>is ſubiect vnto Chriſt, ſo let wiues be to their owne husbands:</hi> whereby it is cleere that the obedience which a wife perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to her husband muſt be ſuch an obedience as the Church performeth to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>From the place of an husband, I gather this generall ground concerning a wiues ſubiection, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Subiection muſt be yeelded to the husband as to Chriſt,</hi> whence will follow two concluſions, one <hi>negatiue,</hi> which is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The wife muſt yeeld no other ſubiection to her husband then what may ſtand with her ſubiection to Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other affirmatiue, which is this,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The wife muſt ſubiect her ſelfe to her husband in that manner that ſhe would or ſhould ſubiect her ſelfe to Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former is a neceſſary condition required of all inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours in their ſubiection, and obedience (as I ſhewed <note n="*" place="margin">Treat. 1. §. 6.</note> before) much more in a wiues ſubiection to her husband, becauſe there is of all vnequals <note n="*" place="margin">See §. 4. of this Treat.</note> the leaſt diſparity betwixt husbands and wiues.</p>
               <p>Hence for our preſent purpoſe, I gather theſe two other more particular concluſions, The firſt whereof is this,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>If God expreſly command the wife any duty, and her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band will not by any meanes giue conſent that ſhe ſhall doe it, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid her, ſhe may and ought to doe it without, or againſt his conſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two cautions are warily to be obſerued about this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion: <note place="margin">2. Cautions for limiting a wiues per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting to doe that which her husband for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That the wife be ſure that God hath commanded her that which ſhe doth without or againſt her husbands conſent. If ſhe doubt, then ſhe muſt ſtay, and for beare till ſhe gaine his conſent. When two oppoſite caſes meet together, and the one be doubtfull, the other plaine and expreſſe: the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full caſe muſt giue place to the more euident. Now the law of ſubiection is indefinite, <hi>thy deſire ſhall be ſubiect to thine huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen</hi> 3 16.</note> the extent of it is generall, <hi>in euery thing;</hi> the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation and exception is <hi>in the Lord;</hi> wherefore if the wife
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:3442:174"/>
be not ſure that that which her husband forbiddeth her is <hi>againſt the Lord,</hi> ſhe muſt forbeare to doe it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond caution is that ſhe vſe all good meanes ſhe can to gaine her husbands conſent, before ſhe doe, euen that which is commanded, againſt his conſent. Thus ſhall ſhe teſtifie her ſubiection both to God and her husband. To God, in that nothing can keepe her from doing his expreſſe commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſhe will rather offend her husband then God, when one of them muſt needs be offended. To her husband, in that ſhe putteth it to the vttermoſt puſh, and vſeth all the meanes ſhe can to auoid his offence, in ſo much as he himſelfe might ſee (if the god of this world blinded not his eies) that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is no way giuen on her part, but meerely taken on his.</p>
               <p>For proofe of this, it is without all contradiction true, that the wife is not bound to greater ſubiection vnto her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band then the ſubiect is vnto the magiſtrate: but a ſubiect ought not to forbeare a bounden duty commanded of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his gouernour forbids him. Inſtance the example of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> who daily made his praiers to God, though the King had made a ſolemne decree that <hi>none ſhould aske any petition of God or man within thirty daies but of the king.</hi> Inſtance alſo the Apoſtles, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> who preached the Goſpel, thogh they were expreſly forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>Though the Scripture be plentifull in affording examples of wiues ſubiection, yet it is very ſparing in recording exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of thoſe who in ſuch warrantable caſes refuſed to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, leſt wiues from thence ſhould take too great liberty.</p>
               <p>Some are recorded, but ſuch as are either extraordinary, or not euery way inſtifiable. <hi>Abigails</hi> example was extraordinary, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 18.</note> and therfore not imitable but in ſuch like extraordinary caſes.</p>
               <p>The example of <hi>Rebekah,</hi> which may ſeeme ſomewhat more <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 6.</note> pertinent, is not euery way to be iuſtified. For though the thing which ſhe intended were for the ſubſtance of it very good, and ought to haue beene done, namely the <hi>bleſſing of Iaakob,</hi> (for God foreſhewed that the bleſſing appertained to <hi>Iaakob,</hi> in that he ſaid, <hi>The elder ſhall ſerue the younger)</hi> yet <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 23.</note> becauſe ſhe put not her husband in minde of Gods word, nor laboured to perſwade him to fulfill the ſame, but went about the matter deceitfully, ſhe cannot therein be iuſtified. But in
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:3442:175"/>
the generall this example ſheweth that Gods word muſt be yeelded vnto rather then an husbands will.</p>
               <p>For better application of this point I will lay downe ſome particular inſtances agreeable to Gods word. Suppoſe a wife well inſtructed in the true religion be maried to an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous or profane husband, and he without any iuſt cauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid her to goe to the Church, eſpecially on the Lords daies, to pray in Engliſh, to read the word, to teach her children the principles of religion, to reſtore that which ſhe hath vniuſtly and fraudulently gotten, with the like, ſhe may, and muſt doe them notwithſtanding.</p>

               <p>The other particular concluſion is this, that</p>

                  <hi>If an husband require his wife to doe that which God hath forbidden ſhe ought not to doe it.</hi>

               <p>Two cautions like the former are likewiſe to be obſerued <note place="margin">2. Cautions for limiting a wiues refuſing to doe that which her husband com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> about this point.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that ſhe be ſure (being truly informed by Gods word) that that which ſhe refuſeth to doe at her husbands command, is forbidden by God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that ſhe firſt labour with all meekeneſſe and by all good meanes that ſhe can to diſſwade her husband from vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and preſſing that vpon her, which with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhe cannot doe.</p>
               <p>A like proofe may be brought for this as was for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: for we know that a wife is not bound vnto greater ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to her husband then a ſonne is vnto a father: but a ſonne may in the caſe propounded forbeare to doe that which his father requireth and commandeth him to doe: inſtance the approued example of <hi>Ionathan,</hi> who refuſed to bring <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 31.</note>

               <p>To exemplifie this in ſome particulars as I did the former, If an husband ſhall command his wife to goe to Maſſe, to a ſtage play, to play at dice, to proſtitute her body to vncleannes, to goe gariſhly and whoriſhly attired, to ſell by ſcant weights, ſhort meaſures, or the like, ſhe ought not to doe ſo.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The ſecond generall concluſion concerning the manner of a
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:3442:176"/>
wiues ſubiection, which was gathered from the place of an husband, was this, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The wife muſt ſubiect her ſelfe to her husband in that manner, that ſhe would or ſhould ſubiect her ſelfe to Chriſt.</hi> The particle <hi>As</hi> in this clauſe <hi>(as vnto the Lord)</hi> importeth ſo much.</p>
               <p>This verie concluſion is alſo inferred out of the <hi>place</hi> of a wife: In the ſame place that the Church is to Chriſt, a wife is to an husband: therefore ſuch ſubiection as the Church yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to Chriſt, muſt a wife yeeld to her husband; which the verie words of the Apoſtle doe expreſly affirme. Now we <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 24.</note> know that euerie Chriſtian wife in her particular ought to yeeld that obedience to Chriſt which the Church in generall doth: therefore alſo ſhe muſt yeeld ſuch ſubiection to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band as ſhe ſhould to Chriſt.</p>
               <div type="question">
                  <p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea: becauſe in his office he is in Chriſts ſtead, though in his heart an enemie. In this caſe will the wiſdome, patience, and obedience of a wife be beſt tried. It is noted of the Church, that ſhe is a Lilly among thornes. She remaineth <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 2.</note> Lilly-like, white, ſoft, pleaſant, amiable, though ſhe be ioyned with thornes, which are ſcraggie, prickly, ſharpe: ſo a wife muſt be milde, meeke, gentle, obedient, though ſhe be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a crooked, peruerſe, profane, wicked husband: thus ſhall her vertue and grace ſhine forth the more clearely, euen as the ſtars ſhine forth moſt brightly in the darkeſt night. Among wiues <hi>Abigail</hi> deſerueth great praiſe, that forgot not her dutie, though ſhe were maried to a churliſh, couetous, drunken ſot, a verie <hi>Nabal</hi> in name and deed. As for thoſe who take occaſion from the wickedneſſe of their husbands to neglect their dutie, they adde to their croſſe a curſe: for a croſſe it is to haue a bad husband, but to be a bad wife is a ſinne, which pulleth downe a curſe. Let wiues therefore remoue their eyes from the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their husbands perſon, to the condition of his place: and by vertue thereof, ſeeing he beareth Chriſts image, <hi>be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to him as vnto Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This generall concluſion might be applied to the <hi>matter</hi> of

ſubiection as well as to the <hi>manner,</hi> for the Church acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth Chriſt her ſuperiour, feareth him inwardly, reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him outwardly, obeyeth him alſo both by forbearing to doe what he forbiddeth, and alſo by doing what he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, which points hauing beene before diſtinctly and largely handled and applied to wiues, I will not repeat them againe.

The Apoſtle requireth it of all <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 2.</note> Chriſtians as a generall ſawce to ſeaſon all other duties: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a peculiar maner is it needfull for inferiours: moſt of all for wiues, becauſe there are <note n="*" place="margin">See before §. 4.</note> many prerogatiues appertaining to their place, which may ſoone make them thinke they ought not to be ſubiect, vnleſſe they be humbly minded.

But <hi>the other</hi> haue reſpect to Chriſts ordinance, whereby their husbands are made their head, and to his word and will, whereby they are commanded ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>Anſw. 1.

               <p>From that extent I gather theſe two concluſions:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A wife muſt labour to bring her iudgement and will to her husbands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Though in her iudgement ſhe cannot thinke that moſt meet which her husband requireth, yet ſhe muſt yeeld to it in practiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the former of theſe, I ſay not ſimply that a wife is bound to bring her iudgement to the bent of her husbands; for he may be deceiued in his iudgement, and ſhe may ſee his error, and then vnleſſe her vnderſtanding ſhould be blinded, ſhe cannot conceiue that to be true which he iudgeth ſo: but I ſpeake of endeuour (when ſhe hath not ſure and vndeniable grounds to the contrary) to ſuſpect her iudgement when its contrary to her husbands, and to thinke ſhe may be in an error, and thereupon not be too per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory and reſolute in contradicting her husbands opinion. This ſubmiſſion euen of her iudgement reſpecteth not only things neceſſarie, for which her husband hath an expreſſe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate warrant out of the Scripture, but alſo things doubtfull &amp; indifferent: for euen ſo farre doth this clauſe <hi>(in euery thing)</hi> extend: and the ſubiection of a wife reſpecteth not her practiſe only, but her iudgement and opinion alſo: which if ſhe can bring to the lawfulneſſe and meetneſſe of that which her husband re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:3442:180"/>
ſhe will much more cheerefully performe it. To this purpoſe (as I take it) may be applied that exhortation of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle vnto women, that they <hi>learne in ſilence with all ſubiection:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11.</note> which though it be principally meant of learning in the Church, yet it excludeth not her learning at home of her husband: for in the next words he addeth, <hi>I ſuffer not a woman to vſurpe authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer the man, but to be in ſilence.</hi>

               <p>That theſe two concluſions are rightly and iuſtly gathered from the forenamed ground I proue by like concluſions which the holy Ghoſt inferreth vpon the like ground. It is euident that Chriſt Ieſus, euen incarnat and made fleſh, was in the roome and ſtead of his father, whereupon Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Philip</hi> that deſired to ſee the father, <hi>he that hath ſeene me hath ſeene the father:</hi> Now marke what Chriſt thence inferreth both on <note place="margin">

                  <hi>you, heareth me,</hi> and on the other, <hi>he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me.</hi> On this ground it was that God ſaid to <hi>Samuel</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the people that reiected his gouernment, they haue not caſt <hi>thee away, but they haue caſt me away.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To apply this reaſon, I hope ſuch wiues as liue vnder the Goſpell haue ſo much religion and piety in them as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, it becommeth them well to be ſubiect vnto the Lord Chriſt Ieſus: here then learne one eſpeciall and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part of ſubiection vnto Chriſt, which is to be ſubiect
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:3442:182"/>
vnto your husbands: thus ſhall you ſhew your ſelues to be the wiues of the Lord Chriſt, as the Apoſtle ſaith of obedient ſeruants, <hi>they are the ſeruants of God.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Againe I hope none are ſo void of all religion and piety as to refuſe to be ſubiect vnto Chriſt: here then take notice, that if wilfully yee refuſe to be ſubiect to your husbands, yee wilfully refuſe to be ſubiect to Chriſt: fitly on this ground may I apply that to wiues, which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, <hi>whoſoeuer reſiſteth the power and authority of an husband,</hi>

               <p>A ſtrong motiue is this firſt motiue.

               <p>This metaphor ſheweth that to his wife he is as the head of a naturall body, both more <hi>eminent</hi> in place, and alſo more <hi>excellent</hi> in dignity: by vertue of both which, he is a ruler and gouernour of his wife. Nature teacheth vs that this is true of the head of a naturall body: and the Apoſtle by intituling an husband, <hi>an head,</hi> teacheth vs that it is as true of an husband: whence it followeth, that it ſtandeth with common equity, and with the light of nature, that the wife ſhould be ſubiect to her husband.

As monſtrous, and much more monſtrous is it for a wife to be aboue her husband: and as great, yea and greater diſturbance and ruine would fall on that family.

                  </note> Chriſt herein, addeth an edge vnto that former reaſon: in being an head, he is like Chriſt. So as there is a kinde of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip and copartnerſhip betwixt Chriſt, and an husband: they are brethren in office, as two kings of ſeuerall places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> There is no equality betwixt Chriſt the Lord from heauen, and an earthly husband: the diſparity betwixt them is infinite.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yet there may be ſimilitude, reſemblance, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip: inequality is no hinderance to theſe. Two kings may be more different in eſtate then a ſubiect and a king; yet thoſe two kings brethren and fellowes in office. There may be a reſemblance where there is no parity, and a likeneſſe where there is no equality. The glorious and bright Sunne in the firmament, and a dimme candle in an houſe, haue a kinde of fellowſhip, and the ſame office, which is to giue light: yet there is no equality betwixt them. So then an husband re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth not only the head of a naturall body, but alſo the glorious image of Chriſt, and is that to his wife which Chriſt is to his Church.</p>
               <p>To apply this point, marke how from it two poſitions (wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be noted) doe ariſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Subiection is due to an husband as well as to Chriſt.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Subiection due to an husband as well as to Chriſt.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay not <hi>as great,</hi> becauſe of the difference in glory: but <hi>as well,</hi> becauſe of the likeneſſe in office. A Conſtable (though a poore meane man) muſt be obeyed as well as an high ſherife: A beggars childe muſt obey his father, as well as a kings
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:3442:183"/>
childe. Such wiues therefore who are not ſubiect, wrong their husbands, as well as they wrong Chriſt who are not ſubiect to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They who by their ſubiection maintaine the honour of their husbands place, maintaine thereby the honour of Chriſts place:</hi> and againe by the rule of contraries, <hi>They who by refuſing to be ſubiect impeach the honour of their husbands place, impeach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the honour of Chriſts place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The obedience of a poore mans childe or ſeruant iuſtifieth that obedience which kings children and ſeruants owe their father and ſoueraigne: and ſo on the contrary, diſobedience in meane ones, diſhonoureth the place of great ones.</p>
               <p>The argument of <hi>Memucan</hi> drawne from the greater to the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſt.</hi> 1. 16.</note> leſſe (in theſe words, <hi>Vaſhty the Queene hath not done wrong to the king only, but alſo to all the princes, and all the people)</hi> may be applied from the leſſe to the greater. Diſobedient wiues doe wrong not only to their owne particular husbands, but alſo to all heads, euen to Chriſt the head of the Church.</p>
               <p>If a naturall body, and the Church were flexible, and could be ſeduced, and drawne to preſume, and rebell againſt their heads, the ill example of wiues were enough to moue them thereunto, for, as much as in them lieth, they by example ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them.</p>
               <p>From the laſt forenamed poſitions (viz. that <hi>the obedience of a good wife maintaineth the honour of Chriſts place,</hi> and on the contrary ſide that <hi>the diſobedience of an ill wife impaireth the honour thereof)</hi> I may iuſtly inferre two other concluſions.</p>

of God in his eternall counſell, redeemed of Chriſt by his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud, and effectually called by the Goſpell of faluation, Gods ſpirit working inwardly and powerfully vpon them, thoſe very ſoules of iuſt and perfect men now triumphing in heauen, not excepted: note how this Church is deſcribed in the 26, and 27. verſes.

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Wiues are as much bound to be ſubiect to their husbands, as the Church to Chriſt.</hi> Elſe why ſhould this example be thus ſet before them, and preſſed vpon them? why are husbands ſet in Chriſts ſtead, and reſembled to him?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A wiues ſubiection to her husband, anſwerable to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſubiection vnto Chriſt, is an euidence that ſhe is of the Church,</hi> guided by the ſame Spirit that the Church is. For it cannot be performed by the power of nature, it is a ſupernaturall worke, and ſo an euidence of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ô Chriſtian wiues, as your husbands by their place reſemble Chriſt, ſo doe you by your practiſe reſemble the Church. Of the two this is the more commendable: for that is a dignitie, this a vertue: but true vertue is much more glorious then any dignitie can be.</p>
               <p>Theſe reaſons being well poiſed, and the force of them all ioyned together, they cannot but worke on the ſtouteſt ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke that is: wherefore if this point of ſubiection ſeeme to be too bitter a pill to be well digeſted, let it be ſweetned with the ſyrupe of theſe reaſons, and it will much better be ſwallowed, and haue the more kindly worke.</p>

For which end it is meete that husbands lay it

downe for a rule, neuer to rebuke their wiues when they are in paſſion. Paſſion raiſeth a darke miſt before the eies of reaſon; which, while it remaineth, keepeth reaſon from giuing any good direction. Yea paſſion is as a fire, and it ſo incenſeth a man, and diſtempereth him, that in his diſorder he can keepe no meane or meaſure. Howſoeuer a man be not able to rule himſelfe when paſſion is ſtirred vp, yet, if before hand while <hi>his eie is ſingle, and his whole body light,</hi> while he is <hi>in tune</hi> (as we <note place="margin">

For if once he begin to doe a thing in paſſion, the leaſt prouocation that can be, will be as bellowes to blow vp that fire into a flame.</p>
                  <p>In regard of the violence of paſſion (wherein women by <note place="margin">Rebuke to be put off while a wife is in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> reaſon of the weakneſſe of their iudgement are for the moſt part moſt violent) it is alſo the part of a wiſe man to forbeare this duty of reprouing his wife euen when ſhe is in paſſion. For as it is needfull that he ſhould be in caſe well to giue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, ſo as needfull it is that ſhe ſhould be in caſe well to take a rebuke.

               <p>Contrary is the indiſcretion of husbands who regard nor place, nor perſons, nor time, nor temper of themſelues or their wiues, nor any other circumſtance in reprouing, but like <hi>Saul</hi> (who at a table where a great feaſt was, in preſence of his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles

               <p>Moſt husbands are forward enough to reproue, but few doe it in meekneſſe, and moderation. They cannot doe it but in company, nor without bitter words. Many in rebuking their wiues, ſticke not to vſe all the euill termes that they can thinke of, euen ſuch as tend not only to their wiues diſhonour, but alſo to their owne and their childrens infamy. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe they neuer rebuke but when they are in paſſion, and ſo ſcarſe know what they doe: whereby alſo they ſtirre vp paſſion in their wiues, and yet for all that refraine not any whit the more, but rather grow more violent: as when the heat of two fires meet together, the flame muſt needs be the greater. This being the prepoſterous practiſe of many husbands, is it any maruell that ordinarily ſo little good, and ſo much hurt is done by reprouing? Nay, would it not be a wonder, if any good, and no hurt ſhould be done thereby? This therefore though it be a duty, yet a dutie rarely and with great moderation to be vſed.</p>

               <p n="2">2. He is bound to beare with his wife more then with any other, becauſe of that neere coniunction which is betwixt them: he that cannot beare with his wife, <hi>his fleſh,</hi> can beare with no bodie. The reaſon alleaged by the Apoſtle to moue a man to dwell with his wife according to knowledge, and to giue honour to her, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this phraſe, <hi>as to the weaker veſſell,</hi> ſheweth that this is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar dutie belonging to an husband, wherein, and whereby he <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7.</note>

may both manifeſt his knowledge and wiſdome, and alſo doe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his wife. For why is he put in minde of her weakneſſe, but to ſhew he ſhould beare with her?</p>
               <p>As that phraſe intimateth the dutie, ſo alſo it intimateth a good reaſon to inforce it. For pretious things, whereof we make high account, the weaker they be, the more tenderly, and charily are they handled, as Cheney diſhes, and chriſtall glaſſes: and of all parts of the bodie, the eye is moſt tenderly handled. Now what things, what perſons are more deare and pretious then a wife? yet withall ſhe is a weake veſſell: therefore ſhe is much to be borne withall.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is a time of weakneſſe, wherein the woman can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well prouide for her ſelfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe her weakneſſe is ioyned with much paine: the <note place="margin">The paines of womens tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.</note> paine of a women in trauell is the greateſt paine that ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is endured by any for the time: none know it ſo well as they that feele it: and many husbands becauſe they are not ſubiect thereto, thinke but lightly of it: but if we duly weigh <note place="margin">

And as for a nurſe to tend her, they thinke their Maid will ſerue the turne wel enough: they need not be at the charges to bring a Nurſe into the houſe. In regard of conuenient lodging ſome will not ſticke to ſay, Cannot my wife be brought to bed in a roome without a chimney as well as the Virgin <hi>Mary?</hi> Why ſhould my wife need more things then ſhe did?

               <p n="1">1. In that before any mention is made of thoſe things <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11.</note> which ſhe did, it is ſaid, <hi>The heart of her husband doth ſafely truſt in her.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. In that, after all her good deedes are reckoned vp, it is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Uerſ.</hi> 28.</note> ſaid, <hi>Her husband praiſeth her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this patterne it is meete that other husbands (whoſe wiues are wiſe and faithfull) ſhould deale with their wiues: that in the houſe they might haue the more honour of children and ſeruants: and that out of the houſe they might giue the better tryall of their charity.</p>
               <p>For conſidering the many excellent promiſes that are made to workes of mercy and charity, and the many terrible threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings that are denounced not onely againſt ſuch as exerciſe cruelty, but alſo againſt ſuch as ſhew no mercy: conſidering alſo that wiues together with their husbands, are <hi>heires of the</hi>

                  <hi>grace of life,</hi> it is very needfull yea euen neceſſary, that they ſhould manifeſt their faith by ſome worke of mercy and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Now vnleſſe her husband doe giue vnto her ſomething at her owne diſcretion to beſtow on others, true and through
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:3442:213"/>
try all of her mercifull and charitable minde cannot be made. If ſhe giue of that which her husband hath reſerued to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as her giuing is vnlawfull, ſo ſhe may be thought liberall, not becauſe ſhe is mercifull, but becauſe notwithſtanding her liberality ſhe parteth with nothing of her owne: yea though ſhe haue a generall conſent to giue as ſhe ſeeth cauſe of the common goods of the family, yet is not that ſo ſure and ſound a tryall of her charity, and mercifulneſſe, as if ſhe had ſomething of her owne which ſhe might retaine or giue away as pleaſeth her ſelfe; and what ſhe giues not away, lay vp as her owne ſtocke proper to her ſelfe. For there is naturally ſuch a ſelfe loue in man, and a deſire to keepe that which is proper to ones ſelfe, that he is very loath to part with any of it, vnleſſe conſcience and grace alter this corruption of nature, and ſo moue him readily to lay out ſomething on charitable vſes. But otherwiſe of that which in whole or in part belongeth to another (be that other, husband, parent, maſter, friend, or any elſe) he is eaſily moued to be liberall and bountifull: a man will willingly cut a large thong (as we ſpeake) out of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers leather.</p>
               <p>It is knowne that many children and ſeruants, who, when they come to be poſſeſſers of their owne, are very niggards and miſers, haue beene liberall of their parents and maſters goods vnto the poore. Yea parteners in a ſtocke will be much more forward in giuing away that which is common with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, then that which is proper to each of them. The trueſt triall of a mercifull and charitable heart lieth in the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which is proper to ones ſelfe.</p>
               <p>It is therefore meet vpon this very ground, that an husband ſhould according to his ability let his wife haue ſome ſtocke, and portion of her owne, free to her ſelfe to diſpoſe as ſhe ſeeth good: intimating vnto her that the principall end why he prouideth ſo plentifully for her, is, that ſhe may ſhew forth the fruits of her faith by ſome workes of charity: and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her ſo to doe. Many religious, wiſe, kinde husbands thus doe: ſome giuing quarterly allowance in money to their wiues, others giuing their wiues power to receiue a certaine portion of rent out of certaine lands or houſes; others making
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:3442:213"/>
their wiues an abſolute eſtate of ſome inheritance, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them to receiue the profits and reuenewes thereof; others giuing them certaine fees of their offices, or of their trade; others, that are poore, ſuffering them to worke for themſelues, &amp; diſpoſe their earnings as they ſee cauſe: ſome one way, ſome another: euery one in his place beſt knoweth the meanes how to gratifie his wife in this kinde: it ſhall be ſufficient for me to haue laide downe the generall rule.</p>

                     </gap> can be, and for continuance, conſtant, and ſo like to Chriſt loue.

                  <p>Thus ought husbands with all tenderneſſe, and mildneſſe <note place="margin">Husbands muſt deale tenderly with their wiues.</note> to deale with their wiues, as we haue before noted in many particulars: only this example of a mans ſelfe I thought good to ſet before husbands, as a liuely patterne wherein they might behold a preſident without exception, going before them, and whereby they might receiue excellent direction for the better performing of the particulars before noted.</p>

               </head>
               <p>To the ſame purpoſe that Chriſts example tendeth, tendeth alſo the patterne of a mans ſelfe. Great is the affection that a man beareth to himſelfe, to his owne fleſh, his owne bodie: he neuer hateth, but euer loueth himſelfe: no ſore, no diſeaſe, no paine, no ſtinch that the fleſh bringeth to a man, can make him hate it: but rather all manner of infirmities doe make him the more to pitty, tender, and cheriſh it. This is a worke of nature: the moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh, and barbarous, that euer were, doe it. Now a wife being to a man as his bodie and his fleſh (for <hi>they two are one fleſh)</hi> and God hauing commanded men to <hi>loue their wiues as their owne bodies,</hi> theſe concluſions will neceſſarily follow from this motiue:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that loueth not his wife is more caried with the inſtinct of nature, then with the expreſſe charge of the God of nature. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures inſtinct moueth him to loue his bodie. But Gods expreſſe charge moueth him not, to loue his wife.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that loueth not his wife is worſe then an infidell and a barbarian, yea then a very beaſt: for all theſe loue their owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and their owne fleſh: but a wife (by Gods ordinance) is as ones bodie, and his fleſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He <hi>that loueth his wife loueth himſelfe:</hi> the Apoſtle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>verſ.</hi> 28.</note> in theſe very words layeth downe this concluſion: from whence by the rule of contraries this alſo will follow, <hi>He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not his wife, loueth not himſelfe.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. He that loueth not his wife cannot but bring woe and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe vpon himſelfe. For the damage and miſchiefe which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth on a wife, through any neglect of dutie on her husband part, followeth alſo on him: as the miſchiefe which followeth on the bodie through any negligence of the head, lighteth alſo on the head.</p>

Where Chriſt forbiddeth an exceſſiue loue in children to <note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>brethren,</hi> whereby he incurred their enuie and hatred, which he would neuer haue done, if he had not loued his father: and hauing beene long abſent from his father, when by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence there was offered an occaſion for him to meet with his brethren, one of his firſt queſtions to them was about their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 9.</note> and haue him dwell with him: and while his father was in the way he went out to meet him, and at firſt ſight fell on his neck, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 29.</note> and wept a good while (a token of great affection.)</p>
               <p>That loue which naturally parents beare to their children, <note place="margin">Reaſons. 1. Equitie.</note> ought in equitie to breed in children a loue to their parents. For loue deſerueth loue: and moſt vnworthy are they to be loued, who cannot loue againe. The loue of parents aboue all others is to be anſwered with loue on childrens part to the vttermoſt of their power, becauſe it is free, great, and conſtant.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there is a neceſſitie of loue in children to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <note place="margin">2 Neceſſitie.</note> leſt for want thereof, their ſubiection (which of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ought to be moſt free) ſhould turne into ſlauiſh ſeruitude.</p>
               <p>This ought children the rather to labour after, becauſe by nature they are nothing ſo prone to loue their parents, as their parents are to loue them. Loue is weightie, and, as weighty things, it deſcendeth. Children therefore with conſcience of dutie muſt labour to make ſupply of this defect, and helpe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by grace. I denie not but naturally there is in children a greater loue to their parents, then to others: yet in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the heat of parents loue to them, their loue to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents is but cold. Wherfore as the heat of the Sun ſhining much and long on a ſtone wall, draweth a reflection of heat from that wall: ſo the hot beames of parents loue, which with
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:3442:226"/>
feruency and conſtancy is caſt on children, ought to prouoke and ſtirre vp children to ſend forth a reflection of loue on their parents.</p>
               <p>Two extreames are contrary to this affection of loue.</p>
               <p>One is <hi>want of naturall affection,</hi> which is a vice moſt odious <note place="margin">

               <p>Thus we ſee that parents authority is very large: there is no reſtraint of it but Gods contrary command, whereof a childe muſt be aſſured, if he refuſe to obey his parent in any thing.</p>
               <p>It is not enough for a childe to ſay I haue thus long, and in thus many things obeyed my parent, I hope in ſome things if I haue mine owne will, I may be excuſed.

               <p>Two things are to be laboured after by children for attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to this <hi>extent</hi> of obedience <hi>in all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p>This ſubiection of iudgement and will is to be yeelded in all the particular caſes of obedience which were <note n="*" place="margin">§. 13. 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>As the diſtinct duties of children haue beene ſet forth, ſo I thinke it requiſite to declare diſtinctly who the parties be to whom thoſe duties are to be performed. Theſe principally are the naturall parents, both <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Mother.</hi> Seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuch as are in the place of parents.</p>
               <p>The firſt point then to be noted is, that children beare an equall reſpect to both their naturall parents, and performe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to both alike. The law expreſly mentioneth both, <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</hi> Well may we thinke that there was ſome iuſt and vrgent cauſe, that the law which ſo briefly vnder as few words as well could be, compriſeth exceeding much matter, ſhould expreſly mention <hi>father</hi> and <hi>mother,</hi> when as there is one word, <hi>parent,</hi> which includeth both. Now what other reaſon can be rendred then the point in hand?</p>
               <p>It is worthy to be noted, how the Apoſtle contenteth not himſelfe to haue named <hi>parents,</hi> which implieth both, but alſo annexeth the expreſſe words of the law, which in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſetteth downe, <hi>father and mother.</hi> It is expreſly ſet downe of <hi>Iaakob</hi> that he obeyed <hi>his father and his mother.</hi> Among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">

               <p n="1">1. Both parents are vnder God a like meanes of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens <note place="margin">Reaſons.</note> being. Children come out of the ſubſtance of both alike.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The care and pains of both for the good of the children is very great: I know not of whether the greater. The mothers paines and care in bringing forth the childe is indeed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and it may be alſo the greater in bringing vp the childe, eſpecially while it is young, at leaſt if ſhe giue it ſucke her ſelfe: yet afterwards the fathers exceedeth in prouiding fit calling,
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:3442:253"/>
ſufficient meanes of maintenance, yea and portion or inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for it, and that after he himſelfe is dead. Thus one way or other the childe is equally bound to both: and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods law maketh no difference betwixt them.</p>

               <p>This ſheweth againe, that vndutifull children, as they doe not that which is right, but rather wrong vnto their parents; ſo they highly diſpleaſe God: they may be ſure therefore not to eſcape vnpuniſhed, though their parents, through ouer-much indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, ſhould let them alone: inſtance the two impious children of <hi>Elie, Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas:</hi> and the two rebellious children of <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 34. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 9. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 25.</note>

               <p n="1">1. That it is no arbitrary matter left to childrens diſcretion <note place="margin">Childrens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to parents is, 1. No arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing.</note> whether they will obey their parents or no: but a matter whereunto in conſcience they are bound, euen as they owe alleageance to God himſelfe the great law-giuer: ſo as in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting dutie to parents, children ſinne euen againſt God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: for the ſame God who hath commanded vs to honour himſelfe, hath commanded vs to <hi>honour father and mother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That this is a <hi>perpetuall</hi> and a <hi>generall</hi> law: a law where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <note place="margin">2. An eternall law, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to all children.</note> all children of all times, places, ſexes, eſtates and degrees alwaies haue beene, ſtill are, and euer ſhall be bound. For the morall law is of that extent: it is <hi>generall</hi> for all perſons: <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall</hi> for all times. Therefore no children may thinke to be exempted from it.</p>

                  <p>Anſw. There may be ſome difference both in ſome <hi>parts</hi> of ſubiection, and alſo in the <hi>manner</hi> of ſubiection betwixt ſuch children as remaine vnder their parents gouernment, and ſuch as are freed from it: but yet ſo long as a childe hath a parent, of what age or eſtate ſo euer he be, he oweth an <hi>honour</hi> vnto his parent. <note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>Ioſeph</hi> when he was a great Gouernour of Egypt, a man growne, hauing wife and children, yet performed the honour of <hi>reuerence, obedience,</hi> and <hi>recompence</hi> vnto his father. <note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 19. 3.

emption from their dutie to parents. If any may, he muſt be either the law-maker himſelfe, or one greater then he, one that hath power ouer him. Now God is the author and giuer of that law, <hi>God ſpake all theſe words,</hi> &amp;c. But is any greater then <note place="margin">

                  <p>Hence then I inferre theſe two concluſions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Popes diſpenſation is nothing worth: they who make it to be of force, muſt make him greater then God, which is a horrible blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though parents themſelues ſhould not exact dutie of their children, yet children were bound to performe dutie to them, becauſe of Gods charge. To this therefore are children to looke. This ſheweth that there is no leſſe paine hanging ouer the heads of the tranſgreſſors of this charge, then the curſe of the law, eternall condemnation.</p>

Now of all to whom we are firſt and moſt bound, and to whom we owe our firſt dutie, our parents are the perſons. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who are rebellious againſt their parents, and refuſe to doe their dutie to them, will hardly performe dutie to any other.

               <p>Great reaſon there is why this affection ſhould be faſt fixed in the heart of parents towards their children. For great is that paine, paines, coſt, and care, which parents muſt vndergoe
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:3442:260"/>
for their children. But if loue be in them, no paine, paines, coſt, or care, will ſeeme too much. Herein appeareth the wiſe prouidence of God, who by nature hath ſo faſt fixed loue in the hearts of parents, as if there be any in whom it aboundeth not, he is counted vnnaturall. If loue did not abound in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, many children would be neglected and loſt. For if pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents look not to their children, who will? If none looke to them, they muſt needs periſh: for they are not able to helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. As God by nature hath planted <hi>loue</hi> in all parents, ſo Chriſtians ought euen for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake, to nouriſh, increaſe, and blow vp this fire of loue, that they may thereby be made more forward to doe euery duty with cheerefulneſſe. The more feruent loue is, the more readily will euery duty be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. <note place="margin">As I haue heretofore laid downe <hi>Loue</hi> a fountaine of wiues, husbands, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens duties; ſo muſt I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue my courſe, and ſet it forth as the fountaine of parents duties. For the Scripture hath noted it as a dutie belonging to all and euery of them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I might not omit it in any of them. Yet let not any thereupon thinke, that the ſame point is oft handled, and repeated againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. For according to the ſeuerall parties, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall relation they haue to others, there are ſeuerall fruits of loue: euen as the ſame moiſture of the earth cauſeth ſeuerall and diuers fruits, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall kindes of plants that receiue that moiſture. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the ſeuerall places, where this generall duty of <hi>loue</hi> hath beene handled, and you will finde the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of handling to be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and to afford new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note>

               </head>
               <p>Of nouriſhing children with breſt-milke, there is no great que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: therefore I haue with a touch paſſed it ouer. The chiefeſt queſtion of doubt is concerning the partie who is bound to this dutie; namely, whether the mother be bound to doe it her ſelfe or no.</p>
               <p>Many ſtrong arguments there be to preſſe it vpon the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences <note place="margin">Poſtquam ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactaueris cam, &amp;c. dixit Hier. ad Laetam de filia ſua.</note> of mothers, and to ſhew that (ſo farre as they are able) they are bound to giue ſucke to their owne children. Some are taken from the light of Gods word; and ſome from the light of nature.</p>
               <p>Gods word doth in many places by iuſt conſequence imply, that it is a bounden dutie: in other places it doth expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it by the practiſe of holy women: and againe in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it taketh it for a granted truth, and ruled caſe, not to be denied.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The conſequences whereby the word implieth this dutie are theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the bleſſing giuen to <hi>Ioſeph</hi> thus ſpeaketh old <hi>Iaakob, God ſhall bleſſe thee with the bleſſing of the breaſts, and of the</hi>

As if he had ſaid; I will bleſſe thee with ſuch women, as ſhall both beare thee children, and alſo giue ſucke to them which they beare. The conſequence then is this: As it is a bleſſing to haue children of a true lawfull wife; ſo to haue thoſe children nurſed of the ſame wife their mother.</p>

If it be a bleſſing for the woman which beareth the childe to giue it ſucke, then mothers are bound to performe this dutie.</p>

               <p>Though Chriſtians are not ſo ſtrictly tied to a ſet day, as the Iewes were to the eight day; yet from that ſtrict direction giuen to the Iewes, we may well gather, that it is not meet for Chriſtians to defer the baptizing of their children beyond eight dayes: for a young childe of that age may with more eaſe, and leſſe danger, be baptized, then circumciſed.</p>
               <p>The moſt ſeaſonable time I take to be the day whereon Gods <note place="margin">Read the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick before the forme of adminiſtring Baptiſme in our Common Prayer booke.</note> people vſe in the place where the childe is borne, publikely to aſſemble together to worſhip God next after the birth of the child, if at leaſt it fall not out within two or three dayes after, which is ſomewhat with the ſooneſt both for mother and childe.</p>
               <p>Whether we reſpect the honour of God (the riches of whoſe mercy is liuely ſet forth in the ſacrament of baptiſme) or the good of our childe (which in that ſacrament receiueth a pledge and ſeale of that rich mercy of God) Baptiſme is of great conſequence: and therefore the firſt ſeaſon of performing it to be taken. For parents by their diligence and due ſpeed therein, giue euidence both of their zeale to Gods glory, and alſo of their earneſt deſire of the childs ſpirituall good.</p>

               <p>Contrary to the forenamed dutie of Parents about well bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing their children, are many aberrations, as</p>
               <p n="1">1. The corrupt opinion of Anabaptiſts, who denie the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of baptizing children. The arguments before noted are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſtop their mouthes.</p>

2. The practiſe of Separatiſts (comming too neere to Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme) who excepting againſt the miniſterie and orders of our Church, doe what they can to keepe their children from that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And to that end carry their wiues ready to be deliuered vnto a ſtrange place, where they are not knowne, and anon after they are deliuered, priuily conuey wife, childe, and all away, that ſo the Magiſtrate may not, againſt their will, cauſe their childe to be baptized: and hauing no miniſterie of their owne, nor meanes to conuey the childe ouer ſea, keepe it many yeeres vnbaptized. Where is the euidence of their faith in Gods promiſe, of their <note place="margin">Chriſtianorum filij ſi baptiſma non receperint, ſcelus refertur ad eos qui dare noluerint: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime eo tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re quo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicere non pote rant qui accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turi erant.

                  <hi>combe:</hi> yea if a ſtranger commeth to the table, where ſuch a childe ſitteth, he may ſoone obſerue that he hath beene too daintily fed. If at firſt children be fed with ordinary moderate diet, they will afterwards both be in better health and liking, and alſo more contentedly, and thankfully accept whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhall be prouided for them. But exceſſe breedeth diſeaſes both in body and minde.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Vanity in apparell doth alſo much corrupt young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: for there is in them euen from the cradle a naturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to outward brauery: now for parents to pranke them vp, what is it but to blow vp the fire of that vanity, and make it ariſe into ſuch a flame as in time may much ſcorch the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents themſelues, and vtterly conſume the children: and yet how vſuall a fault is this? how monſtrouſly doe many parents offend therein? what fooliſh faſhion is vſed of the greateſt ſwaggerers, and lighteſt ſtrumpets, which they will not bring their children vnto, and that when their children are not able to diſcerne betwixt ſtuffes or colours? what can this proclaime but parents pride and folly? Proud maids are many times the inſtruments of pranking vp children (eſpecially when they are little ones) more then is meet: but yet the blame lieth on parents for ſuffering it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Tending children too cockiſhly maketh them too long children, and too tender: and oft altereth a good conſtitution of body. Some are ſo ouer-much tender of their children, as if a childe neuer ſo little complaine, or refuſe the meate (though for daintineſſe or fulneſſe) the Phyſician muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be ſent for, and the Apothecary ſent vnto, and the childe with ſuppoſed and apiſh kindneſſe made much worſe.</p>

trained vp to any good calling, and ſpendeth their ſpirits, and waſteth their ſtrength too much. Yet many parents care not how much time their children ſpend in ſport, and how little in learning: they thinke it duls their children too much to be held to ſchoole, or to any learning: whereas indeed too much play infatuates them more, and learning would much ſharpen their wits.</p>

Children are to be trained vp in thoſe things which are the ground worke of all callings, as <hi>reading, writing, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of learning.</hi> Whatſoeuer the particular calling be, theſe will be of great vſe to any one. Many that haue not beene taught them at firſt, would giue much for them afterwards. Parents at the firſt might teach their children thoſe things with much eaſe and ſmall charge, which afterwards cannot be <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Non ſunt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnenda quaſi parua, ſine quibus magna conſtare non poſſunt.</hi> Hier. <hi>ad Laet.</hi> 2. The calling muſt be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> ſo well learned, partly for want of leaſure, and partly becauſe the parts of thoſe who are growne in yeares are not ſo freſh and fit to learne, as in child-hood they were. Thoſe things are not to be contemned as ſmall, without which great things cannot ſtand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The calling whereunto children are trained vp muſt be lawfull, approued by Gods word, and not againſt the generall rules thereof: ſo may they keepe a good conſcience in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The calling muſt be fit for the childe that is trained vp <note place="margin">3. The calling muſt be fit for the childes ability.</note> to it. As there are diuers callings, ſo there are diuers abilities of ſundry children: ſome are fitteſt for callings of wit and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: others for callings that require an able and ſtrong body. Wherein the wiſe diſpoſing prouidence of God is much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: for thus are men much more vſefull one to another. Now for choiſe of a fit calling, a childs beſt <hi>ability</hi> wherein eſpecially it conſiſteth, whether in the exerciſe of minde or of body, is duly to be obſerued: and alſo his inclination, to what calling he is moſt diſpoſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Among fit callings (for there may be many) that which <note place="margin">4. The beſt callings muſt be preferred. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 31.</note> is beſt and the moſt excellent is to be preferred. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not vnfitly may I apply that of the Apoſtle, <hi>ccuet earneſtly the beſt gifts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On this ground let parents be exhorted to traine vp ſuch <note place="margin">Children to be trained vp to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</note> children as they finde fit, to the great and weighty calling of the miniſtery: no calling wherein any may doe more good, and wherein (if they be able and faithfull Miniſters) they can
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:3442:278"/>
receiue more comfort and contentment. This exhortation is the more to be regarded, becauſe in compariſon of thoſe who are trained vp to other callings, ſo few are trained vp to this.</p>

               <head>§ 33. <hi>Of parents faults contrary to their dutie of training their children vp to a calling.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>On the contrary, many parents much offend in not trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp their children to a calling as they ſhould. And the offence in this kinde is committed many waies. As</p>
               <p n="1">1. When parents ſuffer their children to liue like little ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at home, and paſſe ouer all their youth in idleneſſe. Thus they proue very drones, and caterpillars in the common wealth: if they haue a patrimony, they ſoone waſte it: if they haue none, they oft proue either theeues or beggars: they are fit for all companies: the readieſt prey for the deuill that can be: for they are like the <hi>houſe empty, ſwept and garniſhed,</hi> which <note place="margin">

               <p>The wiſe law-maker among the heathen is ſaid to order <note place="margin">Solon legibus cauiſſe legitur, vt filius, quem parentes nullam artem docuiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, non coge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur illos alere ſenio confectos, aut ad inopiam redactos. Eraſ. Inſtit. Matrim.</note> that the childe which by his parents had beene taught no Art, ſhould not be forced to nouriſh them though they were old or poore. This I all eage not to iuſtifie the law (for it is againſt the Chriſtian rule of ouercomming euill with goodneſſe) but to ſhew how the very heathen iudged the neglect of this dutie a great fault in parents.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When parents neglect to teach their children in their child-hood the generall and common grounds of all callings: ſome vpon niggardlineſſe; others vpon careleſneſſe. Thus poore men make their children vnfit for many meanes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might well maintaine themſelues: and rich men make theirs vnfit for magiſtracy, and for good ſociety. Yea poore and rich are thus nouſled vp the more in ignorance, and made the more vnfit to profit by the preaching of the word, and other meanes of ſpirituall edification.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When parents bring vp their children in vnwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vnlawfull callings, as to be of popiſh and idolatrous orders; to attend vpon papiſts; to be ſtage-plaiers, keepers of dice-houſes, &amp;c. Some (which is horrible to thinke of) traine
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:3442:279"/>
vp their daughters to be common ſtrumpets: and ſome <note place="margin">

How can they in theſe keepe a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when the very workes of their calling are ſinne? Is not this to thruſt them headlong into hell? They who thus binde their children to the deuils ſacrileges are ſpirituall murtherers of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When parents haue no reſpect at all to the fitneſſe of the calling: as when they traine vp children of able bodies, but dull and ſlow capacity, of a ſtuttering tongue and other like imperfections, to learning, wherein they proue very dunces, and loſe all their time, or are not able to make vſe of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which they haue: or when they traine vp children which haue a great inclination to learning, and are very fit thereunto, in ſome other trade, which, after many yeeres ſpeut therein, they are forced to leaue.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When parents only ſeeke after the moſt gainfull trade, and neuer thinke to educate their children moſt to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God. How can ſuch expect Gods bleſſing vpon the meanes vſed for their childrens good? Hence is it that among Papiſts ſo many are trained vp to Eccleſiaſticall orders and functions: and ſo few among Proteſtants. For there is very great maintenance and reuenues for ſuch among Papiſts: but little in compariſon among Proteſtants: <note place="margin">

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Pietie</hi> is the beſt thing that a parent can teach his childe: for as reaſon maketh a man differ from a beaſt; and as learning and ciuilitie maketh a wiſe and ſober man differ from ſauages and ſwaggerers; ſo pietie maketh a ſound Chriſtian much more to differ from the moſt ciuill and well ordered naturall man that can be. Learning, ciuilitie, calling, portion, are all nothing without pietie. Now it is an eſpeciall point of wiſdome, to ſeeke the beſt good that we can, as for our ſelues, ſo alſo for our children: yea this is an euident ſigne of a parents true loue of his childe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a neceſſitie that children be taught pietie, becauſe <note place="margin">2. Neceſſitie of pietie. <hi>Fiunt non naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni. Hier. ad Laet.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. In the familie a parent is all in all ouer his childe: a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet. Therefore that which a Miniſter is to doe for matter of inſtruction in the Church, a parent muſt do at home.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Children haue need of daily inſtruction: the parents paines in this kinde muſt be added to the Miniſters: and both are little enough.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Parents hauing more familiaritie with their children then Miniſters, muſt needs better know their capacitie, and their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: and ſo may better know after what manner to inſtruct them: whether to giue them milke or ſtrong meat, whether to deale mildly or roughly with them.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="538" facs="tcp:3442:280"/>
5. Inſtructions from parents are commonly more kindly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted then from others: and children will the better relliſh them, when they come from their parents. They ſay that a plant will beſt grow in the ſoile out of which it firſt ſprung: ſo inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions comming from thoſe who both brought vs forth, and firſt brought vs vp, are like to doe moſt good.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is no ſuch meanes to breed loue in a childs heart, as to be an inſtrument of bringing piety thereinto. Now who ſhould more ſeeke the true loue of a childe then a parent? In this reſpect a parent is more bound to this dutie then a Miniſter.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is impoſſible, that a Miniſter, who, it may be, hath many hundred children vnder his charge, ſhould well inſtruct them all: It is therefore requiſite, that each parent looke to his owne children.</p>
                  <p>As theſe diſtinct anſwers ſatisfie the obiection, ſo they ſerue as ſo many more reaſons to inforce the dutie: wherefore to proceed in adding other reaſons,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Great equitie there is that parents teach their children piety, <note place="margin">4. Equitie.</note> becauſe they <note n="p" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5.</note> conceiued and brought them forth in iniquitie. If they ſuffer them to lie and die in that corrupt eſtate, they are more cruell then the Oſtrich and Dragon.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Children are moſt properly Gods: <note n="q" place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Pietie is that, which of all other things, will make the childe <note place="margin">6. Cauſe of obedience.</note> moſt obedient, and gratefull to his parents: for thus there is a double bond to binde him: 1. his birth. 2. his new birth: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the cauſe of the one hath beene alſo the cauſe of the other.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Nothing can more ſettle the heart of a wiſe parent on his <note place="margin">7. Comfort of parents on their death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</note> death-bed concerning his children, then aſſurance that pietie is planted in them: for then may he with ſtronger confidence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to Gods prouidence, and with greater aſſurance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his bleſſing vpon them after he is dead.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Parents, by teaching their children pietie, are an eſpeciall <note place="margin">8. Propagation of pietie.</note> meanes of propagating true religion from age to age, and from generation to generation. No better meanes can be thought of.
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:3442:280"/>
For if all parents were carefull of their dutie in this kinde, as there is a ſucceſſion of children, and thereby a preſeruation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, ſo there would be a ſucceſſion of thoſe that feare God, and thereby a preſeruation of true religion. My children that are taught by me, may be fathers of children, and ſo teach that to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which they haue learned of me: yea after them may grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children proue fathers of other children, and they teach their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the ſame, and ſo from age to age others after them. This is the meanes on our part: and in our time we muſt doe our part: and for thoſe who come after vs, leaue the iſſue to God.</p>

Wherein are theſe parents bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then heathen? <hi>Iob</hi> was otherwiſe minded: he was more carefull for their ſoules then for their bodies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Many are ſo farre from teaching piety, as they teach their children profaneneſſe, pride, riot, lying, deceit, and ſuch like principles of the deuill. It had beene better for ſuch children to haue liued among wilde beaſts, then vnder ſuch parents. As the children hereby are thruſt headlong to hell, ſo their blood ſhall be required of their parents.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Others thinke it enough that their children be taught a religion, but what religion it skilleth not. Such are they as hauing rich kindred but popiſh, commend their children to the education of ſuch kindred, in hope of ſome temporall benefit, that their children may reape from them. If they were as careleſſe of their childrens bodies, they would be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted little better then murtherers: and is not the ſoule more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious then the body?</p>

4. So farre are many from catechiſing their children and that daily, as they teach them not ſo much as the Lords praier, the Beleefe, and the ten Commandements. Wherein Papiſts ſhall riſe vp in iudgement againſt them, that are very diligent in teaching their children, <hi>Pater noſter, Aue Maria,</hi> and ſuch like Latine principles, as the children cannot poſſibly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Few vſe the forenamed outward helpes, as the holy rites appointed of God, the great and glorious workes of God, his extraordinary workes of mercy or iudgement, to inſtruct their children thereby.

So much doe ſome preferre a little pelfe before the true <note place="margin">Alexander &amp; in moribus, &amp; in inceſſu l. eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nidis paedagogi ſui non potuit carere vitijs, quibus adbuc paruulus fuit infectus.

Few will ſo doe in caſe of their health or outward eſtate: but will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther get the beſt Phyſitian, or the beſt Lawyer that they can. Children oft learne ſuch euill qualities of their ſchoolemaſters as they can neuer ſhake off againe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Many proue very bad patternes to their children, and giue very ill example by profanenſſe, riotouſneſſe, ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, drinking, playing at vnlawfull games, &amp;c. Theſe parents as they brought forth their children in ſinne, ſo they lead them on forward to hell. Their euill example is not only an hinderance to the good inſtruction of others, but alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all their owne counſells (if at any time they doe giue any good counſell) to be in vaine: for the left hand of euill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Parentes non e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducant filios in eruditione do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini quia ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citi non ſunt pro ſalute vel perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione eorum.

                  <hi>Salomon</hi> laieth the blame, and ſhame of the neglect thereof vpon her: on the other ſide the honour of well nurturing children redoundeth eſpecially to the mother. To this purpoſe is it, that the <note n="f" place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 15. 2, 10.</note> particular names of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the kings are recorded in Scripture: intimating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that mothers were a maine cauſe of the piety, or impiety of ſuch children. <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Abſolom</hi> had both one father, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers mothers. May we not well thinke that <hi>Salomons</hi> mothers care to inſtruct him was an eſpeciall meanes of his piety: and that <hi>Abſoloms</hi> mothers neglect of this duty, was ſome cauſe of his impiety? It is expreſly noted of <hi>Ahaziahs</hi> mother, that ſhe <hi>was his counſeller to doe wickedly,</hi> which made him ſo wicked <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 22. 3.</note> as he was. Home-experience confirmeth as much: for if father and mother be of diuers religions, moſt of the children will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the mother. For while children are young, their mother is moſt in their ſight: ſhe feedeth, ſhe apparelleth them, ſhe tendeth them when they are not well, (when the <hi>Shunemites</hi> childe being ill, ſaid to his father, <hi>my head, my head,</hi> he ſaid to his ſeruant, <hi>carrie him to his mother.)</hi> Her precepts therefore <note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 19.</note> and practiſe in that reſpect are beſt heeded by the children, and ſhe hath the beſt opportunity to perſwade them to what ſhe liketh beſt: ſo as what they learne in their younger yeares, commonly they learne of their mothers: and that which then they learne, for the moſt part ſticketh moſt cloſe vnto them, and is longeſt retained by them, as was noted <note n="*" place="margin">§. 37.</note> before.</p>
               <p>I haue not thus in particular preſſed this point vpon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as if I exempted fathers from all care of nurturing their children in the beginning: for in my text the Apoſtle named <hi>Fathers:</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, that his <hi>father taught him eue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>For well vſing this biting coraſiue of correction, parents muſt haue reſpect to the <hi>matter</hi> for which they doe correct, and to their <hi>manner</hi> of correcting.</p>
               <p>In regard of the matter, theſe three things muſt be noted. <note place="margin">Three things noted in the matter, for which corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to be giuen.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That they be ſure there is a fault committed: that ſo there be iuſt cauſe of correcting: elſe more hurt then good will proceed from thence. If a coraſiue be laid where there is no ſore, it will make one. If correction be vniuſtly giuen, it may prouoke to wrath, but will doe little good. This is it wherein earthly fathers are taxed, and made vnlike to God, for that many times they <hi>correct after their owne pleaſure:</hi> which is a point of great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the fault be made knowne to the childe corrected: and he apparantly conuinced thereof. Correction muſt be for inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which cannot be, except the childe know why he is corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: for it is all one to him, as if he were corrected for no fault, if he know not his fault. God thus a firſt proceeded with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. That the faults be ſuch eſpecially, as the parents can ſhew to their children (if at leaſt they be of ſo much diſcretion) to be againſt Gods word; as ſwearing, lying, pilfring, and the like: for 1. theſe are moſt dangerous faults, and therefore more carefully to be purged out. 2. the childe corrected will thus be the better euicted of his fault, the more condemne himſelfe, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly beare the correction.</p>
               <p>In regard of the manner of correcting, foure generall, and foure <note place="margin">Foure general rules for the manner of correcting.</note> particular rules are to be obſerued.</p>
               <p>The generall rules are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An eye muſt be had to Gods manner of correcting his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and in particular of Gods correcting the parent himſelfe:
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:3442:289"/>
no better generall direction can be giuen: for Gods patterne is a perfect rule.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Prayer muſt be made by parents for themſelues and for their children: for themſelues, to be directed in doing it: for their children, to be bettered by it. Thus will good Phyſitians in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring phyſicke. In all duties is prayer to be vſed; eſpecially in this: for a parent is ready, partly through his owne intemperate paſſion, and partly through the childs impatiencie, to fall into one extreme or other. This is not to impoſe vpon all, whenſoeuer they take vp the rod, to goe and make a ſolemne prayer, but to lift vp the heart for direction and bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Correction muſt be giuen in loue. <hi>All things muſt be done in</hi>

                  <hi>I rebuke and chaſten,</hi> ſaith the Lord. Thus a parent will ſhew that he taketh no delight in ſmiting his childe: it is neceſſitie that forceth him thereunto.

Good and pitifull Chirurgions will try all other meanes before they come to launce and ſeere.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Due reſpect muſt be had to the partie corrected: if he be young and tender, the lighter correction muſt be vſed. <hi>Solomon</hi> oft mentioneth a rod, as meeteſt for a childe; for that is the lighteſt correction. So if the childe be of a flexible and ingenuous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſoone ſneapt, the correction muſt accordingly be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.

If he be well growne, and withall be ſtout, and ſtubborne, the correction may be more ſeuere.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Due reſpect muſt be had to the fault: Sinnes directly <note place="margin">Cauendum ne maior poena, quàm culpa ſit. Cic. loc. citat.</note> againſt God, open, notorious, ſcandalous ſinnes, knowne ſinnes, ſinnes often committed, in which they are growne vp, and whereof they haue gotten an habit, are with greater ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to be corrected.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A parent muſt behold his owne faults in correcting his childes: ſo more compaſſion will be wrought in him.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Prouiding fit places and callings for them to exerciſe their gifts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Prouiding fit mariages for them.</p>
               <p>We heard <note n="*" place="margin">§. 31.</note> before how children were to be trained vp, and fitted to ſome good calling euen in their childhood. Now further, when by vertue of good education they are inabled to diſcharge the functions and duties of a calling, and by yeeres they are well growne vp, ſo as it is time they ſhould be ſet to ſome particular calling:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parents ought to prouide fit callings for their children,</hi> and fit <note place="margin">Fit callings to be prouided.</note> places for them to exerciſe the gifts which by nature or educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they haue gotten. For example, If children haue beene brought vp in learning, parents muſt vſe what lawfull and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt meanes they can to ſettle them in ſuch a place and courſe as they may profeſſe and exerciſe their gifts, according to their ſeuerall kindes, be it Diuinitie, Law, Phyſicke, or the like: or if they haue beene brought vp in any trade, to prouide that they may ſet vp (as we ſpeake) and exerciſe their trade. The two firſt children that euer were borne of woman, <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> were placed forth in ſeuerall callings; and without doubt their places were ſo ordered by their parents. The like may be gathered out of theſe phraſes, <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>&amp;</hi> 25. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Eſau was a man of the field, and Iaakob dwelt intents.</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 1.</note> It is noted of <hi>Samuel,</hi> that he made his two ſonnes Iudges. Had they beene as faithfull in well vſing their places, as their father was carefull in prouiding them, they might haue liued well themſelues, and done much good to others. <hi>Iſhai</hi> hauing many ſonnes, had a care hereof: for <note n="d" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 13.</note> he ſent his three eldeſt ſonnes to the war; and placed them in a ſouldiers courſe of life: <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>&amp;.</hi> 16. 11.</note> his youngeſt he made a ſhepheard, which was in thoſe daies and places a calling of greater reckoning then now it is with vs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Thus ſhall they make vſe of that abilitie whereunto by <note place="margin">The benefits of a fit calling.</note>
                  <pb n="560" facs="tcp:3442:291"/>
their parents prouidence, and their owne diligence they haue attained: otherwiſe that abilitie may ſoone be loſt. Doth not daily experience ſhew that many who haue beene well trained vp by their parents in learning, ſo farre as they haue beene fit to haue entred into the miniſterie, for want of place and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment, haue in time ſo forgotten all, as if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beene trained vp in learning: and ſo in other ſciences.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thus come they to doe much more good in Church or Common-wealth: till men be placed in diſtinct callings, they are but fitting and preparing for future times. I denie not but that both Church and Common-wealth may reape much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by the paines and labour of the younger ſort, who are trained vp vnder others: but moſt properly are they counted members of the Church and Common-wealth, and actuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the good thereof, who haue ſome particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct calling, whereby they doe good to others.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thus they come to liue of themſelues, and to be able to releeue others alſo. All the time of their education, they are commonly at the charge of others: at leaſt, though by their paines they may gaine much, yet the gaine returnes to others: they themſelues for the moſt part haue but a bare maintenance, meat, drinke and cloth (as we ſay:) little haue they to lay vp for themſelues for the time to come, or to giue to others for the preſent.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They thus come to traine vp others againſt after times, as they themſelues haue beene trained vp: whereby a continuall and perpetuall ſucceſſion of all kindes of callings, is from time to time preſerued: and thus Family, Church, and Common-wealth vpheld and maintained. In ſhort time would all cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and functions vtterly decay, if a continuall ſupplie were not thus made.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Though the match may ſeeme meet in the parents eie, yet he may not force his childe thereto. Could a fitter match haue beene found out for <hi>Rebekah</hi> then <hi>Iſaak?</hi> yet <hi>Rebekahs</hi> friends <note n="g" place="margin">

               <p>The extreme in the defect is, when parents careleſly let their children paſſe the floure of their age: and neuer conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need require that they ſhould mary or no.

               <p>The extreme in the exceſſe is, <note n="*" place="margin">See Treat. 2.

               <p>Contrary to a parents prouidence for the good of his children after his departure, is the careleſneſſe of parents for the time to come. They thinke the world is gone with them when they are gone, and therefore they will take no thought for the future times that ſhall be after them; as if it were enough for euery one to looke to his owne time. There may ſeeme to be more ſelfe-loue in ſuch parents then loue of their children, in that their care de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth with their owne time, and extendeth not it ſelfe to the time and continuance of their children. Hence is it, that not a word of direction and exhortation commeth out of their mouths to their children when they are departing, no bleſſing that they will leaue behinde them, no friends ſhall be deputed by them, to be as parents to their children. Let God prouide, ſay they. But where there is a referring of matters to Gods prouidence, without the vſe of thoſe meanes which God hath warranted and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his word, there can be little hope that God ſhould take care of that which is ſo commended to him. Such men doe not in faith depend vpon Gods prouidence, but make the very name thereof a pretext to caſt off that care, which God as a bounden du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie requireth of them. As there is little loue of their children in ſuch parents, ſo there is leſſe zeale of Gods glory: for a parents care of his childrens welfare, eſpecially of their continuing to feare and ſerue the Lord after their owne departure out of this world, is an eſpeciall meanes of preſeruing Gods feare in the world, and propagating it from age to age: ſo as this neglect is a greater fault then many are aware of.</p>

common ciuilitie, when they who haue any eſtate, waxe old, or ſicke, and haue any occaſion of expecting death offered vnto them, to make their laſt Will and teſtament. This is ſet forth in the old Teſtament vnder this phraſe <hi>(Put thy houſe in order.)</hi> A dutie it is expreſly <note n="b" place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 1.</note> commanded by God: and that not without good reaſon. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. A parents Will is an eſpeciall meanes to ſettle peace among children after his departure, and to make them content with that allowance which he hath ſet out vnto them, becauſe by the Will they know it was their fathers pleaſure they ſhould haue ſuch and ſuch a portion. If controuerſies ſhould ariſe, yet a Will is a meanes for the law ſpeedily to determine the ſame without any tedious and chargeable ſuits: for the Apoſtle taketh it for a ruled caſe, that <hi>no man diſanulleth or addeth any thing to a mans' teſtament.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. After a parent hath made his Will, he may the more quietly ſettle himſelfe for heauenly contemplations, and preparations to death: and thinke of ſuch good inſtructions as are moſt fit to giue as his farewell to his children: and the more willingly expect the moment of his diſſolution: and the more patiently ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the very ſtroke of death.</p>
               <p>In performing this dutie, a man muſt both obſerue a fit time, <note place="margin">Direction.</note> and alſo take good aduice.

And becauſe through the cauils which many vnconſcionable lawyers and others are like to make, his true meaning may be peruerted, it is meet to haue the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of ſuch as can in diſtinct words and phraſes ſo expreſſe his meaning, as they ſhall be free from exception.

               <p>Contrary is the daily practiſe of too many parents who are not willing to make any will at all: or elſe on vaine hope that they may liue longer, and when they are ſicke, vpon conceit that they may recouer, or at leaſt longer continue to enioy the vſe of their vnderſtanding and memory, put off the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their Will till it be too late: and ſo die without Will,
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:3442:297"/>
or make ſuch a Will as miniſtreth more matter of ſute, then if they had no Will at all; either becauſe doubt is made whether he that made it had his vnderſtanding and memory or no: or becauſe his Will is ſo abrupt and ambiguous, as his meaning cannot be knowne. The miſchiefes that follow theſe neglects, <note place="margin">Inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of dying without a Will.</note> are many. As

               </p>
               <p>The reaſon which maketh many to put off the making of their Will is a fooliſh conceit, that if a mans Will be once made, then he muſt needs die out of hand. But what ground haue men for any ſuch conceit? If ſicknes grow vpon a man, ſo long as his Will is vnmade his minde is vnſetled, his minde being vnſetled, the phyſicke that is miniſtred to him cannot ſo kindly worke; ſo as his death may be the more haſtened for not making a Will. Beſides, if his ſpeech faile before his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, the thought that then he ſhall die without a Will may ſo perplex him, as his departure will be very vnquiet and troubleſome.</p>

Out of this anſwer may a third reaſon be gathered, to ſhew that it is a behouefull law for the commonwealth that the heire ſhould haue all the land. For this law maketh parents more carefull in training vp their younger ſonnes to ſundry callings which are profitable to a commonwealth. If euery childe ſhould haue a part of his fathers lands, they would all ſo depend thereupon, as none of them would exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to ſuch callings as are meanes of mens maintenance.</p>

When ſome are hugged in the boſome, others are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected as if they were none of their owne, but baſely borne. The vnnaturalneſſe of the eagle is noted in this kinde, that ſhe flaps and driues out of the neſt one of her young ones, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth only the other as her owne. From ſuch partiality in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents proceed many miſchiefes: as theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They giue occaſion to ſuch as obſerue it, to ſuſpect that thoſe children who are ſo little reſpected, are none of their owne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They cauſe enuy, malice, and much contention to ariſe among children. <hi>When Ioſephs brethren ſaw that their father</hi>

               <p n="3">3. They prouoke God to inflict ſome iudgement on thoſe children that are ſo cockered, and preferred before the reſt: that ſo they may the better ſee their folly.</p>
               <p>This ſinne of parents partiality is ſo much the greater, when vpon outward reſpects they preferre the wicked and vngodly children before pious and gracious children. <hi>Iſaak</hi> herein much failed, for <note n="c" place="margin">

               <p>Sometimes againe a gripulous ſeeking of aduantage to themſelues maketh parents to diſinherit the right heire: as when a man after he hath buried the mother of his firſt borne, hearing of another woman which is of great wealth, maketh ſute for her. She refuſeth becauſe he hath an heire of a former wife. He to remoue that blocke entereth couenant to make the ſonne which he hath by her (if he haue any) his heire: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the mariage is conſummate: his ſecond wife bringeth forth a ſonne: he for his couenant ſake diſinheriteth the firſt heire.

               <p>Tutors, to whoſe gouernment young ſchollers, that are ſent to the Vniuerſities, are committed, haue to deale with children in their riper yeeres; euen when the time of ſetling them in a courſe is come: the very time wherein much good may be done to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or elſe wherein they may be vtterly peruerted. There will be little hope of bowing them, and drawing them into another courſe after they be freed from the gouernment of a Tutor. Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors therefore, as they haue need of great wiſdome, ſo of good conſcience, that they may haue the greater care of their Pupils, and take the greater paines in teaching them the three forenamed points, <hi>learning, ciuilitie,</hi> and <hi>pietie.</hi> A good Tutor may doe much to repaire the negligence, and amend the defects of a Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter: but there remaine none to redreſſe the failings of a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: children for the moſt part are paſt redreſſing, when they ceaſe to haue a Tutor.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The vices contrary to the forenamed dutie of Schoolemaſters, are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Unskilfulneſſe.</hi> Many that are more fit to be taught then to teach, take vpon them this weightie calling. Some haue not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient learning: ſome againe are rude, and know not themſelues good manners: and ſome know not the firſt principles of the ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God. No good can be expected from theſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Couetouſneſſe.</hi> All that many ſeeke, is to multiply the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their ſchollers, and to get as much as they can for boording, and teaching: they aime more at their owne gaine then at their ſchollers profit. Children are not like to thriue well vnder them.</p>

                  <pb n="588" facs="tcp:3442:305"/>
3. <hi>Negligence.</hi> Many are loth to take the paines of a Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter, and thereupon come as little into the ſchoole as they can: take euery ſmall occaſion to be gone againe: care not how much their children play: if they be able to hire a poore Vſher, all the burden ſhall be caſt vpon him. Little is that fruit that can be looked for from them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Want of pietie.</hi> Many skilfull and painfull Schoolemaſters, vnder whoſe teaching children come forward exceeding well in learning, thinke it nothing appertaineth to them to teach the grounds of religion, ſo as they altogether neglect pietie. Aſſuredly they want it themſelues: for were their owne hearts ſeaſoned with true pietie, their conſciences would moue them to teach it to their children. The things of the kingdome of God are like vnto <hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eauen,</hi> which ſeaſoneth the whole batch of dough with that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſauour which it ſelfe hath. When children ſpend almoſt all their time with their Schoolemaſters, of whom ſhould they learne it, if not of them? What bleſſing can be hoped from the paines of ſuch Schoolemaſters?</p>
               <p>I might to theſe adde the ouer-much remiſneſſe of ſome (whereby children get too great an head) and the too great ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of others, either in frequencie of correcting, as if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted therein; or in the meaſure thereof, as if they had to doe with beaſts, whereby they affright children, make them dull, yea and impudent alſo. But theſe extremes were <note n="*" place="margin">§. 48, 49.</note> before handled.</p>
               <p>The common fault of Tutors is altogether to neglect their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils. Many thinke a Tutor to be a meeretitular matter: no more to be required of them but to beare the very name; and to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake that the Colledge be diſcharged for their Pupils diet. This conceit, and the practiſe anſwerable thereunto, is the blemiſh and bane of the Vniuerſities. Many children well trained vp in ſchooles, vtterly loſe the benefit of all their former education when they are ſent to the Vniuerſitie, becauſe their Tutors altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaue them to themſelues: and ſo they are made a prey to idle and lewd companions. By reaſon hereof many parents are vtterly diſcouraged to ſend their children to the Vniuerſitie.</p>

Till the iudgement be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued hereof, nor reuerence, nor obedience will be yeelded as it ought.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Many directions are giuen both to maſters and ſeruants in regard of their different places how to carry themſelues one
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:3442:307"/>
to another. Read for this purpoſe the many lawes which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> preſcribed to both: the many counſels which <hi>Solomon,</hi> in his prouerbs eſpecially, giueth alſo to both: and particularly the directions of this and other Apoſtles.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Saints in all ages haue beene ſet in theſe places: ſome in the places of maſters, and ſome in the places of ſeruants: and according to the place wherein God hath ſet them, they haue performed their dutie: maſters the duties of maſters, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants the duties of ſeruants.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The many parables which Chriſt vſeth taken from the power which maſters haue and exerciſe ouer their ſeruants, and the ſubiection which ſeruants yeeld to their maſters, ſhew that the authoritie of the one, and ſubiection of the other, are things without queſtion granted and not denied.</p>
               <p n="5">5. God hath made many promiſes of reward both to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and ſeruants, that conſcionably performe the duties of their place: and hath made many threatnings againſt the one and the other that are negligent therein.</p>
               <p>All theſe grounds are ſo cleerely and plentifully noted in the Scripture, that any one who is any whit acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with may know them to be ſo.

               </head>
               <p>Contrary to this firſt ground of ſeruants ſubiection is the opinion of Anabaptiſts, who teach that all are alike, and that there is no difference betwixt maſters and ſeruants. Their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whereby they would make ſhew to proue their vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable opinion, are theſe.</p>

                  <p>1. <hi>Obiect.</hi> Maſters are either Infidels or Chriſtians, and ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants either one or other. If maſters be Infidels, and ſeruants Chriſtians, how vnmeet is it that Chriſtians ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to Infidels? and if maſter and ſeruant be both Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they are brothers: but brothers are equalls, and neither ſubiect to other.</p>

                  <p>Theſe being thus different, one that is more excellent in the one, may be inferiour in the other. Yea though there be an equality in the one, namely, in ſpirituall things, yet there may be a diſparity in the other, namely, in ciuill and temporall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And though Saints may be farre inferiour to infidels in outward eſtate, yet they are not a whit the leſſe glorious before God. The honour proper and peculiar to Saints is inward, not viſible to the carnall eye of a naturall man.</p>

               <p>The other part of that fountaine, from whence the duties <note place="margin">Seruants ought to feare their maſters.</note> of ſeruants flow, reſteth in the affection: and it is in one word <hi>Feare:</hi> which is an awfull dread of a maſter.

A <hi>dread</hi> is ſuch a feare of prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his maſters wrath, as maketh him thinke and caſt euery way how to pleaſe him. This is it which the Apoſtle here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateth vnder theſe two words, <hi>feare</hi> and <hi>trembling.</hi> In both theſe reſpects <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>So proper is this <hi>feare</hi> to a ſeruant in relation to his maſter, as where it is wanting, there is a plaine deniall of his maſters place and power; which God intimateth vnder this expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>If I be a maſter, where is my feare?</hi> that is, you plainely <note place="margin">

               <p>This feare will draw ſeruants on, cheerefully to performe all duty: the more it aboundeth, the more deſire and endeuour there will be to pleaſe, and to giue good contentment (and this is a point commanded to ſeruants, <hi>to pleaſe well in all things:)</hi>

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p n="3">3. When ſeruants are not fully inſtructed in thoſe things which they ought to doe for their maſter, they ought to aske of him what is to be done, as the diſciples who ſaid to their maſter, <hi>where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>That the very forme and manner of their ſpeech when they haue iuſt occaſion to ſpeake to their maſters, doe ſauour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence: for which purpoſe let theſe particulars be noted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That ſeruants giue reuerend titles to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
                  <p>It was in an honourable reſpect of their maſter that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:3442:310"/>
of <hi>Naaman,</hi> called him <hi>Father.</hi> In Scripture <note n="*" place="margin">§. 4.</note> one of <note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 13.</note> Gods titles is attributed to maſters, as <hi>Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That their words be few, no more then muſt needs, euen when they haue occaſion to ſpeake: as may be gathered out of the forenamed examples alleaged to ſhew when ſeruants might and ought to ſpeake.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That all their words ſpoken to their maſter be meeke, milde and humble: note for this purpoſe how the children of the Prophets framed their ſpeech to their maſter. <note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. They humbly beg leaue for themſelues to goe to Iorden.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They intreat him to goe, in theſe words, <hi>vouchſafe I pray thee to goe with thy ſeruants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When one of them had loſt the head of his hatchet, as if he durſt not be ſo bold as to ſpeake to his maſter to get it him againe, he referreth the thing to his good pleaſure, ſaying, <hi>Alas maſter it was but borrowed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third caution is,</p>
                  <p>That they obſerue a fit ſeaſon to ſpeake to their maſter: as when he is at leaſure to heare them: (thus it is noted of the diſciples that when their maſter was <hi>alone</hi> they propounded their queſtions vnto him) or when his minde is quiet, not <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 4. 10.</note> troubled with paſſion (thus when <hi>Dauid</hi> obſerued that <hi>Sauls</hi> minde was ſomewhat pacified towards him, by that ſpeech he vſed, <hi>Is this thy voice my ſonne Dauid,</hi> then he tooke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion more freely to ſpeake to him.) <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 17.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fourth caution is,</p>
                  <p>That they giue a ready and preſent anſwer to their maſter. This is oft commended in <hi>Peter,</hi> that when Chriſt propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any queſtion to his diſciples, he would preſently and <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 68.</note> readily anſwer.</p>
                  <p>A fift caution is,</p>
                  <p>That all their ſpeeches and anſwers to their maſter be true, not daring to tell a lie vnto them: this argueth a very reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend reſpect of a maſter. When <hi>Eli</hi> demanded of <hi>Samuel</hi> what the Lord had ſaid to him, <hi>Samuel told him euery whit and hid nothing from him.</hi> And when <hi>Dauid</hi> bid the woman of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koah <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 18, 19.</note> not to hide the thing that he ſhould aske her from him,
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:3442:310"/>
ſhe told him the whole truth. There is a double bond to tie ſeruants hereunto.</p>

               </head>
               <p>The cariage of many ſeruants towards their maſter is cleane contrary to the forenamed reuerence. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some through rudeneſſe, and want of good bringing vp, <note place="margin">1. Rudeneſſe.</note> come to their maſters, and goe from them, as to and from their fellowes: no teſtimonie of reuerence by any obeyſance: they know not how to giue it: whereby they diſhonour their parents, and manner of education.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others, if at firſt comming to their maſter they giue ſome <note place="margin">2. Too much familiaritie.</note> ſalutation, yet, through too much familiaritie with them, all the day after they will carry themſelues fellow-like, ſcarce vncouering their heads in their maſters preſence, not enduring to ſtand long before him, but either ſetting themſelues downe, or ſlinking away when they ſhould be in preſence. Doubtleſſe from this ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much familiaritie aroſe this prouerbe, <hi>Good morrow for all day.</hi> This vnmannerly familiaritie is commonly in ſuch ſeruants, as haue poore and meane maſters: for rich and great mens ſeruants can be ſo full of curteſie, as not a word ſhall be ſpoken by their maſters to them, or by them to their maſters, but the knee ſhall be bowed withall: they can ſtand houre after houre before their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and not once put on their hat: if they be walking after their maſters, their maſter ſhall not turne ſooner then their hat will be off, and that ſo oft as he turneth or ſpeaketh to them. Why ſhould
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:3442:312"/>
rich maſters haue ſo much reuerence ſhewed to them, and poore maſters none at all? Doe not the poore beare Gods image as well as the rich? Doth Gods word make any difference betwixt rich and poore? Doth it ſay, <hi>Serue rich maſters with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling?</hi> Surely it is the corruption of mans heart, which maketh this difference. Seruants naturally more regard their maſters out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward abilitie, then inward authoritie: the honour which the world conferreth on men, more then the honour which God conferreth: for God hath giuen as much honour and authoritie to a poore maſter as to a rich, in that he is a maſter.</p>
               <p>Seruants commonly moſt faile in this dutie of reuerence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their maſters there where they ſhould moſt of all ſhew it, namely, in the courts of God, and aſſembly of Gods people, where the very Angels are preſent to behold our ſeemly cariage: thus they cauſe the miniſterie of the word to be euill ſpoken of, and thereby make their ſinne ſo much the more hainous.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Exceeding great is the fault of ſeruants in their exceſſe in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell. <note place="margin">3. Pride.</note> No diſtinction ordinarily betwixt a mans children and ſeruants: nay none betwixt maſters and their men, miſtreſſes and their maids. It may be while men and maids are at their maſters and miſtreſſes finding, difference may be made: though euen then alſo, if they can any way get wherewithall, they will do what they can to be as braue as they can. But if once they be at their owne finding, all ſhall be laid out vpon apparell, but they will be as fine as maſter or miſtreſſe: if not ſo coſtly, yet in ſhew as ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and braue. New faſhions are as ſoone got vp by ſeruants as by maſters and miſtreſſes. What is the end of this, but to be thought as good as maſter or miſtreſſe? If the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> were now liuing, ſhe would as much wonder at the diſorder of ſeruants in theſe dayes, as then ſhe wondred at the comely order of <hi>Solomons</hi> ſeruants.

               </head>
               <p>Seruants ought to forbeare doing of things on their owne heads without or againſt conſent of their maſters, becauſe while the time of their ſeruice laſteth, they are not their owne, neither ought the things which they doe, to be for themſelues: both their perſons and their actions are all their maſters: and the will of their maſter muſt be their rule and guide (in things which are not againſt Gods will.) The rite vſed vnder the Law of <hi>boaring a ſeruants eare,</hi> implied as much. <hi>Dauid</hi> therefore alluding vnto <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exo.</hi> 21. 6.</note> that rite, ſaith to God (both of himſelfe, and alſo of Chriſt, whom vnder a type he prefigured) <hi>mine eares haſt thou boared;</hi> and from thence inferreth that he would do the will of God. We haue <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. 6.</note> a notable patterne hereof in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeruant, who in a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe committed to his charge propounds ſuch ſcruples as came <note place="margin">

into his head to receiue direction from his maſter therein, leſt he ſhould be forced to doe ſomething of his owne head without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular warrant from his maſter.</p>
               <p>This generall will the better be cleared, if it be exemplified in ſome particulars. Take therefore theſe inſtances gathered out of the Scriptures of things which ſeruants may not doe without their maſters conſent.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Seruants may not goe whither they will. The phraſe which the Centurion vſeth <hi>(I ſay to one goe, and he goeth)</hi> implieth, that except his maſter bid him goe, he ought not to goe. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They ought not to doe their owne buſineſſe and affaires. It is noted of <hi>Iaakob</hi> being <hi>Labans</hi> ſeruant, that, though he <note place="margin">

               <p n="3">3. They ought not to doe what buſineſſe they liſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> had a great deſire to carrie the newes of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoloms</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> death to <hi>Dauid:</hi> yet without the leaue of <hi>Ioab</hi> his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and maſter he would not doe it. The good miſtreſſe <hi>giueth the portion to her maides,</hi> namely, the portion of worke: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 31. 15.</note> that therefore muſt they doe which ſhe giueth them to doe. The ſeruants of the Centurion did euery one as by their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <note place="margin">

               <p n="4">4. They ought not to mary while the time of their coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for ſeruice laſteth, vnleſſe their maſter giue conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

3. That which ſeruants are to gather from thence is, if need ſo require, to make knowne their deſire to their maſter, and to vſe all the good meanes they can by themſelues or others to obtaine their maſters conſent.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They ought not to diſpoſe their maſters goods at their owne pleaſure, no not for charitable vſes. The Steward which <note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. When being bound to their maſters ſeruice, they doe their owne buſineſſe, and ſeeke their owne profit; and that without their maſters leaue. This aggrauated <hi>Gehazi</hi> his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie

               <p n="3">3. When ſeruants will chuſe their owne worke, and doe that which liketh themſelues beſt, or elſe doe nothing at all. Thus where many ſeruants be in one houſe together, if they be not in ſuch places as they like themſelues, they will mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and grumble, and doe nothing well.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When ſeruants, eſpecially maid-ſeruants, that are bound, doe purpoſely mary to free themſelues: becauſe our lawes doe free a maide that is maried from her ſeruice to maſter and miſtreſſe.</p>

               <p>The affirmatiue and actiue part of ſeruants obedience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in a ready yeelding to that which their maſters will haue done, hath reſpect (as the like kinde of childrens obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) to the <hi>Commandement, Inſtruction, Reproofe,</hi> and <hi>Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> of their maſter.</p>

way; but irreligious maſters will ſuffer them to follow the ſway of their owne corruption, to ſweare, to profane the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, and ſpend that whole day in ſleeping, ſporting, eating and drinking: to goe to bed without prayer, or catechizing, or reading the word of God, and ſo to riſe againe and goe about their buſineſſe: to which holy duties, ſuch deuout ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as <hi>Cornelius</hi> was, will hold their ſeruants.</p>

               <p>The ſame directions may ſerue for yeelding to reproofe and correction: for they may both be brought to one head: and in the generall they doe both agree. For reproofe is a verball correction, and correction is a reall reproofe.</p>
               <p>The obedience which ſeruants in regard of theſe muſt ſhew to their maſters is twofold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Patiently to beare all manner of reproofe and correction.</p>
               <p n="2">

2. Readily to amend that for which they are iuſtly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or corrected.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, ſeruants haue an expreſſe precept, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> by many reaſons in theſe words, <hi>Seruants be ſubiect to your maſters with all feare, not only to the good and gentle, but alſo to the froward. For this is thanke worthy if a man for conſcience toward God endure griefe, ſuffering wrongfully. For what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye take it patiently? but if whey ye doe well and ſuffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table with God.</hi> Here we ſee,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That correction is patiently to be borne by ſeruants: if correction, then much more reproofe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That though correction be iniuſtly inflicted, yet it is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to be endured: therefore much more when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>buffeting</hi> and that of a froward maſter is to be borne: therefore much more lighter correction of a good and gentle maſter. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> patiently endured <note n="b" place="margin">

Great was the recompence which God made vnto him: &amp; aſſuredly God will recompence all the wrong, paine, and griefe, that in this caſe ſhall be endured for conſcience ſake. For the Apoſtle ſaith, that this is <hi>thankworthy,</hi> that is, worthy of praiſe and commendation, and ſo worthy of recompence and reward.

               <p>To theſe motiues I may adde the rule of our Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion (which is alſo intimated by the Apoſtle in theſe words, <note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 21.</note>

               <p>The <hi>Manner</hi> how ſeruants ought to performe their duties is noted in foure phraſes:</p>

               <p>Commonly the ſeaſon and ſauour of waters commeth from the fountaine: which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> implieth, where he ſaith, <hi>no fountaine doth yeeld ſalt water and freſh:</hi> for if the fountaine be <note place="margin">

Let therefore ſeruants here learne by their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of performing all their duties, to declare that there is a true ſeruant-like feare ſeated in their hearts. Hereof I ſhall need ſay no more then what hath beene <note n="*" place="margin">§. 4.</note> before deliuered.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This trembling feare is needfull in regard of the ſmall loue that ſeruants commonly beare to their maſters. There are not thoſe motiues to ſtirre vp loue in ſeruants to their maſters, as in children to their parents: except therefore through awe and dread they be kept in compaſſe, they will exceedingly tranſgreſſe: and becauſe this is ſo needfull, ſeruants muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to nouriſh it, as a meanes to keepe them from ouer-much boldneſſe.</p>
               <p>Contrary on the one ſide is a proud deſpiſing of a maſters authority (ſaying, if not with their mouthes, yet in their heart, as <hi>Gaal</hi> of <hi>Abimelech, who is he that we ſhould ſerue him?</hi> or as thoſe that deſpiſed the gouernment of Chriſt their maſter, <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 23.</note> in another place. Thus did <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in ſingleneſſe of heart ſerue his maſter: inſtance his refuſing to abuſe his miſtreſſe in <note place="margin">

all that they haue into their ſeruants hands. Neither would this rare vertue in ſeruants be only profitable to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but alſo very comfortable to themſelues, and bring them much peace of conſcience.</p>
               <p>Contrary is hypocriticall ſeruice: when ſeruants haue <hi>a heart, and a heart,</hi> making ſhew-of one heart outwardly, and haue another, euen a cleane contrary heart within them. Such <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 2.</note> an one was <hi>Gehazi,</hi> who <hi>came in and ſtood before his maſter,</hi> as if he had performed ſome good ſeruice for his maſter, when <note place="margin">2. <hi>King</hi> 5. 25.</note> he had moſt highly diſhonoured him: and ſuch an one was <hi>Iudas</hi> who carried as faire a face to his maſter as any of the diſciples, and yet was an arrant traitor: for when he was thought to goe out to buy prouiſion for his maſter, he went to <note place="margin">

               <p>All eye-ſeruice is contrary to the forenamed ſingleneſſe of heart: when ſeruants are diligent ſo long as their maſters eye is on them: <note place="margin">Eye ſeruice.</note> like little children that will doe any thing their mother will haue them doe, while her eye is vpon them; but nothing, when her backe is turned.

which he rendred to him for bleſſing his iourney, ſhew, that he ſerued his maſter for the Lords ſake. It is more cleare then needs be proued, that ſuch was <hi>Iaakobs</hi> ſeruice to his maſter. This is the rather to be noted of Chriſtian ſeruants, becauſe herein lieth the greateſt difference betwixt <hi>beleeuing ſeruants,</hi> and others: others may ſerue with feare and trembling, in ſingleneſſe of heart, and with good will; but only Saints doe ſeruice as to Chriſt for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake: If this be not that which <hi>only</hi> they aime at, yet aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly they doe <hi>chiefly</hi> and <hi>principally</hi> aime at it: which maketh them not to content themſelues with doing the thing, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to doe it after the beſt manner that they can, ſo as God may beſt accept thereof: whereby as they approue themſelues to God, ſo they doe much good to their maſters, and bring much comfort vnto their owne ſoules.</p>
               <p>Contrary is the minde of moſt, who doe all the ſeruice which <note place="margin">Seruice on by-reſpects.</note> they doe on by-reſpects: they may performe much dutie, and it may be doe much good to their maſters; and thereupon they may get good wages at their maſters hands, and extraordinarie recompence alſo, and liue in much quiet vnder them: but no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward can they looke for at Gods hands: ſo as I may ſay to ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, as Chriſt ſaid to thoſe who did all to haue glory of men, <hi>They haue their reward.</hi>

               <p>How lightly ſoeuer many ſeruants eſteeme idleneſſe and ſloth, the truth is, that it is a plaine theft.

               </p>
               <p>I haue the further preſſed this point, becauſe it is noted as a blemiſh in ſuch ſeruants as profeſſe religion to be moſt lazie and negligent, leaſt ſedulous and diligent. Much of that time which they ſhould ſpend about their maſters buſineſſe (which is their

particular calling) they ſpend in prating about ſtate, and Church-buſineſſe, (matters not belonging to them.) Thus they make their maſters weary of their ſeruice; and by reaſon thereof they are oft ſhifted from houſe to houſe, and as <hi>rolling ſtones, gather no moſſe:</hi> they neither learne skill, whereby they may, when they are of themſelues, maintaine themſelues, and doe good to others: nor lay vp any ſtocke or portion, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which are diligent doe: yea they get ſuch an habit of idleneſſe, as they can neuer ſhake it off againe: for they who are ſlothfull being vnder maſters, ſeldome proue diligent when they are for themſelues.

               <p>Among other parts of vnfaithfulneſſe in this kinde one of the moſt monſtrous (which yet is too too frequent) is to allure one another to vncleanneſſe, and men and maids to defile one another.

               <head>§. 33. <hi>Of ſeruants faithfulneſſe in regard of their maſters, or miſtreſſes bed-fellow.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>So faithfull ought ſeruants to be to their maſters and <note place="margin">VI.</note> miſtreſſes, that if one of them ſhould labour to vſe a ſeruant in any manner of deceit to the other, the ſeruant ought not to yeeld. As if a maſter ſhould moue his maid priuily to take away iewels, plate, mony, linnen, or any ſuch thing as is in her miſtreſſe cuſtody. It skilleth not that the maſter hath the chiefeſt power ouer all the goods: a ſecret taking of them away without the priuity of the miſtreſſe in whoſe cuſtody they are, is in the ſeruant deceit, and a point of vnfaithfulneſſe. Much leſſe ought any ſeruants be moued by their miſtreſſe priuily to take away their maſters corne, wares, or any goods for her priuate vſe. Of the two this is the greater part of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>If ſuch deceit ought not to be vſed about any goods, much leſſe about the body of maſter or miſtreſſe. As if a maſter ſhould allure his maid to commit folly with him, or a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe her man, both their conſcience to God, and alſo their faithfulneſſe to their maſter or miſtreſſe ſhould make them vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to refuſe it, and to giue no place to any ſuch temptation. <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>Ioſeph</hi> is propounded as a patterne herein: and againſt the ſuggeſtion of his miſtreſſe he rendreth the two forenamed reaſons: his conſcience to God in theſe words, <hi>how can I doe this great wickedneſſe and ſinne againſt God?</hi> His faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:3442:327"/>
to his maſter in theſe, <hi>He hath not kept backe any thing from me but thee, how then</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To this head may be referred ſeruants faithfulneſſe in making knowne to their maſter the ſinne of his wife, and to their miſtreſſe the ſinne of her husband, eſpecially if it be ſuch a ſinne as may tend to the ruine of the familie, and that by the knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the party that is not blinded and beſotted with the ſinne, but rather free from it, may be a meanes to redreſſe it. Thus <note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals</hi> ſeruants made knowne to <hi>Abigail</hi> the churliſhneſſe of <hi>Nabal</hi> towards <hi>Dauids</hi> ſeruants: by which means the miſchiefe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt the houſe was preuented. Thus if ſeruants know that their maſter intendeth ſome mortall reuenge againſt another, to tell his wife thereof in time, may be great faithfulneſſe: or if they know their miſtreſſe hath appointed to goe away priuily from her husband, to tell him of it, is a part of faithfulneſſe. This may be applied to many other like caſes.</p>
               <p>The contrary is yeelding to maſters or miſtreſſes in any point of deceit one againſt another: whereunto ſeruants are too prone, becauſe they thinke to be boulſtred out by the authoritie of the partie that ſetteth them on worke to deceiue. But no authoritie can be a warrant for any deceit, or wickedneſſe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Maſters and Miſtreſſes are fleſh and bloud as well as ſeruants, <note place="margin">VII.</note> and ſo ſubiect to weakneſſe, ſickneſſe, old age, and other diſtreſſes, wherein they may ſtand in great need of ſeruants helpe: ſeruants therefore muſt be faithfull in affording them the beſt helpe that they can. <hi>Sauls</hi> ſeruants did a part of faithfulneſſe to their maſter, when, he being vexed with an euill ſpirit, <note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 16.</note> they inquired after meanes to eaſe him. So did <hi>Dauids</hi> ſeruants, when he being bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 1. 2.</note> they ſought out one to cheriſh him.

               <p>Contrary is a ſeruants vngratefull and inhumane leauing of his maſter in his time of need, as the ſeruants of <hi>Iob</hi> did: for when the hand of God lay heauy vpon him, and all his goods were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him, and his bodie full of ſore boiles, <note n="e" place="margin">

               <head>§. 35. <hi>Of the meanes to make ſeruants faithfull.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>Among many other meanes to make ſeruants faithfull to their maſter, and carefull to performe other duties ſincerely, willingly, cheerefully, and diligently, as hath before beene noted, this is one of the moſt generall, namely, that <hi>ſeruants,</hi> in all things they doe for their maſter, <hi>make their maſters caſe their owne,</hi> and ſo doe for him as they would for themſelues, or as they would haue their owne ſeruants doe for them. The generall rule of the Law is, <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Leu.</hi> 19. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe;</hi> and <note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>whatſoeuer you would that men ſhould doe to you, doe you even ſo to them.</hi> If thus euery man muſt reſpect another, yea though he be a ſtranger, then much more muſt ſeruants reſpect their maſter, becauſe all that they can doe is after an eſpeciall manner as a debt due to their maſters: in which reſpect Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>when they haue done all that is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>commanded, they haue but done their dutie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I haue the rather noted, becauſe the practiſe of moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants is contrary thereunto. For while they worke for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they will cry out that they are ouer-burdened, and tired with that worke which they will eaſily goe thorow withall when they worke for themſelues. They that while they worke for their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, muſt be called to it againe and againe, and forced to ſtand to it, and to hold out till it be done, what paines will they take, how early will they riſe, how late will they ſit vp, how diligent will they be for themſelues? When Iourneymen receiue increaſe of wages according to the worke which they doe, they will diſpatch more then a prentiſe that hath but cloth, food, and lodging. Againe, many that in their maſters goods are very lauiſh, and waſtfull, when they come to befor themſelues are very ſparing, ſauing, and prouident. What doe theſe things argue but that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants doe not beare to their maſters that minde which they
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:3442:328"/>
ſhould: they doe not for them as they would doe for themſelues. Very requiſite it is therefore that the forenamed generall rule be obſerued.</p>
               <q>Hitherto of the ſeuerall kindes of ſeruants duties, and of the manner of performing them. It remaineth to ſpeake both of the extent of their duties, and alſo of the reſtraint of that extent.</q>

For this end let ſeruants note theſe two rules. The ſame extent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint <note place="margin">Extent of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants duties.</note> that was <note n="*" place="margin">Treat. 3. §. 63, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; Treat. 5. §. 35.</note> before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in laying forth the duties of other inferiors, is here alſo to be obſerued in the duties of ſeruants: for therein they all agree. The ſame rules ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that were before ſet downe, may here againe be applied. I refer the reader to thoſe places for a more large amplification of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals: and here I will content my ſelfe with adding ſuch particular proofes as are moſt proper and pertinent to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they <hi>labour to bring their iudgement to the bent of their maſters iudgement,</hi> and to thinke that meet and good which <note place="margin">Seruants muſt labour to bring their iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to agree with their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> he doth. Thus the <note n="c" place="margin">

                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> thoſe ſeruants yeeld to their maſter, who at firſt thought it vnmeet that he that had ten talents ſhould haue one peece more: and <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 28, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> thoſe ſeruants alſo, that at firſt thought it meet that the tares ſhould be plucked vp from the wheat. This rule is to be obſerued in the particular points before deliuered, as the worke which ſeruants doe, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:3442:329"/>
of doing it, their apparell, their allowance, yea and in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection which their maſter giueth them, and the reſt.</p>
               <p>Contrary is that great conceit which many ſeruants haue of <note place="margin">Seruants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their owne wit.</note> their owne iudgement, wit, and wiſdome, thinking themſelues wiſer then their maſters; as <hi>Gehazi,</hi> who oppoſing his owne wit to his maſters wiſdome, ſaid, <note n="f" place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 20.</note>

               <p>The ſecond rule which ſeruants muſt obſerue is this, that</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though they cannot in their iudgement thinke that fit to be done which their maſter will haue done, yet vpon his peremptorie command they muſt yeeld to the doing of it:</hi> It appeareth by <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> anſwer to Chriſt that he did ſo, for being commanded to let downe his net for a draught, thus he anſwereth, <hi>Maſter, we haue toyled all the night, and haue taken nothing</hi> (here he ſheweth that <note place="margin">

                  <p>Out of <hi>Ioabs</hi> example ſeruants may here learne in humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and reuerence to render ſome reaſons to moue their maſter not to preſſe vpon them that which they thinke to be vnmeet; but yet if their maſter will not hearken to their reaſons, but ſtand vpon his authoritie, <hi>his word muſt preuaile.</hi>

               <p>As a iuſt conſequence following from the forenamed extent and reſtraint of ſeruants duties, I may further gather theſe two leſſons for ſeruants.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is very behouefull that ſeruants make choice of good maſters: at leaſt if it be in their power to chuſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is behouefull that they continue and abide vnder good maſters: at leaſt if they continue ſeruants, and abide vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any maſters.</p>
               <p>That theſe conſequences iuſtly follow as aforeſaid, is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: for ſeeing ſeruants are bound to obey in all things which are not <hi>againſt God,</hi> and muſt obey in nothing but what is <hi>in the Lord,</hi> it is very requiſite that ſeruants be vnder ſuch maſters as beare the Image of God in the inward diſpoſition, and grace of their heart, as well as in their outward function and place: and will goe along with God in vſing their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, commanding nothing but what a ſeruant may doe with a good conſcience, and without tranſgreſſing againſt God: and forbidding nothing that God hath bound a ſeruant to doe. There will be comfort in ſeruing ſuch maſters: and our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:3442:331"/>
to them will be obedience to God. Such maſters there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be choſen. Yea and with ſuch muſt ſeruants abide, (if not with the very ſame, yet with ſuch as they are, of the ſame diſpoſition) for if they goe to other, their former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort will be taken away, and their ſeruitude will ſeeme ſo much the more miſerable, by how much more knowledge and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience they haue had of the benefit of their former libertie (for <note place="margin">Qui fidelem habet domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, ſaluo eius dominio, diligat vt patrem.</note> we may well call ſeruice vnder vnconſcionable maſters <hi>ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> and in oppoſition thereunto, ſeruice vnder religious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>libertie.)</hi> He therefore that hath a maſter that is faithfull, due reſpect had to his authoritie, muſt loue him as a father, and <note place="margin">

               <p>Contrary is the minde and practiſe of many ſeruants: they neuer inquire after the religious diſpoſition of their maſter, nor care though he be popiſh, or profane, ſo they may haue good wages, diet and lodging: and yet by this meanes, if at leaſt there be any ſparke of Gods feare in their heart, they caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpon many ſore temptations, and bring themſelues into many hard ſtraits, and dangerous ſnares. And, if God open their eies to ſee that wretched condition whereinto they haue implunged themſelues, they will be forced to crie out and

               <p>Hence it followeth that ſeruants in performing duty to their maſter performe duty to Chriſt, and in rebelling againſt their maſter they rebell againſt Chriſt; as the Lord ſaid to <hi>Samuel</hi> of the peoples reiecting his gouernment, <hi>they haue not reiected</hi>

                  <hi>will of God,</hi> which declareth the ground of ſeruants ſubiection.

                  <hi>proue what is the will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Good reaſon there is to preſſe this reaſon: for</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gods will is the very ground of goodneſſe: things are therefore good becauſe they are agreeable to Gods will: Gods will giueth the very being to goodneſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Gods will is a rule to ſquare all our actions by, euen as the kings ſtatutes and proclamations are to his ſubiects.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is a perfect rule <hi>(the law of the Lord is perfect)</hi> ſo as we <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7.</note> may be ſure not to ſwerue, if we hold cloſe thereunto.</p>

                  <pb n="643" facs="tcp:3442:332"/>
4. It is a ſufficient rule, it will giue euery one (and among other, ſeruants) direction how to carry themſelues in euery thing they take in hand, yea in euery thing that appertaineth to them. For, <hi>Gods word is giuen to make vs perfect, thorowly</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>furniſhed vnto all good workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It is a good warrant to iuſtifie vs in all our actions: ſo as, going along with it, we need not care what any man can ſay againſt vs. If a man be ſure that he haue ſtatute law, or the kings proclamation on his ſide, he is bold.</p>
               <p>From this reaſon which is of ſuch weight, I gather two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to adde force to this motiue.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſeruants obey their maſters, is no arbitrary matter, but a neceſſary duty: not left to his will whether he will doe it or no, but a thing whereunto he is bound: and that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by ciuill conſtitutions of men, but alſo by a diuine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God: ſo as it is not only a matter of ciuill policy, but alſo of conſcience, to be done for conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That no creature can diſpence with ſeruants, ſo as they ſhould be exempted from doing their duty to their maſter. If they could, they were greater then God, and their will aboue Gods will. Among creatures, maſters themſelues are to be reckoned: now becauſe it is Gods will that ſeruants ſhould be in ſubiection, their maſters cannot exempt them from it. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may let them goe free: but retaining them as ſeruants, they cannot exempt them from a ſeruants ſubiection. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though maſters be careleſſe in exacting dutie, yet let ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants be conſcionable in yeelding duty, becauſe it is Gods will.</p>

For if any aske, what if maſters ſtand in Chriſts ſtead, what maketh that to the purpose? ſurely it maketh much to moue ſeruants: becauſe maſters ſtand in his roome who will reward that which is done for his ſake.</p>
               <p>If againe they aske, what benefit is it to be Chriſts ſeruant? it may be anſwered, <hi>very great:</hi> for Chriſt will reward all his ſeruants.</p>

                  <hi>he changed his behauiour, and fained himſelfe mad, and ſcrabled on doores, and let his ſpittle fall downe vpon his beard:</hi> and againe, <note n="c" place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 3, 5.</note> when he gaue ſuch reines to his paſſion, for the death of his traiterous ſonne <hi>Abſolom,</hi> as <hi>his people being aſhamed ſtole away from him,</hi> and <hi>Ioab</hi> his ſeruant was forced roundly to tell him of it, ſaying, <hi>thou haſt ſhamed this day the faces of all thy ſeruants,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Miſtreſſes oft loſe their authoritie by conſpiring with their ſeruants to goe abroad, take away goods, goſſip, and doe ſuch other like things priuily without their husbands conſent: they make themſelues thereby ſlaues to their ſeruants, not daring to doe any thing which may offend their ſeruants, leſt they ſhould diſcouer to their maſters ſuch lewd pranks as their Miſtreſſes did.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When maſters are too remiſſe and ſheepiſh: intreating and <note place="margin">2.

Howſoeuer this might be counted meekneſſe, and gentleneſſe towards equals and ſtrangers, ouer whom we haue no authoritie, yet towards ſeruants it is too baſe remiſneſſe: yea it is a relin quiſhing of that power which God hath giuen, and whereof God will take an account.</p>

The proofes alleadged for ſeruants obedience to maſters care in this point, doe ſhew that this dutie appertaineth to maſters. See Treat. 7. §. 15.</p>
               <p>The reſpect which maſters owe to God, themſelues, their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, the Church, and Common-wealth where they liue, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth as much.</p>

For there is no ſuch meanes to ſtirre vp ſeruants to doe all good dutie, as the feare of God planted in their hearts. That ſeruant that ſhall finde true grace either firſt wrought, or further increaſed in him by his maſtersmeanes, will thinke him ſelfe ſo beholding to ſuch a maſter, as he ſhall neuer be able to make any ſufficient recompence, &amp; therefore will endeuour to do what good ſeruice he can in way of thankfulnes: he will not only be faithfull &amp; diligent in his buſineſſe, but he will call vpon God
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:3442:344"/>
to proſper his ſeruice for his maſters good, and to recompence that kindneſſe which his maſter hath done to him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No earthly thing that a maſter can doe for his ſeruant (be it portion of money, preferment to any place of profit or credit, or skill in a good trade and calling) can be comparable to the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſeruant in grace.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Seruants well inſtructed in pietie are likelieſt to proue moſt profitable not only to the familie, but alſo to the Church and Common-wealth where they liue.</p>
               <p>That maſters may the better edifie their ſeruants,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They muſt daily inſtruct them in the principles of religion, <note place="margin">Directions for edifying ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</note> and all duties of pietie: admirable is the profit which will ariſe from a daily and conſtant vſe of religious exerciſes: though but a little time be ſpent at once, yet will much knowledge be gained by a frequent vſe of them. This dutie is ſo much the more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, becauſe publike Miniſters cannot take ſuch particular notice of euery ſeruant in their Pariſhes, as maſters may in their families.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Maſters muſt cauſe their ſeruants to goe to the publike mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the word, and worſhip of God, to be further built vp thereby, and confirmed in their faith. Maſters vnder the Law were <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exo.</hi> 12. 44.</note> commanded to let their ſeruants eat of the Paſſeouer, which was a ſolemne ſacrament. The Law which enioyneth all males to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare <note place="margin">

This dutie muſt eſpecially be performed on the Lords day: for the charge giuen to maſters in the fourth commandement for ſanctifying that day, is extended to ſeruants in theſe words, <hi>Thou, nor thy man-ſeruant, nor thy maid-ſeruant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Maſters, beſide inſtructing ſeruants at home, and cauſing them to goe to Church, muſt take an account of their profiting, both by the publike, and alſo by the priuate meanes of edification. Otherwiſe they ſhall not know how to order their manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them: when to giue them milke, &amp; when ſtrong meat.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To make the meanes more effectuall and profitable, they muſt to inſtruction adde prayer. Meanes, without Gods bleſſing vpon the meanes, are nothing.

               <p>There are two extremes contrary to this dutie. One of thoſe that are too niggardly, and (as we ſpeake) miſerable in the allowance of food to their ſeruants: and that ſometimes in the quantitie, when ſeruants bellies are too much pinched: euen ſo as their bodies are weakned for want of food.

This point concerneth thoſe maſters eſpecially that finde their ſeruants (as we ſpeake) and prouide all things for them: as in old time maſters did for moſt ſeruants, and as now they doe for prentiſes whether male or female. If ſeruants by coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be at their owne finding for apparell, maſters are not ſo ſtrictly bound therein: yet they muſt haue a care that their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants fall neither into the one extreme of too baſe, ſlouen-like, or ſluttiſh apparell, nor into the other of too gariſh, or too coſtly apparell.

               <p>Though labour and paines be proper to a ſeruants place, yet he may be ſo put vnto it, as the health and ſtrength of his body may be impaired thereby. For the well ordering of this therefore a dutie lieth vpon maſters: and that in two things eſpecially.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they well moderate the labour whereunto they put their ſeruants, ſo as they may be able for the time to vndergoe it, and to endure ſo long as their time of labour is appointed. It was a good reaſon which <hi>Saul</hi> rendred to keepe <hi>Dauid</hi> from <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 33.</note> entring combat with <hi>Goliah,</hi> becauſe (as he thought) <hi>Dauid was not able to fight againſt the Philiſtim, Dauid being a youth, and Goliah a man of warre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed if <hi>Dauids</hi> faith had not exceeded the ſtrength of his body, it had beene vnmeet to haue put <hi>Dauid</hi> to that taske.</p>
               <p>They which are put to things aboue their abilitie, are like to faile, and ſinke vnder the burden of them.</p>
               <p>It is contrary hereunto to put ſeruants to ſuch hard taskes
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:3442:347"/>
as impaire their ſtrength, endanger their lims, and venture their liues. <hi>Saul</hi> ſhall riſe vp in iudgement againſt ſuch: for he ſuppoſing that it was too hard a taske for <hi>Dauid</hi> to vndertake combat with <hi>Goliah,</hi> was loth to put him to it. <hi>Dauid</hi> excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 33.</note> failed herein, when he gaue direction that <hi>Vriah</hi> ſhould be ſet in the <hi>forefront of the hotteſt battell,</hi> and yet the Generall <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 15,</note> with his ſtrength to retire from him.

               <p>It is alſo a fault in this kinde, to put ſeruants to ſuch toiling <note place="margin">

               </head>
               <p n="2">2. The other thing required of maſters for wel ordering their ſeruants worke is, that they afford their ſeruants things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and behouefull for that worke whereunto they are put: which minde was commendable in <hi>Saul,</hi> who aſſaied if his <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 38.</note> armour might be fit for <hi>Dauid</hi> when he was to goe againſt <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah.</hi> To reckon vp all the particulars were an infinite taske: euery ſeuerall trade and worke hath proper meanes of helpe appertaining to it: this generall direction may be ſufficient to moue maſters to applie it to the particular workes and ſeruices whereunto they put their ſeruants. Fit meanes are ſuch an helpe, as that which with them may eaſily be done, without them can hardly, if poſſibly at all be done.</p>
               <p>It is contrary hereunto to deale with ſeruants as the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did with the Iſraelites, exacting worke at their hands, and <note place="margin">

               <p>There are two eſpeciall times of reſt, which ſeruants may not be denied.

               </p>
               <p>The firſt is ordinary for all liuing creatures: for it was one <note place="margin">Seruants muſt reſt in the night time.</note> principall-reaſon why God cauſed the light of the Sunne to be withdrawen from the face of the earth, that the inhabitants thereof might reſt from their labour. <hi>Vntill the euening</hi> man <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 23.</note> goeth forth vnto his labour and worke. Time of darkneſſe is more fit for reſt then worke. Let not this be ſo taken as if no worke were to be done, after the light of the day is taken away: (then would but little worke be done in the depth of winter, when the daies are ſhort: and then would not God haue affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded artificiall lights) but to ſhew that difference muſt be made betwixt the day and night: and that the night is affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for that time wherein men are moſt to reſt.</p>
               <p>The other time of reſt (being the Sabbath day) is by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine <note place="margin">Seruants muſt reſt on the Lords day. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 3.</note> inſtitution.

               <p>And if ſeruants be impudent in ſinning, and neither faire nor foule meanes will reclaime them, they muſt then be thruſt out of doores.

               <p>In this reſpect this reaſon is both as <hi>a ſpur,</hi> and as <hi>a curbe</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to maſters.</p>
               <p>As <hi>a ſpur,</hi> to pricke them on forward conſcionably to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all thoſe duties which are required of them: for they haue a maſter that will take notice thereof, and reward them for it. As they approue, and recompence the good ſeruice which their ſeruants doe: ſo much more will their maſter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue and recompence them if they doe well. Doe maſters therefore looke that their ſeruants ſhould performe their duty? let them then performe theirs: for there is the ſame reaſon of both. Let this be applied to all the particular duties before mentioned.</p>

to their ſeruants but what they can be able to iuſtifie vnto their owne maſter. With this curbe did God hold in the Iſraelites, ſaying, <note n="b" place="margin">

The conceit which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue that they are free, vnder none, to giue no account, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them both negligent of their owne dutie, and inſolent ouer others; as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who ſaid, <note n="g" place="margin">

                  <hi>fellow ſeruants.</hi> For howſoeuer in outward dignity there is great difference betwixt maſter and ſeruant, yet as the ſeruants of God they are of a like condition, and in many things may be accounted equall: eſpecially if both be of the ſame faith, and ſo brethren in Chriſt. This is another <hi>ſpur</hi> and <hi>curbe</hi> too.</p>
               <p>A <hi>ſpur</hi> in that God will the more kindly accept that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which maſters doe to their ſeruants, becauſe it is done to Gods ſeruants.</p>
               <p>A <hi>curbe,</hi> in that ſeruants ſhall be heard before God as well as maſters, for he is the maſter of both.</p>
               <p>Many thinke that all the kindneſſe which is ſhewed to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants is loſt, becauſe they are ſo meane as they are able to make no recompence. But their maſter is able.</p>
               <p>Others thinke, their ſeruants can neuer take any reuenge of them, and thereupon vſe them as they liſt. But the maſter of ſeruants, who is alſo the maſter of maſters, can take vengeance, euen ſuch as ſhall make maſters ſorely repent all the wrong they haue done.</p>
               <p>If maſters did duely weigh this point, that, howſoeuer in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of outward gouernment there be ſome difference betwixt them and their ſeruants, yet before God they are as fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, would they be ouer-rigorous and cruell? would they not be kinde and gentle?</p>

               <p>The third reaſon (taken from the place of God, <hi>in heauen)</hi> declareth the ſurpaſſing excellencie of that great maſter, who is the common maſter of maſters and of ſeruants: and it addeth an edge to the former motiues.</p>

1. It ſheweth that though the wrong which maſters doe to their ſeruants be within the walls of their houſe, ſo as no mortall eye can ſee it, yet God who is in heauen ſeeth it: and though ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants cannot be admitted into the courts of men to make their complaint, yet heauen is open to them; to that great maſter that is in heauen they may haue acceſſe when they will. That which made the euill ſteward deale hardly with his fellowes, was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 48.</note> which he had of his maſters abſence. But no ſuch conceit can they haue of this great maſter, who know that he is in heauen, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 15. 3.</note> that as heauen is ouer euery place, ſo <hi>the eyes of the Lord are in euery place, and behold the euill and good:</hi> he ſeeth all the good, and all the euill that maſters doe to their ſeruants.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſheweth that the kindneſſe which the Lord will repay, and the vengeance which he will inflict, is infinitely greater then the good or euill that maſters can doe to their ſeruants, euen as heauen i, higher then earth, and as he that is in heauen is greater then they that are on earth. Doeſt thou therefore, who art a maſter on earth, reioyce, or grieue the ſoule of thy ſeruant? God in heauen can much more make glad or ſad thy ſoule. Doeſt thou therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the fauour, or feare the frownes of thy maſter in heauen? ſhew fauour to thy ſeruant on earth, and forbeare threatning. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the infinite diſparitie betwixt thy maſterſhip and Gods, and this will the more moue thee to deale with thy ſeruant, as thou wouldeſt haue God deale with thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſheweth that there is much more reaſon we ſhould take notice of our ſeruants, of their paines, of their diligence, and of their faithfulneſſe, then that God ſhould take notice of ours: and leſſe reaſon that we ſhould ſcorne, or neglect our ſeruants, then God ſcorne or neglect vs. For there is far greater difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and vs, then betwixt vs and our ſeruants.

               <p>The fourth reaſon (in theſe words, <hi>neither is there reſpect of perſons with him)</hi> declareth Gods iuſt and equall manner of proceeding with all men, of what ranke and degree ſoeuer. God will doe the ſame things to all ſorts of maſters that they doe to their ſeruants. To the conſideration of this impartiall iuſtice of God doth the Apoſtle call maſters, both becauſe of that outward power which they haue ouer their ſeruants, and alſo becauſe for the moſt part maſters are backt with the power and authority of magiſtrates on earth, who in matters of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt maſter and ſeruant are ordinarily partiall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting maſters more then ſeruants.</p>
               <p>But let maſters here learne to caſt off all ſuch fond conceits, and fooliſh hopes. Though they be higher in place, haue more wealth, and better friends then their ſeruants, and though men who haue carnall eies may thereby be much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to reſpect them, yet will not God goe an haires bredth from iuſtice for the whole world. If the greateſt man that euer was in the world ſhould haue a ſeruant that were the meaneſt that euer was, and a caſe betwixt that maſter and that ſeruant ſhould come before God, God would not any whit at all leane to that maſter more then to the ſeruant. If the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that be abuſe the meaneſt, they ſhall not eſcape. Wherfore, O maſters, giue no iuſt cauſe of complaint to any ſeruant.</p>
