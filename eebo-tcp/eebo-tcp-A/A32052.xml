            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>My Friends, many there are whose beginning is better than their lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end: but <hi>blessed are they who dye in the Lord,</hi> who have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in the Everlasting Covenant, and in <hi>the sure mercies of David:</hi> though God may <hi>visit their Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with a Rod, and their Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions with Stripes, yet he will never suffer his loving kindness to depart.</hi> Who would then, depart from that God, who sticks so close to his? If we leave him whither shall we go? surely to <hi>broken Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterns that hold no water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh then, as you love your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and immortal Souls, endeavour close Vnion and strict Communion with him. As you are chosen by him, so let him be your choyce: Since he first loved you, let it not be lost. He cast his eye upon us <hi>when we were in our Blood, and no eye pittied us;</hi> and <hi>he spread his Skirt over us, and then was the time of love.</hi> Ah then, if he loved us so unlovely, what estimation should we have of him, who is love it self? Consider what he hath
<pb facs="tcp:53997:3"/>
done for you, in giving life, health, and above all, his beloved Son to dye for you a most ignominious death, that you through him migh have everlasting life. That you may know how to value this transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love of God, weigh well the condition you were at that time in; lamentably helpless, <hi>Dead in Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes and Sins, without God, and without Christ in the world, stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Commonwealth of</hi> Israel <hi>and to the Promises.</hi> This we were in the general: but what were we as to our best, our Righteousness? so bad, that nothing could be worse; no better than <hi>menstruous Cloaths</hi> and <hi>filthy Rags.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Humiliation, what Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation doth our condition call for! Little reason to walk so haughtily as we do, and with the Pharisee to say, <hi>Stand farther off, I am holier than thou.</hi> For shame then, come with humble <hi>Job</hi> in his prostrate State, <hi>Abhor your selves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in dust and ashes:</hi> or with the Prophet cry out, <hi>Wo is me, I am undone, a man of unclean lips;
<pb facs="tcp:53997:4"/>
mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts:</hi> A dreadful sight undoubtedly, that should be so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishing to one whom God honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in making use of his blood for a Testimony of his truth: how much more must it needs be to us, whose lives are so unclean, that there is no soundness in us? What neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity is there then of finding out a way to look God in the face? there is but one; and Blessed, and for ever Blessed be his gratious Name, for the Revelation of it, and that is <hi>Jesus Christ, the onely Mediator betwixt God and Man.</hi> What had become of us, had he not interposed betwixt the wrath of an incensed Majesty and sinful Creatures? Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance had been speedily Executed, and all that long-suffering and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience which is now exercised to us-ward had been prevented; we should not have had <hi>line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little;</hi> his faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters instructing, exhorting, and dehorting, if hereby the torrent of his Ire had not been stopt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53997:4"/>How highly then ought we to prize this Talent, and to let no day nor time of it pass without doing him some service, who hath been so benigne and merciful to us! If men do kindnesses to ingenuous minds, what thoughtfulness is there of recompence, in so much that they declare it to all their friends, and enquire and advise what returns will best suit the nature of their received friendships: How much more should we with David <hi>declare what God hath done for us,</hi> and always walk in thankfulness towards him? For this <hi>the grace of God teacheth us, to deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously and soberly in this present evil world:</hi> Not to turn wanton Libertines, saying, God is good and merciful, and hath sent his Son to dye in our stead, nothing remaining for us to do, but like the children of the old world, to <hi>eat and to drink, and to rise up to play:</hi> This bespeaks men to be of that number of whom <hi>Jude</hi> in his general Epistle makes mention, <hi>ordained of old to this
<pb facs="tcp:53997:5"/>
condemnation, denying the onely Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> How indeed can we more disown him, than by casting his laws behinde our backs, and saying as those wicked wretches did, <hi>We will not have this man to reign over us;</hi> although he was <hi>Lord of all,</hi> and told them <hi>his yoak was easie and his burthen light,</hi> and that <hi>his ways were ways of pleasantness, and his paths were peace.</hi> Think not that these things were written for <hi>their instruction</hi> onely, but <hi>ours also, on whom the ends of the world are come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But lest I should burden you with too tedious an Epistle, I will rather invite you to feed on those whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some remains which you will finde collected from the Writings of those Eminent and Renowned men prefixt in the Title of this Miscelany; whose worth should I undertake to display, it would prove an Eclipse, coming short of your Estimations, and those choice and elaborate Works which will eternize their Memories to all gratious hearts. The best use we can
<pb facs="tcp:53997:5"/>
make of their loss is, to study dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently what they once designed for our benefit, and to be provoked by their good conversation to emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I beseech you therefore let not their, nor my poor Labours, in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering these crums from their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, be lost; but that we may have cause to <hi>rejoyce in this, the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Conscience, that in Simplicity and Godly Sincerity we have had our conversations in the World;</hi> as wisheth</p>

            <head>DIVINE SENTENCES, COLLECTED From the VVorks of Mr. <hi>EDMVND CALAMY,</hi> Lately deceased.</head>
            <p>GOd requires we should morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our lufts: for prayer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, is the service of a Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite.</p>
            <p>Let not any one despair, and cry out I am undone; but let him trust in God, and use his just endeavours: For any man may be happy if he please.</p>
            <p>Sin is a Christians greatest Sore, and Repentance his surest Salve: Who then would want the rare Jewel of Repentance, since <hi>if ye seek, ye shall find?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sin bringeth shame and sorrow; and Piety a portion of everlasting Joys.</p>
            <p>Miserable is that man, whose heart is too hard to pray.</p>
            <p>He that truly repents of his sin, shall never repent of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53997:11"/>
for repentance is as the Hammer of the heart, knocking at the Gate of Heaven; and <hi>to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us cloath our selves with Righteousness; it is the safest Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour against the Darts of Satan.</p>
            <p>If troubles or afflictions shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall thee, say as a late Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine said, <hi>I will go, and bless</hi> God; for I believe this will be for my good.</p>
            <p>There are two Gospel-Graces which require your special heed, <hi>(viz.) Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance:</hi> for though many go to Hell by despair, more go thither by presumption.</p>
            <p>It was the saying of the Learned Sir <hi>Thomas Moore,</hi> I will never pin my Faith upon the sleeve of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, for he may carry it where I would be unwilling to follow.</p>
            <p>You must serve God for his sake, as well as Heaven's.</p>
            <p>A faithful servant of God may have an eye to the recompence of reward, as <hi>Moses</hi> had; but he must have but one eye, and that the left: for our chief and last aim must be at the Glory of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53997:11"/>The true way of serving God, is to obey him as a Servant, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him as a Son.</p>
            <p>Strive to be good in all concerns; to be good Subjects, good Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, good Dealers, good Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, good Masters, and good Neighbours: so will God love you and bless you, and the rest respect you.</p>
            <p>Account sin the evil of evils, and rather embarce the greatest sorrow, than the least sin.</p>
            <p>If God hath bestowed Graces on thee, communicate them to others in your convenient conversations: for true Grace is of a spreading na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; affectual Grace will labour to convert others.</p>
            <p>There are but two Roads that lead to Heaven; the one is called <hi>Innocence,</hi> the other is <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If God hath conferr'd more gifts, either of Grace or Nature, upon thee, than upon another, thou must study to improve them: for as thou expectest more light from the Sun than from a Candle, so will God expect more duty in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53997:12"/>
than from a lesser light.</p>
            <p>For the better the Wages is, the better should the service be.</p>
            <p>Holy Wisdom, mixt with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, are like Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver.</p>
            <p>To disobey God in a little, is no small disobedience: for no sin can be said to be little, since the least sin without Repentance, and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God, is big enough to damn a man.</p>
            <p>A Sword can but kill a mouse, and a Bodkin may kill a man.</p>
            <p>Humiliation, without Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will not shew a man the way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Despise not the Ministers of Christ: for it is Christ that is the Word, and they are his Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors.</p>
            <p>To make you the more capable of serving God, be frequent in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>Consider, the Great God whom ye serve, alters not, neither must his Servants.</p>
            <p>Thou mayst safely serve the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, if thou canst find out a corner
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53997:12"/>
that is secret from the all-seeing eye of God.</p>
            <p>To flatter thy self, is to cheat thy Soul.</p>
            <p>Labour first for the Kingdom of Heaven, and all other things shall be given.</p>
            <p>We say (in temporal affairs) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays are dangerous; how much more dangerous in spiritual, when thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting Peace is concerned?</p>
            <p>Defer not your Repentance till you are old: shall the Devil have the Flower of your age, and God the Bran?</p>
            <p>The Spirit of Prayer is more pretious than Treasures of Gold and Silver.</p>
            <p>If thou art marryed, beware of Cares and Strifes; let your Cares be, which shall be most zealous in the service of God; and your Strifes be, which shall love the other best; so will your Cares and Strifes be turned into a comfortable pleasure.</p>
            <p>If there be want of mutual affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between man and wife, and the one suffer vaxations and affronts for a time, yet do thy obedience
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53997:13"/>
to the Lord, and thou shalt find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the end.</p>

            <p>As the Waves of the Sea are troublesome and unfixt, so are the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53997:13"/>
Thoughts and Actions of a wicked man.</p>
            <p>If thou risest from a low estate to a great one, it is but like stepping from a Boat or Barge, into a Ship; thy dangers continue, for thou art still upon the Sea.</p>
            <p>The way to be either lov'd, or envy'd, is to serve God betimes; so shall God and good men love thee, and wicked men envy thy Glories.</p>
            <p>If thou art afflicted, remember afflictions are Gods Potions, which thou mayst sweeten by Faith and Prayer: but take heed of Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Unbelief, for those two ingredients will make them bitter as Gall.</p>
            <p>To be a servant to sin,<note place="margin">Joh. 6.18.</note> is to be a shameful and an unfruitful slave.</p>
            <p>But in the service of God,<note place="margin">Joh. 8.36.</note> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect freedom.</p>
            <p>Blessed are those that receive the Word of God into their hearts, as well as into their ears.</p>
            <p>For formal service is but an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shew of Devotion, and only an act of dissembling with him that will not be mocked.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53997:14"/>The name of Christianity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a real Practice, is but an empty Title, and a dead Faith. It can be but a small satisfaction to a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, to seem to go to Heaven.</p>
            <p>But to go neer Heaven, and at last miscarry, is as fatal as a double Hell.</p>
            <p>Be merciful and charitable, as well as pious: as you freely receive, freely give. If thou art rich, be pious too; if both, be rich in good works. God doth not delight in the niggardly Christian.</p>
            <p>Beware of Apostacie, the craft of which sin, is to deprave your judgments from the truths of Christ, your affections from your love to Christ, and your conversations from a zealous walking with Christ.</p>
            <p>Meditate frequently on the four last things;
<list>
                  <item>Heaven,</item>
                  <item>Hell,</item>
                  <item>Death,</item>
                  <item>Judgment.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The meditation of Heaven will be so inviting to you, that your mind will more and more affect it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:53997:14"/>The Meditation of Hell, will teach you to abhor the place and the torments of the Damned.</p>
            <p>The meditation of Death, will direct you in your preparations for death.</p>
            <p>The meditation of Judgment, will draw you neerer to God and teach you to avoid sin.</p>
            <p>Nothing separates God and man, but sin; and the only way to remove that Wall of separation is, by a true and hearty Repentance and Reformation.</p>
            <p>Sin not only makes a difference betwixt God and Man, but betwixt Nation and Nation, and sets the whole World at Variance.</p>
            <p>Repentance carrieth with it a Divine Rhetorick, and perswades Christ to forgive multitudes of sins committed against himself.</p>
            <p>It is the only glorious Star, that leads us to the everlasting Son.</p>
            <p>It is impossible to dive into the secrets of Almighty God; no man hath a key to his Closet, nor knows the length of his Patience: The old world had one hundred and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53997:15"/>
twenty years; <hi>Ierusalem</hi>'s destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction forty years; <hi>Nineveh</hi> had but forty days; and <hi>Lot</hi> had but one nights warning for the destruction of <hi>Sodom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some there are, and not a few, that abuse the Mercies bestowed upon them, that may justly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Dung-hills, that the often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they receive the Sun-shine of Blessings, the more apt they are to be corrupted.</p>
            <p>Many there are that enjoy Health, Wealth, and Honour; yet attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute all to their good fortunes, and forget to thank that bountiful hand that bestows them.</p>
            <p>Like Swine, they drink of the Waters of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and look not up to the Fountain from whence they flow.</p>
            <p>But he that regardeth not those Mercies he receives, mindeth not his own interest, and despiseth his best Friends.</p>
            <p>A Meadow affords no pleasure to a Swine, but the Mire doth: even so, an ungodly man, that only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Christianity, is as a fish
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53997:15"/>
upon the shore, that lives a while, but with no delight, because out of its own Element.</p>
            <p>Afflictions and miseries happen by Gods permitment, and <hi>whom he loveth he chastiseth:</hi> those griefs are for the good of them that love God; therefore beware of sin, that makes your sorrows bitter, and minde not the Rod so much, as him from whom the Rod comes, lest that teach you both to fret and faint.</p>
            <p>As Sheep make every place the better where they come, and Goats make every place the worse; so is it with a Saint, and with a Sinner; the first bringeth sweetness along with him, and the other leaves a stink behind him.</p>
            <p>Win what thou canst by Prayer, with comfort thou shalt enjoy the purchase.</p>

               <p>The sinner is always grinding at the Devils Mill; and the Devil is no less busie in supplying the Hopper, lest his Mill should stand still.</p>

               <p>The first that named Gods Name in Scripture, was the Devil, and he likewise confess'd our Saviour to be the Son of God; however, he was the Devil notwithstanding that.</p>
               <p>If you will not follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of your Saviours life, you will merit nothing by his death.</p>
               <p>God will not be perswaded to save us, if we will not be perswaded to serve him.</p>
               <p>Be careful to frequent the Church; for publike Worship is the Pillar of Religion, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Service of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>In the Church be careful to serve God, for you are before the eyes of God and Man.</p>
               <p>It is not only a scandal to man, but a defiance to the Deity, to be careless of our duties in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of those that come to seek his face.</p>

               <p>Well may he be punished that misbehaves himself in the Church, when the Devils misbehaviour cast him out of Heaven.</p>

               <p>It is dangerous to be rich; for riches tempt men to be covetous, and to delight in Gold besides: <hi>Riches have wings, and flie away,</hi>

               <p>Take heed of giving thy self the liberty of committing one sin;

for that will lead thee to another, till by an ill custom it becometh natural.</p>
               <p>That disease is desperate, which to keep is death, and to part with is impossible.</p>
               <p>To begin an evil is of ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it teacheth one to shake hands with shame; but to continue in it, hardens the heart, and leads it till it be past grace.</p>
               <p>To begin a sin, is to lay a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a continuance; this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance is the Mother of Custom, and Impudence at last the Issue.</p>

               <p>Our God is a living God, and loves not dull and drowsie Saints: we must not only serve him in this life, but we must have life in our service.</p>
               <p>Hast thou sinned? repent: behold, the Lord holds a bottle for thy Tears.</p>
               <p>Call no sin little, it will require a great stock of Penitence: take heed of purchasing a sin, till thou knowest the price.</p>

               <p>And it is the pleasure of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout man to promote the Interest of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>He that will be false to God, can never be true to man.</p>
               <p>It is good to be of a true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but it is ill not to be true in that Religion.</p>
               <p>If God be against you, who then can take your part?</p>
               <p>Will God that made you, save you, if you will not serve him?</p>
               <p>Consider, it was Christ that dyed for you, it is he that either saves or condemns you; flatter not your self with a vain conceit: can man be more merciful than God?</p>
               <p>The Epicure that delighteth in the variety of dainties of this World, little thinketh that those very crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will one day witness against him.</p>
               <p>The Gallant that glories in the pride of his Habit, will likewise

be tried by his Garments.</p>
               <p>The heaps of Treasure which the worldling hoardeth up, will be an evidence against him.</p>
               <p>Time will be, when Time shall call the Drunkard to account for his waste of time.</p>
               <p>Fornicators and Adulterers will at last with sorrow remember the date of their former sins.</p>
               <p>The consequences of a sinners life will appear against him, charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with the ruine of Wife and Children, disquieting of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and impoverishing of other Families.</p>
               <p>It is better to be a <hi>Lazarus</hi> in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and to want the relief of this World, than to be richly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, to fare deliciously, and hereafter to want a drop of water to quench the flames of an incensed Mercie.</p>
               <p>The way to live in Heaven, is to live heavenly upon Earth.</p>
               <p>Do not pretend to believe more than you do believe, and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that belief.</p>
               <p>If you would be wholly God's

               <p>Better it is to serve God than man: purity is better than impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: feasting is noysome, because it makes you sick.</p>
               <p>Why do ye wallow in the mire? because ye have the natures of Swine.</p>
               <p>The Lord hath made the world and us, that we in it may serve him; and that is the duty of man.</p>
               <p>The sinner will be accused not onely by his own conscience, but his familiar companions.</p>
               <p>Grieve not the Spirit now, lest it grieve you hereafter.</p>
               <p>Your intentions to Repentance, and the neglect of that Soul-saving duty, will rise up in Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you.</p>
               <p>The Righteous and the Wicked will be tried by their Consciences, and that will discover the whole truth.</p>
               <p>Study that Lesson which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> hath set before you, <hi>To have always a Conscience void of offence towards God and towards man.</hi>

               <p>Justice hath leaden feet, but iron hands; and it is but just, that they that encourage one another to sin, should at last condemn each other.</p>
               <p>It will be but cold comfort at the great Tribunal, for sinners to remember their past follies.</p>

               <p>The holy Quire of Angels will point to the sinners Conscience, and that will answer, I am acquainted with all your sins.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Palm-tree is an excellent Tree, and often the praises of God are resembled by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:53997:32"/>This Tree grows in the purest soil: It will not grow in filthy places, in dungy places, but it loves a very pure soil.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 34.17.</note>The Palm-Trees Branches grow all upward; there's none grow out of the side, as other Trees.</p>
            <p>The Righteous, their affections are set upon things above; they grow up Heaven-ward.</p>
            <p>They do not shoot out their Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches this way, or that way, to the World.</p>
            <p>The Palm-Tree is always green; green in Winter as well as Summer: It doth not cast its Leaf nor fade.</p>
            <p>The Righteous hold-up their Profession in Summers Prosperity, and in the very Winter of Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.</p>
            <p>The Palm-Tree, it is a Tree that is full of Fruit; good Fruit, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

Fruit, sweet Fruit, a kind of cordial Fruit.</p>
            <p>The Righteous have the Green of Profession, and the fruitfulness of their conversation; and 'tis plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Fruit, Fruits of Righteousness, Fruits of Faith, Fruits of Love, and the Fruits of the Spirit.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The Palm-Tree grows most when it is most press'd down by weights.</p>
            <p>When the World would crush the Righteous,<note place="margin">Psal. 37.17.</note> and press them down to the Earth, yea press them down to Hell; yet they grow up more and more.</p>
            <p>

               <note place="margin">Psal. 73.1.</note> but they multiplied and grew, not onely in company, but also in their lives.</p>
            <p>The good Seed falling upon good Ground, brought forth in some an hundred-fold.</p>
            <p>They fall into trouble, God helps them up,<note place="margin">Zach 2.5.</note> they are purged and made white; the fire shall not burn, but refine them.</p>
            <p>Afflictions strengthen: Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion works Patience, and then Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience Experience, and Experience Hope.</p>

            <p>Grace improved, is very near to Glory.</p>
            <p>The weights upon the Righteous do wean them from the World.</p>
            <p>Now when the Soul is delivered from this world, this evil world, it must needs flourish up to the other world.</p>
            <p>The School of the Cross, is the School of Light;</p>
            <p>Which discovers the worlds va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, baseness and wickedness,</p>
            <p>And lets us see more of Gods mind. Out of the dark of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there comes a spiritual light.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 3.7</note>We see the worth of Grace, and of an Interest in Christ.</p>
            <p>And the excellencie of Jesus Christ himself, as of an interest in, so of the person of Christ; how glorious, how choice!</p>
            <p>This knowledge is not notional, a Brain-knowledge, but experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental.</p>
            <p>These weights draw them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse more at home, to be acquainted more with their own bosomes.</p>

               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:53997:33"/>How it is with grace, what Faith, what Love, what Patience!</p>
            <p>When the world is kind to us, fair with us, and flatters us, and hugs us, and embraces us, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to forget and to slight Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>But when the worlds weights are upon us, we have promises of more of the presence of God, and of the presence of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>The purpose of the world when they hang their weights upon the Palm-Trees, is to keep them down, that their graces multiply not.</p>
            <p>To discourage, to turn them quite aside, to renounce, to forsake and apostatize.</p>
            <p>But they have fail'd in it, and the truth flourished more: this hath been rather a furtherance to it.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath a Flail of Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to separate the Chaff from the Wheat.</p>

feed, and grow fat, and flourish, and increase.</p>
            <p>This we are to bless the Lord for, that our Afflictions do not snare us, but are a Table to our graces.</p>

            </p>
            <p>They that are good indeed, shall have a good name; they shall walk in white.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:53997:35"/>To keep the Conscience clean, is to keep the Credit clean; and they who are careful not to blot their conversations, Christ will take care of their reputations, that they be not blotted.</p>
            <p>The Old Worthies kept their Garments undefiled, and it was by the power of Faith; keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the pollutions of the World, they kept themselves a good report. This honour and good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which we get by keeping our Garments undefiled, is sure.</p>
            <p>Sometimes God's people are not onely honourable in Gods eyes, but they sometimes walk in white in the eyes of the men of the World:<note place="margin">Rev. 3.4</note> He can give his people room in the opinions of men; he moves their hearts to think well of them, and he opens their mouths to speak well of them.</p>
            <p>It is not much to us what the wicked World judge of us, yet God doth sometimes raise a Testimony of Honour for his people amongst Carnal men of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioseph</hi> would not defile his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53997:35"/>
he walked in white amongst men. True, he was cast into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, what of that? he was respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Keeper of the Prison, and afterward he walked in white in the whole Egyptian Court.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daniel</hi> was one that walked in white with common men of the World.</p>
            <p>With the Prince of <hi>Eunuchs</hi> he had tender favour: he told him he would not disobey God to please man; yet he did not rail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and call him a stubborn fellow, because he would not bow to <hi>Baal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And afterwards <hi>Daniel,</hi> as great a man as any in that Province, he walked in white. God hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Testimonies of honour for his people from some men of the world, yea they many times put white Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them. God doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time keep up their honour in the World,<note place="margin">1 Tim 5.17.</note> who will not defile their Garments.</p>
            <p>This may teach us the readiest way to the White Robe, to the Robe of Honour: It is to keep our
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53997:36"/>
selves from sinful practises. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they who please God, he can make the World to honour them. If God approve of us, he can make the World to approve of us too. If God see our Garments in the dirt, and spotted with the filth of the World, it will spoil the Honour we should have in the World.</p>
            <p>They who defile their Garments lose their Honour with men, and they lose the Joy they should have hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 4.4.</note>Nay, the Saints also shall walk in the white of peace and joy, and inward comfort, that keep their Garments white: what ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the other white of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the world, they shall walk in the inward white of joy and peace with Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>They who have a good Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from their own Consciences, walk in white; they that have that grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Testimony than our Conscience, the Spirit, they walk in white; this witness doth cause wonderful joy.</p>
            <p>This joy doth arise from that well-grounded hope which that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53997:36"/>
Soul hath that keeps himself clean.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> walked, and appeals from man to God to judge him, he had so much of a well-grounded confidence.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Iob</hi> walkt in white: though his friends blacken him exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet he walkt in white in his Conscience; he walkt in white, notwithstanding all his afflictions from God and his friends.</p>
            <p>Hence we may see the happiness of all those who are true to Christ and his ways: Oh, how much better is it than the peace and joy of this World, and the comforts of this life!</p>
            <p>A good Conscience, and indeed a merry Heart, do but one explain the other.</p>
            <p>Here is no surfeting in this Feast, but a continual Musick.</p>
            <p>Oh, the Rivers of Consolation that flow to them that keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of the Puddles of this World! though the World give thee nothing but the Water of Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet let thy Garments be always white.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:53997:37"/>This gives us an account why the Servants of Christ stand so strictly upon their terms with the world, because they understand in some measure what it is to walk with Christ in white; and it hath left such a tincture and relish upon their souls, that they would not lose it for all the dainty morsels of the world: They had rather indeed walk with Christ in white, than walk with the world in scarlet.</p>
            <p>They will run any hazard, and undergo any affliction, rather than do any thing that will not please God, or be hurtful to their own Consciences. The Conscience is a busie faculty, and hath many offices; it records what we do, and comes as a witness.</p>
            <p>The Conscience is Judge of what we do, and accordingly approves of what we do, and reproves us when we do amiss: I am more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the report of Conscience, than of any man whatsoever; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not do any thing that may reproach me as long as I live.</p>
            <p>Christ hath threatnings for those
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53997:37"/>
that defile their Garments, in the place of rewards for those who keep them clean.</p>
            <p>They who defile their Garments shall walk in Garments of black, in the black of dishonour.</p>
            <p>Oh, take heed of the after-claps of Conscience! I may say, of the thunder-claps of Conscience; for they will come upon you one time or other, if you defile your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

            <p>Seeing there is such a reward promised, as this white, wherein we shall walk with Christ; it is an Angelical Happiness, 'tis Heaven before Heaven.</p>

            <p>They cannot take away this peace, this joy from us; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not strip off this habit: It is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering joy, turns all sorrow into joy.</p>

            <head>Mr. Caryl ON GOSPEL-CHARITY.</head>
            <p>THe pure Heart, is a gratious Heart.</p>
            <p>The end doth denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Action.</p>
            <p>It must have a good end, else though the matter be never so good, the work is not good.</p>
            <p>The principle or spring of the work must be good: 'Tis possible for one to do a work that's good for the matter of it,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.33</note> and to have some good ends in it, and yet not to do it out of a right principle. Unless the principle be good, the work's not good.</p>
            <p>As the Fountain is, such are the Streams that come from it.</p>
            <p>As the Tree is, such is the Fruit that grows upon it.</p>
            <p>The Thorn hath not a principle in Nature to put forth a Grape: The Thistle hath not a principle in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53997:39"/>
Nature to put forth a Figg: An ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scented Vessel, whatsoever passes from it must be ill scented.</p>
            <p>Bad men will often tip their tongues with good words, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear golden-mouth'd speakers, when their Hearts are nothing but Brass and Dross.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 29.20.</note>Evil men they spoil good speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their ill manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or their ill meaning in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>Good words do as it were lisp in the mouth of a bad man, and his Heart never keeps pace with his tongue.</p>
            <p>Good things done by those who have not good principles, though their box of Ointment may have a fragrant smell among many men, yet there are many dead flies in it, especially one great one, call'd Unbelief, which makes their whole box of Ointment very unsavory in the Nostrils of God.</p>
            <p>Gospel-Charity is of a nobler extract, than to be found in the whole Compass of Nature; and Godliness moves in a higher Sphere,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53997:39"/>
than the best dress that the gayest Moralist ever reacht unto.</p>
            <p>This is to be lamented, that Christian Acts should be done, and not from a principle spiritual.</p>
            <p>It is very possible, and very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to follow Christ,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.60</note> yea to call upon Christ with Carnal affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>'Tis very sad to see good men do according to the works of the wicked. <hi>David</hi> did so in the matter of <hi>Vriah</hi>; and thus did <hi>Solomon,</hi> when his Heart went after strange Gods, and he built high places to their abominations. Good King <hi>Asa</hi> imprisoned the Prophet, and in his disease sought to the Physitians, and not to God.</p>
            <p>That Holy Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and forswore his Master.</p>
            <p>This is to act the old Creatures part, in the new Creatures state.</p>
            <p>There's another sight as bad, to see bad men plod on and do good things, but never mind to become good themselves.</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Saul</hi> when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Prophets; and thus
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53997:40"/>
did <hi>Ahab</hi> when he humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and thus did <hi>Iehu</hi> when he destroyed Idolatry; thus did <hi>Iudas</hi> when he preacht the Gospel; and thus did <hi>Demas</hi> when he professed the Gospel; a very good work, but he himself an Hypocrite, and a lover of the world.</p>
            <p>And thus indeed do all Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and meer formalists, in their performing of Gospel-worship.</p>
            <p>I confess it is a sad sight to see a bad man do that which is bad, or a wicked man do that which is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet I say, it is a sadder sight to see a bad man continuing in his state, having no spiritual principles to go on doing good.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 12.33</note>God often declares himself very highly against such as do good, themselves continuing evil.</p>
            <p>The good that you do will not profit you, 'twill not advantage you, 'twill be no plea at the Great Day.</p>
            <p>You may have <hi>Iehu</hi>'s Penny, a deliverance from an outward Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but there is no deliverance from Wrath and Eternal Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:53997:40"/>Thus those that are not far from Heaven shall never come there: yet I would exhort the worst of men to do good; though they please not God in doing it, yet they displease him in not doing it.</p>
            <p>And thus faln man, if he neglect to do good, sins: If he doth good, he spoils it in the doing of it.</p>
            <p>Hence we see the necessity of regeneration: we are not born with a pure Heart. A pure Heart, a good Conscience, Faith unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are the Issues of the new birth.</p>
            <p>Education cannot make the Heart pure; it must be Revelation which makes the Heart pure.</p>
            <p>Education may change a mans Course, but it cannot change his Nature; that's only done by Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
            <p>He must be good, before he can do good spiritually.</p>
            <p>God works us, before we can work for him; he makes us good, before we can do good.</p>
            <p>We by Union to Jesus Christ, come to have a spiritual Principle
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53997:41"/>
to carry us out in the doing of all good works.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7.17.</note>Here's your way, you must be Gods workmanship before you can do Gods works.</p>
            <p>As we are grafted into Christ, he changes the Branch.</p>
            <p>Then all your Fruits are sweet Fruits and pleasant Fruits, they are well-tasted.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 6.5</note>Why? It is done, first, from a Principle of life in Christ.</p>
            <p>And secondly, It is done from a Principle of love unto Christ.</p>
            <p>The Heart of man is the greatest cheat in the world.</p>
            <p>The Heart of man received such a crack in the fall, that there is no mending of it: It must be new made.</p>
            <p>The Heart is made wholly new by the power of God.</p>
            <p>Meritoriously by the Blood of Christ, that cleansing Blood: it is made pure by the Spirit of Christ; the Spirit is a purifier.</p>
            <p>The Word of God is a purifier Instrumentally.</p>
            <p>Applicatorily the Heart is made pure by Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:53997:41"/>When the command of every sin,</p>
            <p>When the custom and practice of every sin,</p>
            <p>And when the love of every sin is gone, such a Heart is free from these powers; that Soul is Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically pure.</p>
            <p>He that indeed hath this pure Heart, is really sensible that once his Heart was very impure.</p>
            <p>And also is as sensible that to this day there remains much impurity in his Heart.</p>
            <p>He also that hath a pure Heart, loves every thing that is pure; and the more pure it is, the more he loves it.</p>
            <p>A pure Heart will be full of pure thoughts; a pure Heart converses with God in purity of thoughts.</p>
            <p>Whereas the wicked they have not the Pure God, nor the Holy God in all their thoughts.</p>
            <p>A pure Heart is full of pure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; he desires to be more good, to be better; he desires to know more of God, and to honour God more; he desires to enjoy God
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53997:42"/>
more; he hungers and thirsts after God.</p>
            <p>A pure Heart hath pure purposes and pure resolves; and by resolves the Heart is more settled and fixt.</p>
            <p>Resolution is the establishment of the Soul.</p>
            <p>He resolves, let the Winds blow high or low, to cleave to Christ.</p>
            <p>There is a purpose in a pure Heart against all that's evil.</p>
            <p>He will neither defile his Heart, nor his Life; and these purposes he carries quite thorough all, unto the end.</p>
            <p>A pure Heart hath pure ends in all it doth; a holy aim, a single eye; not self-profit, not self-applause, not pleasure; but he purposes the profit of many, that they may be saved.</p>
            <p>Weigh it well whether you have this pure Heart.</p>
            <p>The hardest thing that we have to do, and the greatest kindness which God can do to us, is to cleanse our Hearts.</p>
            <p>Our hearts are the filthiest part of us: If there be impurity in the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53997:42"/>
hand, there's much more in the Heart.</p>
            <p>Till the Heart be made pure, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be pure.</p>
            <p>God is a friend indeed to those who have a pure Heart.</p>
            <p>Keep pure Hearts with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, for the Devil comes a Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stealing continually: unless you wash it, weed it, sweep it, Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs will grow, Spiders will creep in, they will be weaving their Webs.</p>
            <p>To the impure Heart, there is nothing pure. Holy Ordinances, honest Callings, great Possessions; all these to an impure Heart are not pure.</p>
            <p>The pure in Heart, are onely fit for Communion with God: they onely are fit to call upon God, who have a pure Heart.</p>
            <p>Onely the pure in Heart shall see and enjoy God.</p>
            <p>Impure eyes cannot behold God, they cannot bear the Glory, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of his Presence.</p>

            <p>Give thanks to the Lord for your creation, and the many mercies you have received from his hands.</p>
            <p>When you arise, pay your devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the holy Trinity.</p>
            <p>Be silent when you dress your self, and fix your thoughts upon some act of Piety.</p>
            <p>If you speak, let it be in the praise of God, of his Goodness, his Mercies, or his Greatness.</p>
            <p>Always let the first-fruits of thy Reason be presented to the Lord, that so the whole harvest of thy conversation may be Sanctified.</p>
            <p>Let your habit be neither care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less nor curious: though men may respect you for your outward habit, God doth expect that your inward garment should be Righteousness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:53997:47"/>Let your ejaculations suit with your actions in the morning; as when you clean your hands, Pray to God to cleanse your Soul from sin; or when you cloath your body, Pray to him to cloath you with the Armour of Faith, and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <p>This done, betake your self to your Closet-Devotions, or to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Duties, as your condition is capacitated.</p>
            <p>Having finished your Prayers, consult with your self about your Occasions that day, and resolve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any thing that may seem op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the Service of God, or the Rules of Good manners.</p>
            <p>If you have Children or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, it is your Duty to Pray with them, and for them; or especially to be careful that they shall Pray for themselves.</p>
            <p>After this, betake your self to your Affairs: avoid idleness, and take heed of being too earnest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wordly goods; be <hi>Prudent, Temperate, Diligent, Humble and Charitable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:53997:47"/>Harbour no idle Persons in your Family; let your Servants have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Work and Meat: if they deserve Reproof, let it be without Passion; advice, with some Natures, may do more than Correction.</p>
            <p>Be not busie to inquire after the Concerns of your Neighbour, but carry your self with this Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in all your Actions you mix the ingredients of Justice and Charity: <hi>Be in Charity with all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Avoid Backbiting and Slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: he that delights in either of them, shall never be beloved, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.</p>
            <p>When you dine, lift up your heart in an holy Ejaculation to the Lord; thank him for your Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Food, and crave for Spiritual.</p>
            <p>After dinner, return thanks for Mercies received: He doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to eat, that doth not desire to thank.</p>
            <p>In your Recreations, be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and be sure to secure your heart for God, left your affections settle upon a false Basis: Let not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53997:48"/>
your Recreations be tedious, lest if you dwell with them long, you may be inticed to sin.</p>
            <p>When you enter into Discourse, be pithy, and as often as you can devout; but if your occasions shall be so urgent that you cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently discourse of God, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be sure to think of him.</p>
            <p>When you Read, let it not be much at once; let your Reading be little, and your Meditation large: for little Reading, and much think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; little Speaking, and much Hearing; brief Prayer, and firm Devotion, is the surest way to be Wise, and to be Devout.</p>
            <p>In the Evening, let your Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations be on the hours of the day past, how they have been spent: if your Conscience be clear, it is the sooner examined; but if any thing extraordinary hath happned, then take time to recollect your self with diligence.</p>
            <p>Thank the Lord for his benefits of the day, and crave a pardon for your errours; and if any duty hath been omitted, endeavour to redeem
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53997:48"/>
that fault the next day.</p>
            <p>Let your last Prayers be applied to the concerns of your Conscience, and forget not to thank the Lord for all his mercies to you and your relations that day.</p>
            <p>When you enter into your Bed, fix your Meditations upon Death and the Grave.</p>
            <p>In the whole course of your life, let Religion be your business: for he is most capable of rejoycing in the evening, that watcheth his words, thoughts and deeds in the day.</p>
            <p>To despise the world, is the way to enjoy heaven; and blessed are they who delight to converse with God by Prayer.</p>
            <p>What folly can be greater, than to labour for the meat that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth, and to neglect the food of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life?</p>
            <p>God, or the World, must be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected at the parting-time; for then is the time of Tryal, then shall the Righteous continue Righteous, and be Blessed.</p>
            <p>To seek your self in this world,<note place="margin">Luk. 14.11</note> is to be lost; and to be humble, is to be exalted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:53997:49"/>First study to believe there is a life of Blessedness hereafter, then will you be the better strengthned to hunger and thirst after Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</p>
            <p>If you would have the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you into Heaven, you must give your self unto Prayer.</p>
            <p>Prayer is defined by <hi>Gregory Nys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen</hi> to be a Discourse between the Soul and God: it is of two sorts, <hi>Vocal</hi> and <hi>Mental</hi>; that is, outward expressions of the Voice, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lifting up of the Mind to the Throne of Grace.</p>
            <p>Before you enter into Prayer, ask your Conscience these Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with a resolution to return an Answer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To what end, O my Soul, art thou retired into this place?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Art thou not come to discourse with the Lord in Prayer?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is he present, will he hear thee?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is he merciful, will he help thee?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Is thy business slight, is it not concerning the welfare of thy Soul?</p>

               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:53997:49"/>6. What words and reverence wilt thou use to move him to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion?</p>
            <p>Let these Interrogatories be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered. Discoursing with thy self, will prepare thee the better to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with God.</p>
            <p>To make thy preparation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, consider thy condition; thou art <hi>but dust and ashes,</hi> and he the great God,<note place="margin">Psal. 103.14.</note> Father of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.5.</note>

            <p>Such Expressions as these from a devout Soul, open the windows of Heaven, and prevail with God to hear its Prayers.</p>
            <p>In your Prayers or Meditations, beware of Satan's devices, of which these are some.</p>
            <p>He endeavours to intice sinners to presumption, by lessening a sin, and making it seem to be slight.</p>
            <p>On the other side, he studies to betray some to the sin of despair; insinuating, such a crime is Haynous, and beyond pardon.</p>
            <p>But thus saith the Lord, <hi>Though your sins be as Scarlet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 1.18.</note> 
               <hi>they shall be white as Snow: Though they be red as Crimson, they shall be as Wooll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He shewed to our Parents a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Cup, but discovered not the Poyson hid therein, when he said,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53997:50"/>
               <hi>God doth know,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen 3.5.</note> 
               <hi>in the day that ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus he attempted to betray Christ, when he tempted him with the glories of the World, saying, <hi>All these things will I give thee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 4.9.</note> 
               <hi>if thou wilt fall down and worship me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath likewise the art to put false glosses on particular sins; as Pride, that he pretends is Neatness; Covetousness is good husbandry; Drunkenness he calls good fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; and Extravagancies the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a liberal Spirit.</p>
            <p>He extenuates sins, by whisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the credulous wretch, To be Drunk, to Swear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are but little sins; and repentance is no hard task, it is but to ask pardon, and cry, <hi>Lord have mercie upon me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He insinuates these delusions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sinner: You may walk by the Harlots, yet not enter; you may drink with the Drunkard, yet not be drunk; you may handle a bag of Gold, yet not steal it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:53997:51"/>He assures the Soul that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man is happier than the devout Soul; for the former enjoys all the delights of the world, whilst the others are Persecuted, Imprisoned, and oftentimes undone.</p>
            <p>One chief designe of Satan to delude the Soul, is to conduct him into evil company.</p>

               <p>By my understanding I consider what God is in himself, what he is in his Angels, what he is in his Saints, what he is in Men, and what he is in his Creatures.</p>
               <p>In himself he is incomprehensible, because the beginning and end; the beginning without beginning, the end without end.</p>
               <p>I understand from my self, how incomprehensible God is, because I cannot understand my self whom he hath made.</p>

            <p>SIn is contrary to God.</p>
            <p>Sinners are called enemies to God.</p>
            <p>And sin is called enmity it self, as being contrary to God.</p>
            <p>It makes men walk contrary to God, revelling, rising up against, and contending with God.</p>
            <p>Hence men hate God, resist God, sight and blasphame God,</p>
            <p>And Atheistically say there is no God. Sin would ungod God.</p>
            <p>Sin is by some of the Antients called, God-murther, or God-kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>All these are in the nature of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very sin more or less, but are all of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53997:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them in the heart of all sinners (in their Seed and Root.) <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence sin is not onely High-Treason against the Majesty of God, but it scorns to confess its Crime.</p>
            <p>God is glorious in Holiness<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Sin on the contrary is all sinful, only sinful, altogether sinful.</p>
            <p>As in God there is no evil, so in sin there is no good.</p>
            <p>God is the chiefest of goods, and sin is the chiefest of evils.</p>
            <p>As no good can be compared with God for goodness, so no evil can be compared with sin for evil.</p>
            <p>Sin opposes all Gods Names and Attributes.</p>
            <p>It deposeth God's Soveraignty; it will not that the King of Kings should be in the Throne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pharaoh</hi> spake the Language of sin: <hi>I know no Lord above me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sin denies God's all-sufficiencie as if there were more in sinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures than in him.</p>
            <p>Sin dares God's justice, and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges God to do his worst: it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes the Lord to jealousie, and tempts him to wrath.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:53997:95"/>Sin disowns God's omniscience: Tush, say sinners, God sees not.</p>
            <p>Sin despises the Riches of God's goodness.</p>
            <p>Sin turns all God's Grace into wantonness: sin is the dare of God's Justice, the rape of his Mercie, the jear of his Patience, the slight of his Power, and the contempt of his Love.</p>
            <p>Sin is the upbraid of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the scoff of his Promise, and the reproach of his Wisdom.</p>
            <p>Sin is contrary to God's works, and is called the Devil's work.</p>
            <p>God's works were good, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly beautiful:</p>
            <p>But the works of sin are defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and monstrous ugly.</p>
            <p>Sin may be impleaded for all the mischiefs and villanies that have been done in the world.</p>
            <p>'Tis the Master of Mis-Rule, the Author of Sedition, the Builder of <hi>Babel,</hi> the Troubler of <hi>Israel</hi> and all mankind.</p>
            <p>Sin is contrary to God's Law and Will, to all the Rules and Orders of his appointment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:53997:96"/>Sin is not only a transgression of, but a contradiction also of the Will of God.</p>
            <p>Sin is an Anti-Will to God's Will.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> in fulfilling of God's Will, was said to be a man after God's own heart; and they that obey the will of sin, are said to wall<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> after the heart of sin.</p>
            <p>Sin is contrary to God's Image wherein man was made; sin is as unlike God's Image, as Darkness is to Light, as Hell to heaven, yea, and more too; sin is the Devil's I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
            <p>Such as the Devil and his Angels are, who once knew good, but now know evil, both by doing it, and suffering the sad effects of it.</p>
            <p>Thus he that runs may read the Picture, Image and likeness of the Devil in sin: sinners are as like the Devil as any thing.</p>
            <p>Sin is contrary to the Children of God: they are near and dear to God; God's heart is set upon them for good, and sin sets its heart against them for evil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:53997:96"/>Sin is always warring against the Seed of God in them.</p>
            <p>By sins ill will, God's people should neither enjoy nor do any good in the world.</p>
            <p>Sin, like the Devil, hath not such an evil eye, or aking tooth at all the sinners of the world, as it hath at the Saints in the world.</p>
            <p>The Devil is a Man-hater, but more a Saint-hater.</p>
            <p>Sin is contrary to, and set against the Glory of God.</p>
            <p>Faith would give Glory to God: now that men may not believe, sin imploys the Devil to blinde their eyes.</p>
            <p>Good men would do all they do (sin will let them do nothing at all) to the Glory of God.</p>
            <p>Sin is contrary to, and opposite against the being and existence of God. It makes the sinner wish and endeavour that there might be no God: for sinners are haters of God.</p>
            <p>And as he that hates his Brother is a murtherer, so (as much as in him lies) he that hates God is a murtherer of God.</p>

            <p>Poor Soul! canst thou finde in thine heart to hug and imbrace such a Monster as this is?</p>
            <p>Wilt thou love that which hates God, and which God hates?</p>
            <p>Wilt thou joyn thy self to that which is nothing but contrariety to God and all that's good?</p>

            <p>Thou that art the founder of Hell, an enemy to all Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that ceasest not to pervert the right ways of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Sin is contrary to the good of man; it is a separation betwixt God and man.</p>
            <p>The Commandment of which sin is a transgression was given not onely for God's sake, that he might have glory from man's Obedience; but for man's sake, that man might enjoy the good and benefit of his Obedience.</p>

               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:53997:97"/>These two were twisted together, and no sooner is the Law transgrest, but God and Man are joynt-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; God in his Glory, and Man in his Good.</p>
            <p>Man's suffering follows at the heels of sin; yea, as he suffers by, so in sinning: suffering and sinning involve each other.</p>
            <p>No sooner did sin enter into the world, but Death (which is a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of good) did enter by it, with it, and in it.</p>
            <p>For 'tis the sting of Death: so that sin saith, Here is Death; and death faith, Here is Sin.</p>
            <p>No sooner did Angels sin, but they fell from their first State and Habitation which they had with God in Glory; not a moment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their sin and misery.</p>
            <p>And as soon as man had sinned, his Conscience told him that he was naked, and destitute of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Protection.</p>
            <p>Sin crosseth Glory, and is cross to man's Happiness.</p>
            <p>Sin is against the good of man's body; it hath corrupted his blood,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:53997:98"/>
and made his body mortal, and thereby rendered it a vile body.</p>
            <p>Our bodies, though made of dust, were yet more pretious than fine Gold; but when we sinned, they became vile bodies.</p>
            <p>Before sin, our bodies were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal. (For death and mortality came in by sin.)</p>
            <p>But now alas they must return to dust, and it's appointed to all men once to dye; (and 'tis well but once, and the second death have no power over them:) they must see corruption or a change.</p>
            <p>Sin is against the good of man's Soul: 'Tis not very ill with a man, if it be well with his Soul; but it can never be well with a man, if it be ill with his Soul.</p>
            <p>So that we can more easily and cheaply dye than be damned; and may better venture our bodies to suffering, than our souls to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>Nothing but sin doth wrong a man's Soul, and there is no sin but doth it.</p>
            <p>Sin is against man's well-being in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:53997:98"/>
this life. Well-being is the life of life; and sin bears us so much ill will, that it deprives us of our live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood.</p>
            <p>Man came into the world as into an house ready furnished; he had all things ready and prepared to his hands.</p>
            <p>All the Creatures came to wait on him, and payd him Homage; but when man sinned, God turn'd him out of house and home, like a Pilgrim, a Begger.</p>
            <p>Ever since it hath been every man's lot to come into and go out of this world naked.</p>
            <p>When Christ came into the world for the recovery of man, and stood as in the sinner's stead, he had not where to lay his head.</p>
            <p>Though Christ were Lord of all, yet if he will come in the likeness of sinful flesh, he must speed not like the Son of God, but Son of man.</p>
            <p>Sin is against that good which God left us, and fills it with vanity and vexation, with bitterness and a curse.</p>

            <p>Sin is against man's health: hence come all diseases and sicknesses: till sin there were no such things.</p>
            <p>Let a man take the best Air he can, and eat the best food he can; let him eat and drink by rule, let him take never so many Antidotes, Preservatives and Cordials, yet man is but a crazie sickly thing for all this.</p>
            <p>Sin is against the quiet of a man's natural Conscience: for it wounds the spirit, and makes it intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>A merry heart doth good like a Medicine; (no Cordial like it:) but a broken spirit drieth the bones, and sucks away the marrow.</p>

            <p>Sin is against the Beauty of man, it takes away the loveliness of mens very Complexions.</p>
            <p>Sin is against the loving cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Soul and Body; it hath sowed discord betwixt them.</p>

            <p>The Soul and all its faculties will speed no better; the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53997:106"/>
will be tormented with Truth, the Conscience with a gnawing Worm, the Will that men think here a princely thing, there they'll finde it a devilish thing.</p>
            <p>Hell-Torments will be without intermission, there's no sleeping there.</p>
            <p>Needs there any more, sinner, to fright thee from sinning, which is the way to damnation?</p>
            <p>For thy Soul's sake, hear, and fear, and do no more wickedly.</p>
            <p>Oh, if thou should'st go from reading of Hell, into Hell, thou would'st say, there was a Prophet; I would not believe it, but now I feel it.</p>

            <p>And yet how well are wicked men pleased and contented with their own condition, and laugh at the Godly, as if it were a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and mad thing to go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the truest happiness to be miserable for ever?</p>
            <p>The Devil himself may as well expect to shake off his chains, and be restored to his lost glory, as they: O be not deceived; as you sow, so you must reap.</p>
            <p>God gives this world oftentimes to his greatest Enemies; he gives glory in another world to none but his Friends and Children.</p>
            <p>Nay, let me speak it freely; They which gain this world with their negligence of Heaven, shall at their death lose both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:53997:118"/>Many that would be counted wise, drive a great Trade for that which is next to nothing; and that lay in no better provisions than Gravel, Clay, or Dung, when they are bound for Eternity.</p>
            <p>They think they make a very wise Bargain, when they sell their Conscience, God, and Heaven, for a little of that which some call Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</p>
            <p>O that I could but bring down the price of sublunary things, and raise the things of that other world to their true worth.</p>
            <p>Think not meanly of Holiness; it's the most excellent thing, it is the greatest Riches, and man's high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Dignity.</p>
            <p>He that knows the worth of Christ, and the nature of his own Soul, let him not envy those that swell like bladders upon water for a moment, and God puffs them off, and where are they?</p>
            <p>How can they look for Heaven when they dye, that thought it not worth their minding whilst they lived?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:53997:119"/>Whatsoever men pursue below Christ, will yield them but little happiness and comfort in another world.</p>
            <p>Not every one that wears Christ's Livery, shall have his Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
            <p>How many seeming Saints shall gain nothing at Death, but a thorow knowledge of their own folly?</p>
            <p>O please not your self with fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies! Sickness and Death is coming, and then you will know better, the reason of my earnest pleading with you in this matter.</p>
            <p>He that hath not got more than ever any Hypocrite could attain, or shall, will miss of Heaven.</p>
            <p>The best of God's Children are most suspicious of themselves, and afraid of their own deceitful hearts; and their great request is, that God would deliver them from mistakes in matters of everlasting conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>It's a common thing for wicked men to carry their false peace along with them to the Grave.</p>
            <p>How many thousands are there
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:53997:119"/>
that dye like Lambs, that are but Swine, and have the Devils brand upon their foreheads?</p>
            <p>Many are carried very quickly to Hell, and fear nothing till they feel; and are not brought to their sences, till unspeakable horrour and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish doth it.</p>
            <p>It hath not a little puzled some, as well as <hi>David,</hi> to see the wicked dye quietly, and the godly to have a strange death; but God will shortly resolve this Riddle.</p>
            <p>That Soul which hath seen the death of Sin, is a person fit for death.</p>
            <p>That man is like to be a gainer by Death, who contemns Earth, and makes Heaven his choice.</p>
            <p>He that counts nothing worth the having, except Christ, and for Christ, cannot be miserable, when he is lodged safe in his imbraces.</p>
            <p>God is oftentimes better, but never worse than his word; The running Christian shall at last obtain the Prize, and the Crown he fights for he shall wear.</p>
            <p>What though the Vessel be tost
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53997:120"/>
and broke? it shall come safe with its rich Lading, to the desired Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>O you foolish world, condemn not these spiritual wise Merchants, till you know what their returns are, when their burden is deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>He that is willing to dye for Christ, shall live as long as Christ lives, in happiness and rest.</p>
            <p>Those Souls are out of Gun-shot, that are instrumental for the shaking the Kingdom of Satan, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the interest of Hell in the world.</p>
            <p>Who would not be a Christian in good earnest? sure none but a mad-man or a fool.</p>
            <p>The highest Worldlings are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the meanest and lowest Child of God.</p>
            <p>Christianity is a clear Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of invisibles, witness the many earnests of their Profession. What warm refreshing Rays of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine love break in upon their Souls what Joy, what Experiments, and blessed Intercourses have past
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53997:120"/>
betwixt God and such Souls! the fire hath burnt, and of a sudden the Soul hath, e're it was aware, been carried above the world.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of Truth will not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to a lye, neither will Goodness it self put a cheat upon poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Balaam</hi>'s wish may throughly convince sinners, that Holiness is no Madness, Piety no Fancie, and Religion no Delusion.</p>
            <p>I am perswaded that all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates in Hell will one day justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Children of God for their seriousness, and wish a thousand times, that they had had their Scorns, Losses and Torments.</p>
            <p>Well then, our Enemies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves being Judges, an <hi>Israelite</hi> indeed is a person of true worth; and without controversie, his Estate is, and shall be comfortable, blessed, and glorious.</p>
            <p>O Christian, as long as God is true, you shall not be deceived; as long as he is happy, you shall not be miserable: you are well enough, go on resolutely; 'tis but a little
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:53997:121"/>
while, and you shall see all this, and more than this a thousand times.</p>
            <p>Death will shortly tear off <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi>'s rags, and present him before the Lord without spot or wrinkle.</p>
            <p>Sin indeed accompanies the wicked to another world; he rests from his pleasures, and his wicked works follow him.</p>
            <p>But it is far otherwise with the godly; sin was his burden<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and death shall unload him.</p>
            <p>Sin shall be confin'd to Hell; Heaven entertains no such defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
            <p>This Tyrant shall no more inslave any of Christ's Subjects.</p>
            <p>The house of <hi>Saul</hi> and the house of <hi>David</hi> shall no longer contend; that sad conflict between the Flesh and the Spirit, shall then be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by a full Victory.</p>
            <p>Death sets the Soul out of the Devils reach.</p>
            <p>This Angel hath nothing to do in Heaven; this Serpent shall not come into the higher Paradise, nor Satan creep into this <hi>Eden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O happy day, when will it come
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53997:121"/>
when the Devil shall be as unlike to tempt, as our hearts to close?</p>
            <p>When we are got once safe to rest, the Devil shall as easily shake God's Throne, as our Happiness.</p>
            <p>Death turns the key, and bolts and bars this Enemy out; then, O then thou shalt see this <hi>Pharaoh</hi> cast dead on the shore.</p>
            <p>Christian, expect not as long as any of that <hi>Cainish</hi> Generation breath, that thou shouldest be long secure.</p>
            <p>What though the world speak great words? thou shalt e're long ride in state to Glory; and then let them do their worst.</p>
            <p>When thou art in Heaven, they may curse, and encrease their own misery, but they shall not in the least diminish thy tranquillity.</p>
            <p>The beauty of this inferiour world will be darkned by the brightness of that light, which Death leads thee into.</p>
            <p>Death blows the dust out of our eyes; it plucks off the vail, and shews us quickly the glory of both worlds.</p>

            <p>Sin denies God's all-sufficiencie: Every Prodigal that leaves the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers house, doth practically say so. Sin dares the Justice of God, and challengeth God to do his worst; it provokes the Lord to jealousie, and tempts his wrath.</p>
            <p>Sin disowns God's Omniscience: Tush, cry sinners, God sees not.</p>
            <p>Sin despises the riches of God's goodness.</p>
            <p>Sin turns God's grace into wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness.</p>
            <p>Sin is the dare of God's justice, the rape of his mercie, the jeer of his patience, the slight of his power, and the contempt of his love.</p>
            <p>And further, 'tis the upbraid of his providence, the scoff of his promise, the reproach of his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53997:128"/>
and opposeth and exalts it self above all that is called God.</p>
            <p>Sin is contrary to the works of God: sin may be impleaded for all the mischiefs and villanies that have been done in the world; 'tis the Master of Mis-rule, the Author of Sedition, the Builder of <hi>Babel,</hi> the Troubler of <hi>Israel</hi> and all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
            <p>Sin is contrary to God's Law, to all his Orders and Rules, to his Appointment.</p>
            <p>'Tis not onely a Transgression of, but a Contradiction also to the Will of God.</p>
            <p>'Tis an Anti-Will to God's Will: <hi>David in fulfilling the will of God, was said to be a man after God's own heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And they that obey the will of sin, are said to walk after the Heart of sin.</p>
            <p>Sin is contrary to God's Image wherein man was made; <hi>viz.</hi> in Righteousness and true Holiness; but sin is as deformity and ugliness; sin is the Devil's Image: never was a Childe more like the Father,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53997:129"/>
than a sinner is like the Devil.</p>
            <p>Sin is contrary to the People and Children of God.</p>
            <p>Though sin cannot hate them so much as God loves them; yet the more God loves them, the more sin sets its hatred against them.</p>
            <p>The Serpentine Race will not suffer the little Flock and Remnant of the holy Seed to have one quiet day.</p>
            <p>The Devil is a man-hater, but more a Saint-hater.</p>
            <p>Sin is contrary to God's Glory: Good men would do all they do to the Glory of God, but sin will let them do nothing at all to God's Glory.</p>
            <p>Might sins desires take place, there should not be a person or thing by whom and whereby God should be pleased or glorified.</p>
            <p>Sin is contrary to God's being; sinners are God-haters, and, as much as in them lies, they are God-mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers.</p>
            <p>And if its power were as great as its will is wicked, it would not suffer God to be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:53997:129"/>God is a troublesome thing to sinners, and therefore they say, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us.</hi> Sinners they would break Christ's bonds, and make war with the Spirit of Peace. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou art, pause a little, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what is said of sin: it is to be considered by the sinner, and is meant of thine and my sin.</p>
            <p>Canst thou finde in thine heart to plead for such a Monster? Wilt thou love that which God hates? God forbid.</p>
            <p>Oh, say to this Idol, yea to this Devil, Get thee hence, thou Childe, yea Father of the Devil; thou that art the founder of Hell, an enemy to all Righteousness. Oh think on't: what! hast thou no value, no regard for thy Soul? Wilt thou neglect and despise it, as if't were good for nothing but to be damned, and go to Hell?</p>
            <p>Sin is contrary to the good of man, and nothing is properly and absolutely so but sin: and this results evidently from sins contrariety to God, as there is nothing contrary to God but sin. (For Devils are not so, but sin.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:53997:130"/>Sin being a separation between God and man, an interruption of his Communion and Conformity, it must needs be prejudicial and hurtful to him.</p>
            <p>Man's sufferings follow at the heels of sin; suffering and sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve each other: no sooner did sin enter into the world, but death (which is a privation of good) did enter by it, with it, and in it: for 'tis the sting of death; so that sin saith, Here is death, and death saith, Here is sin.</p>
            <p>Sin is against man's good; here in time, and hereafter in Eternity; in this world which now is, and in that to come. Particularly,</p>
            <p>Against man's body, it hath cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted man's blood, and made his body mortal, and thereby rendered it a vile body: our bodies, though made of dust, were yet more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious than fine Gold; but when we sinned, they became vile bodies.</p>
            <p>Before sin, our bodies were Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, (for Death and Mortality came in by sin) but now alas they must return to dust! and it's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53997:130"/>
to all men once to dye, and 'tis well if they dye but once.</p>
            <p>Sin is against the good of man's Soul too; and this is much more to man's hurt: 'tis well with his Soul; so that we can more easily and cheaply dye than be damn'd.</p>
            <p>Nothing but sin doth wrong a man's Soul, and there is no sin but doth that.</p>
            <p>Sin is against man's well-being in this life; man was born to a great estate, but by sin (which was and is Treason against God) he forfeited all.</p>
            <p>Man came into the world as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an house ready furnish'd; but when man sinned, God turn'd him out of all.</p>
            <p>Thus by sin man that was the Emperour of <hi>Eden,</hi> is banisht from his native Country, and must never see it more, but in a new and living way, for the old is stop'd up: all we have (our Food and raiment) is but lent us, we are only Tenants at will.</p>
            <p>The sin of man had left the Son of man nothing when he came into
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53997:131"/>
the world for the recovery of man.</p>
            <p>If he will come in the likeness of sinful flesh, he must speed not like the Son of God, but Son of man.</p>
            <p>Nay, the venimous Nature of sin is such, that it fills that good which God left us with vanity and vexation, with bitterness and a curse, sweat and sorrow: many a grieving Bryer and pricking Thorn stick fast to him.</p>
            <p>More particularly,</p>
            <p>Sin is against man's rest, 'tis a sore Travail which the Sons of men have under the Sun; yea he hath not rest in the night, but is haunted if not frighted with extravagant and frightful dreams: Man's ground is over-grown with thorns; he hath many an aking head and heart, many a sore hand and foot (before the year come about) to get a little livelihood out of this sin-curst ground.</p>
            <p>The old world was very sensible of this; Sin, Curse, and Toyl keep company.</p>
            <p>Sin is against man's comfort and joy; if man laugh, sin turns it to madness; all our sweet meats have
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53997:131"/>
sower sawce. <hi>In sorrow shalt thou eat</hi>: his bread is the bread of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
            <p>The Woman hath her share of sorrow: for the time of conception, breeding, bearing, and birth are tedious.</p>
            <p>Sin is against man's health; till sin, there were no Diseases and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses: let a man take the best Air he can, and eat the best Food he can, let him eat and drink by rule, let him take never so many Antidotes, Preservatives, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, yet man is but a crazie sickly thing for all this.</p>
            <p>Sin is against the quiet of a man's natural Conscience: for it wounds the Spirit, and makes it intolerable; <hi>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This broken Spirit drieth the bones, it sucks away the marrow and radical moisture. <hi>A good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is a continual Feast,</hi> but sin mars all the mirth. When <hi>Cain</hi> had killed his Brother, and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science felt the stroak of his Curse, he was like a distracted man, and mad: When <hi>Iudas</hi> had betrayed
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53997:132"/>
his Master, he was weary of his life.</p>
            <p>Sin is against the beauty of man, it takes away the loveliness of their Complexions, and alters the very air of their Countenance; it makes man vanity, and his beauty vain.</p>
            <p>Sin is against the loving and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal Cohabitation of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: Sin sowed discord between them, and made them jar: many a falling out there is now betwixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul, between Sense and Reason; they draw several ways: there's a self-civil War.</p>
            <p>The Soul is become a Prisoner to the Body. (Rather than a free man.)</p>
            <p>Too too often the beast is too hard for the man, and the horse rides the Rider. Sense lords it, and domineers over Reason.</p>
            <p>Sin is against man's relative good in the world; man's weal or woe lies much in relations: by sin, that which was made for an help, proves an hindrance: Sin hath spoil'd so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: one man is a Woolf, nay a Devil to another. Sin will not
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53997:132"/>
suffer Husband and Wife, Parents and Children to live quietly, but sets them at variance: they of a mans own house and bosom, that eat the bread at his Table, are the worst Enemies.</p>
            <p>Sin is against the very being of man: Sins aim is, not onely that man should not be well, but that man should not be: How many doth it strangle in the Womb? How many doth it send from the Cradle to the Grave, that they have run their race before they can go?</p>
            <p>Others dye in their full strength, besides the havock that is made by War.</p>
            <p>Man no sooner lives, but begins to dye; sin lays all in the dust, the Prince and the Begger; sin hath reduc't man's age to a very little pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, not only to seventy, but to seven; for among men no mans life is valued more.</p>
            <p>In a moral sense, sin hath degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded man by defiling him. Sin hath rob'd man of his primitive Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie; of a Lord, he is become a servant, yea a slave to Devils, and lusts of all sorts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:53997:133"/>His body is defiled: their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness, with their tongues they use deceit, the poyson of Asps is under their Lips, their Throat is an open Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, Eyes full of Adultery, the Eye-lids Haughty, Ears dull of Hearing, yea deaf as the Adder; the Forehead as impudent as a Brow of brass, both Hands are imployed to work Iniquity, the Belly an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol-God, the Feet are swift to shed Blood.</p>
            <p>Within the Gall is a Gall of Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness, the Spleen is infected with Envy and Malice.</p>
            <p>Sin hath defil'd the Soul, so that man is faln short of the Glory of God, and the Glory of being Gods.</p>
            <p>It must be new created or renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till God will own it for his, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause till then his Image is not legible.</p>
            <p>Yea, the Flood which washt away so many sinners, could not wash a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way sin; the same heart remain'd after the Flood as before.</p>
            <p>Sin hath made the heart of man deceitful, obstinate: out of the heart
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53997:133"/>
come vain and villanous words. Sin hath defiled and spoiled mans Memory and Conscience, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most put out that leading faculty the Understanding.</p>
            <p>Sin hath darkened the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; poor man is wise to do evil, but to do good hath no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>Poor man is covered with Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian thick darkness.</p>
            <p>Man, now like the blinde <hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> gropes to finde the door.</p>
            <p>Man hath lost his way since he lost his eyes.</p>
            <p>Poor man catches at every straw, and grasps every trifle.</p>
            <p>Man cannot comprehend the light, though it shine.</p>
            <p>In the innocent golden Age, man could have comprehended the least light that came from God, and have seen day at a little hole; he could have looked on the Sun, and his eye not twinkle.</p>
            <p>But now the wisdom of God, the Gospel, continues an hidden thing to this blinded world.</p>
            <p>Man's darkness appears by his
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53997:134"/>
walking in all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; who but blinde men would walk in dirt up to the ears, yea over head and ears?</p>
            <p>It appears that sin hath blinded man, for he knows not whither he goes.</p>
            <p>Men are busie in this world (like a company of Ants) creeping up and down from one Mole-hill to another, but are not so wise; for the Ants know, but poor blinde men know not whither they go, whether forward or backward, from home or to home.</p>
