            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>In spongiam incubuit,</hi> alluding to
the Argument of the Fable, in which <hi>Ajax</hi>
when he knew what things he had spoken

unto the fabulous History of <hi>Ajax,

<hi>Martial</hi> saith of it, <hi>Vtilis haec quoties

               <p>Having conquered his enemy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home victorious, amongst others
that came to congratulate his happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
there was one holding a Crow, which
he had taught to say,<note place="margin">Macrob. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</note> 
                  <hi>Ave Caesar, Victor, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator,</hi>
God save the Emperour, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querer.
He wondering to see the Bird so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficious,
gave a great sum of money for him.
His fellow workman to whom none of that
liberality came, affirmed that he had at
home another Crow for <hi>Caesar,</hi> which he
intreated he might bring; being brought,
he expressed the words which he had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<hi>Ave victor, Imperator Antoni.</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
being nothing provoked therewith,
thought it sufficient to bid him divide the
donative with the other: being saluted in
like manner of a Parret, he caused him to
be bought. This example allured a poor
Cobler to try whether he could teach a
Crow to use the like salutation, but he
being at great expences in vain, was wont
often to say, <hi>Opera &amp; Impensa periit, all
my paines and charge is lost;</hi> but at the
last the Crow began to utter the same salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
which <hi>Augustus</hi> once hearing as he
passed by, he answered, <hi>Satis domi salutatorum

The Crow remembred to adde that

laughed, and gave more for him then

with <hi>laudandum &amp; ornandum,</hi> and betokeneth to

in good part; but in another, it is all one with <hi>tollendum
de medio</hi> or <hi>occidendum,</hi> that is, to be dispatched
out of life or killed, in which sence <hi>Augustus</hi> took it; much

                  <hi>Nero</hi> said jestingly of <hi>Claudius,</hi> That he left <hi>morari

a double sense, which gives the grace unto this pleasant
scoffe; for being a meer Latine word, and having the first
syllable by nature short, it signifieth to stay, or to make
long abode, and taking it thus, <hi>Nero</hi> might he thought
to imply thus much; that <hi>Claudius</hi> was now departed

a Fool, and hath the first syllable long, it importeth,
that <hi>Claudius</hi> played the fool no longer here in the world

had the Art of Government in greatest perfection, there
lived the best Poet, <hi>Virgilius Maro;</hi> the best Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
<hi>Titus Livius;</hi> the best Antiquary, <hi>Marcus Varro;</hi>
and the best or second Orator, <hi>Marcus Cicero,</hi> that to

               <p>Afterward, many filthy Monsters reigned, and many
seditious and civill wars followed; therefore I have not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enlarged the former Treatise, by inserting here and there
some other speciall observations, but have made an addition
also of six more Emperours since, (as Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi>
also saith in his advancement of Learning) the six next Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were all learned, or singular favourers and advancers
of Learning: which age (as he also saith) for temporall
respects, was the most happy and flourishing that ever the
Roman Empire (which then was a Model of the world)
enjoyed: a matter revealed and prefigured unto <hi>Domitian</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:63947:67"/>
in a dream, the night before he was slain; for he thought
there was grown behind upon his shoulders a Neck, and a
head of Gold, which came accordingly to passe, in those
golden times which succeeded. <hi>Fulke</hi> in his Book of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors
observeth, not long before the contention of <hi>Galba,
Otho,</hi> and <hi>Vitellius,</hi> for the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> there
appeared three Suns, as it were pointing out the strife
which followed soon after between them three for the
Imperial Diadem; of threescore and thirteen Roman
Emperours (that perished within the narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
of one hundred years) onely three died a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
death in their Beds, the rest were cut off by their
lusts.</p>
               <p>It was a heavy time then with Christians, when
they groaned under the Persecuting Emperours three
hundred years together, yet in that time they had many
<hi>Lucida intervalla,</hi> many breathing spaces under Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
not altogether so bloody; there were too principal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors
of the Church, <hi>Diocletian,</hi> and <hi>Julian,</hi> but the
last was the most pestilent. <hi>Jerome</hi> justly styled him <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
rabidum;</hi> and it is remarkable what is observed of
him, that going forth to the Persian War, he asked in
scoffing manner, What the Carpenters Son (meaning
Christ) was doing? To whom it was answered by a good
Christian, <hi>Loculum fabricatur,</hi> He is making a Coffin
for <hi>Julian;</hi> which Propheticall speech was indeed verified
by the event; for <hi>Julian</hi> was strangely wounded and
slain in that War, and as in his life time he had blasphemed
Christ, so he died blaspheming Christ, and casting up his
Blood towards Heaven, he cried, <hi>Vicisti ô Galilaee,</hi> Thou
hast overcome O Galilean.</p>
               <p>This may suffice to have spoken of some of the chief Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors
in generall, since I purpose not to enlarge this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise

               <p>Yet at last he was perswaded by his father

he served in the camp with such proof

he was chosen Emperour. For the

who related it, not because they would not
have had the news to be true, but for that
they thought it more dangerous to believe

Black-Moor with a <hi>Cypresse</hi> garland on his

got the Empire, whom yet he put to death
with cruell ingratitude, onely because he
was advised by him to reform.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Syrian</hi> Priests having foretold him
that he should dye a violent death, he build
a rich and stately Tower whence he might
throw himself down; preparing also cords of
crimson silk and gold to strangle himself
with; rich swords to thrust himself through;
keeping poyson in boxes of <hi>Emeralds</hi> and
<hi>Jacynth,</hi> that he might chuse a death accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

binding it to an heavy weight, &amp; so cast
it into the River, that it might neither float

               <p>They did also thrust stakes through the

that their death might be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their life.</p>
               <p>It is observable that notwithstanding he
not onely permitted, but also encouraged
his subjects to live licentiously: moreover
was so liberal toward them, that he fed them
with most delicate and exquisite meates,
gave unto them abundance of mony, and
all the plate, were it of gold or silver, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

supped with him, &amp; made many other very
sumptuous distributions to the people: yet

               <p>Though he was strict in his discipline,

               <p>His mother <hi>Julia Mammaea</hi> (daughter of
<hi>Maesa)</hi> was a Christian woman, and did send
for <hi>Origen</hi> to instruct her son in the
grounds of the Christian religion.</p>
               <p>He was the first who received at one time
all ornaments and tokens of honour, which
he purchased by his honest life and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
manners, whereby he obtained such
favour of all men, that when his Cousin-German
<hi>Heliogabalus</hi> would have slain him,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:63947:102"/>
he could not for the Souldiers and Senates
resistance: he proving himself worthy to be
saved harmless by the Senate and Souldiers,
and to be elected Emperour by the votes
of all good men, when he was but 16. years
old. <hi>Lamprid.</hi> c. 2.</p>
               <p>He was then so modest, that when the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

               <p>He used like severity toward souldiers;
for when he heard that one of them had

wronged a poor old woman, he cashiered
him and made him be bond slave to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that he being a carpenter might with
his trade and labour maintain her: and
when the Souldiers were grieved thereat, he
perswaded them to be contended, and
made them afraid to grudge at it. <hi>Id.</hi> c. 51.</p>

                  <hi>He would in no case permit offices to be

               <p>He so abhorred bribery, that if by chance

ready to scratch out his eyes; and was so
incensed at the sight of such extortioners,
that he would immediately vomit up cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
his face being as it were on fire, and he
not able of a long time to speak a word. <hi>Id.</hi>

               <p>He had a favourite named <hi>Vetronius Turi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
who used to be more familiar with him
then others, which so blinded him, that
he by lyes confirmed the opinion of many,
who thought the Emperour would do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
without his advice. Which abuse the
Emperour hearing of used this plot to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvent
him. He caused one to desire some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of him openly, and after to sue pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
to <hi>Turinus</hi> to help him in his demand,
and secretly to move the Emperour for
him: which being done, <hi>Turinus</hi> promised
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:63947:104"/>
good will to the petitioner, and soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
said that he had sollicited the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
therein, (whereas he spoke not a word
thereof) and expected his answer; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
he received of the said person a great
summe of money, which the Emperour
knowing, caused him to call often on <hi>Turi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus;</hi>
who, as if he had other business in hand,
onely beckened on him without speaking
any thing to him; the Emperour in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim</hi>
having given to another that which
this man sued for, who grudging thereat,
discovered openly what <hi>Turinus</hi> had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of him: whereupon the Emperour
commanded <hi>Turinus</hi> to be accused openly in
his presence, and all things being proved
by sufficient and credible witnesses, in whose
presence he had received bribes, and in
whose hearing he had promised great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
he was adjudged by the Emperour to
be bound to a stake in the market place, and
to be smothered to death with smoke of
green sticks and wet stubble, the bedell
being commanded to cry the mean while,
<hi>Fumo punitur qui vendidit fumum; He peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
by smoke who had vented smoke in stead of
substance.</hi> But lest men should think the
judgement was too rigorous for one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
before he was condemned to dye,
the Emperour made diligent search, and
found by evident proofes, that <hi>Turinus</hi> had
often and in many causes received money
of both parts, promising to promote their
cause to the Emperour. <hi>Lamprid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

He had in his chamber bills containing
the number of his Souldiers, with their
names, and what time they had served;
and when he was alone, he perused their
accounts, and the number of them with their
dignityes and wages, that he might be sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provided upon all occasions: wherefore
when he had any thing to do with them, he
could tell many of their names. When he
was sollicited to promote any one, he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
his name, and then searched his books
of remembrance, wherein were the names
of them who served him, with the time of
their service, also their reward, and at
whose request they were promoted. <hi>Id.</hi>
c. 21.</p>
               <p>In his expeditions if any Souldier going
out of the way passed through an other
mans ground, he would cause him to be
beaten with rods, or be drubbed in his
sight: or if the dignity of the person freed
him from such punishments, he would se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
reprove him, saying; <hi>Visne hoc in agro

                  <note place="margin">See p. 128.</note>
because he exercised martial discipline up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
some of them for debauchednesse, he
stilled them with these words; <hi>Quirites dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedite,

example, they all putting off their armes
and souldiers coates, departed to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
lodgings. Then the Emperours
guard brought all the Standards into the
Camp, and the people themselves brought
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:63947:105"/>
all their armour to the Emperours Palace:
Yet that very Legion which he disbanded,
being sued unto 30 dayes before he went
toward <hi>Persia,</hi> he received again, and by
their valour especially, he overcame his
enemies: notwithstanding ere he departed
he put to death the Commanders of that
Legion, because the souldiers passed their
time riotously at <hi>Daphne,</hi> through their
negligence or connivence. <hi>Id. ib.</hi> c. 53. &amp; 54.</p>
               <p>He so heard the complaints of souldiers
against their Commanders, that if he found
any Officer faulty, he punished him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the quality of the offence, without
purpose of pardon. <hi>Id.</hi> c. 23.</p>

               <p>When any one had exercised his office in

things appearing merry and pleasant. <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pridius</hi>
c. 29.</p>
               <p>He was so courteous, that he visited the

he rested, receiving so many smaller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
but not such as were given to the
Souldiers, and was listed for service. Three
dayes after the Emperour riding to view
his Camp, saw <hi>Maximinus</hi> (who was yet but a
fresh water-souldier) out of order; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he commanded a Colonel to call him
into his rank, and to instruct him in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he was to obverve in the warres: <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
imagining the Emperour spake of him,
kneeled down at his feet. The Emperour
desiring to see whether he could run well
or no, spurred his Horse and took several
Turnes in the field; and seeing <hi>Maximinus</hi>
left not of running, old <hi>Severus</hi> being tired
said to <hi>Maximinus, Thracian,</hi> will you wrestle
after your race? whereto he answered, <hi>So

in his army, <hi>Maximinus</hi> overcame them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

commanded a collar of gold to be given
to him alone, with certain pieces of silver;
made him one of his guard, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that he should continually attend
in the palace: by which means he came to
be esteemed by the Commanders and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and to obtain what he desired of the
Emperour, <hi>Id. ib. c.</hi> 2. and 3.</p>

his preferment, saying, <hi>Ego quò major fuero,

should be out of action, he imployed
them in hunting.</p>
               <p>Even in his old age he would throw
down 5, 6, or 7 Souldiers (whom he wrestled
with) one after another; and being challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by a Tribune who envied him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
met, <hi>Maximinus</hi> gave him such a blow on
the breast with the palm of his hand, that he
threw him flat upon his back, saying, in
sport; <hi>Date alium, sed Tribunum.</hi> Id. ib.

               <p>
                  <hi>Caracalla</hi> made <hi>Maximinus</hi> a Centurion;
(in <hi>Macrinus</hi> his reign he left the army out
of hatred to the assasinate of his sovereign;)
even <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> permitted him to be a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune:

the consent of the Senate. <hi>Id. ibid.</hi> c. 4. 5.
7. 8.</p>
               <p>It appeareth unquestionably that he
committed this villany (notwithstanding
the doubts of some) because he killed all

               </p>

               <p>He was so feared at <hi>Rome,</hi> that, when he
was in <hi>Italy,</hi> the women with their children
prayed solemnely in their Temples that he
might never return; having heard that some
were crucified by him, some inclosed in
beasts newly killed, others cast to wild
beasts, others bruised with clubs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any regard to the quality of persons.
Id. <hi>ibid.</hi> c. 8.</p>
               <p>For his cruelty (which he thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for his security) he was hated, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Cyclops, Busiris, Syron, Phalaris, Typhon,</hi> and
<hi>Gyges.</hi> Id ib. &amp;c. 9.</p>
               <p>He was so infatuated with the confidence
of his own greatness and personal strength,
that he entertained a conceit, that death
durst not adventure to encounter him, for
fear of having his Javelin broke about his
own crazy skull, and all his Skeleton of
