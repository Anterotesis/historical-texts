         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Ruſty and welbeloved, Wee greet you well, Whereas Wee have beene long ſenſible of the juſt Complaints and great Burdens of Our Subjects in theſe Northern parts, by occaſion of the Garriſon in our Town of <hi>Hull;</hi> And whereas We were upon Friday the 22. of this Moneth petitioned by divers of the Gentry, and others, Inhabitants of this County, That the Munition at <hi>Hull</hi> might remaine in the Magazin there, for the ſecurity of Our Perſon, and of all theſe Northern parts, their Feare, being much grounded upon the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Relations of forreign Invaſions: Vpon which, the more to expreſſe Our care of Our peoples ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, We did our Selfe go in Perſon to that Our Town, that upon Our own view, We might conſult what proportion of it might be fily removed upon any preſſing Occaſion, having a reſpect to the promiſed ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for <hi>Scotland,</hi> the neceſſary uſe of Arms for <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well as for the ſafeguard and ſatisfaction of theſe Northern parts: But much contrary to Our expectation, and the Duty and Allegiance of Our Subjects, We found the Gates of that Our Town ſhut, and the Bridges drawn up againſt Vs; and though We came in a peaceable way, repoſing the greateſt Confidence in the Loveand Loyalty of our People, by offering (as We did) to put Our own Perſon, and Our two Sons, but with twenty Horſe, into that Town, there being in it a Garriſon of about eight hundred ſouldiers; Yet We were not onely denied entrance, but in a warlike manner oppoſed by <hi>Sir Iohn Hotham,</hi> the armed men being placed in all the Ports, and about all the Walls of the Town, alleadging(though falſly) for his excuſe, The Command of the Parliament, and being preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Vs to ſhew ſuch an Order in writing, he could not do it; for We were ever very confident that there was never any publike Order of theirs, that could ſo much as imply a denyall to Our admiſſion; We know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well enough, that he was entruſted by them for a Guard and Security of that place againſt forreign E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, or thoſe at home who are diſ-affected in Religion, and not againſt His naturall Soveraign, which hoſtile Oppoſition and adtuall Levying of War againſt Our Perſon, being by the Statute of 25 <hi>Ed. 3.</hi> enacted High Treaſon: Which Statute conſidered, and that for the avoyding of all lealouſies, as We have ſaid, Wee were content to have been admitted with ſo very ſmall a number in our Company, We were thereupon conſtrained to proclaim the ſaid ſir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> and all thoſe that ſhould adhere to, or aſſiſt him, Traytors. Of all which aboveſaid paſſages, We have acquainted Our Parliament, demanding luſtice to be done upon him, that they might thereby have oportunity to vindicate the imputation laid on them by ſir <hi>Iohn Hotham,</hi> and Wethe eaſier way to chaſtize, according to the Law, ſo high a Treaſon. And leſt a miſunderſtanding of Our Intentions, or of the Law may miſguide any of Our loyall and wel-affected Subjects, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, Captains, Officers, or ſouldiers in that Town, We have thought fit to commend to your Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the aforenamed ſtatute, with that of the 11. of <hi>Hen. 7. Cha. 1</hi>

               </gap>ared, by the unanimous Aſſent of Parliament, <hi>That the Subjects of this Realme are bound, by the Duty of Allegiance, to ſerve the King for. the time being, for the defence of His Perſon and the Land, againſt every Rebellion, Might, or Power raiſed againſt Him, and with His Majeſty to ente, or abide in Service in Battell, if cauſe ſo require.</hi> And it was therefore then enacted, <hi>That from thenceforth no perſon whatſoever that ſhall attend upon the King, or be in place, by His command within or without the Land That for the ſame deed and true ſervice of Allegiance, he, and they be no wayes attaint or convict of high Treaſon, or of other Offences for that Cauſe, by any Proceſſe of Law, whereby he, or any of them ſhall loſe or forfeit Lives, Lands, Tenements, Goods or any thing; but be for that Deed and Service utterly discharged of any vexation, trouble, or loſſe; And if any Act or Acts, or other Proceſſe of Law thereupon for the ſame happen to be made contrary to this Ordinance, that then that Act or Acts, or other Proceſſe of the Law whatſoever they ſhall be, ſtand and be utterly void.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which, together with the Copies of Our Meſſage and Petition (which We ſend here incloſed) We require you to publiſh to the Inhabitants, and all ſuch Commanders and Souldiers as will heare them: That knowing both the Perill of the Law on the one ſide, and the ſecurity of ſuch as ſhall adhere to Vs on the other, they be not miſled (through ignorance)to decline their Allegiance; and that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers may lay down their Arms, and admit Our entrance in a peaceable way. In ſo doing, you ſhall both diſcharge your duties, and thoſe that ſhall have need, be aſſured to finde (upon ſuch their ſubmiſion) Our ready Mercy and Pardon. And We doe likewiſer require, and charge all you, the Inhabitants (as well Souldiers as others) upon your Allegiance, Thatyou permit not any part of our Magazin or Munition to be removed or tranſported out of that Town under any pretence of Order or Power whatſoever, without our Royall Aſſent in writing under Our Hand. Aſſuring you, That it will be much more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to Vs to have Occaſion adminiſtred by the Fidelity of the Inhabitants to enlarge thoſe Graces and Immunities granted to that Town by Our predeceſſors, then to have any occaſion to queſtion your Charter.</p>
