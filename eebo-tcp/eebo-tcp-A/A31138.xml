            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE Clothiers, Weavers, Hoſiers, Merchants, Drapers, Mercers, <hi>and other Dealers in the Woollen Manufactures; with Relation to the Bill now depending, for the Transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Collection of the Duty of</hi> Aulnage <hi>to the</hi> Cuſtome-houſe, <hi>and give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Recompence to the Crown for the ſame.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THe <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Aulnage</hi> was Conſtituted for the <hi>Meaſuring,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Edw. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Weighing,</hi> and <hi>Searching of Cloth;</hi> And to the intent that the Dealers therein might not be deceived, the <hi>Seal</hi> was put on, to ſignifie the Goodneſs thereof, and the Duty paid in Conſideration of the performance of that Service.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Subſidy</hi> of <hi>Aulnage</hi> was granted to the Crown, in conſideration of the Releaſing Forfeitures, that were <hi>grievous</hi> to the Dealers in Cloath.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Aulnager</hi> is now become altogether unneceſſary, and no ways Anſwering the End of its firſt Conſtitution, and is only continued for the Collecting the Duties due as aforeſaid, and the <hi>Seal</hi> now only ſignifies, (as a Cocquet at the Cuſtom-houſe) that the Duty is paid.</p>
            <p>The manner of Collecting theſe Duties, is not only very chargeable to the Crown , but <hi>Extreamly Oppreſſive</hi> and <hi>Burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi> to the Subject, and a great hindrance to the Trade of the Woollen Manufactures.

            </p>
            <p>The manner of Collecting theſe Duties is <hi>very Grievous</hi> to all the Dealers in the Woollen Manufactures For,</p>
            <p>That <hi>in many places for the Payment of a Half penny or Penny Duty, they are forced to carry their Goods to ſeveral Offices, at great diſtance from their Habitations to be Sealed, by which means their Goods are much damaged, their Inventions Expoſed their Markets oft times loſt, which is much more Grievous than the payment of the Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>in other places they are forced to ſend for Seals many Miles, and many times the</hi> Aulnagers <hi>not having Seals, the Clothes for want thereof, have been ſent up to</hi> London, <hi>or other places, where they have been Seized, and the Clothiers put to great</hi> Charge <hi>and</hi> Trouble <hi>to have them again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>they make frequent Searches at the</hi> Dreſſers, Dyers, Preſſers, <hi>&amp;c. And if by any accident the</hi> Seales <hi>be droped off, as it will of times happen they Seize and carry away what they find <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>they make frequent Searches at</hi> Inns, <hi>Search</hi> Waggons, <hi>or</hi> Horſe Packs <hi>upon the Road, Search</hi> Fairs, Markets, Blackwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hall, Cuſtom-houſe Keys, Merchants <hi>and</hi> Factors, Shops <hi>and</hi> Warehouſes, <hi>and where elſe they pleaſe, Seize and carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way what they find <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>they enter into and Search all</hi> Retailers Shops, and Warehouſes, <hi>rifle all their Goods, diſturb their</hi> Markets, <hi>Seize and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away either whole Pieces or Remnants if <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſealed, although they have been Sealed; this being ſuch an</hi> Extraordinary Grievance, <hi>the Retailers have been forced to</hi> Yearly Contributions <hi>to be freed from ſo great an Inconvenience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>all Goods Seized are preſently Compounded for, or elſe carryed to the</hi> Aulnagers Houſes <hi>or</hi> Offices, <hi>where the Owners are forced to attend and Compound, at what Rates theſe</hi> Aulnagers <hi>pleaſe: Or if they refuſe, then are their Goods returned into the</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, <hi>as Forfeited to the Crown, where they muſt Sue for them; which Remedy being in moſt caſes worſe than the Diſeaſe, forceth the Complainants to ſuffer the loſs of their Goods, (many times unjuſtly) rather then be at ſo great a</hi> Charge <hi>and</hi> Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>to obtain them again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>although it has been made appear that the Goods have been Seized wrongfully, yet have they refuſed to deliver them again until certain Fees, as they pretend is due, for</hi> Porteridge, Warehouſe Room, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be allowed.</p>
            <p>Thus are all the Dealers in the Woollen Manufactures <hi>oppreſſed,</hi> and all this for a Small and Inconſiderable Duty, not amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Five Shillings for a hundred pound value.</p>
            <p>Thus are the Wheeles of Trade clogged with an <hi>unneceſſary Office,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonable Officers,</hi> who under the ſpecious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Collecting and Increasing the Revenue of the Crown, have been, and ſtill are very Induſtrious, to Collect and Increaſe their own Profits and Gain, to <hi>loſs, diſcouragement and vexation of many Thouſand Laborious Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Remedy of all which Miſchiefs it has been propoſed, That the <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Seal</hi> ſhould be wholly taken away, and that the Duties ſhould be made payable at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> for ſuch Manufactures only as are Exported.</p>
            <p>For which purpoſe a Bill has been Four several times before the Parliament in former Seſſions.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Bill</hi> for the ſame purpoſe is now depending, and if the Rates that are now incerted in this Bill, had been Collected at the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> in thoſe years in which the <hi>Aulnagers</hi> ſet forth, That they made clear of all Charges 7350 <hi>l.</hi> they would have produced near 8000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> as by Accounts abſtracted out of the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe</hi> Books is moſt plainly to be demonſtrated.<note place="margin">☞</note> The Rates that are incerted in this Bill, amounts unto about 2000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> more then the Rates that were Incerted in the Bill that was depending in the laſt Seſſions, and comes to about 500 <hi>l. per annum</hi> more than the <hi>Aulnagers</hi> made clear of all Charges in thoſe years when their Exactions were very great.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is therefore humbly hoped this Bill will ſoon be paſſed into a Law, and the Dealers in the Woollen Manufacture thereby delivered from the Burdens and Oppreſſions they have for a long time laboured under.</hi>
