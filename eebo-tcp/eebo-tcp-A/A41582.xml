         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

there are but three words in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
the firſt concernes the <hi>day,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
the <hi>times,</hi> the third the <hi>ſtate:
Prayer,</hi> a principall end of <hi>Faſting,</hi> is proper to the
<hi>day: Peace</hi> is ſeaſonable in theſe divided <hi>times:
Jeruſalem</hi> brings in the <hi>State:</hi> But three words
(I ſay) in the Originall; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
but they are all three <hi>Verba Trojana,</hi> pregnant
words, every one containes a catalogue: <hi>Pray,</hi> all
duties in one: <hi>Peace,</hi> all bleſſings in one: <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi>
all Cities and States in one. <hi>Pray, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every word playing his part will divide the
Text into a ſingle act, and a double object: or into
an <hi>Act,</hi> an <hi>Object,</hi> and a <hi>Subject:</hi> the <hi>Act</hi> or duty;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94937:3"/>
               <hi>Pray:</hi> the Object of prayer, <hi>Peace:</hi> the Subject of
Peace, and yet the Object of Prayer too, <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
But I will invert the order of the words: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the <hi>Object</hi> in nature is before the <hi>Act,</hi> and the
<hi>Subject</hi> before them both, I will firſt ſpeake of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi>
next of <hi>Peace,</hi> and conclude with <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words were written for our inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and therefore, though <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> be only nam'd,
all Cities and States are meant; <hi>David</hi> for <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
We</hi> for great <hi>Britaine,</hi> every man intercede
for his Country, and Chriſt for us all.</p>
            <p>Pray for <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> for theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Homo eſt animal politicum,</hi> Man is a creature
naturally both needing, and deſiring ſociety,
therefore it is not good for man to be alone, nor
were it ſafe for men to be together, but in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
under ſome forme and frame of government:
for <hi>homo homini lupus,</hi> nothing is more wild and
cruell then man, if he be not tam'd by authority:
out late confuſion and violations of Politicall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
have made <hi>England</hi> like the ſea about it, where
one fiſh hunts and preyes upon another. Vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled
licentiouſneſſe, though to the groſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
vulgar it ſeemes to be liberty, yet wee find
by diſmall experience, that it produceth nothing
but diſorder, injuſtice, rapine, and inſupportable
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94937:3"/>
ſlavery: for now violence and the ſword beare
ſway, every man does what he can, and the
ſtrongeſt takes all: wherefore it was well and
wiſely ſpoken of <hi>Calvin, Politie or government is of
no leſſe neceſsity, and of farre greater dignity then
bread and water,</hi> I may adde, then the ayre we
breath in, or the Sun that gives us hight: for indeed
there is no living without it; at leaſt men would
be driven to live ſolitary in woods and caves, like
beaſts, and ſalvages. Therefore it is a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
duty to pray for <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We ſee in the great world, how all parts of
it diſpenſe with their particular affections to their
proper Elements, when their generall duty to the
Vniverſe requires it: Stones would forſake the
earth, the place of their private repoſe, &amp; mount as
high as Heaven to fill a vacuitie to heale a wound
in Nature. So alſo in the Microcoſme, the little
world of man's body, if the heart, the mother of
life be diſtreſſed, preſently the ſpirits and bloud
flock and flow from all parts to relieve her. Now
if (as learned <hi>Hooker</hi> obſerveth) thoſe voluntary
actions are moſt agreeable to reaſon, which doe
moſt reſemble the neceſſary workes of nature;
then as it is in the naturall, ſo in the politick body
it ought to be, every part ſhould have a maine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94937:4"/>
eare of the whole. Therefore it is our naturall
duty to pray for <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. If the Sunne ſhould draw the Ocean dry,
or the Ocean ſwell to quench the Sunne; if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
put out his lights, or Earth keepe in her fruits;
the Winds hold their breath, and the Clouds ſtop
their Bottles, what would become of the world?
and if the world ſhould periſh, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of them? So if we, the particular members
of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> (for what is <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> but our ſelves
incorporate?) ſhould withdraw our duty, ſhe
could not ſubſiſt; and if ſhe doe not, neither can
we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the whole be ruin'd, the parts muſt ſuffer;
if the tree fall, the branches wither; if the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
be over-run, who ſees not, who feeles not,
that the ſubſtance, lives, and liberties of private
men muſt needs go to wrack? Therefore, though
we have no care of the Publick, but referre all
things to our ſelves, and our domeſtick commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
yet becauſe theſe are incloſed in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
of the Vniverſality, it is our neceſſary duty
to pray for <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Prayer is the expreſsion of deſire, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of deſire is Good, the greater good is to be
preferr'd before the leſſe, the publick good is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
greater and worthyer then the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94937:4"/>
by how much a whole Societie is more
worth then one man. Therefore it is our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
duty to pray for <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. To theſe reaſons I will adde Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
which we cannot diſobey, unleſſe
firſt we will be unreaſonable. <hi>Honour thy father
and mother;</hi> if the parents of our fleſh, the authors
of our generation and being, ought to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
then our King and Country, to whom we
owe our preſervation and well-being, are worthy
of double honour: for it is better to be well or
happy, then ſimply to be; as it is worſe to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,
then not to be at all. <hi>Honour thy father
and mother. Ieruſalem</hi> is the mother of us all, &amp;c.
Our Country (ſaith the Orator) is <hi>major altera pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi>
our Grand-mother; wherefore we muſt do
all we can to honour her; inwardly, with our
judgements and affections; outwardly, with our
endeavours and devotions: the leaſt we can do
is to <hi>pray</hi> for her. Therefore it is our bounden
duty to <hi>pray</hi> for <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> without <hi>peace</hi> were no
right <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that is, the Scene of <hi>peace,</hi> or where
peace is to be ſeene; but rather a very <hi>Babylon,</hi> a
Citie of confuſion: Therefore in the ſecond place
pray for <hi>peace,</hi> the peace of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:94937:5"/>
1. Many are of the minde, that, though men
had perſiſted in their primogeneal integritie, there
ſhould have beene dominion and government
amongſt them: yet (as profound <hi>Hooker</hi> noteth)
if <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen, there is no impoſſibility in
nature, but they might have liv'd without it. But
all agree in this, our fall and corruption made it
neceſſary: For when there were but foure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in the world, (but foure that we reade of;
howſoever, no great multitude) one brother mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the other; and, as their number, ſo their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and miſchiefes increaſed; for reſtraint where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
there was no way, but to come to compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and by common conſent to authorize one, or
more to ſuperintend the quiet and ſafety of the
reſt; to defend them, who were not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themſelves, to curb the unruly, to diſtribute
to every one his due, and ſo preſerve the peace
and tranquillitie of all. Seeing then an inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to peace was the originall ſpring of civill com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities,
and the eſtabliſhment of peace the very
end, whence they had their beginning; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the end is <hi>bonum primae intentionis,</hi> though ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
laſt, yet deſired firſt; firſt in our purpoſes
and wiſhes, this is a duty, which hath none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, to pray for peace, the <hi>peace</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:94937:5"/>
2. But if peace be not larded with proſperity,
'tis not worth the praying for: for as proſperity
without peace is but an <hi>uncertaine felicity,</hi> ſo peace
without proſperity is but <hi>ſecure miſery.</hi> Did we
dwell in a barren deſert, or a peſtilentiall aire, in
the Acheruſian fens, or under the North-pole, we
ſhould find cold comfort in our peace. But peace
here, peace, in the language of the Holy Ghoſt,
doth ſignifie the confluence of all earthly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
the entire maſſe of humane welfare. Some
render it, <hi>Salutate Ieruſalem,</hi> for the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſaluted
them, to whom they wiſhed all happineſſe, with
this complement, <hi>Peace be unto you.</hi> Peace then,
according to the ſacred idiome, is the Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz
or Magazine of all that good is: For all that
good is either <hi>honeſium, jucundum, utile,</hi> honeſt,
pleaſant, or profitable; as for <hi>decorum</hi> it is but a
gloſſe ſet upon the reſt, or a reflection from them.
1. Peace is honeſt, for it is nothing but a ſweet
reſultance from the due obſervation of good
Lawes; Shee's the daughter of righteouſneſſe,
ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa. 32. 17.</hi> 'tis a fruit of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpirit, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal. 5. 22.</hi> Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and peace kiſſe each other,<note place="margin">Pſal. 84. 10.</note> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>
ſings moſt ſweetly; 'tis founded in charity, which
is the comprehenſion of all Chriſtian vertues.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94937:6"/>
2. Whether peace be pleaſant, or no, I appeale to
your now quickned experience. What is more
wiſhed, or would be more welcome then peace?
What is better or ſweeter then peace? What is
more ſplendid and beautifull then peace? Peace
is that faire <hi>Aſtraea</hi> that linketh men together in
the golden fetters of mutuall amitie, and maketh
them to live, as if, their perſons being many, their
ſoules were but one. Peace is the harmony of
the world, the ſmile and ſerenity of the earth, the
hanſell and image of our happineſſe in heaven,
the tutelar Saint of Kings and Princes, the very
forme or ſoule of a Common-wealth, the nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
of Arts, ſhortly, a Paradiſe where all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations
for this life and the next do grow.
<hi>O how good and pleaſant a thing it is to ſee Brethren
to dwell together in unity!</hi> If there were no poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
pleaſure in peace, yet as it is the greateſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be depriv'd of Heaven, ſo it is not the
leaſt of pleaſures to be freed from Hell:<note place="margin">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94937:6"/>
for in that encomiaſtick Pſalme of Peace, it is not
onely compared to the fragrant oyntment of
<hi>Aaron,</hi> but alſo to the prolifique dew of <hi>Hermon,</hi>
fructifying the fields of <hi>Sion; Pacis alumna Ceres,</hi>
peace and abundance go together: therefore ſhe
is emblem'd in a faire woman holding a <hi>Copia-Cornu,</hi>
a horne full of flowers and fruits in one
hand, and leading <hi>Plutos</hi> the good of riches in the
other, to paint out unto us, that riches and plenty
are the inſeperable companions of peace O what
a bleſſed Trinity conſpire in this Vnity! Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they know not what is good for themſelves,
who doe not pray for peace, the peace of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The greateſt benefit of peace is, to improve
it to that end, for which God had given it; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the advancement of religion, and the exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his ſervice. 'Tis a moſt unthankfull aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his favours, to abuſe them as as we have
done; turne his grace into wantonneſſe, confume
our fertile peace in making proviſion for the fleſh,
to ſatisfie the luſts thereof, to make our backs fine,
and our bellies full: Better follow the warres,
then thus to ſtaine our peace. God ſends peace
for holyer purpoſes, that we ſhould <hi>lead quiet lives
in all godlineſſe and honeſtie.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 2. that we

ſhould <hi>ſow the fruits of righteouſneſſe in peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Iam. 3. 17.</hi> that <hi>being delivered from the hands of
our enemies, we ſhould ſerve him without feare:
Luc. 1. 74.</hi> If <hi>Hannibal</hi> were at the Ports, <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhache</hi>
upon the Walls, the <hi>Rebels</hi> now within our
Workes, what a wilde confuſion would rout
your attention? Put men into a bodily feare, and
quite marre their devotion. The <hi>Iewes</hi> were thrice
a yeare to worſhip God in <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> now in the
time of Warre 'twas ill travailing the Countrey,
men were then affraid to ſay, what <hi>David</hi> was ſo
glad to heare, <hi>Let us goe into the Houſe of the
Lord.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> therefore being exceedingly
delighted to behold theſe meetings, and wiſhing
in his heart they might never be interrupted, from
the deſire of his ſoule breathed this flagrant eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
<hi>O pray for the Peace of Ieruſalem.</hi> Indeed
it is the very beauty of peace, a bleſſed ſpectacle
to ſee men trooping to Church; endearing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with the mutuall offices of pietie, like thoſe
in the eighth of <hi>Zachary,</hi> lovingly inviting, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and exciting one another, heare you neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
friend, brother, <hi>Let us goe into the Houſe
of the Lord.</hi> The free and ſolemne exerciſe of
religion is ſo great an happineſſe, as we can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
no greater, till we come in Heaven, and the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94937:7"/>
principall meanes to bring us thither. Therefore
it is as much as our ſoules are worth to pray for
peace, the peace of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after we have beene ſo cruelly ſwing'd
with the <hi>iron flayle</hi> of warre,<note place="margin">Nehem. 1. 3.</note> ſure no man can be
ſo mercileſſe to himſelfe, as not to be glad of
peace. To moſt of thoſe, who were ſo forward
at firſt to blow the coale of this terrible conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if S. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> queſtion were now put, <hi>Vultis

would they anſwer? <hi>Cupimus, amamus, volumus,</hi>
yes, with all our hearts. But how ſhall we repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe
our ſelves of it? <hi>Hic labor, hoc opus eſt:</hi> for
we are growne to deſperate extremities; we have
loſt our ſelves in a Labyrinth of moſt perplexed
difficulties, and can finde no clew to winde us
out of it; our breach is too wide to be healed, our
wrongs too great either to be ſuffered, or to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;
our quarrels by mutuall ſlaughters incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to implacable hatred, and our peace ſo ruin'd
beyond all reparation, that a temper now, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
now may ſeeme impoſſible. But what is
impoſsible with man, is poſsible with God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Pray.</hi> He, he alone can recollect the pieces of
this ſhattered Kingdome, and joyne them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againe in a firme and laſting peace, therefore
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94937:8"/>
               <hi>pray;</hi> doe but aske and have, ſpeake and ſpeed.
<hi>Pray for the peace of</hi> Ieruſalem.</p>
            <p>1. God, the onely object of prayer, is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
of peace and lover of concord: his chiefeſt ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in the New Teſtament, is, the God of peace;
to intimate this great ſtates-matter is at his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing.
Knowing then from whence peace doth
come, hereby we know whither to goe; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for peace, but to the God of peace? at him we
cannot come <hi>pedibus, ſed precibus,</hi> not with the
feet of our body, but with the feet of our ſoule, our
affections lifted up in prayer. Prayer then being
the onely avenue to God, who is the onely giver
of peace, tis the onely meanes to procure it. There-pray.
<hi>Pray for &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I may opportunely ſally out upon the
<hi>Epicurean</hi> and <hi>Iudiciary Aſtrologer;</hi> for if their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
be true, this of my text is falſe. The <hi>Epicure</hi>
makes God like <hi>Aeſops Incurioſus,</hi> not caring how
the world goes: whatſoever befalls us, be it peace,
be it warre, it is not long of him who lets all things
run at random, to hap as hap may: as if it were
an <hi>Indecorum,</hi> a thing unworthy the ſublimity of
his ſtate, to vouchſafe the caſt of his eye upon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary
matters;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94937:8"/>
Scilicet is ſuperis labor eſt, ea cura quietos
Sollicitat.</p>
            <p>But goe to the beaſts of the field, thou <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,</hi>
and they ſhall teach thee; to the foules of the
aire, and they ſhall tell thee; to the flowers of thy
garden, and they ſhall inſtruct thee: for if God be
carefull to feed lions and ravens, and to cloath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
how much more ſhall he regard men and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ſocieties, O ye of little faith? Next, the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netarian</hi>
gravely tells us, that for our long, almoſt
miraculous former peace we may thanke our ſtars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whoſe kind aſpect and propitious irradation was
the cauſe thereof and that warre hath ſince been
kindled by the fiery influence of <hi>Mars,</hi> inflaming
the cholericke humour of Potentates. If ſo, then
the beſt Phyſitian were the beſt States-man: and
what needed ſo many conſultations, overtures,
propoſitions, and umpires of peace, when a good
Purge would have done the feat? Biſhop <hi>Fotherby</hi>
confuteth theſe men by <hi>Pſal. 75. 6. Promotion co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
neither from the Eaſt, nor from the VVeſt, nor
from the North, nor from the South:</hi> not from the
Eaſt, whence the Starres come in their <hi>diurnall</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
nor from the Weſt, whence they goe in their
<hi>naturall</hi> motion; nor from South or North, whence
they come and goe in their motion of <hi>Trepidation;</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:94937:9"/>
from none of theſe <hi>motions</hi> doth <hi>promotion</hi> come,
therefore the happineſſe of States doth not hold of
the Starres. But ſhall we in good earneſt confute
theſe men, or ſhall we laugh at them? To confute
them were to <hi>anſwer a foole in his folly;</hi> therefore
either pity their blindneſſe, or laugh at their mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and ſo let them goe.</p>
            <p>2. I might by many Scripture Examples ſhew
the force or rather omnipotence of prayer; what
power it hath over men, over devills, over the
elements of the world, over God himſelfe. To cite
a few proving the efficacy thereof for the publique
good. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Aegyptians</hi> were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to cut him and his <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to pieces, <hi>Moſes</hi> by
prayer divided the Sea, and eſcaped from them.
When <hi>Corah</hi> and his complices made an inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and diſturbed the peace; the ſame <hi>Moſes</hi>
by prayer opened the mouth of the earth, and ſent
them quicke to hell. When God <hi>Exod. 32.</hi> would
have diſpatched all <hi>Iſrael</hi> at a blow, the ſelfe ſame
<hi>Moſes</hi> held his hands by prayer ſo ſtrongly, that
God ſeemes to aske <hi>Moſes</hi> leave to ſtrike them; and
like one ſtrugling to get looſe, but could not, cries
out, <hi>Let me alone:</hi> Let thee alone! <hi>Quis tenet te
Domine</hi> (replies Saint <hi>Auguſtine)</hi> Lord, who hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
thee? Why, that doth <hi>Moſes</hi> here, that I cannot
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94937:9"/>
have my will upon theſe rebells. Cannot? Not
for want of ſtrength, for who is like to the Lord
in power? but for the aboundance of his clemency,
which would not ſuffer him to lift up his hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that people, for whom his faithfull ſervant
ſo earneſtly beſought him. I might name more,
but theſe are enough to ſhew how effectuall it is
to <hi>pray,</hi> to <hi>pray for the peace of</hi> Ieruſalem:</p>
            <p>3. Take this for a rule. Prayer implies the uſe
of all ſubordinate meanes requiſite for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of that we pray for. We muſt not ſtand wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
and woulding and doe juſt nothing: This
very thing hath undone us, like the Carter in the
fable, who when his Cart ſtucke faſt in a ſlough,
ſets him downe and cries amaine, Helpe <hi>Hercules,</hi>
helpe: <hi>Hercules</hi> appearing chid the lubber; helpe
you (ſaid he) and I will helpe. Our devotion muſt
be ſeconded by our devoire. To our <hi>prayers</hi> we
muſt joine our <hi>purſes</hi> and our <hi>perſons;</hi> not onely
<hi>pray,</hi> but <hi>fight,</hi> and <hi>pay for the peace of Ieruſalem.</hi>
Pray and pay too? <hi>durus ſermo,</hi> this is no good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
who can endure to heare it? Pray if you will,
the whole Liturgy over; outpray a falſe Phariſee,
a babling Papiſt, an extemporanean Enthuſiaſt,
with all their <hi>orationes ſine ratione,</hi> their endleſſe
ſenſeleſſe effuſions, yea and faſt into the bargaine,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94937:10"/>
ſo we may ſcape Scot-free and <hi>pay</hi> nothing. But no
penny no <hi>Pater-Noſter,</hi> as good neither the one
nor the other, as not both together; both theſe
muſt meet, or no <hi>peace</hi> will be concluded. For
this deduction is obvious to every mans reaſon:
Our peace we ſhall never recover, if the rebels may
have their will; their will they will have, if we
be not provided to breake them of it; proviſion
cannot be made without money, money cannot
be had without contribution, therefore out with
your purſes, and <hi>pay for the peace of Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may boldly ſpeake it: He can neither be a
good <hi>Subject,</hi> nor a right <hi>honeſt</hi> man, who for the
preſervation of the King, Religion, Lawes, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Learning, the Churches and his Countries
peace, would not thinke not onely all the money
in his purſe, but all the bloud in his body well
ſpent. Chriſt hath commanded us to <hi>give vnto
Caeſar the things that are Caeſars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and inforced the
commandement by his owne example, who as
Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> well obſerveth, <hi>never wrought mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
about money matter, but onely to pay tribute unto
Caeſar.</hi> But enough of this: for he is too much a
ſtranger to theſe hard times, that thinks to do any
good by chargeable doctrines. Now for fighting,
although the perverſeneſſe and obſtinacy of our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94937:10"/>
enemies hath left us no other way to raiſe our col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed
peace; yet it is not ſo comely for us who
are or ought to be Angels of peace, out of this place
to ſound the Alarmes of warre, and to whet mens
courages to cut throats. Onely this I'le ſay, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
out of a conſcientious regard had to his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
obliged by the lawes of God and men, ſhall
looſe his life in the ſervice of the King, I dare not
deny that man the honour of a Martyr.</p>
            <p>4. Prayer is for, or againſt: if we be friends to
the peace of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> we muſt be enemies to the
enemies of it; if we pray <hi>for</hi> that, we muſt pray
<hi>againſt</hi> theſe. Now if God be the authour of peace,
warre and diſcord can have no authour but Gods
adverſary the Devill; and they that are the ſtirrers
up and fomenters of it, muſt needs be his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
whoſoever they be. If the peace-makers be
bleſſed, <hi>for they ſhall be called the ſonnes of God;</hi> then
curſed are the warre-makers, curſed to the pit of
hell, for they ſhall be called you know what: if
there be any devils upon earth, theſe are they; as
like their father, as if they had beene ſpit out of his
mouth, who was a lyar, and a murderer from the
beginning. Therefore we need not make any ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of praying againſt ſuch: againſt thoſe Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
Incendiaries, who have fetched fire from
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94937:11"/>
heaven to ſet their Country in combuſtion, have
pretended Religion to raiſe and maintaine a moſt
wicked rebellion: againſt thoſe <hi>Nero's,</hi> who have
ripped up the wombe of the mother that bare
them, and wounded the breaſts that gave them
ſucke: againſt thoſe <hi>Cannibal's</hi> who feed upon the
fleſh and are drunke with the bloud of their own
brethren: againſt thoſe <hi>Catiline's</hi> who ſeeke their
private ends in the publicke diſturbance, and have
ſet the Kingdome on fire to roſt their owne egges:
againſt thoſe tempeſts of the State, thoſe reſtleſſe
ſpirits who can no longer live, then be ſtickling
and medling; who are ſtung with a perpetuall
itch of changing and innovating, transforming
our old Hierarchy into a new Presbytery, and this
againe into a newer Independency; and our well-temperd
<hi>Monarchy</hi> into a mad kinde of <hi>Kakiſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi>
Good Lord! what wild irregular courſes have
theſe men runne, ſince the reines have layen looſe
upon them? I am afraid, they will never leave
chopping and changing, plotting and practiſing,
till in concluſion they bring all to confuſion, all to
an <hi>Anarchy</hi> or ſavage <hi>Ataxie, Prayer, Peace, Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and all. Therefore it is no breach of charity to
pray againſt theſe men. How long, Lord, how
long holy and juſt ſhall our bloud and wrongs be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94937:11"/>
unreveng'd upon them? how long ſhall the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
and his inſtruments have place and power to
deface and defile thy Temples, to profane thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
to perſecute thy miniſters, to purſue the life
and honour of thine Anointed, and to ſeduce the
ſilly people like ſheepe to the ſlaughter? How
long ſhall they blaſpheme thy Name and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by making it an inſtrument of ſuch helliſh
practiſes? How long Lord, how long holy and
juſt?</p>
            <p>Thus have I runne through the parts of my
Text. I have ſhewed ye, that our chiefeſt care
ſhould be for <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> that the greateſt bleſsing
we can wiſh <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> is <hi>peace;</hi> that the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
meanes to procure <hi>peace,</hi> is <hi>prayer.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>pray for the peace of Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let naturall-hearted men, that wiſh the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the world; Let loyall Subjects, that are
tender of the ſafety and reputation of their Prince;
Let true Patriots, that regard the flouriſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of their Country; Let devour Chriſtians,
that thinke it an happineſſe to enjoy the free uſe
of religion; Let whoſoever deſire to ſee good
dayes, and the lives of them and theirs prolonged
and proſpered upon earth; Let us all, that have
beene tormented with the furies of a long Warre,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94937:12"/>
joyne in a maine army of Supplicants, and <hi>Pray
for the peace of Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before theſe cauſeleſſe Warres began, (cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
for though the meritorious was too appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
yet the next immediate cauſe is ſomewhat
myſtick and wondrous:) Before (I ſay) theſe
cauſeleſſe Warres had cut aſunder the <hi>Gordian</hi>
knot of our well-ſetled <hi>peace;</hi> God had advanced
this Nation above all Nations with ſo rare and
continued courſe of proſperity, that all the world,
and all the ages in the world could hardly patterne
it; for which ſo much we owed unto his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bounty, as we were never able ſufficiently to
pay: And therefore if we did not give him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
number of thankes, and praiſ'd him with
our mouthes, &amp; magnified him in our hearts, and
glorified him in our lives, and did all we could to
ſet forth and celebrate his matchleſſe goodneſſe
and indulgence towards us, we were the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull,
and conſequently the moſt hatefull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
under heaven: For God in the firſt of <hi>Eſay</hi>
ſummons all the world with a tragicall <hi>Proſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia,</hi>
to wonder at ſuch, as monſters, rather then
men. <hi>Heare O Heaven, give eare O Earth, and be
aſtoniſhed: I have nouriſhed and brought up children,
and they have rebelled againſt me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:94937:12"/>
Doubtleſſe this black ſinne of ingratitude, our
unthankfulneſſe in not acknowledging, and our
diſſoluteneſſe in abuſing ſuch ſingular favours
made us longer unworthy of them. For beſides
that Warre and Deſtruction having taken their
progreſſe through the neighbouring Countries, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ordinary deſtinie of earthly things,
our turne was likely to be next: Did not our ripe
ſinnes expect the ſickle? Did not their extreame
enormity, leaving ſcarce any feare, that we could
be worſe; and their brazen impudencie, leaving
as little hope that we would be better, argue the
meaſure of our iniquities to be brim-full? hath
not our more then heatheniſh profaneneſſe and
impiety, our exorbitant pride, and foppiſh gayetie,
our ranke voluptuouſneſſe, riot, luxury, and moſt
ungracious abuſe of Gods innumerable mercies,
provoked his Juſtice to bring upon us the ſame or
worſe calamities, then have ſo long, and doe ſtill
afflict the wretched Territories of the diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Empire? Therefore it is high time, now
that we are at the pits mouth of utter undoing,
ready to be tumbled in, with penitent hearts and
teary eyes, with all fervency and importunity <hi>to
pray</hi> unceſſantly <hi>for the peace of Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When from this generall, which is confeſs'd on
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94937:13"/>
all ſides, I deſcend to the inquiſition of more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
and nearer cauſes of our preſent miſerie, I
am ſtruck ſilent with amazement; my thoughts
are all confounded, I know not what to ſay to it,
unleſſe I ſhould aſcribe the diviſion of States to
the conjunction of Starres, unleſſe men at certaine
periodicall times were carried into it by a fatall
ſway; that ſuch eager and mortall contention
ſhould flame from little or no provocation.</p>
            <p>Or if there be any cauſe other then fatall; was
it, that we were come to the deſperate reſolution
of <hi>Aeſops</hi> Aſſe, who made no haſte to fly from the
enemies, preſuming they could not load her with
heavier burdens then her Maſter? It cannot be
denyed but ſuch Aſſes were numbers in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
till ſad experience, the fooles Miſtriſſe,
made them finde and feele to their coſt the little
finger of the Rebels to be heavier, then was the
hand, loynes, and whole body of the King.</p>
            <p>Or ſhall I thinke Religion, that moſt ſpecious
pretext, the onely ſound whereof (for, dull ſoules,
they skill little of the ſubſtance of it) doth ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
bewitch and inveigle the people? Shall I think
this to have been the true genuine cauſe? Nothing
leſſe. For our religion of old was (ſaith <hi>Lactantius)</hi>
and ſtill is to be defended, (eſpecially againſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94937:13"/>
thoſe whom God hath ſet over us) not by <hi>fighting,</hi>
but by <hi>dying;</hi> not by cruelty, but by patience; not
by wickedneſſe, but by faith; not by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out into rebellion, but by conſtancie in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.
And yet theſe men, with ſtupendious
boldneſſe, have pretended religion for all their
barbarous and bloudy actions; and made the
doating multitude believe, That all this killing
and ſtaying is for the glory of God. For the glory
of the Devill, is it not? I am ſure the Devils glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in it, and make merry in hell, that we are ſo
mad upon earth; they ſit clapping of their blacke
hands to ſee us together by the eares; there, there,
ſo we would have it. It is no new art to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and to ſet a good face upon a bad cauſe; but
if there were the leaſt affecting ſenſe of religion in
the hearts of men, if they had any taſt of Heaven
or Hell, it would not, it could not be thus. 'Tis
impoſſible mindes ſeaſoned with the ſweet do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Goſpell, which commands us to love
our very enemies, ſhould entertaine thoughts of
deadly hoſtility againſt their friends and brethren.
Certainly the Devill hath diſtill'd the quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence
of his ſerpentine policie into this ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem,
to convert religion, which God intended for
the firmeſt bond of amity, and which naturally
conſerves the peace and incolumity of States and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94937:14"/>
Kingdomes, into the maine cauſe of warre and
bloud-ſhed. The Chriſtian religion; that that
ſhould draw men to diſobedience, that that
ſhould make them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Theeves, Murtherers, Rebels,
Traytors: O blaſphemy! Why, our religion is
all for peace, the Author of it is ſtiled. <hi>The Prince of
Peace, the Lambe of God,</hi> who came into the world
on purpoſe to <hi>guide our feet into the wayes of peace;</hi>
therefore the Angels at his comming proclaimed
<hi>peace,</hi> and when he was come, the religion that he
taught us is called the <hi>Goſpell of peace,</hi> and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
of many admirable precepts of meekneſſe, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
humilitie, innocence, ſubjection, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
&amp;c. all the mothers and nurſes of <hi>peace;</hi> nay it
denounceth damnation to all that break the <hi>peace.</hi>
Let not then turbulent ſpirits and the troublers of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> once offer to ſpeake of religion, for if our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that is, if the Goſpell be true (as who dare
ſay the contrary?) there is no religion in them. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
is as the ſinne of Witchcraft: 1 Sam. 15. 23.</hi>
Witches (they ſay) when they firſt covenant with
the Devill, renounce their Baptiſme, renege their
Chriſtianity: So they, that follow or favour rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious
courſes, had as good renounce <hi>Chriſt,</hi> abjure
his Goſpell; for howſoever they may continue
<hi>formall Profeſſors,</hi> they are <hi>reall Apoſtates.</hi> When I
ſteadfaſtly view the palpable hypocriſie of theſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94937:14"/>
times; my minde leades me to thinke our greateſt
Zealots, that perſonate Saints upon earth to be
no better affected then <hi>Machiavill,</hi> who eſteem'd
it wiſedome to <hi>profeſſe,</hi> but weakneſſe to <hi>believe</hi>
any religion. And indeed nothing doth more
ſtrongly poſſeſſe me with a feare of the large
reigne of Atheiſme in theſe wretched dayes, than
the generall abuſing and profaning of religion, by
making it the grand engine of practiſes, a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zour
to cover the face of all knavery and impiety,
a meere legerdemaine to mock vulgar eyes: For,
marke it; if the deſigne be to make a fortune, or
to mend a broken one, to ſatisfie ſome revengefull
or ambitious humour, the onely ſure way to effect
it, is, to proclaime a Faſt, to overlay it with the
faire colours of religion. Men now a dayes would
ſeeme out of meere devotion and conſcience to
breake all Gods Commandements in the higheſt
degree. O times! what can be added to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
of this age, wherein ſuch foule and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
villanies, all manner of tyrannicall outrages
are perſwaded, acted, and applauded, as ſingular
teſtimonies of our good affection to Chriſt and his
religion?</p>
            <p>But to give over this Scrutinie: whatſoever
the cauſe was, liſten to a prodigie, by which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the helpe of a prophetick ſpirit, you may eaſily
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94937:15"/>
prognoſticate, what the effect will be. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes
of a Serpent, called <hi>Amphisbaena,</hi> a Serpent with two
heads, one where it ſhould be, the other where
the tayle ſhould be, at each end a head: which
two heads ſtriving to goe contrary wayes, doe
miſerably ſtraine and wring the body, and at laſt
with continuall biting and fighting, woory and
teare it all to pieces. To apply it were to reproach
ye with dulneſſe; onely, what can come of our
unnaturall and virulent diſtractions, but ſuch
hopes to our enemies, ſuch feare to our ſelves; joy
to our enemies, ſorrow to our ſelves; encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to our enemies, diſheartning to our ſelves;
and finally triumph to our enemies, unprofitable
repentance to our ſelves? Theſe things conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
it concerneth us to cry mightily unto the Lord,
and with ardencie more then ordinary, to <hi>pray for
the peace of Ieruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> may be as a City at unity in
it ſelfe: pray alſo that ſhe may have <hi>peace in her
borders,</hi> peace with her neighbours: The word
in the text is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in the duall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that is pray for the peace of the two <hi>Ieruſalems,</hi>
pray for the peace of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> That
as we have one land, one language; one religion,
one King, one God; ſo we may be of one mind.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94937:15"/>
I ſpeake not this out of puſillanimity, or any baſe
feare of that moſt inſolent and moſt unexcuſable
enemie, for he carrieth the heart of a leveret in the
boſome of a man, that being ſuperiour to his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
in cauſe, ſhould be inferiour in courage;
but I ſpeake it out of compaſſion to my bleeding
Country, and out of horrour and deteſtation of
the infinite miſchiefes of civill warre, rapes, rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
proſcriptions, depopulations, ſacking, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
killing, and a world of miſeries. O caſt your
ſorrowfull eyes upon the preſent lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>England,</hi> lately one of the moſt happy, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
rich, reſplendent, renowned regions in the
world; now nothing but a great ſlaughter-houſe,
the true repreſentation of all the cruell and curſed
effects of diſcord, the lively picture of all deadly
calamities; behold in all places what harmes and
havocke warre hath made, and then joine your
acclamations with mine, <hi>O bleſſed, thrice bleſſed be
the Peace-makers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will conclude with a briefe admonition, that
<hi>Ieruſalem</hi> would not put a barre betweene <hi>Prayer</hi>
and <hi>Peace.</hi> If prayer and religious duties (for
prayer <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> containes them all) be the moſt ſure
preſervatives of peace while we have it, and the
moſt ſoveraigne reſtoratives when we have loſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94937:16"/>
it; then, by the Law of contraries, ſinne and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety
is moſt deſtructive and obſtructive of it.
Therefore let us not, as our manner is, ſhift off and
transferre the fault, for unleſſe we had no ſinne
our ſelves, why ſhould we throw ſtones at others?
but let every one call himſelfe to a ſtrict account,
deſcend into his owne breaſt, and there like <hi>Jonas</hi>
aſleepe in the ſides of the ſhip, he ſhall finde the
cauſe of all theſe ſtormy commotions, his owne
ſinne and tranſgreſſion: upon this diſcovery, let
him ſadly weigh and deeply conſider what it is to
be guilty of the deaths of ſo many thouſands, guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the deſolation of a moſt glorious Church,
guilty of the ſubverſion of a moſt flouriſhing
Kingdome: for to all theſe every mans ſinne doth
make him acceſſary. For, as it appeares by that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Dialogue betweene <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> if a
Land be ſupported and ſaved by the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Inhabitants, then it is loſt and ruin'd
by the <hi>wickedneſſe of them that dwell therein.</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
and peace may kiſſe each other, but
wickednes and peace cannot dwell long together.
I might preſent ye with a cloud of examples out of
ancient and moderne, prophane and divine ſtorie.
How often in the booke of <hi>Iudges</hi> doe we reade,
<hi>againe Iſrael committed wickedneſſe in the ſight of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94937:16"/>
Lord?</hi> and <hi>againe Iſrael committed wickedneſſe in the
ſight of the Lord:</hi> and againe, and againe, and <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
quoties, Iſrael</hi> ſmarted for it, and were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into the hands of their enemies. But why
ſhould I fetch in forraine Precedents, our ſelves at
the preſent being a fearefull example of this truth
to all the world? For though we had a wall of
water,<note place="margin">Nah. 3.</note> the Sea for our wall, as <hi>Alexandria</hi> had;
though we had a wall of wood, a mighty Fleet, as
<hi>Athens</hi> had; though we had had a wall of braſſe,
as (they ſay) <hi>time was,</hi> when we might have had;
and a mighty rampire of mountaines, as <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>
had; yet ſinne ſo abounding within, <hi>centuplex
murus rebus ſervandis parum eſt,</hi> an hundred walls
would not have kept the enemies out: no, nor
the Horſes and Chariots of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> our prayers
were not able to guard us: For <hi>if we regard iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in our hearts, the Lord will not heare us,</hi> ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid:</hi>
Why ſhould he heare <hi>vs,</hi> who will not heare
<hi>Him?</hi> Why ſhould he give us <hi>audience,</hi> who deny
him <hi>obedience?</hi> Why ſhould be reſpect our <hi>prayers,</hi>
who diſ-reſpect his <hi>precepts? Qui orat &amp; peccat,
non orat Deum, ſed deludit Deum,</hi> to ſinne and pray,
and pray and ſinne, is not devotion but deluſion:
Nay, for us to pray for peace, who have abuſ'd it
to his diſhonour, and will not be reclaim'd
by Warre, is <hi>impudens poſtulatio,</hi> a very impudent
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94937:17"/>
requeſt. <hi>VVe know</hi> (ſaith the blinde man in the

               <hi>we know that God heareth not ſinners.</hi> If
them we come before him with our ſinnes unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,
with foule and contaminated conſciences,
lifting up impure hands; pray we never ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly,
<note place="margin">Iſai. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Give peace in our time, O Lord;</hi> Speak peace
unto us, O moſt gracious God, <hi>Pacem te poſcimus
omnes;</hi> what anſwer can we expect, but ſome
ſuch as the furious <hi>Iehu</hi> made to <hi>Iehoram?</hi> What
peace, ſo long as your ſinnes and iniquities
are ſo many? and then let fly his arrow and kill
us all. Therefore, as God directs ye by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<hi>VVaſh yee, and make yee cleane; ceaſe to doe
evill, and learne to doe well:</hi> and then we may goe
with boldneſſe to the throne of heavenly grace:
then come, and let us joyne the deſires of our
mindes, and the requeſts of our mouthes; Let us
with one heart, and one voyce, <hi>Pray for the peace
of Ieruſalem,</hi> that <hi>peace within her walls,</hi> and <hi>proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

Which the God and Father of <hi>peace</hi> grant, for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
