            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ength of Age argues strength of Constitution; and as in Naturall bodies, so this Rule holds good likewise in Politicall: Whence it may be inferrd, that the Signorie of <hi>Venice</hi> from Her Infancy was of a strong Symmetry, well nursd, and swadled with wholsom <hi>Lawes,</hi> which are no other than the <hi>ligaments</hi> of a State, or the Arteries whereby the bloud is directed and strengthened to run through all the veines in due proportion, though Nature allowes <hi>som</hi> to have a greter quantity than others. To this may be attributed Her so long <hi>duration,</hi> for having bin born a Christian, and Free from the beginning, She hath continued a pure <hi>Virgin,</hi> and an <hi>Independent</hi> (but only upon Her-self) neer upon 13 Ages; She hath shind in Her <hi>VVatry</hi> Orb among all other Republiques upon Earth, as the <hi>Moon</hi> doth in the Heavens among the rest of the Planets, Though She hath cop'd with the gretest Potentats of the World, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the huge <hi>Ottoman</hi> Emperour Her Neighbour; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not only scratchd his face, and oftentimes cut off those tuffs of hair wherin his strength lay for the time, but peeld his beard, and somtimes pluckd him by the Mustachos; She is now in actuall luctation, and hath bin any time these six yeers at handy-gripes with that monstrous Giant, who this yeer
<pb facs="tcp:49798:4"/>
intends to bend, and bandy all his Forces both by Land and Sea, to <hi>ravish</hi> and ruin Her; Therfore it imports all Christian Princes to resent Her condition, She being both the Key, and Bulwark of <hi>Europe</hi> that way; And, with humble leave I speak it, it may well becom <hi>England</hi> (now that she is more formidable at Sea than ever) to be sensible of Her case, <hi>That</hi> Republic having bin her antient Confederat ever since the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation of the Holy Warr, and having, for this last Centurie, mingled interests, and run the same cours of state with Her; Nor is it a Quaere altogether impertinent, but may very well admit of a debate, whether a <hi>warr</hi> against the Turk might not prove more advantagious to <hi>England</hi> than his <hi>wares.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, if likenes may beget love, <hi>England</hi> hath reson to affect <hi>Venice</hi> more than any other, for in point of security ther is much resemblance between them, being both seated in the Sea, who is their best Protector; The one preserves Her-self by her Gallies, the other by her Galeons; The fairest flower of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> is the Dominion of the Narrow Seas, the gretest glory of <hi>Venice</hi> is the Dominion of the Adriatic Gulph 700 miles in extent; <hi>Venice</hi> had the chiefest hand in framing the Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Lawes for Sea cases, by which all the Levant parts are guided; and <hi>England</hi> was the busiest in constituting the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim Lawes of <hi>Oleron,</hi> whereby the Western World is governd.</p>
            <p>This following Survay (which is like a Frame indented with sundry peeces) will, I beleeve, make the Reder both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and inwardly acquainted with this <hi>Mayden</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, for it shewes Her policy and power, Her warrs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, and confederacies, Her interests of State, together with Her advantages and defects, and how farr She hath trodd in the stepps of old <hi>Rome;</hi> Therfore, most humbly under favor, the Author deemd it a peece of industry not alltogether unworthy to be presented unto that Noble Assembly by</p>

            <p>The Eastern Emperours have divers times set upon her skirts, The Gran Turk hath bin often at Her, (and She is now tugging hard with him) but he could never have his will of Her, for though She hath often clos'd with him, yet She came still off with her mayden-head cleer; She hath had sundry Thunder-bolts darted at Her from the <hi>Vatican,</hi> yet She kept her self still free from all inward combustions, and all popular tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults both in her <hi>Church</hi> &amp; <hi>State,</hi> notwithstanding that She expeld from her Territories, the greatest supporters of the Popes Chair, when She gave the <hi>Iesuits</hi> this cold farewell, <hi>Andate, niente pigliate, &amp; mai retornate, Goe your wayes, take nothing, and never return;</hi> As also that She long since made her Ecclesiastics incapable to inherit <hi>Stable</hi> possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or sit in the Senat, in regard they have a dependance and juramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall obligation, in divers things, to another <hi>Prince, viz.</hi> the Pope; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore before any suffrage passe in the Councell, the common cry is, <hi>fuora I preti, Out Presbyters;</hi> This curbing of the Clergy hath caus'd divers clashes twixt <hi>her</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> so that once the Pope began to question Her right to the Dominion of the <hi>Gulph,</hi> and asking her Ambassador what warrant She had for it, He answered, <hi>If your</hi> Holines <hi>please to produce the Instrument wherby the Emperour</hi> Constantine <hi>passed over the City of</hi> Rome <hi>to your predecessors, upon the back of that Grant your</hi> Holines <hi>will find the</hi> Venetian <hi>Charter to the Dominion of the</hi> Adriatic <hi>Gulph;</hi> Another time <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13. threatning to excommunicat the <hi>Doge</hi> and the Senat about a controversie that had arisen touching the bounds of their Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, <hi>Nicholas Pontanus</hi> answered, <hi>Censuram Pontificiam esse gladium va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina inclusum, qui temerè distringi non deberet, ne discerent homines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnere ejusmodi Tel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Christian Princes who deserve better of <hi>Rome</hi> than <hi>Venice,</hi> for She hath often supported the Popes <hi>Chair</hi> when it was tottering, nay, being once quite thrust out She riggd her gallies and resettled <hi>Him</hi> in it as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peer: And of later yeers She resented it extremely when <hi>Bourbon</hi> scal'd the walls of <hi>Rome;</hi> Besides, She wold not admit <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth's Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador from <hi>France</hi> to Her Chappell till his Master was reconcil'd to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor did She keep Saint <hi>Peters</hi> bark only from sinking, but She spread her sayles, and displayed her banners allso for preserving the Eastern Emperour (when <hi>Christian</hi>) from the furie of the Saracens and other barbarous peeple.

               <head>Som Reasons why <hi>Venice</hi> hath lasted so long in the same condition of <hi>Liberty.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>NOw, how this longliv'd Republic came to do those notable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievments abroad, and conserve her self from all popular tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and revolutions at home so many Ages, may be imputed, (besides the politic frame of her goverment in generall, which shall be treated of hereafter) to these particular reasons following.</p>
               <p>1. SHE hath bin allwayes constant to her <hi>self,</hi> and to her first fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls &amp; principles, for She hath bin allwayes an enemy to change, holding it to be a wholsom caveat that <hi>Ipsa mutatio consuetudinis magis perturbat novitate quàm adjuvat utilitate, viz.</hi> The change of custom useth to perturb a State more by it's <hi>noveltie,</hi> than advantage it by it's <hi>utilitie;</hi>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49798:8"/>
She hath a rule allso that <hi>malè positum saepiùs mutatur in pejus,</hi> This makes her decrees irrevocable; As one of her Ambassadors answer'd <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> when he interceded for the abrogation of a Decree of Hers, <hi>Serenissime Rex, Senatus Venetus diu deliberat, antequam decernat, sed quod seriò decrevit revocat nunquam; Most gracious King, the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Senat doth deliberat a long time before it decrees any thing, but when it is once seriously decreed 'tis never revoked.</hi> Whereunto he added further, <hi>gli Decreti di Venetia non sono comme ligridi di Parigi, The Decrees of Venice are not like the cryes of Paris</hi> (meaning the French <hi>edicts</hi>) proclam'd to day, and repeal'd to morrow. To this maturity of deliberation, may be added, the gravity of her Senators, and the exact reverence the younger sort bear, not only to the <hi>persons,</hi> but <hi>opinions</hi> of their Elders; It is not there as in other places, where young men make lawes for old men to observe, they abhorre that inversion of the Law of Nature, but <hi>gray heads sway, and green heads obey;</hi> so provident they are of the future, when they consult of a busines to day, they think what may befall 100<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yeers after. Nor is ther any admitted to their superior Councells till he be somwhat stricken in yeers, untill he hath pass'd employments of public trust within her own Territories, or Embassies abroad. Touching this second service they have certain degrees which they observe in the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of their Ambassadors, for commonly one passeth from the Cantons of <hi>Swisserland</hi> to be Ambassador in <hi>Holland,</hi> thence he is transmitted to <hi>England,</hi> thence to <hi>France,</hi> so to <hi>Spain,</hi> and thence either to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or to be <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ailio</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where he lives in great height, and is not accountable for his expences as all other Ambassadors are, nor ever after employed in any Legation.</p>
               <p>But though She be so constant to her <hi>self</hi> at home in Her primitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, and intrinsique goverment, yet in her correspondency, leagues and confederacies abroad She often varies, and casts her cours of policy into new moulds, as the Fortune of other Princes or States do rise or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline; her principall aym being to keep not only the State of <hi>Italy,</hi> but allso <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which are the two poles whereon <hi>Europe</hi> may be sayed to move, in <hi>Aequilibrio,</hi> To keep them in a counterpoize.</p>
               <p>2. Another cause of the <hi>longaevity</hi> of this Republic may be allegd to be, that She hath allwayes bin more inclind to <hi>peace</hi> than <hi>war,</hi> and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen rather to be a Spectatrix or Umpresse, than a Gamestresse, Her chief motto being, <hi>Pax tibi Marce;</hi> Insomuch that no Christian Prince or State, except the Popedom, hath labourd more by costly Legations to reconcile the quarrells of <hi>Europe,</hi> and quench the fyre that issued out of them to the disturbance of the public peace, as allso for preventing the advantages which the Common Enemy the <hi>Turk</hi> (one of her next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) might take therby: which hath bin the cause that for the <hi>saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> of her men, and maturenes of her Counsells, She hath bin oftentimes desird to be Mediatrix of differences 'twixt the greatest Potentates, which She hath don with that addresse and diligence as is admirable, so that <hi>Thuanus</hi> gives her this character, to be <hi>Civilis prudentiae officina,</hi> the shop of civill prudence.</p>
               <p>3. A third reason for the continuance of this Republic in such a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49798:8"/>
prosperous condition may be sayed to be the rare temper of her peeple, who with exact obedience and promptitud execut what is enjoynd them by their Superiours; so that it may be sayed of <hi>Venice</hi> what a grave Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian speaks of <hi>Sparta,</hi> when he pass'd his judgment of Her, <hi>Sparta diu stetit, non quod Rex benè</hi> imperabat, <hi>sed quia populus benè</hi> parebat, <hi>Sparta lasted so long, not as much that the Prince did command well, as that the peeple did obey well.</hi> Nor, is the <hi>Venetian</hi> of so volatil an humor; and so greedy of change as other Italians, he is not so fickle as the <hi>Florentine, Milaneze,</hi> or they of <hi>Naples,</hi> who, as the History relates, hath had eight and twenty revolutions (with this last) in lesse then 300. yeers, in which time the Napolitan Courser threw off his Rider five times.</p>
               <p>4. Add herunto that the <hi>Venetians</hi> are mighty good Patriotts, and love their Country in an intense degree, every Gallie that goes in cours thinks she hath <hi>Venice</hi> her self aboard of her; as if the print of that old Roman rule were stil fresh in their hearts, <hi>Dulce &amp; decorum pro patria mori:</hi> And as in this particular, so in many qualities besides, the soul of <hi>Rome</hi> seems to have transmigrated into <hi>Venice,</hi> as shall be shewn herafter. They are equally studious and eager to conserve the glory and greatnes of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public,</hi> for which they have bin ever ready to part with their bloud and fortunes; There are many examples how the women have bin ready to part with their braceletts, earings and necklaces in time of extremity, nay they have offered their very <hi>hair</hi> to make <hi>ropes</hi> for their gallies, &amp;c. But though they continue still such great Zelotts to their own <hi>Country,</hi> and goverment thereof, they are not so to the <hi>Church</hi> of late years, as it is observ'd; and were it not for those confusions that ensued therby in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countreys, and the hatred they shold heap upon themselfs from their neighbours, som think the <hi>Republic</hi> by this time would have drawn her neck from the Roman yoak, which made Cardinall <hi>Ossat</hi> say, that <hi>Venice</hi> hath now no more devotion to <hi>Rome</hi> than needs.</p>
               <p>5. A fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t reason that <hi>Venice</hi> hath continued a <hi>mayd</hi> so many Centuries of yeers, is, her advantagious site and position, being seated in an arm or Estuary of the <hi>Adriatic</hi> Sea upon an Assembly of small Ilands to the nomber of above threescore consociated and leagud together by 800. and odd bridges; so that sitting thus securely on <hi>Thetis</hi> lapp, She need not fear any invasion by land, or any approaches to her from sea without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pilotts: She hath as it were cutt the Ocean into so many aqueducts through her streets, as we read <hi>Cyrus</hi> causd the River <hi>Pindes</hi> to be draind into 360. channels, which he did out of a revenge because she had drownd one of his horses, but <hi>Venice</hi> clean contrary doth this out of affection to <hi>Neptun,</hi> that therby She might embosom her self the more easily between his armes. This rare situation of the City of <hi>Venice</hi> induc'd divers to be of opinion That som superior power to man, That som heavenly Intelligence had a hand in founding and tracing Her out.</p>
               <p>6. Sixtly, This rare perpetuity of the Republic of <hi>Venice</hi> may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crib'd allso to her <hi>Tresure,</hi> and <hi>Arsenal,</hi> wherof the one is grown to be a proverb for <hi>riches,</hi> the other for <hi>strength,</hi> being stord with such huge Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazins of both: The first could never be yet exhausted or estimated; The other can, in case of necessity, put so many Gallies to the sea as ther
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49798:9"/>
be daies in the yeer, having 3000. persons perpetually at work, with other advantages, as will appeer when we com to describe it, with the <hi>Tresury,</hi> for these are but <hi>prolegomena,</hi> and generall <hi>Ideas</hi> of things.</p>
               <p>7. Seventhly, The counterpoise of rewards and punishments may be sayed to have bin the plummetts which have made the great clock of this <hi>Commonwealth</hi> to go tru so many ages: In this government whosoever is detected to have the least attempt or thought of conspiring any thing against the <hi>Republic,</hi> dies without mercy; On the other side, whosoever finds out or invents any thing that may tend either to her advantage or honor, shall be as sure of his reward, as the other of punishment.</p>
               <p>8. Another reason why <hi>Venice</hi> hath lasted so long at such a constant stand, is her wonderfull <hi>sagacity</hi> in discovering any privat conspiracy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Her self, her cautions to prevent it, and ready means to suppresse it; for there is allwayes a privat Armory (besides the great Arsenall) wherin ther are choice armes ready for 1500. men, the musketts, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quibuzes chargd, match ready, and every thing fitted for a present execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in case of a sudden surprize or uprore. This Armory is very secretly kept nere the Dukes Palace, and not to be shown without 3. Gentlemen of the great Councell, being reserv'd meerly for the use and safety of the Senat, in case they shold be assaulted by any ill-favour'd commotion, or privat outrage while they are consulting about the affaires of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public:</hi> It is closely and curiously kept, and hath many new divises of armes, as steel-bowes which shoot needles or small darts, and hitt unseen, ther be musketts and pistolls that will go off 6. times together, halbards with pistolls in them one at each end, strange kinds of polaxes, with other sorts of defensive and destructive armes, if occasion should require. Besides this means of suppressing all violence, she hath many cautions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides to prevent them: It is death without mercy for any of her Senators, Officers or Gentlemen to receave pensions from any other Prince or State; nor is it permitted that they have any privat conversation with their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors or public Agents; Her own Ambassadors must not conceal the presents and gifts they receav'd from other Princes where they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, but at their return they must present them to Saint <hi>Mark</hi>'s Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury, which hath much multiplied the wealth of it.</p>
               <p>9. Another reason of her so constant subsistence may be the sundry restraints She putts to the power of the Prince, which are such, that 'tis impossible for Him to be a Tyrant, or able to attempt any thing against her liberty and government; He may be sayed to be but a Collegue to the rest of the Senators, diffring from them only in the hinmost part of his Capp, which riseth up like a Cornet. <hi>Besides,</hi> though <hi>Maydens</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly love young Men, yet she never chooseth any to be her Prince or Duke till he be stricken in yeers, and season'd with the experience of the world, untill he be half mortified, having shaken hands with those extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant humors, appetits and passions that attend humane Nature.</p>
               <p>Hereunto may be added the limitations She putts to the wealth of the Nobles, that none of them grow over rich, but to such a proportion, in regard that it is a quality ever inhaerent and hereditary in the nature of man, that excesse of riches puffs up the mind, and incites it to ambitious
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49798:9"/>
and high attempts, nor is there a more catching bayt for one to take vulgar affections, and draw them after him, than Wealth: therfore one of her prime principles of State is to keep any man, though having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd never so well by good successe or service, from being too popular; Therfore when forren Ambassadors are employed to Her, they have it among their privat instructions not to magnifie any of her subjects in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, for She cannot endure to hear of it, though She can be allways very well contented to hear Her self extoll'd, and tickled with comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the generall.</p>
               <p>10. Add herunto, that one of her policies is to exempt her Cittizens from going to the warrs, but She hires others in their places, by whose death she sustaineth the lesse losse, for She hath bin allwayes observ'd to be parsimonious of her own bloud: Moreover, She entertaines som for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Prince for Her Generall, whom, the warrs being ended, and the <hi>game</hi> played, She presently <hi>discards;</hi> by which cours She avoyds not only super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous expence, but likewise all matters of faction, and apprehensions of danger, which might well happen if She shold employ any of her own peeple in so high an employment, which might elevat his spiritts to too great an altitud. She hath allso another politic law that permitts not the younger sonnes of the Nobility and Gentry to marry, lest the nomber encreasing so exceedingly it should diminish the dignity, and her great Councell shold be too much pester'd, and this may be one reason why she connives at so many Courtisans for the use of the <hi>Cadett</hi>-gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen.</p>
               <p>11. Eleventhly, the rare secrecie She injoynes in her chiefest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, may be a reason that no forren Prince could come nere her privy parts all this while; for it is there an irremissible crime, and such a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall sin that drawes upon it death without mercy, to reveale the privat transactions, and secretts of her Councell of State; In so much that the designes of this <hi>close Mayd</hi> may be sayed to be <hi>mysteries</hi> till they be put in execution.</p>
               <p>12. Lastly, the cause of her continuance may be imputed to another reach of policy She hath, not to admitt <hi>Churchmen</hi> to any of her se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Councells (nor was She ever subject to the authority of <hi>Women</hi>) And the reason why the Clergy is made incapable to sit in the Senat is, because (as it was touch'd before) they have relation to another gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Pontificiall.</hi> Moreover, She hath had a speciall care of the Pulpit (and Presse) that no Churchman from the meanest <hi>Priest</hi> to the <hi>Patriarch</hi> dare tamper in their Sermons with temporall and State-affairs, or the transactions and designes os the Senat; It being too well known that Churchmen are the most perilous and pernicious Instruments in a <hi>State,</hi> if they misapply their talent, and employ it to poyson the hearts of the peeple, to intoxicat their brains, and suscitat them to sedition, and a mislike of the government; and now Churchmen have more power to do this in regard they have the sway on the noblest part of the rationall Creature, over the soul and the intellectualls; Therfore if any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with matters of State in the Pulpitt, they are punish'd in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary severe manner. Yet they bear a very high respect unto the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49798:10"/>
                  <hi>Church</hi> (as long as she keeps within her own sphere, and breaks not out into ceccentricall and irregular motions.) They suffer Her to this day to enjoy above 2. millions of crowns in yeerly revenue, holding it for a maxime, that reverence, riches, decency and splendor are the greatest pillers that support Religion. She hath allso two very eminent men, the one a sound Divine, the other a learned Casuist, that have a pension from the Republic, who are allwayes ready in case She have any contestation with <hi>Rome,</hi> to defend and vindicat Her by public writing, and to satisfy the world of her proceeding, as <hi>Paolo Servita</hi> did.</p>
               <p>Thus have you in part som reasons (which will be enforced in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing description of her Goverment) how <hi>Venice</hi> came to last so many centuries a pure unspotted <hi>Virgin,</hi> and free not only from all forren ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishments and assaults, but allso from all intestin commotions and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults. 'Tis true that som short combustions have happen'd in Her, but by Her wisedom and providence they prov'd but as fyres of flax or stubble, which no sooner flash'd out but they suddenly extinguish'd of themselfs. And this is the more to be wondred at, because it is observ'd, that as rank excuberant grounds use to be more subject to bear weeds of all sorts, than other soyles, so rich luxurious Citties are more expos'd to corrupt superfluous humors, which use to break out into strange distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and high feavers. 'Tis well known that <hi>Venice</hi> hath bin allwayes such a Cittie, yet by Her extraordinary prudence She hath and doth still preserve her self from such distempers, notwithstanding that She swimms in wealth and wantones as well as she doth in the waters, notwithstanding that She melts in softnes and sensualitie as much as any other whatsoever; for, 'tis too well known, ther is no place where ther is lesse Religion from the girdle downward: yet She suffers not those frayl vessels of plesure to mingle with her other Daughters in Church-Communion.</p>
               <p>But now we will proceed to the Originall of her Republic, and the frame of her Goverment, wherby She hath endur'd so many hundreds of hard winters, and hott sommers.</p>

                  <hi>ITalie</hi> hath bin allwayes accounted the Eye of <hi>Europe,</hi> the Mirrour of policy, and once, Mistresse of the World; Although, putting all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions together, and taking her <hi>length</hi> to peece out her <hi>latitude,</hi> She be scarce as big as <hi>England,</hi> yet hath She a Kingdom 450. miles long, and 112. in breadth, (for <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Calabria</hi> are so) which containes 2700. Townes, 20. Archbishopricks, sixcore and seven Bishops, 13. Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 24. Dukes, 25. Marquises, and 800. Barons: She hath a <hi>Popedom</hi> which extends its Territories 300. miles long, and is situated 'twixt two Seas, <hi>viz.</hi> the Adriatic, and Tyrrhene Seas, and so runs through the midst of Her; which makes the Pope to be more proper ct capable to be an Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire or Enemy upon any occasion of difference that side the Alps; For besides his navall strength he can put into the field an Army of 50000.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49798:10"/>
well arm'd men in case of necessity, being a mixt Prince 'twixt spirituall and temporall.</p>
               <p>She hath allso divers other Principalities; The Dutchie of <hi>Milan</hi> is little inferior to the Popedom in point of strength; The gran Duke of <hi>Toscany</hi> hath 20000. arm'd men inroll'd, train'd up and in perpetuall pay, with 400. light horse, and 100. gendarmes, all which are quarter'd in so narrow a compasse that he can command them all to his Court at <hi>Florence</hi> in fower and twenty howers; The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted allso one of her Princes, is far beyond the <hi>Florentine</hi> in power; There be allso in Her the Dukes of <hi>Parma,</hi> of <hi>Urbin</hi> and <hi>Mantoua,</hi> who are Soverain Princes. Besides all these, <hi>Italie</hi> hath three Republiques, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Venice,</hi> that of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and that of <hi>Luca,</hi> which may be sayed to differ one from the other as the three degrees of comparison, wherof <hi>Venice</hi> is the superlatif; and indeed she may be term'd so, being compar'd to any Republic on earth, take her power by sea and land together. It is well known that Kingdomes take their denomination diversly; som take their names from the whole bulk of Earth and Countrey it self which they possesse, as the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark, &amp;c.</hi> Som are denominated <hi>ab eminentiori,</hi> from the chief Metropolis, as <hi>Rome</hi> in times pass'd had the glory to denominat the whole Empire, and after her <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and as now <hi>Morocco</hi> names that Kingdom, and <hi>Naples</hi> christneth Hers, though I must confesse the King of <hi>Spain</hi> now adaies termes not himself King of <hi>Naples,</hi> but <hi>Utriusque Siciliae,</hi> of both <hi>Siciles,</hi> and it may be thought he doth this to displease the Pope the lesse, who still claymes title to it. Thus is it with Kingdoms, but touching <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,</hi> They for the most part take allways their denomination from the principall Cittie, as <hi>Athens</hi> of old, with divers others, and now <hi>Venice, Genoa, &amp;c.</hi> But I find that <hi>Venice</hi> takes the state upon Her to be nam'd still in the plurall nomber <hi>Venetiae;</hi> which strain of statelines, doubtles with other things she borrowed from the Greeks, who nam'd sundry of their Citties only in the plurall, as <hi>Thebae, Athenae, &amp;c.</hi> but more of this hereafter: Now to her government.</p>

               <p>Now, there is nothing so uncertain and difficult as the Art of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Hominem homini imperare difficillimum,</hi> and those who from <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices</hi> have bin bredd up <hi>Iourneymen,</hi> and <hi>Masters</hi> in this art, and have spent their youth, manhood, and a long time of old age therein, yet when they left the world they profess'd themselfs still but <hi>Novices</hi> therin; And this may be imputed to those various events and contingencies which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend humane negotiations, together with the discrepant fancies of men, specially of the common multitud, who in lightnes match the winds, and outgoe the waves of the Sea in fury oftentimes. Ther is a certain way to break, guide, and keep in aw all other <hi>Animalls,</hi> though never so savage and strong; but there is no such certain way to govern a swarm of men, in regard of such frequent turbulencys of spirit, and variety of opinions proceeding from the <hi>Rationall</hi> faculty, which other cretures, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented only with <hi>sense</hi> are not subject unto: and this may be sayed to be one of the inconveniences that attend <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if ever any hath brought humane government and policy to a <hi>science</hi> which consists of certitudes, the Venetian Republic is She, who is as dextrous in <hi>ruling</hi> men as in <hi>rowing</hi> of a gallie or gondola, otherwise She could never have lasted so long, and kept in such an exact obedience 3. millions of men, for therabouts by frequent censes that have bin made is the nomber of her subjects.</p>
               <p>We are going now to describe the method this Republic hath allwayes us'd in Her goverment, which is the most materiall thing in point of knowledg: For to stand raking the ashes of times pass'd to find out the pedigree of a Peeple, Countrey or Cittie; or to know their power and wealth, their exploits and extent of territory, affoords only matter of discours; but to pry into the <hi>policy</hi> and <hi>soul</hi> of a State, wheron her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment and whole incolumity depends, is a knowledg far more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious and usefull, for therin ther may be things for imitation: Therfore in treating of this Republic, I will begin with the most necessary part, <hi>viz.</hi> the form of her Goverment.</p>
               <p>THe Venetian Goverment is a compounded thing, for it is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all kinds of goverments, if the division of the <hi>Philosopher</hi> into <hi>Monarchy, Aristocracy</hi> and <hi>Democracy</hi> be allowed to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: This goverment may be sayed to have a <hi>grain</hi> of Monarchy, a <hi>dose</hi> of Democracy, and a <hi>dramm</hi> if not an ounce of Optimacy.</p>

Whereupon a Generall Assembly being convokd, wherin the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Grada</hi> presided, divers Speeches were made, That <hi>ther was no more hope of the</hi> Venetian <hi>Commonwealth and public</hi> liberty, <hi>which had bin preservd and purchasd by their noble Progenitors with such heroic resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unlesse the tyranny of the</hi> Tribunes <hi>might be suppressd; otherwise they might be sayed to have left the firm land, to find out slavery among the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many high acrimoniall Orations were pronouncd at this Convention of that nature; wherof ther was one more notable than the rest, which is inserted before the legend of <hi>Paulutio Anafesto,</hi> the first Duke or Prince of <hi>Venice,</hi> as will appeer herafter in the <hi>Historicall</hi> part of this Work.</p>
               <p>Upon the pronouncing of these Speeches, they gave an unanimous shout and suffrage, that a Duke or Prince should be elected, who might represent the whole honor and Majesty of the State, but with such cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teles and reservations that might consist with the public Liberty. And this mutation happend, according to the approvedst Authors, in the yeer after the incarnation 697.</p>
               <p>This Duke ever since hath had the prime place in the Republic; He hath a kind of Regall, though dependent, power; He hath the represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and gravity of a Soverain Governor; He is allwaies stild, <hi>Sere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nissime Princeps,</hi> and reverence is don to him accordingly; He goes all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes cladd in silk and purple, somtimes he shewes himself to the public in a robe of cloth of gold, and a white mantle; He hath his head coverd with a thinn coyf, and on his forhead upward he weares a crimson kind of mitre with a gold border, and behind, it turns up in form of a horn; On his sholders he carries Ermin skinns to the middle, which is still a badg of the Consulls habit; On his feet he weares embroderd Sandalls tied with gold buttons, and about his middle a most rich Belt embroderd with costly jewells; In so much that the habit of the Duke, when at festivalls he shewes himself in the highest state, is valued at above 100000. crownes: He hath a place elevated like a Throne in the Senat. Besides public, he hath peculiar Officers and Ministers of his own, dignified with sundry titles, who have their salary from the Republic: He hath a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49798:12"/>
Chancelor, a Knight Major, who is by particular appellation calld the <hi>Dukes Knight;</hi> He hath divers Chaplaines and Churchmen to attend him, commonly calld <hi>Donzelli,</hi> who wayt on him when he goes abroad; All Magistrats and Cittizens whatsoever speak to him standing, and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, but he doth not rise up to any; All public Letters go forth in his name being seald with <hi>lead,</hi> a particular priviledg which Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the third gave him, for the high favors that <hi>Venice</hi> did the said Pope when he was forcd to fly thither for Sanctuary against the rage of the Emperour <hi>Frederic Barbarossa;</hi> All Decrees, Lawes, and public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments are promulgd in his name; All coines, as well gold as sylver, bear his stamp; All Letters from forren Princes are addressd to him, and answers returnd under his hand, and whether he be present or no yet all Speeches are directed to him, being stild allwayes by Ambassadors and others, <hi>Serenissimo Principe,</hi> Most gracious Prince, in the <hi>concret,</hi> and <hi>Serenità,</hi> in the <hi>abstract.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The office of the Duke was of larger extent at first, but now the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall duties of it are, That he preside in all Councells, as well the great Councell, as other Colleges of Senators; That he have care that every Magistrat acquit himself of his duty; That every Wensday he visit all the Courts, and put every one in remembrance of his office, that privat causes be not neglected, or public delayed: He is not capable of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inferior office; if he find that any one neglects his duty, he is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him before the whole Colledg, and give him sharp reprehensions, but he never useth to do so in privat, and if the offence require it he transmitts him over to the Judges; He is often to grace with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence the Courts of Justice, wher he hath a suffrage; but He can passe no public Instrument, nor dispatch any busines of himself without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of other Senators; nor can he leave the Cittie, or marry any forrener without the knowledg and consent of the Senat; Insomuch that we read of Duke <hi>Falerio</hi> that was putt to death for marrying a Stranger without the suffrage of the Senat: In fine, this high politicall Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat hath only the <hi>presence</hi> of a Soverain Prince, but nothing of the <hi>power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the old records of <hi>Venice</hi> the reasons are yet extant which inducd the Republic to elect this formall Prince for her Head, wherof these are the remarkablest, <hi>We have observd that in this vast Universitie of the World bodies according to their severall natures have multiplicity of motions, yet they receave vertu and vigor but from one, which is the</hi> Sun; <hi>All causes derive their originalls from one supreme cause; We see that in one Creture ther are many differing members, and faculties who have various functions, yet they are all guided by one soul, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke for his Salary hath 100. Zecchins (which coin wants above twelvepence of ten shillings English) brought him every Wensday to his Palace.</p>
               <p>Among all these restraints which keep him from trenching upon the Common Liberty, and doing injustice, ther is another, and that a shrewd one; which is that <hi>Lex repetundarum</hi> may be executed upon his Heir after his death, for there is a <hi>Iunta</hi> appointed to make a scrutiny of the

               <p>Ther is an Officer who in time of exigence is appointed <hi>Proveditor generall</hi> of <hi>Candy,</hi> and he is chosen by the suffrages of the <hi>Senat;</hi> He during the time comands the whole Iland in a supreme way of authority, and hath a kind of <hi>Dictatorian</hi> power for the time: If he comes to any Town or Castle they presently bring him the Keys; He administers the Law himself, if he please, and disposeth of all public levies of moneys; he superintends all kind of Magistrats and Officers both by Land and Sea, and is subject to no controulment but what comes from the Senat.</p>
               <p>Ther is another great Officer calld <hi>Proveditor Generall of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,</hi> and he allso useth to be created upon extraordinary ocasions; He comands all the firm Land in the highest way of authority; He hath a transcendent power over all <hi>Prefects</hi> or Captains, and all other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strats and Officers that are under the Empire of the <hi>Republic,</hi> yet ther

is nothing of moment can occurr, or be putt in execution, but he must receave directions and comand from the Senat.</p>
               <p>Ther are other Officers calld the <hi>Proconsulls of Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> who are created by the suffrage of the Senat, and they are trienniall Magistrats; They have their residence either in <hi>Aleppo</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> or in the Gran <hi>Cayro</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where they live in a decent and splendid equipage; All dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences twixt any Marchants that acknowledg obedience to the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norie of <hi>Venice</hi> are brought before them, and they have power to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the controversie; These <hi>Proconsulls</hi> do allso good offices to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christians, whether Italians or any other Nation, that resort thither either for curiosity or comerce, and they are respected as if they were in qualitie of Ambassadors, or Soverain Agents.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Republic</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> employeth divers <hi>Ambassadors</hi> abroad, and no <hi>State</hi> more, and they are either Ordinary or Extraordinary; The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the Ordinary Ambassadors continueth for three yeers; These are employed to the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> the Kings of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and they have commonly allwayes one residing in all these Courts in a magnificent maner; They have allso an Ambassador in <hi>Constantinople</hi> attending the motions of the great Turk, calld the <hi>Bailio,</hi> residing there perpetually, and the <hi>Republic</hi> allowes him a greater Salarie than to any other; nor indeed hath he any sett Salarie, but whatsoever he spends is allowd him upon his own accounts without examination; all these are elected by the suffrage of the <hi>Senat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Republic employs allso abroad Ambassadors <hi>Extraordinary</hi> very often, who have a greater latitud of power, and are soly for matter of State, or som particular negotiation: The ordinary scope of their Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is either to congratulate or condole with Soverain Princes when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is offerd. All these Ambassadors have <hi>Secretaries</hi> whom the <hi>Senat</hi> takes notice of, and the <hi>Republic</hi> allowes them a Salarie, and they are persons of good extraction and breeding; this is don because they may afterwards be in a capacity, for their knowledg and experience, to be Ministers of State themselfs: But touching Ambassadors Extraordinary ther are never any employd unlesse they have bin Ambassadors formerly. And touching this kind of employment the <hi>Republic</hi> hath certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, or Scalary ascents and rules of removall, which are never trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressd. These kind of political and public Ministers are strictly examind by a Junta expressly for the same end at their return touching their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment in the Legation, They are to discover what Presents they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceavd from the Prince or <hi>State</hi> to whom they were sent, and it is of dangerous consequence for them to conceale any thing.</p>
               <p>These are the Magistrats and Officers wheron the Republic of <hi>Venice</hi> hath stood firm, as upon so many pillars, so many centuries: Now, ther are few or none who are greater <hi>Patriotts</hi> than the Venetian Gentlemen, their prime <hi>study</hi> is the public good and glory of their Countrey, and <hi>civil prudence</hi> is their principall <hi>trade</hi> wherunto they arrive in a high mesure; Yet as it may be easily observd, though these Gentlemen are extraordinary wise when they are <hi>conjunct,</hi> take them <hi>single</hi> they are but as other Men.</p>

She hath the shape of a Bow bent towards the East; She is mountanous towards the South, and flat towards the North; Her soyl is craggy and destitut of water, so that a South wind oftentimes spoyles their Harvest, therfore do they employ the Earth in planting Vineyards and Olives, with other fruit trees, and what they produce is extraordinarily good in evry kind; In so much that She a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with Wine, Wax, Honey, Oile, Pomcitrons and divers other fruits; On the North side ther is the Castle of Saint <hi>Angelo</hi> which is notably fortified, so that it hath frustrated the hopes of the Turk in sundry expeditions; Towards the East ther are divers Creeks and Ports with two <hi>Peninsulas,</hi> where upon one of them stands <hi>Pagiopolis,</hi> the other by a little streight is cutt off from the Great Iland: Opposit to these stands <hi>Corfú</hi> at the foot of a hill, with two Castles strongly built by rules of Enginry which in a manner hang over her; wherunto ther is another lately built of very great consequence: Upon the right side of the Cittie ther lieth a Promontorie where the famous Fountain <hi>Card<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>CEphalonia</hi> is of a triangular form, and hath in circumference 160. miles; She hath many Stations for Shipps, among whom <hi>Argostolica</hi> is the chiefest, and capable to hold any Fleet within her Bosom: Ther is another that lieth behind a Promontory calld <hi>Guiscardo,</hi> wher ther yet remain many ruines of Castles, Palaces and other Edifices; and ther are daylie diggd out of the Earth many old Coines, with other Monuments of Antiquity. This Iland produceth a good proportion of Wheat and Oil, and She is well stord with Sheep; She hath allso plenty of Hony, of Manna and Raysins of the Sun, but She wants a sufficient competency of Water; Ther is a white Muscadel Grape that growes which perfumes the breath after it is eaten, and that Wine which is made therof is accounted the delicatst sort of Greek Wines, though it make the brain clowdy if one drinks above two cupps; but by reason of the over delicatnes therof it cannot brook the Sea any long time, but it will prick, and lose both tast and colour. This Iland may have about 20000. Soules men and women in her; This Iland is computed to have 200. Townes of all sorts, besides those two before mentiond, <hi>Nollo</hi> is the chiefest.

                  <hi>CRete,</hi> now calld <hi>Candie,</hi> is one of the most noble Ilands of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea; She hath 270. in length, and 50. in latitud; Her situation is so oportune, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmed She was so situated that Natur her self intended her to be Mistresse of the Sea; She is but a few dayes sayl, not 100. distant both from <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> being equally remote from both; from <hi>Caramania, Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Albania</hi> She is 300. miles distant; Her Coasts are fretted out into divers Creeks and Promontories, the principall wherof are <hi>Capo Spada,</hi> and <hi>Capo Salmone,</hi> wherof the one looks Westward, the other Eastward, but in the midst betwixt both <hi>Drepano</hi> rayseth up himself which is now calld <hi>Capo Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecca,</hi> and the Promontory <hi>Zephyrium</hi> which is now calld <hi>Alcelico;</hi> That part of the Ile which beholds the Sun rising lyeth high and is not so fruitfull. Among the rest of the Hills wherwith this gentle Iland swells up and down, Mount <hi>Ida</hi> stands. This Iland was calld in old time <hi>Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tompolis</hi> or <hi>Cent oppidum,</hi> having 100. Citties in her, but now She hath not three of any moment, and they are towards the North. The chiefest is <hi>Candia</hi> (formerly calld <hi>Candida</hi> or <hi>Candace</hi>) which hath about 100000.

Souls or therabouts; But up and down evry where ther are Ruines Marks and Monuments of Antiquity, and of other old Townes; That part which looks towards the South is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested ever and anon with Northern blasts. The secundity of the Iland consists in pasturage, and Valleys wherin ther are great nombers of Cattle feeding, and on her Plaines ther is good store of Corn growes, but not a competent quantity for the whole Iland; She abounds with rare Wines famous all the Earth over; Ther is great store of Hony had there, which is carried most comonly to <hi>Alexandria;</hi> Ther is no place in the World wher ther be such high and goodly Cypresses; She hath but small Rivers; This Iland sympathiseth in one qualitie with <hi>Ireland,</hi> for She produceth no venemous Beast; She abounds with a luscious Wine calld Muskadell, wherof the English Marchants have brought som yeers into <hi>England</hi> above 12000. Butts, together with Sugar-Candie, Gumms, Hony, Sugar, Olives, Dates, Apples, Oranges, Lemmons, Cittrons, Pomgranatts.

               <p>This <hi>Wonder of Citties</hi> is seated in the bosom or betwixt the armes and aestuaries of the <hi>Adriatic</hi> Sea, who spreading himself gently along towards the Continent of <hi>Italie,</hi> leaves som green tuffs or tombs of Earth uncoverd, upon which the Cittie is built, and as it were chaind together by I know not how many hundred Bridges; Insomuch that <hi>Venice</hi> is no other than a Convention of little Ilands peeping up above the Waters, which may be an excuse for her <hi>salacity,</hi> having such a <hi>salt</hi> tayle steepd and brind perpetually in the <hi>Sea:</hi> In so much that it may be well thought that the Goddesse <hi>Venus</hi> and the Cittie of <hi>Venice</hi> had one kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation being both engendred of the Sea; It is allso very likely <hi>Aphrodite</hi> that wanton Lady had her Original out of that white Spume which <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptune</hi> casts upon those little gentle Ilands wheron <hi>Venice</hi> makes her bed.</p>
               <p>The ocasion that made these <hi>watry</hi> Iles a mansion for men, was, when that Northern <hi>deluge</hi> of <hi>Goths, Vandalls, Hunns</hi> and <hi>Longobards</hi> did <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow</hi> all <hi>Italie,</hi> which made peeple of all sorts fly to these Lakes to avoyd the Land <hi>torrent</hi> that was like to swallow them up; and finding the air to be gentle and fitt for habitation and propagation, and the clime

more temperat than in other places, though sited under the same latitud, by reason of the fresh breezes and eventilations of the circumjacent Sea, which makes it lyeope to all winds, and evry point of the Compas; They pitchd their Tents upon these Iles, and associated them by conjoyning Bridges; Inviting all peeple to com and cohabitt with them, In so much that som derive the name of <hi>Venetiae</hi> from the word <hi>Venite, Venite,</hi> (or <hi>Veni etiam,</hi> com again) by which they invited them of the <hi>Continent</hi> to dwell with them, and fix their Commoration there. They are therfore much deceavd who think that the <hi>Gentry</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> are of a baser allay than others, taking them to be no other than Fishermen at first; No, they were of the best rank of peeple, that to avoyd the <hi>inundation</hi> of those barbarous peeple fledd thither from <hi>Rome, Aquileia, Padua, Heraclea</hi> and all other places for a secure rendevous, being frindly invited therunto, which makes the Cittie of <hi>Venice</hi> to be the most hospitable place upon Earth to this day for all Commers.</p>
               <p>Now, the first <hi>Venetians</hi> had not their beginning from <hi>Italie,</hi> but were issued of an ancient race of peeple in <hi>Asia</hi> calld the <hi>Hevetians</hi> of <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> who after the destruction of <hi>Troy</hi> came under the conduct of <hi>Antenor</hi> to <hi>Italie,</hi> whose Tomb is to be seen standing in <hi>Padua</hi> to this day.</p>
               <p>Now the Original of the Cittie of <hi>Venice,</hi> according to the opinion of the most judicious Historians, hapned in this manner. As the fear of the <hi>Hunnes</hi> had possessd most of the Inhabitants of <hi>Italie,</hi> and that the <hi>Venetians</hi> as formost in the danger were more apprehensive therof than any other, therfore for their owne incolumity and freedom, and being neerest than any other, they retird from about those plesant places which borderd upon the <hi>Adriatic</hi> Sea into these small Iles or Lakes whither the Enemy could not pursue them; And those who were the first Leaders were rich and honorable Persons, full of Piety and Religion, specially those of <hi>Aquileia, Padua,</hi> and <hi>Heraclea,</hi> who with their substance and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies came first to <hi>Grada,</hi> and thence to the <hi>Rialto;</hi> Those places wheron at this day the Cittie of <hi>Venice</hi> is seated being then but bare Iles and Mansions for Fish, as many parts of <hi>Holland</hi> was: Now, those of <hi>Padua</hi> were they that began to build at the <hi>Rialto</hi> where the first foundation was layed, and is now as it were the Center of the Cittie; How religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously the same was don may be conjecturd, because by how much the more one did affect Christianity, so much more he shunnd the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the barbarous peeple. The Temple of God was the first House that was in intention, though not in execution, because it was a work of time, wherof the first Stone was layed in Saint <hi>Marks</hi> Place the 25. of <hi>March,</hi> about the Vernall Equinoctiall in the beginning of the Spring, which may be sayed to be a good cause why the Cittie florishd so won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ever sinee, for about the same time the first <hi>Man</hi> receavd his <hi>Creation,</hi> and the <hi>Redeemer of Mankind</hi> his <hi>Conception.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now allbeit for populating this new Cittie all the most experienced Mariners were calld from all parts, with promise of reward to such as could build Shipps, yet as the old Records have it, they were carefull not to admitt any man of a servile condition, or any Murtherer or Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitifs
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49798:23"/>
for offences; with such sorts of men we find that <hi>Rome</hi> was first populated.</p>
               <p>The new Cittie did daylie encrease in Inhabitants and building, when a fyre kindled upon a sudden and burnt 24. Houses; and because the matter which fedd the fyre was scatterd here and there, and so could not be quenchd by humane strength, all the peeple betook themselfs to their prayers, and, as the Record hath it, so soon as they had made a vow to erect a Church to the honor of God, calld Saint <hi>Iames</hi> Church, the fury of the fyre ceased; This Church is to be seen standing to this day in good repair in the midst of the <hi>Rialto,</hi> and this was about the yeer 400. At first they were governd by <hi>Consulls,</hi> then came they under a <hi>Tribunary</hi> power, then under a Prince or <hi>Duke</hi> because ther is a greater energie of love and power in unity; yet this Duke is but a kind of Collegue with som others of the Senators, and differs only from them in the rising corner of his Capp; When he goes abroad in State the Sword is carried <hi>behind him,</hi> but <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Senat</hi> who com after him, and he is so restraind that 'tis impossible for him to be a Tyrant.</p>
               <p>Ther have bin since the beginning of this Principality neer upon 100. Dukes, wherof 12. have bin either <hi>slain</hi> or sentencd; Ther is <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>chance</hi> that concurr in his creation; Now as <hi>Senatus ex Populo,</hi> so <hi>Princeps è Senatu oritur,</hi> and commonly one of the <hi>Procurators</hi> of Saint <hi>Mark</hi> is chosen; As the <hi>Popes,</hi> so the <hi>Princes</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> are made of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient men, who have passd through divers Offices, and so have bin long bredd up in the School of Experience, which is that <hi>great Looking-glasse of Wisedom;</hi> Persons that have their humors daunted, and their passions mortified in them. <hi>Contarenus</hi> describes the election of the Duke in this maner; Presently upon the vacancy, all the Gentry above 30. do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble. So many as meet cast their names into a Pott, and in another are just so many Balls, wherof 30. only are gilt, then a Child draweth for each, till the 30. gilt ones be drawn, for which 30. the Child draweth again a second time out of another Pott that hath only 9. gilt Balls; The 9. so drawn nominat 40. out of which 40, 12. are again selected by the same kind of lott; These 12. nominat 25. out of whom 9. are by lott sett again apart; These 9. nominat 45. who are by lott reducd again to 11. These 11. choose 41. of the Senat of the best and principall rank; These 41. after evry one hath tied himself by solemn Oath to choose whom they shall think most worthy, write in Scrolls whom they think most worthy; the Scrolls are mingled together and then drawn, the fittnes of the Persons thus drawn is discussd, and he who hath most voices above 25. is the Man whom they pronounce to be elected, and adjudg him to be created Duke with all Solemnities; by lott allso they choose Gentlemen to sitt in the Senat, and creat public Officers, so that this <hi>Republic</hi> hath much of the modell of <hi>Platoes</hi> platform.</p>
               <p>Som derive the Etimologie of this rare Cittie from <hi>Venetia,</hi> which in old Latin signifieth the frothing or seething of the Sea, for as <hi>Varro</hi> hath it, <hi>Venetia est maris exaestuatio quae ad littus pellitur:</hi> Ther are 72.

impetuousnes of the waves extending in length above 6. miles, through which ther are 7. places broken out for passages of Boats, but no way for Vessells of bigger burden saving at <hi>Malamocca,</hi> which is 3. miles distant from the main Cittie, and at the Castles of <hi>Lio,</hi> which are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified according to the utmost art of Enginry; So that tis impossible to surprize <hi>Venice,</hi> or to take Her, unlesse it be by an Army of 150. miles compasse; She is above 8. miles in circuit, and hath of all sorts neer upon 1000. Bridges; Besides, ther be above 20000. Gondolaes which ply up and down perpetually, som wherof have two rowers, som more; so that in case of necessity the Cittie could make an Army of above 50000. Gondoliers.</p>
               <p>Her Fabriques public and privat are extraordinary specious and sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and Her Streets so neat and eevenly pavd, that in the dead of Winter one may walk up and down in a pair of Sattin Pantables and Crimson Silk Stockins and not be dirtied: Ther are above 200. Palaces fitt to receave any Prince with his ordinary retinue; In fine, Her situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is so rare, evry street allmost having an arm of the Sea running through it, and Her Structures so magnificent and neat, that this <hi>Virgin</hi> Cittie useth to ravish at first sight all Strangers that come to visit Her, specially if they com from Sea, and not passd through others of the dainty Townes of <hi>Italie.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Venice</hi> besides Her 150 Churches and Monasteries, hath three things worthy of sight, <hi>viz.</hi> Saint <hi>Marks</hi> Church and Steeple, the <hi>Tresury,</hi> and the <hi>Arsenal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church is built throughout with rare Mosaique work, and the furniture of the Church surpasseth the Fabrique in richnes; Her Walls are inlayed in many places with precious Stones of divers colours, and in such a maner that they seem to be the work of Nature rather than of Art; but the full description of this Temple shall be reservd for another place, <hi>viz.</hi> for that time that Saint <hi>Marks</hi> body was first transported from <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> which will appeer in the Historicall part as I shall run over the Lifes of the Dukes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arsenal of Venice</hi> is one of the greatest Magazins of armes in all the World; It is 3. miles in compas, of which circuit the Turks <hi>Seraglio</hi> is thought to be; ther are above 300.

he espouseth the Sea to the Cittie once evry yeer: which rare priviledg Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> endowed the Cittie withall, as an argument of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titud to Her for preserving him from the fury of the Emperour <hi>Frederic Barbarossa,</hi> for taking <hi>Otho</hi> his Son Prisoner in his quarrell, and for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing him to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire again when he was fledd from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi> for shelter; He allso gave the <hi>Republic</hi> a priviledg to <hi>seal with lead</hi> the same time, and made Her Lady of all the <hi>Adriatic</hi> Gulph which extends above 700. miles. This <hi>Bucentoro</hi> is the self-same Vessell wherin Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> performd this Ceremony of marrying <hi>Venice</hi> to the Sea many hundred yeers agoe, and She is still usd to fetch in Ambassadors and Forren Princes when they come to visitt the Cittie; but though She be still taken for the same Shipp, yet I beleeve ther is little of the first Materialls remaining in Her, She hath bin so often trimmd, putt upon the Carine, and metamorphosd. The sight of this Shipp when I was there, made me think on <hi>Theseus</hi> famous Shipp (as I have it elswhere) Nay, it made me fall upon an abstracted notion of Philosophy, and a speculation touching the body of man, which being in a continuall flux, and succession of decay, and consequently requiring ever and anon a restauration of what it loseth of the vertu of the former nutriment, and of what was digested after the third concoction into bloud and fleshy substance, which, as in all other sublunary bodies that have internall principles of heat in them, useth to transpire, breath out and wast away through invisible pores by exercise, motion and sleep, to make room still for a supply of new nouriture; I fell, I say, to consider whether our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may be sayed to be of the like condition with this <hi>Bucentoro,</hi> which though it be still reputed the same Vessell, yet I beleeve ther's very little of the first Timber remaining in Her which She had in Her first dock, having bin, as they told me, so often plankd, and ribd, caukd, peecd and gilt: In like maner I considerd our bodies may be sayed to be daylie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paird by fresh sustenance which begetts new bloud, and consequently new spiritts, new humors, and I may well say new flesh, the old by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall deperdition and insensible transpirations evaporating still out of us, and giving way to fresh; so that I made a question whether by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of these perpetuall reparations and accretions the body of man may be sayed to be the same numericall body in his old age that he had in his manhood, or the same in his manhood that he had in his youth, the same in his youth that he carried about him in his childhood, or the same in his childhood which he woare in his mothers womb; this was the theory which the sight of that <hi>amphibious</hi> old yet fresh <hi>Venetian</hi> peece of wood infusd into me at that time.

               <p>This Candiot lay skulking in Saint <hi>Marks</hi> Church divers nights, untill he had wrought a mine under the wall behind an Altar, and so gott in to the Tresury, whence he had embezeld divers rich Jewells to the value of about 200000.

               <p>Among other little gentile Ilands which attend the Cittie of <hi>Venice,</hi> ther is one calld <hi>Murano,</hi> about the distance of a little mile, where Crystall Glasses are made; and tis a rare sight to see a whole Street where on the one side ther are above twenty Furnaces at work perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually both day and night; It hath bin observd and tryed, that if one shold remove a Furnace from <hi>Murano</hi> to <hi>Venice</hi> Her self, nay to the other side of the Street, and use the same men, materialls and fuell, and the same kind of Furnace evry way, yet one cannot be able to make Cristall Glasse in the same perfection for bewty and lustre as they do at <hi>Murano;</hi> And the cause they alledg is the qualitie and cleernes of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambient air which hangs ore the place, and favoureth the manufacture, which air is purified and attenuated by the concurrent heats of so many furnaces together which never extinguish, but are like the Vestall fyres that allwayes burn; Now it is well known in other places, what qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying and extraordinary impressions the air useth to make, as particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly tis observd in the Air of <hi>Egypt</hi> where they use to have so many common Furnaces to hatch Eggs in Camells dung, if, during the time of hatching the air happen to be orecast and obnubilated, not one Egg in twenty will take; but if the Skie continue still serene and cleer, not one in a hundred will miscarry. The art of Glassmaking is very highly valued in <hi>Venice,</hi> for whosoever comes to be a Master of that profession is reputed a Gentleman <hi>ipsa arte,</hi> for the art sake; and it is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason, it being a rare kind of knowledg and Chymistry to transmute the dull bodies of dust and sand, for they are the only main ingredients,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49798:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to such a diaphanous pellucid dainty body, as we see Cristall Glasse is, which hath this property above Gold and Silver, or any other Mineral, to endure no poyson; Glasse allso hath this rare qualitie, that it never loseth any thing of its first substance and weight, though usd never so frequently, and so long: It is wonderfull to see what diversitie of shapes and strange formes those curious Artists will make in Glasse, as I saw a complete Gallie, with all her Masts, Sayles, Cables, Tackling, Prore, Poope, Forecastle, Anchors, with her long Boat, all made out in Cristall Glasse, as allso a Man compleat in armor.</p>

As I stood prying into the materialls, and observ'd the frame of their Furnaces, the transubstantiations, the calcinings and liquefactions that are incident to this fyerie art, my thoughts were raysed up to a higher speculation, <hi>viz.</hi> That if such a small Furnace fyre had vertu to convert lumps of dust and sand crumbled together into such a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent body as Cristall, surely that great Universall Fyrewhich shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen at the Day of Judgment, may by its fervor and violent ardor vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

They have a saying there, that the first hansom Woman was made of <hi>Venice</hi> Glasse, which implies beuty, but brittlenes withall, and <hi>Venice</hi> is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnishd with Cretures of that mould; Her Courtisans love variety, and this makes them so fond of Strangers; They go allwayes vayld in black, wheras Wifes and Women of honor go in colours and unvayld; They are low and of small statures for the most part, which makes them to rayse their bodies upon high shooes calld <hi>Chapins,</hi> which gave one oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to say that the Venetian Ladies were made of three things, one part of them was Wood, meaning their Chapins, another part was their Apparrell, and the third part was a Woman; The Senat hath often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavourd to take away the wearing of those high Shooes, but all women are so passionately delighted with this kind of state that no Law can weane them from it: A Story runns of a strange Gentleman, who being extremely enamord with one of them bargaind for a nights lodging for so many Crownes, but in the morning finding her so low and little from what she had appeerd the day before he wold pay her but the one half of what he had contracted, in regard she was but half the Woman that had bargaind with him formerly. Among other peculiar Lawes in <hi>Venice</hi> ther is one that limitts the Dowries of Women, for lest the Patricians or Gentlemen shold exhaust their estate, and not be able to live like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs, they restrain the Dowry to 16000. Crownes, so that no Senator or Nobleman may give more with his Daughter; but a Plebean marrying his Daughter to a Gentleman may give 20000. Crownes.</p>

                  <p>MOst invincible Emperour, the ancient Philosophers, and the great Men of their times did not err in their opinions when they esteemd that glorie which one gaines by a Conquest over himself to be the truest, the most firm, and best of victories, and to exceed all other acquests, achievements, trophyes and triumphs; This pourchasd <hi>Scipio Major</hi> more honor, and made him more illustrious than by debelling of <hi>Afric,</hi> and daunting the proud Cittie of <hi>Carthage:</hi> Did not the same kind of victorie make that great <hi>Macedonian</hi> immortall, when King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> being discomfited by him prayed the Immortall Gods that they wold establish his Kingdom, which if they pleasd to ordain otherwise he desird no better Successor than so mild an Enemy, and gentle a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. That <hi>Caesar</hi> the Dictator, from whom you have your sirname, and whose fortune, liberality, magnificence and other high virtues you inherit, was not he judgd worthy to be placd among the Gods for his clemency, concessions, gentlenes and mercy? Lastly, the Senat and peeple of <hi>Rome</hi> who were the tamers of the World, whose Empire is now soly in you, and whose amplitude and Majesty doth so shine in you, did not they reduce more Nations to their obedience by their justice, equity and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetude than by warr and arms? Since this is a know truth, <hi>O Caesar,</hi> it will not be the least of your glories, since that you have the victorie ore the <hi>Venetians</hi> now in your hands and power, to call to mind how frayl all humane things are, and consequently to use your victory with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to incline more to the study of peace, than the doubtfull events of warr; for how inconstant all mundane affaires are, how casual, various, false and flattering, how obnoxious the state of Mortalls is to hazard and danger, I shall not need to illustrat either by new or old examples; The Venetian Commonwealth shewes it sufficiently, which being a little while agoe florishing and splendid, illustrious and renowned, and so powerfull that her name and renown was not contented to be bounded within the precincts of <hi>Europe</hi> only, but it passd over to <hi>Afric</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi>

and rebounded with no ordinary applause in the extremest parts of the World: This, this Republic is now by one and that but a slight battail deprivd of the glory of all her Tropheys, She is bereft of her wealth, torn as it were in peeces and trampled upon, daunted and overcom, being destitut of all things specially of Councel, so that the image of her former virtues are faded and allmost utterly defacd, and her wonted heat in arms quite allayed. For in former times the <hi>Venetians</hi> being oppressed with greater calamities, and harassd with worse miseries, ill successes and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, yet they never lost their spirits, no not then when with infinite losses, dangers and hazards they bore up for many yeers against that most cruell tyrant the Turk; nay from being overcom they became conquerors afterwards, They might hope the like now, but the redouted name of your Majesty, and the invincible vertu of your military forces being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, their hearts are so dejected, that ther is little left us to resist, much lesse to overcom; But they are deceav'd, yea mightily deceav'd if the <hi>French</hi> attribute any thing of this to their valour. Therefore all Armes being cast away we place all our hopes in the rare clemency, or rather the Divine piety of your imperiall Majesty: And in the name of the Prince, the Senat and peeple of <hi>Venice,</hi> with humble devotion and in most supplicant maner we pray, beseech and implore that you wold vouch safe to behold with the countenance of compassion our most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted condition, and to apply som comfortable remedy unto them: All the Laws of peace that you shall impose upon us, we will embrace, we shall obey all just, honest and equitable comands not swarving from reason; But haply we deserve that we lay a necessity upon our self, that all things may return to you as tru and lawfull Prince that which our progenitors took from this sacred Empire, and the Dukedom of <hi>Austria,</hi> which that it may be don more handsomly, we add whatsoever we possesse in the continent, we yeeld, notwithstanding any rites we can clayme unto them. Moreover we are willing to pray every yeer to your Majesty, and the lawfull successors of the Empire 500 weight of Gold in lieu of tribut, and we are ready to obey all Decrees, Manats, Precepts or Lawes, that come from your Majesty. Defend us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from those, we beseech you, with whom we lately joyned our armes, who we find now to be most cruell enemies, which study no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then the utter ruin of the <hi>Venetian</hi> name; Being preserved by this: our clemency we shall call you our farther, and parent, our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector and founder, and we shall digest these your mighty benefits into our annalls, and our late Nephews, shall be ever mindfull of them: And truly this will be no small accession of glory to you, that you were the first before whom the Republic of <hi>Venice</hi> did present her self, to whom she layed down her neck, whom she adores, and reverenceth as som God decended from Heaven. If Almighty God had given our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestros that mind that they had not middled so much with other mens things, our republic had surpass'd by this time all the Citties of <hi>Europe,</hi> whereas she is now forlorn and squalid, coverd over with ashes, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny and shame, having in a moment as it were had her beauty blasted, and becom a derision to all Nations, and lost the glory of all her former

               <p>This was the lamentable speech, that the mayden Republic breath'd out before the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> by the mouth of her Ambassador <hi>Antonio Iustiniano;</hi> but 'tis known that Mayds have teares at will, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most men thought these words were not cordiall but meer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, and to temporize, yet they produced a peace, and 'tis <hi>a cheap peace that is got by a complement;</hi> but this submission the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public made was partly recompencd, by a generous and pious act she did in refusing the help, and Auxiliaries which the Turk offered her so earnestly in those her extremities. About <hi>Addua</hi> she receavd the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall'st blow that ever she had, and it was like to have bin as fatall to her as <hi>Canna</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> or <hi>Pavia</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King; The <hi>Genoways</hi> also brought her once to a low ebb, so that she sent very low proposalls to him, which he refusing, she made vertu of necessity, and reinforcing her self soundly bangd him.</p>
               <p>Before I part with this <hi>Mayden City,</hi> I will make a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel betwixt her and old <hi>Rome,</hi> for of all the Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> thers none resemble her more in her constitutions and policy, nay she is more like old <hi>Rome</hi> then <hi>Rome</hi> her self as now she is, as if the soul of old <hi>Rome</hi> by a Pythagorean kind of meterapluchosis, were transmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into her, she is obdurated with the same kind of vigor and vertu as old <hi>Rome;</hi> but it seemes that she is of a far stonger constitution, and more constant in her way of policy; som do brand the one to be a <hi>Shepheards</hi> Town at first, and <hi>Venice</hi> a <hi>Fisher</hi> Town; 'Tis tru that <hi>Rome</hi> is fabled to be so, so that it might be said, that when the <hi>Pope</hi> came to be her head she was reduced to her first principles, for as a Shepheard was the founder, so a Shepheard (spirituall) is still her preserver from utter ruin, otherwise she had bin long since turn'd into a heap of rubbish which had becom her Tomb; So that Providence seems to have a care of her still, though present <hi>Rome</hi> may be sayed to be but the monument of her self compard to times passd when she was in that florish wherin Saint <hi>Augustin</hi> did wish to see her; She was then of 50. miles circumference as <hi>Vopiscus</hi> witnesseth, and she had 500000. free Cittizens in a famous cense that was made in <hi>Claudius</hi> his time, which allowing but six to evry family in Women, Children and Servants, came to 3. millions of Soules, but She may be sayed to be now but a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernes in comparison of that nomber, yet She is esteemd to have yet bout 14. miles incircuit; Moreover She is much humbled since the Church came to be her Head, for wheras She was before elevated upon seven

Hills, She now spreads her-self upon a flatt, having descended to the Plaines of <hi>Campus Martius:</hi> So She who tamd the World seemd to tame her-self at last, and falling under her own weight grew to be a prey to <hi>Time,</hi> who with his iron teeth consumes all bodies at last, making all things both animat and inanimat which have their being under that changeling the Moon to be subject unto corruption and dissolution.</p>

               <head>A Parallel twixt the Government of old <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe greatest thing wherin old <hi>Rome</hi> differs from <hi>Venice,</hi> is, that after Kings or Souverain Princes <hi>Rome</hi> was governd by <hi>Consulls,</hi> but here clean contrary, after <hi>Consulls</hi> a <hi>Doge</hi> or Princely Head came to govern, yet doth he carry still the badg of a <hi>Consull</hi> in the vest upon his back. Among the Romans <hi>Tribunus Celerum</hi> he who had the comand of the Cavalrie had the chiefest charge, just so, the Venetians use to create a <hi>Captain General</hi> of the Armies in the Continent; and as he at <hi>Rome</hi> defended the King, and Cittie, and was the first that assalted the Enemy, and the last that left the field, so doth the <hi>Venetian General,</hi> therfore he hath the next place to the Prince himself.</p>
               <p>Moreover, a good while passd when the <hi>Consulls</hi> could not levy the cense which evry one according to his substance was bound to pay in regard of other more important affaires wherin they were involvd, therfore the <hi>Censors</hi> were chosen, so calld because their first office was to gather the cense, which was to know the nomber of Cittizens, and putt an estimat upon their states, and so a tax; afterwards this Magistrat did grow to that esteem and use, that he came to have authority allso over the maners and customes of the Romanes, and to have Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency both of the Senat, the Cavalry and Gards. In conformity to this office ther are ten <hi>Censors</hi> in <hi>Venice</hi> which are calld vulgarly <hi>Gli dieci Savii,</hi> the ten Sages, who supervise not only the cense but the Customes allso of the Cittie; But the Cittie encreasing, and peeple multiplying daylie with busines, <hi>Venice</hi> did choose other <hi>Censors</hi> giving them au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the <hi>pomp,</hi> the <hi>food</hi> and <hi>rayment</hi> of the Cittizens; which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrats are calld <hi>la Giustitia nuova,</hi> instituted in the time of <hi>Renier Zeno,</hi> who have authority over all Inns, Hostries, and Lodgers of Strangers.</p>
               <p>The Romans, peeple still encreasing, and having Warrs in divers places, created in tract of time a new Officer of greater authority whom they calld <hi>Dictator;</hi> from him ther was no appeale to be made, and he had in the highest way of authority power over the lifes of men: The <hi>General of the Sea</hi> among the <hi>Venetians</hi> hath som resemblance with this Officer, only with this difference, that he is chosen upon extraordinary ocasions, but as long as he is abroad he hath a Dictatorian power, for to what maritim place soever he arrives he hath the Keys of the Town brought him, with those of any Castle or Fortresse. But here it is to be observd, that this Officer cannot enter <hi>Venice</hi> with any armed Gallie, but as soon as he comes to <hi>Istria,</hi> which is distant 100. miles from <hi>Venice,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:49798:30"/>
he payes the Mariners and all other Officers their Salaries, and so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands them, and returns to <hi>Venice</hi> with a very few of his retinue: This corresponds with the custom of the Romanes, who usd to restrain their Generall to passe over the river <hi>Rubicon</hi> by this peremptory comand, <hi>Imperator, sive Miles, sive Tyrannus armatus quisquis, sistito, vexillum armá<expan>

               <p>Afterwards in <hi>Rome</hi> they added to the Dictator Officers calld <hi>Magistri Equitum,</hi> who shold be present at all Councells; and in case the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator shold be sick <hi>They</hi> were to execut his office, as being as it were his Compagnous, and Witnesses of his virtues: Just so, the <hi>Venetians</hi> use to choose two <hi>Proveditori</hi> in evry Army who have the next place to the Generall, and must be present at all Councells, and have a concurrence of their opinions before any enterprize.</p>
               <p>Besides these the <hi>Venetians</hi> make choice of three of the Patrician Order, whom they stile <hi>Auvogadori de Communi,</hi> who resemble <hi>Tribunos plebis</hi> in <hi>Rome;</hi> these three are rather Sollicitors then Judges for the peeple, they are their Intercessors upon all ocasions.</p>
               <p>Add herunto that the Romanes thought it fitting to choose Officers that should have care of the profitt, the ornament and provision of the Cittie, therfore did they constitut divers persons of probitie, and known integrity, and they went all under the name of <hi>Aediles;</hi> The first two they did choose, were to have speciall care of the Temples and Fanes, as as allso of other Fabriques and Ornaments of the Cittie, which Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were stiled <hi>Aediles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and rates of all kinds of Wines; Then <hi>gli Signori di panni d'oro,</hi> who take a speciall care that no fraud be us'd in the making and vending of any Gold, Silver, Tissue, or Silk stuffs; Then you have the <hi>Signori della Dogana di mare,</hi> which were instituted in the government of <hi>Tomaso Mocenigo,</hi> whose charge is to look to the freight of all sorts of Ships and Gallies, if they go laden with any Marchandize, and overlook that the Republick be not cosned in her imposts; Lastly, ther be a sort of <hi>Ediles</hi> calld <hi>delle Ragion vecchie,</hi> who have it comitted to their charge that in case any Ambassador com, or any forren Prince into the City, they are to see that he be entertaind, and defrayd by the publick expence of S. <hi>Marke.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> had also Officers calld <hi>Quaestores,</hi> who receav'd and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed the public treasure, and they were calld so <hi>ab inquirenda pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunia,</hi> from making search after moneys; so in <hi>Venice</hi> ther are such Officers calld <hi>Camerlinghi,</hi> who have the very same charge.

In <hi>Rome</hi> ther were Questors allso in times of peace; so likewise in all the Cities belonging to the Republick, ther are such Questors who have power to recover, spend and pay the Public deniers, whereof they use to send a particular account to the Senat with the Treasure that remaines unspent; In resemblance to these <hi>Roman</hi> Questors, ther are divers other Officers in the Republic of <hi>Venice,</hi> as <hi>gli Governatori dell' entrate</hi> they who receave the public Revenues of the Signorie, with all sorts of Gabells and Impositions.

superintendent power of all things; every one of these was used to sit upon the Tribunall ten dayes, and determine all matters, and they were used to succeed one another; In imitation hereof the <hi>Venetians</hi> have the same Magistrates who jump with those of <hi>Rome</hi> both in nomber and authority, which is vulgarly calld <hi>il Consiglio di Dieci,</hi> the Councell of ten; That in <hi>Rome</hi> dur'd for a yeer, and so doth this, both of them were without appeal unlesse it be in <hi>Venice</hi> to the Colledg, and then a busines is sayd to go <hi>à l'altra mano.</hi> In this <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> differ, that this kind of Magistrate in the one was of short continuance, and quickly perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but this in <hi>Venice</hi> hath for many hundr'd yeers continued to the great wellfare and safety of the City; when the <hi>Decemviri</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> were created all other Officers ceasd, it is otherwise here; those governd only for ten days, and of these three are chosen every moneth, which are calld <hi>glitre Capi;</hi> one of them alone hath no power to judge or refer, but he must have another to joyn with him, but in both Citties they were advancd to the <hi>Decemvirat</hi> who precelld others in experience and age, in probity and known sufficiency.</p>
               <p>There were allso a long time after the foundation of <hi>Rome</hi> Officers elected called <hi>Praetors,</hi> for the story relates the Citty stood 390 yeers before any was created; The Wars were the cause of the election of this Magistrate, because in the confusion of Armes the Consulls could not tend all businesses, therefore ther were other Judges created calld <hi>Praetors;</hi> Of these <hi>Praetors</hi> ther were among the Ancients three sorts, <hi>Urbani, Forenses,</hi> or <hi>Provinciales,</hi> The first determind controversies betwixt Cittizens and Tounsmen; The second sort decided Cases twixt Cittizens and Countreymen, and the third went to the Government of Provinces; so likewise in the Republic of <hi>Venice</hi> such <hi>Praetors</hi> are created, and in the same degree of Order; The <hi>Praetores Vrbani</hi> are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by those that are of the <hi>Corti de petitione,</hi> and other Offices, which determine all differences twixt Citizens; The <hi>Praetores Forenses</hi> are those that preside in the <hi>Ufficio</hi> calld <hi>del Forastiero,</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall <hi>Praetors</hi> are represented by those who go up and down the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Cities that are under the obedience of the Republic, &amp; they are calld <hi>Praetors</hi> or <hi>Podestá.</hi> The first Officers in this kind were <hi>del Petitione,</hi> and they were sufficient at first to dispatch all sorts of differences, but afterwards in proces of time, businesses augmenting with the Age and strength of the Signorie, ther were divers other Magistrates of the same kind created. The <hi>Iudici de Petitione</hi> determind all Sutes as far as 1000 Ducketts, or any above 50. They cause all bargaines to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; They tax the allowance of Pupills for their sustenance, and education, unlesse they be within the precincts of the Procurators of S. <hi>Mark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ther be other Officers stild <hi>Guidici all' officio del mobile,</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine all Controversies and Causes 50 Ducketts upwards that happen about moveables, and personall Estates. Ther are allso Judges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examiners; Ther be other Officers calld <hi>Cataveri,</hi> which is much of the same nature though inferior in degree to the <hi>Camerlinghi;</hi> Ther is another Officer calld <hi>Il pio vego,</hi> who takes Cognizance of all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49798:31"/>
Contracts tending to Usury, this Officer hath allso care of the public ways; Ther be other Officers calld <hi>Syndicks,</hi> which supervize all public expences; Ther be others calld <hi>Sopragastaldi,</hi> who put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution the sentences that are pass'd by other Judges, and sell the goods brought in by sentence of the Court; And because som error may arise in the sale of such goods, ther's another Office calld <hi>de Superiori,</hi> who are to censure the Acts of the <hi>Sopragastaldi;</hi> To these may be added the Consulls and <hi>Sopra Consoli,</hi> who are peculiar Officers touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Marchants affaires, and carry the busines so that a bankrupt cannot be utterly ruind. The last kind of <hi>Pretor</hi> is <hi>del Forestiero,</hi> who determines differences twixt <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Forener,</hi> or twixt <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> and <hi>Forener.</hi> All controversies touching Rents of Houses go before these Judges, as allso touching the hyre of Shipps and Barkes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> had also certaine Officers calld <hi>Centumviri,</hi> in Analogy to whom the Republic hath <hi>Consilio di Quarentie,</hi> or the Councell of 40. and hence it may be sayd that the division sprung it being of three Orders, <hi>viz.</hi> two upon civill Causes, and the third upon Criminall; Touching civill Causes the one is calld <hi>la vecchia,</hi> before whom all Causes com from the <hi>Auditori vecchi,</hi> whereof former mention hath bin made; the other is calld <hi>la nuova</hi> created by the <hi>Pisan</hi> Law, where all Causes that are introducd into the Court by the <hi>Auditori nuovi</hi> are deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; But in tract of time controversies multiplying together with the peeple, <hi>il Collegio de venti savii,</hi> the Colledg of 20 Sages were adjoynd to it, who take cognizance of differences as far as 300 Duckets; and lastly the Colledg of twelve was added, who shold terminat all Sutes as far as 100 Crownes: So the <hi>Centumviri</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> were divided to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These Counsells of 40 have three heads or Presidents of their order, who for two moneths have the precedency of the rest, and introduce the Causes which are to be handled; they cast lotts in three Boxes, whereof one is in favor, the other clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and the third nor one nor the other, which is call'd <hi>non Syncero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> had also foure men who had care of the Streets, and the same officers are in <hi>Venice,</hi> who are calld <hi>Proveditori di Comun,</hi> whose care and industry is to keep the Streets well repaird, with the Bridges, whereof ther is nere upon 1000 of all sorts, with other public places; but whereas ther were foure officers in <hi>Rome</hi> of this nature, ther are but three in <hi>Venice,</hi> yet they have many for their substituts. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ther were in <hi>Rome</hi> three officers who supervizd the Coines of Gold and Silver, ther are the same number in <hi>Venice,</hi> who are <hi>Proveditori alla Zeccha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all these com the Prefects or Captains that are appointed for the goverment of Citties abroad, who may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49798:32"/>
They have care of the Walls of the Cittie, with the Gates thereof, and upon any insurrection they have power to rayse and assemble the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the place to suppresse it; they sett the Gards, and look to all things that tend to conservation and outward security of the Cittie. Ther were allso in <hi>Rome</hi> Officers calld <hi>Praefecti victuum,</hi> that had care to see the place well provided with Victualls, and prevent famine by bringing in Corn and other necessaries from abroad; so in <hi>Venice</hi> ther are three chosen that have the like charge, which are called <hi>Prodvedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori alle biade,</hi> and upon extraordinary ocasions ther are other two added to them calld <hi>Sopra proveditori,</hi> but these kind of Officers may be rankd more properly among the <hi>Aediles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, the Romans had an Officer calld the <hi>Praefectus Vigiliarum,</hi> who had care to prevent all fyrings of Houses, and if any happend to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and extinguish it, before it shold spread further, as allso to take cognizance of burglaries, thefts and robberies don in the night time; So the Republic of <hi>Venice,</hi> who hath bin industrious to search into all Lawes, holding it no disparagment to imitat any that may tend to her better Wellfare, have ten Gentlemen elected, who are divided to two parts, but both calld <hi>Signori di notte;</hi> To the one five are brought all Civill causes, to the other all Criminal that have relation to the night; The office of these is to secure evry one in his own Precinct, and prevent that the obscurity of the night do not procure dommage to any body, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent murthers, and breaking into Houses.</p>

               <p>The main instruments that govern this <hi>Republic</hi> are the Gentry, for the <hi>Venetians</hi> do call those <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that have a share in the Government of this Common-wealth, <hi>viz.</hi> those that have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to elect the publick Magistrats, and have a capacity them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs to be elected. This prerogative is given unto them by their birth, so as whosoever are born of noble Parents (now these words Noble and Gentleman are synonimas amongst them) is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted noble, and may at a certain time and manner limited by the Lawes, enter into the great Councell, where the ordinary electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Magistrats is made; Into this rank are receavd either those, who having bin the chief Inhabitants of the Cittie, and being most famous for Vertue or Wealth, have from the beginning had the managing of public affaires; or allso those who for som notable exploits or worthy act don in the service of the <hi>Republic</hi> are at sundry times, and upon speciall occasions admitted thereunto, who for the most part have bin of the chief, and noblest Familys, or som other place subject to the Signorie, or some others to whom by speciall grace and favour this title of Nobility hath bin given; wherein neverthelesse they have carried themselfs very sparingly, it being granted but to Lords of great Estates, and in this maner were the Families of <hi>Este, Gonzaga,</hi> and <hi>Farneses</hi> with som other of the chiefest of <hi>Italy</hi> admitted therunto. <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> after the third of that Name of <hi>France,</hi> being at <hi>Venice</hi> among other honors receavd the title of a <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentleman, and he seemd to be highly pleasd with the dignity as appeerd by his presents: Moreover all those that descend from such as receave this degree, have the same preheminence as their Parents in such a tract of time; But to the end it may be continually maintaind in it's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, they do curiously search out the Predigrees of those who are to enter into the great Councell, not only the Nobility of the Father, but likewise whether they be born of lawfull Matrimony, and of no Comon Woman, but of some honorable degree and condition, whereof a Register is kept by one of the chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, termd the <hi>Avogario</hi> of the <hi>Republic.</hi>

Magistrats serve her gratis, and without salary for a time; She allso makes frequent use of Lotteries to serve her turn; And the Church useth to contribut very largely, yet they never exact any thing of the Ecclesiasticks without acquainting the Pope, which is only <hi>pro formâ:</hi> But the War ceasing, these extraordinary Levies cease allso with the cause, and all things return exactly to be <hi>in statu quo priùs,</hi> which hath often happend, and this makes the peeple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute more cheerfully, because she is alwayes very carefull to keep her Public Faith with her Subjects inviolable.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this particular Description of the so much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired Cittie of <hi>Venice</hi> with one observation more, <hi>viz.</hi> That ther are few places where ther are more curious and costly Books for the illiterat vulgar, for <hi>so</hi> the <hi>Romanists</hi> term Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Images and Sculptures, whereof ther are great nombers <hi>à la Mosaica,</hi> and made by the famous <hi>Titiano</hi> a <hi>Venetian</hi> born; one of the most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marquable is <hi>that</hi> of the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> at Saint <hi>Marks</hi> Church, where those who desire to know whether a friend absent be living or dead, use to set up a Wax Candle in the open Aire before the Picture, and if the party be living the Candle doth quietly burn out be the wind never so high; if he be dead, the least puff blowes it out according to their belief. Ther is also on Saint <hi>Marks</hi> Walls, among divers others, the Picture of two Cocks carring away a <hi>Wolfe,</hi> which represents <hi>Lodovico Sforza</hi> the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Cocks denote <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelf, and <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth Kings of <hi>France</hi> who outed him of his Duchy. Ther are allso two Emblematicall Lions, one meagre and leane lying on the <hi>Land;</hi> The other plump and fat sporting in the <hi>Water;</hi> the last refers to S. <hi>Marks</hi> Lion the Armes of <hi>Venice,</hi> who hath both enrichd, and defended her self, more by the Sea than by Land; for whereas som Citties of <hi>Italy</hi> are said to be walld with <hi>Fire</hi> (meaning Flint) <hi>Venice</hi> may more truly be sayd to be walld with <hi>Water;</hi> It is the <hi>Water,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in she lies like a Swannes nest, that doth both fence and feed <hi>Her;</hi> to which purpose she hath many thousands of <hi>Wooden</hi> Horses perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally bringing her provisions, and carrying her Inhabitants up and down within and about the <hi>Citty;</hi> But a horse of <hi>flesh</hi> were as strange a thing to be seen there as an <hi>Elephant</hi> upon <hi>London</hi> streets.

               <p>That there was no more hope to be had of the Venetian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, nor yet of their Liberty, which had bin pourchased and maintain'd by their Progenitors with such generosity, unlesse the fury of the Tribunes expired; that their self-same Ancestors had in times past for the sweetnesse of Liberty abandoned their most pleasant Countrey, their Houses, and all other matters which men commonly esteem most dear, and were com into barren Ilands, where there was nothing that might invite them to dwel; That if they could have dispens'd with their Liberty, they might with all safety have remain'd in the City where they were first born and brought up; and with this losse alone, might have liv'd peaceably among the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians; but being full of innated courage, they suppos'd that they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49798:37"/>
ought not to lose their Freedom, but with their lives; wherefore divers of those that were there present, following the example of their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, came only into those places to live at Liberty; To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose then was their designs? what profit had they by their dislodging? why had they so many Churches, Buildings, and so many public and private Houses? why did they forsake the <hi>firm land</hi> to eschew bondage, and yet meet it in the <hi>midst of the waters</hi> by the insolency of a few, whither it was likely, that the barbarous enemy who was so near them, wold take any rest, till he had found som means to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>uinat this new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micile of Liberty, seeing that Tyrants hate nothing so much as that Name, and undoubtedly 'twas his wish, to see the whole Venetian State destroy'd by civill discord, which he could not shake by any other means.</p>
               <p>Hereupon they suddenly resolv'd to elect a new <hi>Duke</hi> who shold represent the Honor and Majesty of the whole State, and have power to Assemble the General Councell, to choose Annual Tribunes in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Ilands, from whence the Appeals should come before him: and moreover, if any had obtain'd any dignity o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Upon these Deliberations PAULUTIO of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> a man of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, evperience and courage, was chosen Duke after the Cities foundation, about 276. He took an Oath, well and faithfully to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide whatsoever should be fit for the honor of the Common-wealth, and the Venetian Name; hereupon he was adorn'd with divers Noble Ensigns to make the Dignity the more illustrious: Being instal'd Duke, his first care was to free the Republic of the War that was than afoot with <hi>Luitprand,</hi> which he did; and he extended the limits of <hi>Heraclea,</hi> from the River of <hi>Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In sum, ther is no place in the whole Church either within or without, but is either deck'd with Marble, Gold, or precious Stones, so that the two Columnes of Alablaster which stand nere to the high Altar, and the Chalcedony Stones, which are to be seen in the midst of the pavement, with the Mosaicall works, we coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the least curiosities.</p>

The Italians who were in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd <hi>Venice,</hi> but those of <hi>Tyre</hi> held to <hi>Genoa;</hi> at <hi>Trapani</hi> the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian gave the Genoway another shrewd defeat, wherin were taken twenty foure Gallies, and many thousand prisoners carried away, and 1200 slain. Yet the Genoways made head again, and sailing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the coasts of <hi>Candy</hi> they took <hi>Cydon</hi> now call'd <hi>Canea,</hi> and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag'd it, but the Venetian met them a while after, and was soundly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd of them.</p>
               <p>This Warre with Genoa put the Republic to extraordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, whereupon a a new impost was levied upon white meats, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at there was a small insurrection, which was quickly suppress'd, and the Authors severely punished.</p>
               <p>LORENZO TEPULO upon the death of ZENO succeeded, the<note place="margin">1268</note> Pope with the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Sicilie</hi> did labour to reconcile matters 'twixt the Venetian and Genoway, in regard this quarrell betwixt them made things go to wreck among the Christians in <hi>Syria,</hi> but nothing could prevail. The Genoways scour'd the Seas, so that no corn could be brought to <hi>Venice,</hi> either from <hi>Apuleia,</hi> or <hi>Sicily,</hi> which pinch'd the City: a truce at last was made between the two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics, but a new war did happen 'twixt <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Bologna</hi> about Trade, which lasted three years; at last under the conduct of <hi>Maria Gradonico</hi> an army was sent, who utterly defeated the <hi>Bolonians,</hi> which made themseek for peace.</p>

               <p>GIOVANNI DANDULO came after CONTARENI, at which<note place="margin">1280</note> time the Sea did in such sort overflow the City, that it was held by som very prodigious, and their augury prov'd tru, for soon after ensued an Earthquake, and a warr with the Patriark of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> wherin the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public had no great successe; she had worse luck in <hi>Syria,</hi> for the King of <hi>Babilon</hi> besieg'd <hi>Acre,</hi> which the Venetian with the Popes souldiers defended a good while, but no aid coming unto them from the rest of the Princes of Christendom, the City was taken, and so the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian name grew to be almost wholly extinct in <hi>Syria,</hi> the yeere 1290.</p>
               <p>PIETRO GRADONICO succeeded DANDULO, and the<note place="margin">1290</note> Truce being expired with the Genoways, ther was a fiercer war renew'd then ever. In running over this history of the Venetians, divers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters offer themselfs so conformable to those of the ancient Romans that possibly may be, as well in point of counsell, travail, successe, accidents of fortune, and sundry other traverses; but among all, the Venetian war with <hi>Genoa</hi> seems to have great resemblance with those which the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans had in times pass'd with <hi>Carthage;</hi> for the neer neighbourhood, as it most often happens, did not beget this Emulation betwixt them, or caus'd the war, because they are as far distant one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as are the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> and <hi>Libian</hi> Seas 'twixt <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Africk;</hi> to cleer which point, it will not be amisse to give a little short description of the situation of both their Countreys.</p>
               <p>Italy <hi>is a promontory stretching from the</hi> Alpes, <hi>whose height on the one side extending towards the</hi> South, <hi>serves her for a Rampart; she is besides water'd towards the West with the</hi> Ligustik <hi>and</hi> Tyrrhene <hi>Seas, and on the</hi> East <hi>with the</hi> Adratic <hi>and</hi> Ionian, <hi>from thence the waves begin to mingle themselfs together, and to make her the more strong, they wold fain shut up the Alpes the more closely; in the</hi> Adrian <hi>Gulph stands</hi> Venice; <hi>on the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Ther happen'd at this time a notable navall fight 'twixt <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa</hi> nere <hi>Corfu,</hi> where the Venetians lost almost their whole Fleet, and <hi>Andrew Dandolo</hi> their Admirall was taken prisoner with five thousand more, and carried to <hi>Genoa;</hi> this victory was got by a reserve of fifteen Gallies the <hi>Genoways</hi> had, which at the fagg end of the fight came fresh out, as those reserve of five hundred men which <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi> kept fresh under hatches for the last push. This defeat lay heavy upon <hi>Venice,</hi> for she lost then above sixty Gallies, yet she appear'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain shortly after, and about the streight of <hi>Gallipoli</hi> she lost again six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Gallies, and the <hi>Genoway</hi> a little after took <hi>Canea</hi> in <hi>Candy;</hi> but a peace was at last mediated 'twizt <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon these ill successes abroad, ther were some treasons detected in <hi>Venice,</hi> but quickly suppress'd; <hi>Padoa</hi> also stir'd, but to little purpose. The next yeer, notwithstanding all the late losses, the Republic sends a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Fleet against <hi>Paleologus</hi> the Greek Emperour, whereof <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niano</hi> was Generall, because he refus'd to pay the Republic a great sum of money which he ow'd her, this Fleet sailing into the <hi>Pontik</hi> Sea, quickly brought <hi>Paleologus</hi> to reason &amp; to repay the mony. This victroy did much heighten the spirits of <hi>Venice,</hi> which had somwhat languish'd for her great losses in the <hi>Ligustic</hi> war with <hi>Genoa;</hi> she also made her self Mistress of <hi>Ferrara</hi> a little after, which being a City fewdetary to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope excomunicated <hi>Venice,</hi> interdicting her from the use of the Sacraments, which drew a great deal of odium upon her, so that she thought it high time to restore <hi>Ferrara</hi> to the Popes Legat, yet she wold pause a little further upon't. About this time, the famous conspiracy of <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:49798:45"/>GIOVANNI SOVRANZA succeeded GEORGIO, who had go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd<note place="margin">1304</note> but ten moneths; the City which had bin a good while anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiz'd, sent <hi>Francisco Dandulo</hi> to the Pope; this Nobleman being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the presence of <hi>Clement,</hi> who perfectly hated <hi>Venice</hi> because of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> by a wonderfull example of piety to his Countrey, and love to Religion, continued a long time on the ground before the Popes Table; with an iron chain about his head like a dog, untill the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was taken off, which was don upon those acts of penitence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hereupon a little after <hi>Venice</hi> had a notable successe against <hi>Genoa</hi> in the <hi>Pontik</hi> Sea, where above thirty bottomes were sunk and taken by JUSTINIANO the Generall.</p>
               <p>FRANCISCO DANDULO who had bin Ambassador with the Pope,<note place="margin">1329</note> and by that penance formerly spoken of had got the Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken off, was elected the next Duke, the Polani and the Valesians who had bin a long time subject to the Patriark of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> did volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily yeeld themselfs under the protection of <hi>Venice;</hi> About this time the Republic did divers exploits upon the Coasts of <hi>Syria</hi> against the Turks, for securing of Navigation upon those Coasts; she likewise did many feats in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> her Army took <hi>Padoua</hi> and <hi>Bergamo, Brescia</hi> also fell under her protection.</p>
               <p>BARTILMEO GRADONICO was chosen next, and a little after ther<note place="margin">1332</note> arose one night a most furious Tempest, which caus'd such an inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on three foot deep above the streets of the City: In this Dukes time ther came Ambassadors from <hi>England,</hi> craving aid against <hi>Philip</hi> the French King, whom the <hi>Genoways,</hi> who were mortall enemies to <hi>Venice,</hi> did favour, but nothing could be obtain'd, and this was the first time that ther was any acquaintance 'twixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> which was in the yeer 1332<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ther was another revolt in <hi>Candie</hi> suppress'd.</p>
               <p>ANDREA DANDULO came next to the principality, a man of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary parts of learning as well as valour, for he compil'd the<note place="margin">1336</note> Venetian story in two styles. The Republic sent a Fleet against the Turk, which took <hi>Smyrna</hi> again. There was an Ambassadour sent by the Senat to the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> concerning the Venetians free Trade into <hi>Egypt,</hi> which though stood upon by the Pope, in regard they were Infidells, was setled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zara</hi> had rebell'd now the seventh time, but was reduced, and <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Hungarie</hi> repuls'd.

               <p>This was the substance of the Venetians Answer, whereat the Pope was so incens'd, that he excomunicated the Doge; and the Senat, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving leagu'd himself with <hi>Frederick,</hi> and <hi>Alfonso</hi> Duke of <hi>Calabria,</hi> who came with two thousand men for succour of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> among whom were four hundred Turks, which he brought from <hi>Otrauto;</hi> but they a while after ran away to the Venetians, which though it was some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet they had an ill-favour'd disaster in the City at that time, for the Dukes Palace was half burnt down.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:49798:50"/>The Republic having many potent enemies banded against Her, by the instigation of the Pope, employ'd Ambassadors to the French Army, and Germane Princes, with others, to have a Generall Councell call'd, wherin it might be lawfull to complain of the Pope or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Herupon a while after Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> apprehending some fears, a Treaty was set on foot for a peace, which was quickly concluded; The Venetians a little before, had taken <hi>Gallipoli</hi> in <hi>Calabria;</hi> and though they lost neither honour or territory during this warr, yet in lesse than two years it cost the Republic nere upon three millions.</p>
               <p>MARCO BARBADICO succeeded next, in whose time a trade was<note place="margin">1485</note> begun with <hi>Portugall,</hi> to which purpose the Republic sent an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador expresly to <hi>Lisbon, Anno Dom.</hi> 1485.</p>
               <p>When this Duke was upon his death-bed, there came a great Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador from <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Turkish Emperor with rich presents unto him, but he enjoy'd them little; He was buried with greater solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie than ordinary, and the ceremonies which were us'd then continue constant to this day at the interment of Venetian Doges, which is thus. After the Duke is dead, he is unbowell'd, his body embalm'd, and laid under a Canopie of gold, with his gilt sword and spurres revers'd; he is publiquely kept in the palace for three whole dayes, then all the Companies in the City, which are as many as ther be Trades, do with their banners in solemn order go before the body, after them followeth the Clergy, next to them the mourners, who are in great multitudes in sad funestous manner: last of all come the Senat cloth'd in scarlet and purple, to demonstrat that the City which is free, doth never in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing habit follow the Exequies of any Prince, how vertuous soever: In this manner and habit so soon as the body is brought into the Church they sit round about it, whilst the memory of the deceased Prince is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the peeple in a funerall Oration: from thence the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors returning to the Palace, do publish the first Assembly for the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a new Duke.</p>

The Queen wonder'd at her brothers Proposition, saying, that she wold not for a world part with so sweet a Kingdom, and that the <hi>Senat</hi> might be satisfied to have it after her death: her brother replied with this charming subtill Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Intreating her not to make more account of</hi> Cyprus, <hi>than of her own dear Countrey, because that worldly affairs being variable and inconstant, it might in short space com to passe that she might be expuls'd, it being so thought on already by divers potent Lords, and her self envied by many of her Subjects,</hi>

But now when all her Neighbours wait for an occasion, and lay snares to surprize Her, the</hi> Senat <hi>hath thought this onely remedy most expedient; but if she fear'd not these dangers, he be sought her to consider, what she was likely to have fallen into the yeer before, for had not the Republic rescued her with their Gallies, she had bin in danger to have bin carried Captive to</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople; <hi>It is good to foresee that which som odd accident or small errour may hurl us into, and to prevent it, fortune is blind and volable, nor can we ever prevent our enemies designs, nor can our friends be alwaies ready to help us when we want them; there is a great distance by Land, and a great Sea 'twixt the</hi> Adriatic <hi>Gulph and</hi> Cyprus; <hi>This,</hi> Madam <hi>you ought to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and timely consider, that though nothing enforc'd you thereunto, yet what greater honor, or more lasting glory can you leave behind you, then to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>A little after this, the King of <hi>Tremisen</hi> in <hi>Affrique</hi> sent to <hi>Venice</hi> his Ambassador, to entrust som Venetian gentlemen to see Justice done to the Venetian Subjects, who liv'd in three of his Cities, therupon <hi>Lodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vico Piramane</hi> was sent, who had the hundredth peny upon all Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize for his salary.</p>
               <p>Not long after the Patriarch of <hi>Aquileia</hi> died at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Hermolao Barbaro</hi> being there Ambassador for the Republic, the Pope confer'd that high Ecclesiastic Dignity upon him, and made him Cardinall.</p>
               <p>This being known at <hi>Venice,</hi> notwithstanding that <hi>Hermolao</hi> was a Minister of great desert, and had acquainted the Senat hereof; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was an expresse Law, forbidding all Venetian gentlemen, being Ambassadors at <hi>Rome,</hi> to receave any obliging Dignity of the Pope, during the time of his Legation, the Senat took the audacious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49798:51"/>
of this Law in ill part; and though he were rich, well allied, and had great friends, they sent expresse command, that he shold resign the Patriarkship again to the Pope, if not, they wold take from his Father the Procuratorship of S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and confiscat all his estate; the Father died before the years end, of meer resentment, and the Son ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving compos'd many excellent books, died a little after of a Squi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Venice</hi> was now very quiet, when <hi>Charles</hi> the VIII. of <hi>France</hi> sent three Ambassadors one after the other to the Duke, that their King being resolv'd to com to <hi>Italy,</hi> to conquer the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> which by hereditary right belong'd to him, he desir'd to know the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians inclination towards him, and whither they wold continue the former League and Amity; The Senat answer d the Ambassador, that the Signory did ever prefer peace before war, and did now desire it more then ever, therefore they could wish, that their King being now in a perfect peace, wold suffer the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to be so too. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the French King being daily push'd on by <hi>LowtkSforZa</hi> the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Salerno</hi> then an Exile in <hi>France,</hi> send <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Comines</hi> again to <hi>Venice,</hi> who propos'd to the Senat, that if they wold joyn with them in the recovery of <hi>Naples,</hi> they shold have a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble share of the Kingdome, if not, that they shold persever in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer friendship.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Senat</hi> answer'd, That the King was so potent and well provided with all warlike necessaries, that he needed no help from them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they determin'd according to the laudable custome of their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, not to stir, who never made war but upon constraint: Moreover, they desir'd not to have any share in that Kingdome whereunto they had no claim; for the rest, they sayed, they wold still make high esteem of his friendship.</p>
               <p>The Republic had at this time a great Fleet upon the Coasts of <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia,</hi> because they understood <hi>Bajazet</hi> the great Turk began to arm; at which time there came a solemn Embassie from <hi>Florence</hi> to crave their advice how they shold behave themselfs 'twixt the Kings of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> the latter of which had sent to desire passage through their Countrey. The <hi>Senat</hi> answer'd:</p>
               <p>That in so difficult a businesse, subject to such a world of accidents, they knew not so suddenly what was best to be done, and though they loved the one better then the other, they durst not deliver their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because that fortune is commonly Mistresse in warre, and that it u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually falls out, that matters done by chance and adventure, do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prosper better then those which are premeditated, and beaten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the anvill of long premeditation; therefore they ought to ask coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of none but Almighty God, who only knew what was best for men to embrace or avoid.</p>
               <p>The French King rushing into <hi>Italy,</hi> found no resistance scarce, till he had crown'd himself King of <hi>Naples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Venetians were at this time put mightily to their plunges and reaches of policy, because it was not wholesom for them or <hi>Italy,</hi> that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49798:51"/>
the French shold grow so powerfull, therefore the King of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, the Spaniards, and the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> who had fallen from the French, sending their Ambassadors unto them, they strike a League to represse the French proceedings. The Venetian takes <hi>Manapoli, Pulig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano,</hi> and <hi>Mola,</hi> and partly by arms, partly policy, the French are dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of <hi>Italy;</hi> yet <hi>Charles</hi> the VIII. being dead, they make a new League with King <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France</hi> against the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> upon these conditions, that <hi>Lodowick SforZa</hi> being elected King, shold have <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Republic <hi>Cremona</hi> and <hi>Abdua,</hi> and it came so to passe.</p>
               <p>The Republic had but sorry successes against the Turk in this Dukes time, for at <hi>Cephaloma</hi> they receav'd a terrible blow, yet she reduc'd at last that Iland to a perfect subjection.</p>
               <p>LEONARDO LOREDANO succeeded <hi>Barbarico;</hi> in his time<note place="margin">1491</note> the French and Portugall assist the Signory against the Turk, so that a peace ensued; The Republic receav'd a mighty wound in her Comerce about this time, in regard that the Portugalls had found a passage to the <hi>East Indies,</hi> by the cape of good hope, and so brought home in their Carraks those spices which <hi>Venice</hi> was us'd to fetch from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and dispence up and down <hi>Europe.</hi> 1503.</p>
               <p>But Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the II. gave her a worse blow, by drawing a most heavy war upon the Republic, in regard she wold not part with <hi>FaenZa</hi> and <hi>Rimini,</hi> for which She offer'd to pay him any rent in quality of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, alledging that it was dangerous for the Signory in regard of their Situation, that they shold be in any other hands: Hereupon, that notable League at <hi>Cambray</hi> was privatly struck against <hi>Venice,</hi> wherin ther were Confederates, the Pope himself, the Emperour, the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> with divers others: It was given out, that they met there to accommode the businesse of the Duke of <hi>Gueldres,</hi> but that was only a pretext, which the Republic could not smell out.</p>
               <p>The Republic by this huge powerfull League, had lost almost all the Towns she had in the firm Land of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> as far as <hi>Padoua;</hi> The great Turk offer'd the Republic aid in this exigent, but she modestly refus'd any: Besides other places, she receav'd a most fearfull overthrow hard by <hi>Abdua;</hi> being thus oppress'd with the spirituall Armes of <hi>Rome,</hi> and most of the temporall Armes of <hi>Europe,</hi> rather then break, she comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Emperour, and bow'd to the Pope, by delivering him those places aforesayed in <hi>Flaminia:</hi> Among others, the Cardinall of <hi>York</hi> in <hi>England</hi> did do her good Offices to the Pope, as her Annales make mention: The French having taken <hi>Milan,</hi> and other places, grew insolent in <hi>Italy;</hi> therefore there was a new confederacy made 'twixt the Pope, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Venetians; at <hi>Ravenna</hi> the French be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Victors in a great battail, but a little after the Swisse coming in as Confederates against them, they were totally routed and driven over the Hills again. The Venetians recover'd <hi>Crema,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> having taken <hi>Bressia,</hi> and delaying to render it to <hi>Venice,</hi> there was a new occasion offer'd for the Republic to make a League with <hi>France</hi> again against the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> the first by their help regain'd <hi>Milan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:49798:52"/>The Republic was never so driven to her shifts as she was in the time of this Duke, in divers traverses of warr, and confederacies against her, which she dissolv'd by pure policy, more then any power.</p>
               <p>She was afterwards much persecuted by Pope and Emperour, in so much that <hi>Maximilian</hi> sent to <hi>Selim</hi> the new great Turk an Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, to invite him to a warr against the Venetians, and to invade their Sea Coasts, while he assaulted them by Land.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Leo</hi> sent <hi>Petro Bembo</hi> upon a solemn Embassie to the Republic, that they shold break with the French, and League with the Emperour and Spaniards against them; whereunto the <hi>Senat</hi> made this grave an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:</p>
               <q>That his Holinesse Ambassador was greatly pleasing to the <hi>Senat,</hi> as well in respect of himself, whose vertue and particular affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Countrey was sufficiently known to all men, as likewise in regard of the <hi>Prince</hi> who sent him, seeing the Republic had ever born all reverence and honour to the Soveraign Bishops of <hi>Rome;</hi> but they more particularly inclin'd to Pope <hi>Leo;</hi> that the Senat had ever most highly esteem'd his good and wholesom Counsell, but the mischiefe was, that by how much they above all others had desir'd his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and alliance in that incertainty of all things, by so much more were they continually kept from it; and albeit, their love was never disjoyn'd from him, yet their forces were ever divided; as then they did humbly thank his Holinesse, and confess'd themselfs much bound unto him, in that he had bin ever ready by divers good offices to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and favour their cause, even so likewise they were extremely griev'd, that they could not follow his Counsell, it being their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent custom not to leave an old friend for a new, specially being not provok'd thereunto by any wrong, their ancient Fathers thinking that alone to be profitable, which was most honest; therefore they could not without great blemish of their reputation break or abandon the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance which they had already contracted with the French; And if the Pope wold call to mind the ancient benefits of the French Kings, not only to the Venetian Common-wealth, but likewise to the Church, and consider the wealth and power of that Kingdome, he wold not only excuse but commend the Venetian Councel, and be desirous him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to follow it because that being back'd by the French Forces, with those of the Venetian, ther was likelihood, that he shold be abler to lay surer foundations, as well for the state of the Church, as for the greatnesse and advancement of his own house.</q>
               <p>Hereupon the Republic sent Ambassadors, both to <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to congratulat their alliance (for old <hi>Lewis</hi> had married young <hi>Henries</hi> Sister) and to streighten this League betwixt them against the Emperour.</p>
               <p>The Republic likewise employed two Ambassadors to confirm the peace with the great Turk <hi>Selim,</hi> who had newly subdued the <hi>Mamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lukes</hi> and <hi>Soldan,</hi> that had bin Lords of the <hi>Gran Cayro</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> above three hundred years, <hi>Anno</hi> 1516.</p>

nor have kept them from him, and that those Cities had bin ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at such time as the Pope had quitted the League, and that they might justly now detain them for the same occasion; moreover they had spent a great masse of Tresure in that warr which those Cities were not able to recompence; they desired that the King wold take it into serious consideration how much it might import him, if those so commodious Cities shold be quitted by his friends and confederats to be given to the Pope, who stood so coldly affected to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> nay even into the hands of the Imperialls, seeing that it was apparent how the Pope either by his own proper motion, or through fear did wholly depend upon the Emperour, that he was besides to consider of their interest, and the wrong which wold be offer'd their confederats, <hi>viZ.</hi> the Florentines and the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> whoque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse wold be greatly distasted hereat, and wold cool that heat which pusheth them on to the affairs of the League: and moreover how that these Towns did serve for a bridle to contain the Pope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his bounds, seeing that without them he wold already have shewed himself an open friend to the Emperor.

               <p>In this Dukes time the Republic sent to the Pope that she might have the nomination of her own Bishops, for which he had made divers proposalls formerly, but could get no definitive answer; herupon ther was a seizure made of the temporalities of divers Bishopricks which the Pope had collated, wherat his Holiness was much incens'd. The Senat considering the importance and difficulty of the business, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberat theron in open Councell, where opinions were very different, but for the present it was decreed, that in favour of the Pope the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities of those who had bin promoted by his Holiness shold be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred them in the Cities under their jurisdiction; yet nevertheless they did not give over their demands, saying that what they had then done was for the extraordinary respect and reverence they bare to

Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> hoping that herafter they wold grant them more than they crav'd: The Pope nevertheless, who at first made shew that he demanded nothing els but that, stood after upon greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>

               <p>To bear up against <hi>Solyman,</hi> the Senat thought fit to levy the Tenths upon the Clergy, but they could not obtain it of the Pope, who made answer, that he had a purpose to levy two Tenths upon the goods of all the Italian Clergy, to employ them for the relief of the Cantons of the Catholic Swissi, against the other apostat Cantons, who threatned them with war.</p>
               <p>A little after <hi>Venice</hi> made her self Mistresse of a Town in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> call'd <hi>Obrovatza,</hi> a place of considerable strength and advantage.</p>
               <p>PIETRO LANDI succeeded <hi>Gritti,</hi> who had continued Prince<note place="margin">1539</note> nere upon sixteen years, <hi>Guy Vbaldo</hi> Duke of <hi>Vrbin,</hi> the old Duke being dead, was chosen Generall of the Republic by Land; he was allow'd ten Captains pay, and four thousand Ducats yearly Salary besides: The Senat at that time decreed that four hundred Artificers of the City shold be inroll'd, with whom four times a year, the Gallies appointed for that purpose shold be mann'd, that they might all of them row together, which they commonly call'd <hi>Regater,</hi> and pensions were appointed them who had serv'd so thrice: This decree pass'd, to the end they might be assur'd to have men alwaies fit and ready to mann any nomber of Gallies. Ther happen'd a mighty dearth of corn through all <hi>Italy</hi> in this Dukes time, which lighted more heavy upon <hi>Venice</hi> then any place (among other causes) which necessitated her to make peace with the Turk, but the Marquis of <hi>Guasto</hi> Governor of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Annebalt</hi> Marshall of <hi>France,</hi> and her Generall in <hi>Piemont,</hi> came to <hi>Venice</hi> to divert her; they had extraordinary magnificent entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both for the quality of their own persons, and of the great Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that sent them.</p>
               <p>The Marquis of <hi>Guasto</hi> coming to the Senat, told them that he was sent by his Imperiall Majesty to acquaint them, as his trusty and inward friends, with the enterview that he intended to have with the French King, and in <hi>Flanders</hi> with King <hi>Ferdinand</hi> his Brother, and the Queen his Sister, who govern'd ther for him, assuring them, that in the same Assembly of Princes affairs wold be handled concerning the universall good of <hi>Christendom,</hi> and the particulrr advantage of that Republic, which the Emperour did as much desire as well as of his own Estates; and that now they were ready to assail the Turks with very great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; The Emperor therefore was desirous to know the Senats will and intentions therein, what provision they wold judge to be necessary, and what they wold have him to do for his part towards the better ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of this great design.</p>
               <p>Marshall <hi>Annebalt</hi> spake to the same effect, protesting his Kings good

will to the common peace of Christendome, amd particularly of the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer was made by the</hi> Senat <hi>to the Marquis and the Marshall, that their arrival was very pleasing and acceptable, as well in respect of the Princes whom they represented, as for their own persons, for which, and for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and friendship which they did professe to the</hi> Republic, <hi>they did infinitely thank their Princes; The news of the good correspondence and certain hopes of peace 'twixt two such mighty Kings had much rejoyc'd them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so much the more, by how much greater the profit was which all Christendome shold receave thereby: But as for the Declaration of their meaning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments towards the present occasions, it might be sufficiently known by their actions, how for their parts they had for three years born the brunt and burthen of the warr against the common enemy, and being invited by those hopes, they were ready again to embark and expose themselfs: yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse all might well perceave, that they were not able alone to hold out long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the power of so potent a Foe, therefore what could they say more? their necessity being known to all men, how ev'ry one knew that</hi> Barbarossa <hi>was in the Gulph of</hi> Lepanto, <hi>with a Fleet of eighty Gallies, and intended to winter there, whereby the whole world might perceave, to what danger the State of the Common-wealth was expos'd, and by consequence all Christendom, unlesse the Navall Armies might be ready by the month of</hi> February <hi>to divert his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, all which things were exactly to be thought upon, and speedily remedied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was an Answer without a resolution nor could those two great Ambassadors get any other at all, for the sagacious Senat smelt out whereunto these practises tended, and what the Emperors true designs were, namely to feed the French with vain hopes of a restitution of the Duchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> and the Venetians by propounding unto them to make preparation against the Turk, though he cared not to perform ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but only thereby to win time, by being assur'd of the quiet of the French Arms, and diverting that King from warr.</p>
               <p>But the Republic was constrain'd a little after to conclude a peace with the Turk by surrendry of <hi>Naples</hi> in <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> and <hi>Malvesia</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Napoli</hi> and <hi>Malvesia</hi> were exceedingly afflicted that the Republic wold give them up to the Turk, therefore Generall <hi>Mocenigo</hi> made unto them this consolatory tender Oration.</p>

               <p>Not long after the French King finding that he could get nothing but promises instead of performances, for the surrendry of <hi>Milan</hi> from the Emperor <hi>Charles;</hi> he employ'd one <hi>Rincon</hi> Ambassador to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyman</hi> for aid against <hi>Francis</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> this <hi>Rincon</hi> was near <hi>Pavia</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> slain by the Emperours Forces, as he was on his way to <hi>Turky;</hi> therupon <hi>Polin</hi> was sent, whom the Republic did furnish with a Gallie to carry him to <hi>Constantinople:</hi> He negotiated so well that <hi>Solyman</hi> sent a Fleet of sixscore Gallies which took <hi>Reggio</hi> in <hi>Calabria,</hi> with the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Nice,</hi> and so arrives at <hi>Marseilles.</hi> The Republic was eagerly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portun'd both by the Emperor and French King to enter into a League with them, but nothing could put off from their Neutrality.</p>

               <p>Herupon <hi>Selym</hi> himself resolv'd upon it, and arm'd accordingly; wherupon the Venetian <hi>Bailio</hi> which was resident at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> not daring to send advertisement by Land for fear his Letters shold be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, made his addresse to <hi>Bassa Mahomet,</hi> who was ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse to this design, hoping therby to obtain his desire: He told the <hi>Bassa</hi> how ill beseeming it wold be for the Majesty and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity of so great a Prince to invade those on a sudden and unexpected, who upon his word and oath thought themselves firm and safe; as though when time and occasion wold be offer'd he could want Forces to employ against them for the recovery of that which might justly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him, against whom he ought first to proceed by way of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and next by force, using first gentle means before he did take arms. Herupon by the advice of <hi>Mahomet Bassa</hi> the gran Visier <hi>Selym</hi> sent a <hi>Chiaus</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> who being admitied to a privat audience, was brought to the Senat, and according to the usuall custome, being plac'd on the Dukes right hand, he kiss'd his gown, and after divers reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, he presented a purse of gold tissue, wherin were the Emperors Letters, saying, Most excellent Sir, this is a Letter from my Lord, when you are acquainted with his demand I expect an answer; The Duke answer'd it should be so. The <hi>Cwiaus</hi> being at a stand because he had no other answer, addressed himself to the Senators, saying,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>My Lords, <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Visier <hi>Bassa</hi> hath commanded me to tell you that he is very sorry, that an occasion is offer'd that he must break with you, having ever sought to continue your friend, but complaints coming so often to the Port, and from so many places, of the unfriendly dealing of the Officers belonging to this State, and specially of the kind entertainment and reception given to the Western pyrats at <hi>Cyprus,</hi> who this very year have done great hurt to the Musulmans hath taken such impressions in the mind of the great Lord, and so often provok'd him against this Common-wealth, finding that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49798:56"/>
complaints made hereof to your <hi>Baylio</hi> hath taken little effect, that he could detain himself no longer from denouncing war against you; and because you cannot hold out long against the arms of so potent a Prince, he adviseth you as a friend to take som course to shield you from so many dangers; and to this end he hath procur'd my coming hither, offering to do all he may, that ye may avoid this mighty stroke offortune, and continue your ancient friendship with the great Lord.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince replied,<q> that the Senat had resolv'd on an Answer which shold be read unto him, that he might the better understand and know their intentions, which was don by <hi>Antonio Milladonna</hi> Secretary to the Councell, which was thus, That the Senat did extremely marvail, that his Lord being no way by them provok'd, nor upon any just cause, wold violat that oath wherby he had so solemnly confirm'd the peace, taking now for a pretence to make war upon them, because they wold not give away a Kingdome which they had so many years lawfully and peaceably enjoy'd, wherewith he might be well assur'd they wold never part; but seeing that he was determind to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them in that manner, the Republic wold not fail to defend that which did belong unto her, hoping by so much more to be the better able to do it, by how much the justice of their cause wold procure them all aid and succour, both divine and human, and so the <hi>Chiaus</hi> was dismiss'd with an Answer to his Letter, which was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That the Venetians had inviolably maintain'd the peace concluded with his Imperiall Majesty, and contemn'd all other respects whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by refusing many fair oportunities, whereof they might have made good use to their extraordinary advantage, because that above all worldly things, it befits a Prince to keep his promise; and they being carefull to avoid all suspition of so great an infamy, had dissembled and buried in silence divers wrongs done unto them, because they wold not be the first disturbers of the peace; but now perceaving that upon no occasion he denounc'd war against them at such a time as they least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it, they wold not refuse it, for the defence of their own, and in particular for defence of the Iland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which as their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors had enjoy'd by so just a title, they did likewise hope that God wold give them grace to maintain it valiantly against all those that wold injustly take it away from them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chiaus</hi> being return'd to <hi>Constantinople, Selym</hi> took it in high indignation, that the usuall Ceremonies us'd to Ambassadors were not perform'd to his <hi>Chiaus Cubat,</hi> who coming before him, and relating what preparations the Republic made, he seem'd to repent himselfe of his determination, and fell into a great heat of passion; therupon there were gards put upon the <hi>Bailios</hi> Palace, as also upon all the Venetian Consulls in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LODOVICO MOCENIGO was elected the next Duke, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning<note place="margin">1570</note> of whose government the Turk sent mighty forces both by Land and Sea for the conquest of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> the Ile of <hi>Rhodes</hi> was the first ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devous
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49798:57"/>
of the whole Fleet, which came to more then two hundred ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Vessells, accounting one hundred fifty Gallies, together with Fusts and Galeots, among which ther were certain Mahonnes, which are like to great Gallies, not altogether so big as a Galeon, six Ships, and a great nomber of Vessells commonly call'd <hi>Caramussolini,</hi> and som fifty <hi>Palandaries</hi> to transport horse.</p>
               <p>This Fleet bended it's direct course towards <hi>Cyprus,</hi> was descryed nere <hi>Batto</hi> the first of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1570. they dispatch eighty Gallies, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers flat battom'd Vessells to <hi>Tripoli,</hi> and to the river of <hi>Caramania,</hi> ther to raise more horse and foot forces, all which arriving in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> made up the nomber of fifty thousand foot, two thousand five hundred horse, three thousand Pioners, and thirty peeces of Ordnances, with one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Falconets.</p>
               <p>The ordinary Garrison of the Iland was but two thousand Italian foot, and som thousand recreuts sent from the firm Land with <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nengo,</hi> two thousand fresh soldiers, many whereof perish'd by incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious transportation, so that the greatest hopes of being able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Towns and Castles, consisted in the fresh supplies, which the Iland her self, being populous, had promis'd to levy, and for Cavalrie, ther were but five hundred Stradiots which were upon the pay of the Republic.</p>
               <p>Things being thus, and sufficient forces wanting to repell so huge an enemy, the Cavalry was too weak to hinder his landing, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantery too few, therfore resolution was taken to defend the two main Cities, <hi>Famagosta</hi> and <hi>Nicotia.</hi> The two chief Commanders of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Army was <hi>Mustapha</hi> and <hi>Piali,</hi> wherof the first was of a fierce fiery spirit; these two differ'd in opinion which to besiege, first <hi>Piali</hi> was for <hi>Famagosta,</hi> but <hi>Mustapha</hi> was for <hi>Nicotia,</hi> saying, that the reputation of so great an Army as theirs, ought not to be blemish'd by attempting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mean enterprize, therby to encrease the enemies courage, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish their own; that the Genoways had for ninety years held <hi>Famagosta</hi> at the same time as the Kings of the Family of <hi>Lusignan</hi> commanded the Iland, wherby might be gather'd, that the taking of that City wold be of no great importance for the taking of the whole Iland; that the Nobility, and the better part of the peeple were retir'd to <hi>Nicotia,</hi> where all the wealth and strength of the Kingdome was; so as that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exploit being perform'd, wold quickly put a period to all the rest, and their first atchievment give an end to all their designs: so they inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted <hi>Nicotia,</hi> a City seated in the midst of a Campane in a wholsome temperat air; she hath excellent water, and the soil is very fruitfull: In former times 'twas nine miles in compasse, but the Venetian the better to fortifie it, reduc'd it to three; She is proportion'd like a Star, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven points; in ev'ry one of which there is a bulwark made only of earth, which were not perfectly finish'd when the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd, but the rules of fortification were so exactly observ'd, as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Engines accounted it the most absolute peece in the world: There were in the City ten thousand foot, among whom were fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Italians, and the rest were Cypriots; some contestation happen'd
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49798:57"/>
in <hi>Nicotia</hi> among the chief Commanders, but in <hi>Mustapha's</hi> Army there was a wonderfull unanimity and obedience, who among other choice men had six thousand Janizaries, and four hundred Spahies pick'd out of purpose for that expedition. <hi>Mustapha</hi> gives a fierce assault to four Bulwarks at once, and they of the City making a sally upon the enemy under <hi>Andrea Cortese</hi> a Stradiot Captain, he was taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, and as soon as he was brought before <hi>Mustapha</hi> his head was chopt off.</p>
               <p>The Turks pursue their batteries with such a resolution, that they made themselves masters of all the Bulwarks, and so quickly rush'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town, wher the Governor and Bishop, with the better sort, had retir'd into the Palace; and having received <hi>Mustapha's</hi> word for the safety of their lifes, so soon as they had open'd the gates, the rabble fell in upon them, and put them all to the edge of the sword; which being done, they ran confusedly, and without Ensignes up and down the City, seeking, spoiling and ruining all things, (except Churches) dishonoring wifes, ravishing Virgins, and massacring all as they went without distinction of sex or age, so that there was slain that day above twenty thousand Christian souls they who were reserv'd were chain'd together, and haled over the bodies of their dead friends (reaking with hot bloud) to prison. Thus was the famous City of <hi>Nicotia</hi> after four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen daies siege taken and sack'd, a place that had flourished in great pomp and pleasure for many ages.</p>
               <p>The Turks did afterwards with much ease become Lords of <hi>Cyprus, Famagosta</hi> excepted, whither <hi>Mustapha</hi> march'd soon after, and encamp'd himself three miles from the City, causing his horse to make daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions to the very gates, bearing the head of the chiefest Nicotians upon their Lances points to daunt the souldiers, who were rather the more encouraged for revenge; so that when he made nearer approaches to the walls, they made many sallies out, and did notable execution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the enemy; with their Ordnance they demolish'd three Forts which had bin rais'd by <hi>Mustapha,</hi> but it turn'd to their prejudice afterward; for thereby they spent above fifty thousand pound weight of powder, which they afterwards wanted.</p>
               <p>Winter now approaching, and <hi>Mustapha</hi> having intelligence of a great League which was like to be between the Christian Princes, <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stapha</hi> did often, and by divers insinuating waies, sollicit the City to hearken to some agreement touching their rendition, but the Captains and inhabitants of <hi>Famagosta</hi> wold hearken to no parly at all; but sent to the Venetian Senat, intreating them not to treat with the bloudy barbarous enemy, but to send them more forces, for they resolv'd to sell their lifes as dearly as ever Christians did.</p>
               <p>Ther was then at <hi>Suda</hi> in <hi>Candy,</hi> a great Fleet of Christian Gallies, both Venetian, Spanish and Roman, united by a late League; there was a consultation among the chief Commanders what to do, some held it was best to assault some places belonging to the Turk, thereby to enforce the enemy to quit <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and come to the rescue of their own: but <hi>Zanne</hi> the Venetian Generall was of another opinion, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:49798:58"/>
                  <hi>them to sail directly to</hi> Cyprus, <hi>alledging that the principall design of that Fleet was to preserve that Island, which was in so desperate a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if they directed their course elsewhere, 'twas impossible to keep her from utter ruine: That the probablest and most magnanimous way was to find out the enemies Fleet, because that upon report of their coming the Turks wold be enforced to quit their Land enterprises, and retire to their Navy, for the defence therof; which if they shold not do, they were then sure to find their Gallies empty in the haven expos'd to their mercy: He added further, That though haply the enemy was more in number of vessells and men, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they were without all doubt in goodness of shipping, as also in courage and goodness of quarrell farre superior unto them; moreover to approach the enemies Fleet, though no other profit shold ensue therof, wold increase their own reputation, wheras on the contrary to turn away from them wold argue fear and cowardice; That it was no sound advice to lose his own first, upon hope to get it of another man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These reasons being well enforc'd, were approv'd by every one as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Senats Decree, wherupon the whole Fleet, consisting of an hundred eighty light Gallies, namely one hundred twenty foure of the Venetians, forty five of the King of <hi>Spain's,</hi> and twelve of the Popes, besides twelve great Gallies, and fourteen Venetian men of warre, with great number of other vessells of burthen, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ammunition, with other necessaries, in which Fleet there were fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thousand mercenary footmen, besides great numbers of volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, and most of them Gentlemen; this Fleet I say hois'd sails, and sail'd with a fair wind towards <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and in three dayes came to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stelrosso,</hi> which is seated on a rock, opposite to <hi>Carimania,</hi> som hundred and fifty miles from <hi>Famagosta;</hi> there they received the heavy news of the taking of <hi>Nicotia,</hi> which did much trouble them; therupon a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was call'd the next day, wherin <hi>Doria</hi> the Spanish Admirall openly protested, <q>That he wold return home, saying, that he came from <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> with a designe to relieve <hi>Nicotia,</hi> which being lost, the cause of his journey ceas'd, and that he knew no other reason to expose them to the hazzard of a battail; for the enemies being therby grown more insolent, wold quickly embark themselves not only to repell, but to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail us; He added further, the unfitnesse of the season, winter draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and the speciall charge he had for preserving his Fleet by the command of his Catholic Majesty: so <hi>Doria</hi> took his leave of the rest, not a little to his dishonor, and directed his course for <hi>Puglio,</hi> and so to <hi>Sycily.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Colonna</hi> the Popes Admirall, and <hi>Zanne</hi> desirous to do somthing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> remain'd still together, but having intelligence that <hi>Piali</hi> the Turks Admirall was with his whole Fleet making towards them, they weigh'd anchors and made for <hi>Candy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though the <hi>Republic</hi> had ill luck at Sea, and in <hi>Cyprus</hi> this year, yet there were som compensations made to her in <hi>Albania,</hi> for divers Towns did rise up there, who being desirous to shake off the Turkish yoke, they sent to <hi>Venice</hi> for some auxiliary supplies, protesting unto them, That upon the first sight of their ensignes they wold run unto
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49798:58"/>
them, and becom their subjects for security; wherof they wold give them their chiefest children for hostages: so the Governors of <hi>Autivari, Dulcigna</hi> and <hi>Budua,</hi> did in the name of the Republic receave the Oath of Alleageance of more then one hundred Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages.</p>
               <p>While poor <hi>Cyprus</hi> and her chief City <hi>Famagosta</hi> was upon making her last wil, the renewing of the League was treated at <hi>Rome,</hi> which the hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty spirit of the Spaniard did much retard. The Pope in his hortative of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to go upon the Fleet; among other things, the Spaniard propos'd that the Venetians shold be bound upon pain of Ecclesiastical censures, to observe in ev'ry point that which shold be resolv'd on in the League, as though they had suspected the <hi>Republics</hi> integrity; wherunto the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Ambassadors gave a round and stout Answer; they did moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver contend about a <hi>Generalissimo,</hi> the Spaniard proposing not onely to nominat him but his Lievtenant also, who in his absence shold have the same authority: this did much distract the Treaty; ther was another rub besides in the businesse, which was a darknesse that was like to be 'twixt the Emperour and the Pope, for conferring a new Title upon the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> which the Emperour wold not allow of.</p>
               <p>Ther was a motion of peace made about this time by the Turk to the Republic, but as she was ready to send <hi>Ragasson</hi> instructions according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Generall <hi>Colonna</hi> the Popes Generall was sent from <hi>Rome</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade her from it; the Spaniard also seeks unto her about the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and to desire her to re-enter into the League which was now ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely concluded: hereupon she gave <hi>Colonna</hi> a pleasing answer, and after much canvasing the point in the Senat, a resolution was taken to send new Commissions to her Ambassadors at Rome accordingly.</p>
               <p>So in <hi>Rome</hi> after most solemn Divine Service, and the procession end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in S. <hi>Peters</hi> Church, the League was publish'd, the particular Articles whereof were as followeth.</p>

That all the Confederats shall be oblig'd to defend the States of any one of them whom the Turk shall invade, and in particular with other places that shall belong to the Church: that for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the war, his Catholic Majesty shall pay one half, and the other moitie being divided into three parts, the Venetian shall pay two, and the Pope the third: They shall be bound to give the Pope twelve Gallies ready rigg'd and munition'd, which his Holinesse shall mann for the service of the League; that generally each of the Confederats shall be bound to contribut for the common necessity, whatsoever he shall abundantly have, and others want, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards shall be allow'd upon account: that the Store-houses for corn shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>In this League, which was struck 1570. ther was a place reserv'd for <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> the elect Emperour, for the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> to enter into the confederacy when they shold think it fit, and to all other Christian Princes, who had a desire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in it, and in case any strife shold arise <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>twixt the Confederats, the Pope as Umpire shall decide it.</p>
               <p>These Articles were not to be put in execution till the year follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: in the mean time, because <hi>Famagosta</hi> was so much streightned, the Republic sent thither <hi>Marc Antonio Quirini</hi> with four Ships, attended by twelve Gallies, to carry supplies thither, who safely landed sixteen hundred foot, with great store of victualls and munition in <hi>Famagosta,</hi> which did beyond expression encourage them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and whilst he remain'd ther, he took a Ship of the enemies, with other smaller Vessells, and raz'd certain Forts which the Turks had rais'd upon the rock of <hi>Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella;</hi> there was another supply of eight hundred fresh men sent to <hi>Bail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi> the Governour of <hi>Famagosta</hi> in other Ships a little after.</p>
               <p>The Turk made some overtures of peace again to the Venetians, which they wold not hearken unto, in regard of the new League; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon there came another formidable Fleet of two hundred and fifty Gallies again to perfect the conquest of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which arriving at <hi>Candy</hi> did ravage the Countrey; but beaten out with losse, they row'd up and down, and pillag'd divers other places in <hi>Zant</hi> and <hi>Cephalonia;</hi>

That the inhabitants who were desirous to depart, might do the like, and those who wold continue there shold have assurance given them to enjoy their goods, and to live in their Christian Religion still. These Articles being sign'd by <hi>Mustapha,</hi> there were forty vessells ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to transport the Soldiers and inhabitants; but as soon as the Turks entred the City, they began to offer violence: wherupon <hi>Braga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini</hi> sent <hi>Martinengo</hi> to <hi>Mustapha,</hi> to complain of the Soldiers; <hi>Musta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> entertain'd him kindly, desiring to know so valiant a Captain, and to confer with him: <hi>Bragadini</hi> giving credit to these sugred words, being accompanied with <hi>Martinengo,</hi> and <hi>Quirini,</hi> and attended on by sundry Captains all on horsback, with som four musqueteers, go to <hi>Mustapha's</hi> Tent: <hi>Bragadini</hi> rode foremost under a crimson <hi>umbrella</hi> cloth'd in purple, wearing his usuall robe of Magistrat, who being come to <hi>Mustapha's</hi> pavilion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> left their weapons at the doore; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred were courteously entertain'd by <hi>Mustapha;</hi> who cau'sd them to sit down, among other discourses he craved caution for the vessels that were sent to <hi>Candy; Bragadini</hi> having made answer that no such thing was mention'd in the Articles, and besides he had no man there with him who he could leave for pledg behind him; <hi>Musta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> pointing at <hi>Quirini</hi> said, let that man be pledg; <hi>Bragadini</hi> constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintain'd the contrary, and told him he could not justly detain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, <hi>Mustapha</hi> waxing impatient, and being no longer able to master his choler, did fiercely thunder many injurious speeches against him, commanded them all to be manacled, then thrusting them forth of his Tent, he caus'd his Soldier to murder before his face, <hi>Baillone, Martinengo, Quirini</hi> and all the rest before <hi>Bragadini's</hi> face, who was reserv'd for a greater torture, having before his death endured many martyrdomes: they forc'd him twice or thrice to offer his neck, as though they wold have chopt off his head, which they did not do, but only cut off his nose and ears.

but hid by <hi>Mustapha's</hi> Eunuch till his fury was pass'd; all the rest of the Christian soldiers were also bound, and those which were already ship'd were made Gallie-slaves, and despoil'd of their goods. Two daies <hi>Mustapha</hi> entred the City, wher he commanded <hi>Tepulo</hi> to be pulled up, and hang'd at the Yards Arm of a Gally; then causing <hi>Bragadini,</hi> who was so pittifully mangled and dismembred, to be brought before him, he was loaden with two baskets full of earth, the one before, the other behind, and was made to carry them to the great Breach, making him to kisse the ground so oft as he pass'd by him; thence he was hurried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way into a Gally of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> where he was bound in a Chair, with a Crown at his feet, and so hoisted up to the Main-yard of the Gally, that he might be the better discern'd of the Slaves and Christian soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that were in the Haven: being thence brought back to the City with Drums and Trumpets into the Market place, he was ther stript of his clothes, and most ignominiously layed upon a Scaffold, wher they fell a flaying of him alive; the Noble gentleman enduring all things with invincible patience and magnanimity, without any murmuring, only taxing the perfidious <hi>Bassa</hi> with perjury and Breach of Faith, at last expir'd, when the bloudy executioners had come with their knifes as far as his navill; then was his skin stuff'd with straw, and carried round about the City, 'twas afterward hung at the Yard Arm of a Galleot all along the Coasts of <hi>Syria,</hi> as he return'd to <hi>Constantinople.</hi>

               <p>This was the sense of the Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> which the Speakers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and gracefull delivery gave more life and strength unto; it was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards confirm'd by <hi>Carnia</hi> a Spaniard, the sympathy between whose toung and the Genaralls ear further'd perhaps his resolution to fight, willing that so Noble a Councell might be rather attributed to one of the Nation, then to <hi>Barbarico: Carnia's</hi> Speech in effect was this:</p>
               <q>Ther are three Motives, most magnificent Generall, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imputation of fear or omission of duty, may induce a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to decline battail: First a disproportion between the benefit of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and prejudice of overthrow on either part; in this respect the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> did politiquely abstain from encountring the <hi>Guise</hi> in <hi>Naples</hi> when they could lose but their Army, but the Spaniard his Army, and Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> Secondly, if he foresee an easier and cheaper means to dissolve the adverse Army then by battail; thus did your highnesse Father, <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour of sacred memory, break the neck of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Armies in <hi>Germany:</hi> Lastly, the inequality of strength, he being the weaker, and likely to miscarry in the attempt, wherof ther are so many presidents, that I need alledge none; but neither of these can be applied to divert us from battail, where if we prevail we recover our own again, and haply <hi>Greece</hi> her self for inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; if fighting valiantly we be overcome, yet shall we in the conflict so far weaken and maim the enemy, that we shall sooner arm a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Navy then he an offensive, and more easily secure our own, then he make any further impression on it. Touching protraction, the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will indeed dissolve his Fleet, but so that it will bud forth againe the next Spring perhaps a greater, and get the start of our Navy, his being united by Nation, ours by combination. Touching inequality of force, it is propable we exceed them more in men, then they us in vessells, for he must needs consume many men, in taking so many strong Towns and Forts, and employ many in keeping them; neither are the scars of the late pestilence healed among them, therefore my advice is, the Gallies of <hi>Candy</hi> being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Don Iohn</hi> after this serious consultation concluded to assail the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Fleet, and attempt to intercept their harvest of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> with other maritin parts of Christendom ere they shold house it; therefore depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from <hi>Messina,</hi> and being lanch'd out to open Sea, he compos'd his Gallies to that form of battail which he intended to observe in fight; so marshalling and exercising them before, that ev'ry Squadron might know his place, and ev'ry Gally his Squadron, and be able to transform themselfs to all figures without confusion, when occasion shold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Two daies after they arriv'd at the Cape of <hi>Colonnes,</hi> wher they came to anchor by reason of a contrary wind, as also because they were to take their fresh supplies of men; in the mean time they dispatch'd

               <p>
                  <hi>Colonna</hi> the Popes Admirall fearing what this might grow unto, us'd his intercession to atone the difference, conjuring <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> in whom he found great obstinacy of discontent and estrangement, and telling him <hi>the act was just, though sudden like the occasion, and that suddennesse is necessary in dangers of so swift extension, which having once got the start, remedy could hardly overtake them:</hi> 
                  <q>That mutiny in an Army was of as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant conveyance as a gangrene in the body; if the party infected were not presently cut off, it endanger'd the whole; that this was no intrusion on the Generals authority, for an under-Admiral in his own Squadron to execut a privat offender: that indeed he had no cause of offence, &amp; if he had cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had no leasure to entertain it: that the enemies strength could not so much endanger them, as their own division weaken them; that as nothing could heap more honor upon him then the suppressall of the enemy, so nothing could lay fouler aspersion then to lose this oportunity of doing it; therfore if he could not casheer his passion, he shold employ it against the common enemy.</q>

               <q>Brave invincible spirits; whom gracious heaven hath held worthy to be his Champions, to whom the Angells will not be idle specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but actors and assistants in this sacred Tragedy: Nature I know hath given you the strongest temper of valour and devotion, set so keen an edge on that temper, as I need not whet it by any further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; only let me tell you, that you have the fairest occasion that ever was to unsheath and use it; let victory set such a glasse upon it, as no rust of Oblivion may ever eat out. Now is the time to bring that dark half Moon, which seeks to eclipse the bright Sun of Heaven, to such a wane, as shall never fill again. Let her not any longer usurp domination o're the Sea: our enemies exceed us in nombers made up of cyphers and shadows of men, but let us excell them in resolution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the essence of soldiers; they are imprison'd and immur'd by shores and rocks, as much as I wold say victory cannot scape us; they must fight because they cannot fly, we because we must overcom; we have a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of conquest, the danger mix'd with it doth but season and enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it, who wold triumph over women? we are to share the whole wealth of Nature, the Earth to the Survivors, the Heaven to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: the scarrs of the wound wil be beautiful, because honorable: who would ingratefully refuse to bleed for that loving God, who refus'd not to die for him? Courage therfore Divine Champions, forget not that some of you are Romanes; and which is more, all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</q>
               <p>This Speech was answer'd with applauses and wonderfull conclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on all sides, in which humor we will leave them a while to behold the countenance of the enemy, and how the <hi>Moon</hi> appear'd.</p>
               <p>The Turks in the <hi>interim</hi> us'd more then ordinary circumspection and providence; for having information by Spies, Fugitives, Greeks and prisoners, not only of the conjunction of the Confederat Fleet of the Christians, but of their nere approaches, being now engag'd in the Gulph of <hi>Lepanto: Mehemet Bey</hi> was dismiss'd with sixty Gallies to <hi>Asprospicio</hi> a Neighbour City, to bring from thence som competent supplies of victuall and men, in which businesse he used such celerity, that in short time he return'd, bringing with him plenty of provision &amp; ammunition, besides ten thousand <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> two thousand ordinary soldiers, and two thousand Volunteers; with which multitude and false supposition of our paucity, they were not so confirm'd in their courage, but stood possessed of a kind of ominous mistrusting the event. In which respect <hi>Ali Bassa</hi> the high Admirall, though by his own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and his masters command he stood resolv'd to fight, call'd a generall Councell to deliberat on so huge a design, most of them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to give battail, but <hi>Partau Bassa</hi> Generall of the Land Forces, earnestly oppos'd it: On the contrary side <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <q>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:49798:66"/>Most excelse and victorious Prince, the Turkish Nation hath so Nobly behav'd it self, that it is a question whether their fortune or their valour hath bred their greatnesse, or whether the latter hath commanded the former; once it may be affirm'd, that if our Starrs have favor'd us, we have not forsaken our selfs, nor shamed them, but magnified their influence by our actions: Our Predecessors have left us ample Territories, wherein we have not bin such unthrifts, but husbanded them, that if they have made little much, we have exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that much almost to infinite; so that if we hold on this course of victory, <hi>Alexander</hi> never stood more then we in need of new worlds; which of these prying inquisitive Christians had not discover'd unto us, our valour e're long wold want work; yet let us not seem so glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and cloyed with conquest, as to refuse to accept of this one tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph more; this by Sea will serve to counterbalance that glorious Land victory lately pourchas'd; let us fill both the hands of our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, one with spoils of Land, the other of Sea; these feeble tyr'd Christians have bin but our Porters, they are now ready to deliver them, let us not disdain to take it of them, least they cozen us now, as they did my Father thirty years ago, when they ran away with their burden; we have Gallies enough, not only to stow their wealth, but if need were to take in their Gallies; therefore most invincible Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, let us prevent their flight by a speedy assault.</q>
               <p>This Speech utter'd by a man, whose performance heretofore had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bin correspondent to so confident expressions, not only incourag'd, but inflam'd many of the hearers, wherof <hi>Vluzzali</hi> Generall of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Barbary</hi> could not contain himself, but with many earnest and pregnant arguments averr'd the same with <hi>Hassan;</hi> alledging besides the oportunity, the necessity of obeying the gran Signors command, <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>abeg</hi> the Sanzak of <hi>Smyrna</hi> ecchoed the same.</p>
               <p>Yet many of the graver, and more advised sort of Captains dissented from this more hot then deliberat resolution, specially <hi>Mehemet Bey</hi> the Sanzak of <hi>Negropont,</hi> who though not so eloquently, yet more truly demonstrated the danger of fighting, as followeth.</p>
               <q>I am sorry magnificent <hi>Ali,</hi> that at this time the Counsell of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious <hi>Hassan,</hi> is rather to be admir'd and applauded for greatnesse of courage then follow'd for soundness, fitter to set our toungs then hands on work, I mean to be answer'd, then executed; It is most tru in raising the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, that the Turkish valour hath ever guided their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but it is as tru, that their wisdom hath alwaies directed their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, els they had never created this world of their greatnesse out of nothing, or made it out of atomes and such slender principles; they have not by posting to the end of their desires lamed or tyred the means that carried them, but by going softlier have gone further; greatnesse is steep and high, not to be climb'd but leasurely, those that strive to mount up violently use to fall precipitatly; such was the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den floud and ebb of the <hi>Goths,</hi> such the inundation of <hi>Tamberlain;</hi> one Kingdome is a sufficient crop for one year, after that rate we may soon begger Christendom, and perfect the Turkish Monarchy; as we have
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:49798:66"/>
won <hi>Cyprus</hi> and may keep it, so we may lose that and our selfs too in seeking to get more: If you conceave the Christians have come so far but with resolution to fight, or to fight but with probability of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, you must think them either fools or madmen; but if after so familiar and long hostility, overvaluing our selfs, they hinder us not to know them, we must needs think their swords and wits to be as sharp as ours: It is not their pusillanimity but their division hath ruin'd them, &amp; our multitudes have rather wearied then conquer'd them. From <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veza</hi> they departed themselfs, we did not drive them, at least the shame of flying then will incite them to fight now; our odds of strength is incertain, if they be the weaker, supplies may strengthen them, if we the stronger, many accidents may weaken us, but none strengthen us: therfore my counsell is, that we go home while our way is open, and we have our welcom in our hands, and let not hope defraud us of certainty, yet is my Opinion ever subject to your corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</q>
               <p>This Speech was highly applauded of <hi>Partau Bassa, Siroch</hi> and <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey,</hi> yet fate and their Emperours expresse command urg'd publiquely by <hi>Vluzzali,</hi> transported them so far against their own judgement, that they resolv'd not only to hazard battail, but to seek it: To which end having distributed those 4000. soldiers wher they found most need, they weigh'd Anchor and came to <hi>Galanga</hi> about the evening the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>Octber,</hi> and ther stayed to supply themselfs and their Gallies with whatsoever was requisit for the incounter. Now drawing nere, the Admirall neglected nothing that might tend to the augmentation of strength, or for the ostentation of his vessels and men: one principall care was the fastning of his slaves, least their bodies as wel as their minds instead of necessary instruments, might prove dangerous revoltedengins against them, knowing that desire of liberty and revenge, two violent appetits, wold make them apt to snatch at any oportunity: he caus'd their allowance of diet to be augmented to cherish their bodies, that they might be more strenuous for labor, mixing hopes of future lenity with fear of present punishment, that stubbornesse, a thing invincible, which obdurats the minds of slaves might not hinder the utmost extent of strength: He likewise keeping good intelligence at Sea to prevent a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den invasion, drew forth his Fleet in order of battail, that both his men and Gallies when need requir'd might not be to learn their duty or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which he neglected not to practise continually as he approach'd the Christian Fleet, till he had brought them to perfection therin.</p>
               <p>The eight of <hi>October</hi> very early in the morning, hoping inexpectedly to have com upon the Christian Fleet as they were at anchor, they hoisted their sails half mast high, so to hinder their discovery, and with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle gale sailed towards <hi>Cephalonia;</hi> both Fleets were within twelve miles one of another, yet undescried, by reason of certain capes and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands dividing and shadowing them. They first ken'd the Christian Navy cleer of the <hi>Cruzalares</hi> which had somwhat disordred them; and seeing <hi>Andrea Doria</hi> stand to Sea-ward vainly, imagin'd that he had fled, as upon the like reason the Christians were deluded with the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49798:67"/>
of them, which opinion as it begat contempt of the adverse part, so it bred confidence in themselfs; the place wher both the Fleets met serv'd aptly to fight, and not to fly.</p>
               <p>The Gulph being in circuit not above two hundred &amp; fifty miles, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Maura,</hi> the one being forty, the other fifteen miles long on that Coast; on the coasts of <hi>Albania,</hi> scarce a mile from the main, were the rocks <hi>Cruzulares</hi> of an inequal bignesse, but the lesser the more dangerous: here again the Christian Fleet before conceal'd by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposition of headlands bewray'd truly her own greatnesse, which though inferior to the Turks, yet exceeding their expectation, did som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what shake their former resolution, yet hope, shame, and which was more then both, necessity spurring them forwards, they approach'd in form following.</p>
               <p>They divided their Fleet which consisted of two hundred seventy Vessels, Gallies, &amp; Foists, into four battaillons correspondent to that of the Christians. In the middle battail was the High Admirall <hi>Ali Bassa,</hi> and therin were contain'd ninety Gallies, in the midst of whom in a rich and a well appointed Gally was he himself flank'd on the right side with <hi>Partau Bassa,</hi> and on the left with the Tresurer of the Navy, who were assisted each of them by three Admiralls: The right wing consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of fifty Gallies, wherof <hi>Mehemet S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

credulity listned; but soon were those arguments confuted, when the wind which till now had bin still partiall unto them, became a neutral to both, and a flat calm, giving attention (as it were) to the voice of the Cannon; and not only the wind, but the Sun seem'd now to ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy against them, who having with too much light dazled the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Navy at the instant of joyning ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>The Christians having in all respects provided for so great an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt as far as human wisdom and strength could extend, (considering this Fleet to be their Ark, and God himself interested in the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie) ceased not with importunat, but most humble invocations, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the aid of heaven, which by their Confessors was confidently promis'd them: Their devotions concluded, and each battail facing each other, the charge was given by a Canon from <hi>Ali</hi> the Turkish Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, and answer'd by one from each wing, with obstreperous cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours after their custom, which they think awakens the courage of the soldier, with amazement and terror to the enemy; they quickly make towards the Christian Fleet, who in a differing manner made Trumpets, Drums, Fifes, and other such Martiall music, the delightfull Prolog to a more dreadfull Scene: <hi>Venieri</hi> back'd his Gally with two other of <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now <hi>Stroch</hi> perceaving himself not onely frustrated the interposition of <hi>Barbaricos</hi> Squadron, but distress'd by the irresistible force of it, yet he persisted still in fight to save his honour, though not his life, using all the powerfull Rhetoric he could for the encouragement of his languishing men, wherin by speech, as well as by example, he so prevail'd, that desperation whetting resolution, they had recover'd now not only hopes of resistance, but of victory: For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter divers unequall and doubtfull conflicts in many parts, here nomber oppressing valour, ther valour making amends for the odds of nomber, specially in the Gallies of the two <hi>Barbaricos,</hi> while with discreet cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage they ran still to the weakest part, like the vitall spirits in the body: one of them was mortally wounded by a fatall Turkish arrow in the left eye, himself being indeed not only the eye, but the very heart of his Squadron; he falling down, confirm'd that the Life-bloud of an Army runs commonly in the veins of the chief Commander: his owne men shrunk back, the Turks intruded and press'd into his Gally, which had bin taken, but that <hi>Frederico Nani,</hi> and <hi>Silvio Porcia</hi> came into her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue. These heroick gentlemen growing up like <hi>Hydras</hi> heads in the room of <hi>Barbarico,</hi> repell'd the Turks, and recover'd the former hopes of victory: <hi>Porcia</hi> receav'd a wound in his thigh, the honorable badge of valor.</p>
                  <p>In another part <hi>Cicogna Barbarico</hi> oppress'd with multitudes of Turkish Gallies, was (as one might say) refin'd with wild fire, and his face beautified with an eminent scar, but was at last preserv'd by spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy supplies, being so far from yeelding either to wearinesse or pain, that after this he boarded and took a principall Gally, &amp; one of their Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Ensigns, which to this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>serves in the Venetian Armory to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the invincible courage of the taker: But <hi>Siroch</hi> surrounded with danger and mischiefs on both sides, having no means to satisfie his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on all, desperatly rush'd upon <hi>Giovanni Contarini,</hi> whose kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was before not cheaply slain, and that such an impetuous violence, that he had almost stem'd his Gally, which he obstinatly persevering to board, was ther mortally wounded, as before in judgement, so now in valour, having manifested himself a compleat and absolut soldier: his fall bred such an amazement in the Turk, as the fate of <hi>Barbarico</hi> in the Christian; his men slain and wounded, left their decks to their thronging enemies, who rushing in, were like to have made the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie a common sepulcher to both; for she being shot between wind and water, was upon point of sinking: the Turks leaped over board, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping by swimming to find the land more mercifull unto them then the water; <hi>Siroch</hi> was taken not quite dead, but his wounds were search'd and found incurable, in pity rather then cruelty he was dispatch'd out of his pain.

Fleet, assisting where they saw need and had oportunity; besides the battail of succours continually supplied and releev'd impartially all parts distress'd.</p>
                  <p>Now the two Generalls, <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Ali Bassa,</hi> meeting like two furious currents, began so terrible a fight in midst of both the Fleets, that the rest seem'd to be but Spectators to them two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Gallies that incircled them were (as it were) the Scaffold, and they two the Stage; contrariety of Religion, emulation of honor, anger, hope and fear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd admirable effects in both: while <hi>Ali</hi> made violent impression on <hi>Don Iohns</hi> Gally on the Prow, she was by others likely to have bin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred at the Poop, which being perceav'd, was prevented by those that back'd her, who boording those boorders, took their Gallies, but with great slaughter and difficulty. The Turkish Generall knowing the fortune of the day to depend upon his successe, desperatly conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to inforce <hi>Don Iohn;</hi> wherin he prevail'd so far, that he compell'd him to bring out of hold his fresh reserves that he had under deck, to exchange place with his wounded and wearied men upon the hatches, which strange and inexpected supply, sprung as it were out of the womb of the Gallie to defend her mother, bred an amazement, and by amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hastned the destruction of the fainting Turks: <hi>Ali<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> being shot in the head, his Gally soon yeelded, himself being yet alive and presented to <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> his head was struck off, which being mounted on the point of a pike, was held up for a public demonstration of victory; a gratefull object to the Christians, but dreadfull to the Turks; the same cause bringing forth at once two contrary effects, <hi>viz.</hi> hope and fear, which yet lesse dismay'd them, not discerning it afar off; but the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Crosse Royall on the top of their Admirall Gally, danted them more then all the rest, for that was visible throughout the Fleet, and the fatall signification of it easily interpreted, so that now they began to fly, but in such a confusion, that while they shun the poursute of one Gally, they fall foul upon another: besides <hi>Marco Quirini,</hi> and <hi>Antonio Canali,</hi> two Venetian Commanders, intercepted many of the Gallies flying, and men swimming to the shoare.</p>
                  <p>In this most memorable fight, many Commanders on either side were taken or slain, whose distinct Catalog shall be inserted at the end of the battail, not yet absolutely concluded: For <hi>Vluzzali</hi> foreseeing now too late this generall overthrow, studied how he might in some measure revenge what he could not prevent: therfore hovering aloof from the Fleet to expect some straglers of the Christians, at last found oportunity to cut off certain Venetian Gallies, who at first had fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd <hi>Dorta,</hi> but now desirous to have bin sharers in so Noble a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, were retiring to the main battail; them he chas'd, fetch'd up and boarded; but they bravely repelling him, and <hi>Dorta</hi> wheeling about to assail him, knowing it dangerous for him to persever in fight, when his own force wold continually decrease, and his enemies be augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by confluence of rescu from all parts of the Army, executing most of his mischief upon those Venetians, he with sail down stood off to Sea, towing after him the Gallies of <hi>Pietro Bua,</hi> of <hi>Corfu,</hi> of the

                  <p>To conclude, the insolent enemy being thus overthrown, and their spoil gather'd, the next care was to cure the wounded men, and repair the bruised and torn Vessells, wherin the Commanders shew'd no lesse industry, then in preparation for the fight, and their admired valour in it. It is hard to decide, which of these three Admiralls, <hi>Don Iohn, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieri,</hi> or <hi>Colonna,</hi> merited most applause: they all did what could not be exceeded by any other, nor equall'd but by themselfs: the former dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ast 'twixt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Don Iohn</hi> and <hi>Venieri,</hi> as it had bin providently pacified by mediation of <hi>Colonna,</hi> so was it in the conquest nobly forgotten of themselfs. <hi>Don Iohn</hi> towards the beginning of the battail, being endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd by inequality of nomber, <hi>Venieri</hi> with his own danger bravely rescued him, like two metled Mastiffs jarring among themselfs, when the Bear comes, forbear privat strife to joyn against the common enemy; which Noble courtesie, the Generall nobly and gratefully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, honoring him with the Title of Author, and which is more, the Father of the Victory.</p>
                  <p>The whole Army in united voice gratified the Divine Mercy for so great a preservation, and elevating their victorious hands to heaven, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd to be taught to fight by it; ev'ry man congratulated the safety of his living friend, yet moderately lamented the fate of the dead, the sorrow of their death being dried by the merit of the cause; those bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that were recover'd were honorably buried, the rest detain'd by the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49798:72"/>
Sea, were yet eterniz'd on the shore. To repeat the Noble action of ev'ry particular man were a <hi>Plutarks</hi> labour, ev'ry life wold be a story; and we know that <hi>Plutark</hi> gave lifes to many, though the longest to himself; but among the most eminent, shines the Noble indifferency of the Marquis of <hi>Santa Cruz,</hi> who disposing of the reserve of succours, distributed them not according to his own affections, but other mens necessities, bewraying at once excellency of judgement, courage and celerity.</p>
                  <p>Many circumstances gave lustre to this victory, but nothing more then the flight of the Christian Fleet, not many years before from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same place, the infamy of the one glorifying the other, and serving as a foil to it, as shadows set forth and enlighten pictures. It was a pleasing consideration to those who had bin forc'd to be fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, to think they shold find their honor where they lost it: To this may be added the remembrance of the like battail fought 'twixt <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Marc Anthony,</hi> above a thousand years past in the same place, as if destiny had made it a Stage for great actions, and that this Heroick Battail had bin but the second part of the first.</p>

                  <p>This great losse was lessen'd by that of the Turks, who are reported by some Authors to have lost nere upon thirty thousand: but the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of their Gallies taken, wrack'd, and dead bodies floting on the Sea, carrying with it a resemblance of the generall deluge, must needs acknowledge it to be great.</p>

confer three hundred duckets of yearly pension upon him. But the most esteemed spoil had from the Turkish Fleet, was the redemption of so many Christians, in nomber twelve hundred; words are but mute expressions of the pitifull slavery they were in, being compell'd both actively and passively, to suffer for, and act against their own Religion; nothing could equall it, but the joy of this enlargement, nor was this joy peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar and solely to themselfs, but multiplied by portions among their friends and kinsmen.</p>

                     <hi>Venieri</hi> highly extoll'd the magnanimity of the General, propo singunto him the rescue of <hi>Greece,</hi> an exploit which shold immortalize him more then the conquest of <hi>Tunis</hi> did his Father, whose <hi>Genius</hi> wold not envy, sayed he, to see it self exceeded by him, which was not equall'd by his Predecessors. This much inflam'd the hot aspiring mind of the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Conquerour, insomuch that they proceeded to consultation, how this Trophy might be perfected, whose hardest work, to wit, the foundation, was already so happily layed; therfore making <hi>Aprill</hi> the time, and <hi>Corfu</hi> the rendevous of their next years convention, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies were dissolv'd, <hi>Don Iohn</hi> returning to <hi>Messina.

Here it will not be improper to add an Answer of an old <hi>Chious,</hi> who being com Ambassador to <hi>England</hi> in King <hi>Iames's</hi> time, and being ask'd among other things by the King, whether he had bin at the battail of <hi>Lepanto, Yes,</hi> sayed he, <hi>and at the taking of Cyprus also.</hi>

                     <hi>Colonna</hi> departed also with <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> and return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> where his fame had arriv'd long before him: This successe rais'd the spirits of that ancient City in a shape of rriumph, to see her aged glory give such a fresh lustre in this glasse of victory, to entertain her new Champion; the whole City seem'd to be turn'd inside outward, the rich Tapistries now beautifying the wals without, the streets were strew'd with flowers as at a marrage: It is reported that a little before this battail, the Pope <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> had perform'd many rigid and austere Penances in his own person, and having bin a whole night contending with God in prayer, in his own privat Oratory; he came at last suddenly out with a cheerfull countenance, and in a kind of ravishment or extasie, saying, <hi>alegramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te la Vittoria é nostra,</hi> be of good cheer the Victory is ours, and as the Manuscript hath it, this was the very morning before the battail began.</p>
                  <p>No lesse were the triumphs at the Court of Spain, when tydings were brought to <hi>Philip</hi> the second of this Signall and glorious Victory; yet when the very first, and long expected news therof was brought and related unto him, he never chang'd countenance, or gave as much as a smile, or least outward shew of alteration, he was a man of such a rare constancy of temper, only he sayed after a long speculative pause, <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho ha aventurado mi hermano Don Iuan,</hi> my brother <hi>Don Iohn</hi> hath ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd very far; but it was the first time that ever he was heard to call him <hi>Brother,</hi> which stile he continued ever after.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Republic</hi> hoping that the rest of the Christian confederat Princes wold be constant in the League, rigg'd up their Gallies again, and made great preparations against the following Spring, but <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceasing, who gave the greatest vigour to the League, matters began to languish; yet ther was a conjunction of som forces the Sommer after against <hi>Vluzzali,</hi> a great Pyrat, and Admirall to the Turk; and there were considerable Fleets on both sides, the Turk had two hundred Sails, the Christians not so many, and about the <hi>Mona</hi> they twice fac'd one another, but encountred not; so all dissolv'd without performance of any thing, though <hi>Venieri</hi> made fair Propositions unto them for som attempts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both by Land and Sea, and to be the first in the Van himself, but the Spaniard was too cold and cautious; besides <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> himselfe had promis'd to come in person, but did not.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon it was high time for the <hi>Republic</hi> to hearken to a peace with her potent Neighbour, specially ther having bin divers Overtures made by the Gran Visier to that purpose: among other inducements

                  <p>The world pass'd sundry censures of this peace, specially in regard the Venetians had done it without the consent of the other Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats; <hi>Paul</hi> the third then Pope storm'd at it, but the King of <hi>Spain</hi> seem'd to dissemble his discontent, saying, <hi>That he doubted not, but that the motives which shold induce so wise a</hi> Senat <hi>were of great importance, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that as he had freely employed his forces for the generall incolumity of Christendome, and particularly of the Venetian, so they likewise wold if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion requir'd be ready to do the like for him;</hi> The world wondred at this calmnesse in the Spaniard, and the reason which peeple alledg'd then, was the revolutions in the Low Countreys, and that he was like to fall out with <hi>France,</hi> with whom he was loth the Venetian shold ligue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether against him.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding this solemn peace with <hi>Selim,</hi> yet the Republic understanding that <hi>Amurath,</hi> who had newly succeeded in the <hi>Ottoman Empire</hi> upon the death of <hi>Selym,</hi> did arm apace to be reveng'd upon <hi>Spain,</hi> in regard that <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> had lately sack'd <hi>Tunis</hi> in <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary;</hi> this made the Republic apprehend som fears, that the Turk wold fall foul up on some of their Dominions, specially the Ile of <hi>Candy:</hi> hereup on she rigs up her Gallies again, but in the interim a <hi>Chiaus</hi> coms from <hi>Constantinople</hi> in quality of Ambassador extraordinary from <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi> to confirm the former peace.</p>

                  <p>The Ambassador did what the Pope injoyn'd him, and within a while after he receav'd instructions and a Commission from the Senat, to acquaint his Holines with the equity of their cause, and Justice of their Law, together with the Signories decree, and unquestionable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to passe such decrees: The Pope being confident in his own O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, sayed aloud, that he gave him Audience only to content the Venetians, but not to admit any of his propounded reasons or excuses, Then he made another complaint about the detaining of a <hi>Canon</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza,</hi> and the Abbot of <hi>Nerveze,</hi> both of them accus'd of notorious Crimes; And within a while after, concerning another Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding to build Churches without permission, being resolv'd to have those two Laws revok'd, and the prisoners delivered to his <hi>Nuncio</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siding in <hi>Venice:</hi> hereupon on the tenth of <hi>September,</hi> he pass'd two <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions,</hi> one concerning the two Laws, the other about sentencing the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49798:76"/>
Clergy; so he sent a Commission accordingly to his <hi>Nuncio</hi> to present them, resolving upon their refusall to proceed to <hi>Excommunication;</hi> but the <hi>Nuncio</hi> being peradventure mov'd with pity because the Senat at that time had chosen an extraordinary Ambassador, by humble means thinking to divert his Holines from his resolution, and to induce him to consider better of the matter, delayed the presenting of those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions, which the Pope took in ill part; whereupon in all hast he sent him an expresse Commandement, to present them without further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crastination; In regard whereof upon <hi>Christmas</hi> day when Duke <hi>Grima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> lay at the point of death, and that the Senators were solemnly assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, som wherof had receav'd the Holy Sacrament, and others were ready to receave, the <hi>Nuncio</hi> craved Audience, and produc'd the two <hi>Injunctions,</hi> but the Dukes death hapning the next day, they were not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd till after the Election of the new Prince.</p>
                  <p>LEONARDO DONATO Knight and Procurator of S. <hi>Mark</hi> succeeded<note place="margin">1605</note> GRIMANI, after whose Election the two <hi>Injunctions</hi> being open'd, were found to be both of one substance, which in effect was, <q>That his Holines was advertised that the Venetian Senat had decreed divers things contrary to the Liberty of the Church, and Authority of the <hi>Sea Apostolie,</hi> and divulg'd through all the Dominions of the Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry certain Laws peculiar only to the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> forbidding to build Churches or Monasteries, or to alienat the secular possessions of the Clergy without the Senats permission, which, as repugnant to the Churches Liberty, his Holines declared to be invalid, and they who enacted them to have incurr'd Ecclesiasticall censures, commanding them under pain of Excommunication, presently to revoke and abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the sayed Lawes, threatning to proceed further in case they did not conform.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Senat answer'd 28. of <hi>Ian. Anno</hi> 1606. as followeth: <q>That with grief and amazement they understood by his Holines Letters, that he dislik'd the Laws of the Venetian Republic, prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously observ'd for so many Ages, and never tax'd by any of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, the revokement wherof wold not only shake, but utterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the very fundamentalls of the State; that he interpreted those Laws to be prejudiciall to the Sea Apostolic, and the Authority thereof, blaming those who had made them as infringers of the Churches Liberty, notwithstanding that they were known to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of singular piety, and to have done good service to the Sea of <hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>,</hi> and were now doubtlesse in heaven; that the Senat according to his Holines advertisement had narrowly examin'd both the New and Old Laws, and could find nothing in them but what might be decreed by a Soveraign Prince, concluding, that the Venetians did not think they had incurr'd any censures, and that therfore his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes so repleat with Religion and Piety, wold not without pondering well the cause, continue his menaces.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This answer did much displease the Pope, who presently awarded an <hi>Excommunication</hi> against them, which on the seventh day of <hi>April</hi> of the same year was publish'd throughout all <hi>Rome,</hi> and hung up in the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49798:77"/>
usuall places, namely on the great Gate of S. <hi>Peter's</hi> Church, the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery and Market place of <hi>Campo di Fiore</hi> by <hi>Christophoro Fonduto</hi> and <hi>Gio. Dominico di Pace</hi> the Popes Poursuyvants.</p>
                  <p>The Prince and Senat having intelligence of what had pass'd at <hi>Rome,</hi> to prevent all popular tumults and commotions which might peradventure thereby arise in the Towns and Cities subject to their Jurisdiction, were desirous to acquaint all sorts of people therwith; to which end they fram'd two Declarations, the one directed to all the Clergy of their Dominions, and the other to all secular Magistrates and Officers, to stop and restrain all disorders that might hence ensue; wherupon all that year divers books were written <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> som con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the Venetians, others the Pope, ev'ry one as his passion did transport him; but at last this great contention had like to have bin decided by the sword, both sides making preparations for war. For the Venetians having understood that a great number of Foot and Horse was levied at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and that the Romanes had offer'd to aid the Pope in that war with men and money; They likewise rais'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces accordingly, and fell to fortifie their Towns with greater strength, because they wold not be surpriz'd, or taken unprovided, so that there was a great likelihood of an eager bloudy warr, had not <hi>France</hi> vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously appear'd as <hi>Mediatrix</hi> in the businesse.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon <hi>Henry</hi> the IIII. to prevent the danger and scandall which might arise by this war, did speedily send the Cardinall <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> both to the Pope and the Venetians from him, and in his name to intercede for a peace amongst them, which Embassie took very good effect; for the Cardinall being speedily dispatch'd from <hi>France</hi> with instructions &amp; other dispatches necessary for his Negotiation, He arriv'd at <hi>Rome</hi> on a Thursday night 23. <hi>Martii</hi> 1607. and the same Evening confer'd with the Cardinalls and the French Ambassador there resident, to propound the businesse to his Holines: therupon the next day the Cardinall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the Leger Ambassadour, went to see his Holines; unto whom the Cardinall did largely relate the occasion of his coming; But the Pope seem'd to be inexorable to any terms of agreement with the Venetians, til the Clergy and Jesuits (who had bin banish'd not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) were restor'd to their Churches &amp; Colledges; The Cardinall at this first Audience wold not put him out of hope of their restitution, but only told him, that he did not despair of reconciling the Jesuits to the Venetians, having bethought himself of a fit meanes, whereof if his Holines wold not make use, he doubted not but it wold be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent.</p>
                  <p>The Pope being much desirous to know this new devise; did the next day early send for him, then the Cardinall <hi>de Ioyeuse</hi> told him, <hi>That to hope by any expresse Treaty to obtain of the Venetian Senat the restauration of the Iesuits, were but to spend time to no purpose, but if his Holines wold give ample Commission and Authority to revoke the Censures, and send him to</hi> Venice <hi>with such a power, some good might be done upon the public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of the sayed Commission.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pope made shew, that he neither could nor wold approve of this
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49798:77"/>
motion, therfore he sayed, <hi>That he had engag'd his promise not to abandon the Iesuits, who had bin expuls'd for favouring his Interdiction, unto whom he had pass'd his word never to be reconcil'd to the Venetians, till they were re-establish'd;</hi> but after sundry other Allegations, this conference was to little purpose, ev'ry man perceaving by his Holines countenance that he was perplex'd.</p>
                  <p>The French <hi>Cardinall</hi> and others meeting to reconcile these differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and remove the difficulties, entreated Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> to go the next day after dinner, to get expresse Audience of the Pope, and if it were possible to induce him to grant certain points for the advance of the businesse.</p>
                  <p>Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> at their intreaty undertook the task, and a good while debated the point with his Holines about the restoring of the Jesuits, shewing him the danger whereunto he expos'd the Church and Christian Religion for one particular Order, whose restauration was to be hop'd for therafter, though for a time defer'd: <hi>He told him that his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines shold first re-establish his own Authority in</hi> Venice, <hi>and that being once done, ther was no doubt but the other might follow after:</hi> So after many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prevalent reasons, <hi>Perron</hi> obtain'd of the Pope, that seeing for the present he could not prevail in the Jesuits behalf, he shold let it passe, and insert a Clause in the Article, wherby it might appear to the world, that he had not neglected their restauration: then the Cardinall speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commission, the Pope wold hardly be drawn therunto, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it to be dishonorable to the Sea Apostolic, <hi>in regard that the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Censures ought to be done at</hi> Rome, <hi>and not sent to</hi> Venice; yet the Cardinal alledging divers reasons to the contrary, the Pope at last consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to give the Cardinal <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> Commission to revoke the Censures which he shold carry with him to <hi>Venice,</hi> but on this condition, to do his best for the restauration of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> before he disannull'd the Interdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He also, though with som difficulty, induc'd his Holines to be pleas'd that the French Ambassador resident at <hi>Rome,</hi> and not he who lay at <hi>Venice,</hi> shold in the French Kings, and the Signories Name, crave of him the revocation of the Censures in writing; for the Pope told him that the Spanish Ambassador resident at <hi>Venice</hi> had crav'd it in the name of his Master and the Republic; In a word, the Pope granted all his demands, only he seem'd unwilling to declare his intention to the Consistory, saying, that he suppos'd he ought not to do it publiquely, because he had not yet acquainted the Cardinalls herwith; neverthelesse he wold resolve upon't, and the next day in the Consistory wold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it to som particular Cardinalls, and the same afternoon call one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another into his Chamber, to take their suffrages in secret: Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this resolution, the Pope having in the Consistory declar'd his intent to som particular Cardinalls; he did the same afternoon call the rest into his Chamber, secretly to take their Opinions, and in that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse spent the whole week.</p>
                  <p>The Spaniards being not well pleas'd, that they were not sought unto in this businesse, and desirous to frustrate the matter, divulg'd certain rumors contrary to the Popes will and meaning, and among others, a
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:49798:78"/>
cunning letter was written by <hi>Don Francisco de Castro,</hi> wherin he certified the Pope, that if he stood first for restoring the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> he was likely to obtain, it and that the Republic determin'd to make a Protestation, by surrendring the Prisoners contrary to that which had bin concluded, and which his Holines had promis'd to himself: these false rumors distracted the Pope, who therupon made som difficulty to proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but Cardinall <hi>Perron</hi> solliciting him, and assuring him of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he deliver'd, according to his former resolution, the Commission to Cardinall <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> willing him to make hast to <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Spaniards being not able to crosse this resolution, made sute to have Card<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Cardinall <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> with the Commission receav'd from his Holines containing the conditions wheron the Censures were to be revok'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in nomber six, goes on his journey: The conditions were to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, 1. <q>That the two Churchmen prisoners, namely the Abbot of <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veze,</hi> and the Chanon of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> shold be freely given to the Pope. 2. That his Holines shold revoke his Censures, making a Declaration therof to the Colledge. 3. That the Venetian Signory shold within a while after send an Ambassage to the Pope: That the Venetian Duke by a Declaration shold certifie the Clergy under the <hi>State,</hi> that the first Declaration is revok'd: That the three Decrees mention'd in the Popes Inderdiction, and other Laws of the Signory shold continue in their full force and power, with this <hi>Proviso,</hi> That the Senat shall promise the French and Catholic King, not to execute them till the businesse be fully concluded 'twixt his Holines and the Signory, having first more amply inform'd the Pope of the justice and equity of those Laws: Lastly, that all Churchmen and Religious Orders which are banish'd and expuls'd from <hi>Venice,</hi> or the Jurisdiction therof, by reason of these troubles, may return home to their houses and Convents; but concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the return of the Jesuits, his Holines is contented to defer it, till an Ambassador from the Signory hath treated particularly with him concerning that point, certifying him, that their expulsion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from certain causes and reasons which have no community with the Interdiction, and if it shall be found otherwise, then to admit their restauration, as well as of other Ecclesiastiques.</q> Now Cardinall <hi>Ioyeuse</hi> departed from <hi>Rome</hi> with his Commission, and the Articles afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayed and arriv'd at <hi>Venice,</hi> wher he was extraordinarily entertain'd, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Senators going to meet him in the Bucentaure; the next day one of the States Secretaries accompanied with the Captain and other Officers of the Prison were sent to him; and for the greater solemnity, with a
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:49798:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
public Notary, brought the two prisoners to the House of <hi>Monsieur du Fresne</hi> Ambassador for the French King at <hi>Venice,</hi> and deliver'd them unto him, as granted to the Pope at the instance of the King his Master, without prejudice to the States Jurisdiction in such cases, and the French Ambassadour did presently consign them to the hands of Cardinall <hi>Ioyeuse,</hi> who was in the same House in the presence of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, with these words, <hi>These are the prisoners which the Signory hath granted to his Holines,</hi> not adding at whose entreaty, and so the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall receav'd them as his proper prisoners, wherunto the Secretary at that time made no reply; In this manner, by this omission on the one part, and silence on the other, it seemed that som did not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what remain'd betwixt the Pope and the Signory.</p>
                  <p>The next morning the Cardinall came to the Colledge, and after som circumstances of the Popes Fatherly goodnesse, he assur'd them that the Censures were revok'd; so having given them his Benediction, he went to celebrat the Masse in the Patriarks Church; the Dukes first Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was revok'd also in this manner.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Ther happen'd a little difference betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> the V. and the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic of <hi>Luca</hi> at this time, who in regard that many of her Citizens ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving chang'd their Rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:49798:79"/>Ther happen'd about this time another clash 'twixt him and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of <hi>Genoa,</hi> who being inform'd that the Governors of certain lay-Fraternities, instituted by devotion, had not dispens'd the revenu with requisit fidelity, She resolv'd to examin their accounts, to which effects the books were commanded to be brought before the Duke; but this was not well accepted by <hi>Paul</hi> the V. therfore he gave the Republic of <hi>Genoa</hi> to understand, that these proceedings were against the Liberty Ecclesiastical, So he expresly enjoyn'd them to revoke their Edicts, otherwise he wold proceed to the Censure of Excommunication: both these States complied with the Pope, but the State of <hi>Venice</hi> was more stiff-neck'd, and constant in the maintenance of her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</p>
               <p>The first cloud of discontent 'twixt this Pope and the <hi>Venetians</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peard, when he having solicited the Republic for a contribution of summs of money to aid the Emperor in the warrs of <hi>Hungary</hi> against the Turk, he receav'd from her a complementall deniall: He afterwards propos'd the revocation of an Ordinance made by the Senat a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, forbidding the Subjects of the Signory to set forth any Vessells by Sea, or to make any assurances or Companies for the traffic of any Merchandize whatsoever, to be exported out of the State of <hi>Venice</hi> into any other Countreys, unlesse it pass'd first by <hi>Venice,</hi> alledging that this wold hinder the Commerce in the State of the Church and was against the Ecclesiasticall Liberty.</p>
               <p>The Republic answer'd herunto, <hi>That ev'ry Prince commands his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, in that which may serve for the commodity of his own Estate, without considering what may follow therupon to neighbour Princes, who cannot just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be therwith offended, howsoever they may be in some sort incommoded;</hi> therfore whensoever his Holines shall command his Subjects any thing which may turn to the profit of his Government, the State wold not take it in ill part, nor esteem it against their Liberty.</p>
               <p>The Pope perceaving by this Essay that he could not compasse his ends, these differences being not within the bounds of things spirituall, and finding that his desires were so little prevalent with the Venetian, thought to be quit with him som other way, and an opportunity was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd a little after; touching one <hi>Scipio Sarraceno</hi> Canon of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the complaint of a young gentlewoman his cosen, whose doore and ring therof (which is a common kind of revenge in <hi>Italy</hi>) he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smear'd with excrements, and don her som other wrongs; she herupon complain'd to the Senat, who therupon cited and imprison'd the <hi>Canon;</hi> complaints herof being made to the Pope, the Republic answer'd, <hi>That the just Title and Authority which She hath to judge Ecclesiasticall persons in causes criminall, were founded on the power of a naturall Prince, and on cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, never interrupted by the space of a thousand years and upwards, which hath bin approv'd of by the Popes Breve's themselfs, yet extant in the public Archives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being deliver'd by the Venetian Ambassador to Pope <hi>Paul,</hi> he receav'd it with som impatience, saying, <hi>That the reasons alledg'd were frivolous, that to judge of an affair, it was to no purpose to ground it upon</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:49798:80"/>
                  <hi>custom, which is often so much the worse as it is ancient; and for the</hi> Breve's, <hi>ther were no other Archive of the Papall</hi> Breve's <hi>but at</hi> Rome; <hi>that those which they pretended for their justification were but wast papers, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this occasion ther was superadded another, which was the impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Count <hi>Brandolin Valdemanno</hi> Abbot of <hi>Nervese,</hi> as was formerly mention'd; the Pope sent Order, that both the sayed <hi>Count</hi> &amp; <hi>Canon</hi> shold be releas'd, but the Senat pass'd it over with a complement; the Pope also excepted at that Decree in <hi>Venice,</hi> 
                  <q>That none shold erect either Church or Chappell without the permission of the Senat; He adjoyn'd further, that the Republic retain'd in her hands five hundred thousand Crowns of Ecclesiasticall Legacies</q>; charging, that in all these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars she shold give him satisfaction; answer was made, <q>That God had not given to Popes any greater Authority in the Government of their Estates, then to other Princes, who by the Law of Nature have all power which is necessary, and as it appertain'd not to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians to govern the State of the Church, no more doth it belong to Ecclesiastics to govern the State of <hi>Venice;</hi> and wheras it was alledg'd, that the Republic had reserv'd such a portion of Legacies Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, it was a meer suggestion, and if his Holines wold give credit to ev'ry such calumny, differences wold grow infinit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Pope stayed, saying, that touching the Legacies he wold say no more; but he wold reduce all the differences to three heads, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>To the Decree touching building of Churches.</hi> 2. <hi>To another Decree a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the aliening of Laymens possessions to Ecclesiastics.</hi> 3. <hi>To the wrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment of the Canon and the Abbot aforesayed.</hi> In all these he expected to be obey'd, otherwise he wold <hi>apply such remedies as the nature of things requir'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Genoa</hi> publish'd a <hi>Manifesto,</hi> by revoking a Decree which the Pope had excepted against<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he made use herof for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to make the Venetians conformable to his will, using these words, <hi>Sequimini paenitentes,</hi> follow the penitent; answer was made, <q>That ther was not the same reason for the Republic of <hi>Venice,</hi> seeing she had not seven Cardinalls her Citizens, as <hi>Genoa</hi> had, to mediat for her upon all occasions with his Holines; That the Decrees of the Senat were the main Pillars of the Republic; That they were well known to his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, who, before their Election to the Papacy had lived at <hi>Venice</hi> in quality either of Confessors, Inquisitors or Nuntio's, and that after their promotion they never question'd them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This gave no satisfaction at all to the Pope, therfore he sayed he wold send a <hi>Breve</hi> hortatory to the Republic, concerning the three points before mention'd, and if he were not obey'd by such a time, he wold proceed further; for he must not suffer the Authority of the Church to decline, but according to his Office, he wold vindicat and uphold it to his utmost, and <hi>to which end he had Legions of Angells for his aid, and assistance, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herupon he seal'd and sent two <hi>Breves</hi> a little after to his <hi>Nuntio</hi> in <hi>Venice,</hi> with charge to present them accordingly; they were address'd <hi>Marino Grimani Duci, &amp; Reipublicae Venetorum.</hi> After this he call'd a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49798:80"/>
Consistory, wherin he declar'd how the State of <hi>Venice</hi> had violated the Ecclesiasticall Liberty, by publishing two Laws prejudiciall therun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and by detaining in prison two persons of the Church, &amp;c. The Cardinalls were very sparing to deliver their Opinions herin, and when it came to <hi>Bellarmin</hi> to speak, he sayed, <hi>That his Holines shold rather think on the residence of Prelats in their Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Venetian Senat thought good to send an Ambassador expressely for this purpose; and to shew their high respects to the Apostolic See, they made choice of the Lord <hi>Leonardo Donato</hi> an ancient Senator of the wide Sleeve, who was afterwards Duke.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Nuntio</hi> in Venice having receav'd the <hi>Breves</hi> but the next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Embassador extraordinary stayed the presentation therof, and sent advice by an expresse of the choice of the sayed Ambassador; the Pope was not well pleas'd when he heard of this, that the <hi>Nuntio</hi> shold presume to interpose his own judgment after his Ordinance; therfore he dispatch'd unto <hi>Venice</hi> an expresse Courier with a <hi>mandamus</hi> to the <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> to present the sayed <hi>Breves</hi> immediatly after the receit of his Letter, &amp; that this might be conceal'd from the ordinary Ambassador of <hi>Venice,</hi> then resident at <hi>Rome,</hi> he caus'd the Courier to go out in a Coach without boots, and so take horse at the second Stage. The <hi>Nuntio</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceav'd this command on Christmas Eve, that he might punctually obey his Holines, did present that solemn high Festivall day the sayed <hi>Breves</hi> unto the Senators assembled to assist at a solemn Masse, in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Duke <hi>Grimani,</hi> who was then strugling with the pangs of death, and expir'd the morning after, so that the <hi>Breves</hi> were not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd till the creation of a new Duke.</p>
               <p>The Pope having advice herof, writ to his <hi>Nuntio</hi> to make a protest unto the Senat, and enjoyn them not to passe to a new Election, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it wold prove void, being made by men excommunicated; the <hi>Nuntio</hi> pressing for Audience herupon, was delayed, in regard it hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bin the custom of the Signory to treat of no businesse of State du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Vacancy.</p>
               <p>Duke <hi>Grimani</hi> being buried, they fell to ballotation for another, nor according to the Constitutions of the Republic, can they fall to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of another, till the former Duke be under ground; so it fell to the lot of LEONARDO DONATO to be chosen: all Ambassadors went to congratulat the new Prince except the <hi>Nuntio;</hi> yet did the Prince write unto the Pope as the custom is, to give him advice of his Election.</p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Paul</hi> herupon, though it was beyond the expectation of divers, did receave this Letter from the new Doge by the hands of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Venetian Ambassador then sojourning at <hi>Rome,</hi> and return'd a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulatory Amswer therof, revoking the Order formerly sent to the <hi>Nuntio</hi> of presenting himself to the Duke.</p>
               <p>The first affair that was agitated in the Senat after this new Election was this difference with the Pope, and <hi>Pietro Duodo</hi> Knight, was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Ambassador for <hi>Rome</hi> instead of <hi>Donato;</hi> The <hi>Breves</hi> were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, and they were both of the same substance, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was com to his knowing, how the Republic in former years had determin'd
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49798:81"/>
in her Councells many things contrary to Ecclesiastic Liberty, and to the Canons, Councells, and Constitutions Pontificall; <q>but among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that in the year 1603. she had in the <hi>Decemvirat,</hi> having regard to certain Laws of their Ancestors, who had forbidden to erect Churches or other places without permission, instead of nulling the old Ordinances touching this matter, she had reviv'd the same, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Statute which only concern'd the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> to all other places of their Dominions under great penalties, as if Churches and persons Ecclesiasticall were in any sort subject to the secular Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or he who foundeth a Church were worthy of so rude a chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if he had committed som great Crime; moreover, that in the moneth of <hi>May</hi> last, the Senat having regard to another Law made in the year 1536. wherby was prohibited the perpetuall alienation of Lay-mens possessions within the City and Signory of <hi>Venice</hi> to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall persons, without permission of the Senat under certain penalties, instead of revoking that Law, as their duty requir'd, they had renew'd it, and extended the penalty to all their Dominions, as if it were lawfull for temporal Princes to ordain any thing for the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of any Jurisdiction, or to dispose in any sort without the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astics, and particularly of the Pope, of the goods of the Church, spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of such goods as have bin given to the Church, of persons spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and other places of devotion granted by the faithfull for remedy of their sins, and discharge of their consciences: That these Ordinances tending to the damnation of souls, to public scandalls, and also contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Ecclesiasticall Liberty, were of themselfs void and of no vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, as furthermore he declar'd them to be such, no man being oblig'd to observe them; on the contrary, that they who had made the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, or any like, or they who had further'd them, had incurr'd the Churches Censures, and depriv'd themselfs of all such possessions as they held of the Church, as also their estates and demains were subject to other penalties, in such sort, that they could not be absolv'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they revok'd all such Laws, and re-establish'd all things in their former estate: That therupon being plac'd in the Soveraign Throne, and not being able to dissemble or indure these things, he admonish'd the Republic to consider well the danger wherinto they had cast their souls upon this occasion</q>, and to seek remedy betimes, otherwise in case of contumacy he commanded under pain of Excommunication <hi>latae sententiae,</hi> that the afore sayed Lawes ancient and modern shold be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated; That this Monitory shold be publish'd in all places throughout the Republic, expecting from them an account herof, if not, upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice had from his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> he wold proceed to execution of the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and to such other remedies that were meet, remembring the recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that he was to give to God at the day of Judgment, and that he could not in duty dissemble when the Authority of the See Apostolic was diminish'd, Ecclesiasticall Liberty trod under foot, the Holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons neglected, the right of the Church and Clergy violated; Of all which the charge lay upon him, affirming that he was not induc'd here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto for any worldly consideration, for he desir'd nothing els but the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49798:81"/>
glory to acquit himself of his Apostolicall function; and as he intended not to usurp anything upon the secular Authority, so he wold not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Ecclesiastic shold be diminish'd; he concluded, that if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public wold conform, they wold deliver him from much pain which he endur'd in their behalf, and they might still retain the Lands which they held of the Church: That the best means wherby she might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the incommodities that might fall upon her from Infidells, were to conserve the Church-men in their rights, who watch in perpetuall pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to God for her conservation.</p>
               <p>The Senat with much maturity ponder'd these <hi>Breves,</hi> and therupon sent to confer with their learnedst Counsellors in the Civill Lawes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom they admitted <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> of the Order of the <hi>Servites,</hi> an eminent Divine and Canonist, with other <hi>Padouan</hi> Doctors, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult what answer they shold return the Pope. </p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Republic also sent to consult other Doctors, themost renowned of <hi>Europe</hi> for sound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. of <hi>England,</hi> had don touching the legality of a divorce with <hi>Katherine</hi> of <hi>Aragon.</hi> Having receav'd the judgments of the learnedst men in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> specially of <hi>Giacomo Monochio</hi> President of <hi>Milan,</hi> a man much cried up in those daies for learning, the Senat fram'd the Answer to the Popes Monitory, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p>That with much grief and wonder they understood by the Letters of his Holines, that their Laws observ'd carefully through so many Ages, and never question'd by any of his Predecessors, the revokement wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wold shake the very Foundations of the Republic, were reprehended as contrary to the See Apostolic, and that they which made them (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bin persons eminent for merit, and well deserving of that See, who are now in heaven) were noted for Violaters of Ecclesiastic Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; that according to the admonition of his Holines, they had exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with much exactnesse their Laws Old and New, but had not found anything which a Soveraign Prince might not have well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd without any just offence to the Popes Authority, it being a thing evidently belonging to a secular Prince, to have regard what Companies are erected in h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>s Dominions; as also to prevent the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of such Edifices as in time to com might be hurtfull to the public safety; and though their State abounds with Churches, and places of piety as much as any other, yet when they saw it convenient, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver refus'd to permit new Foundations themselfs contributing libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally therunto. That in the Law against perpetuall alienation of lay goods unto Ecclesiastics, the question being of things purely tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, they could not be tax'd to have don any thing contrary to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons or Decrees; That if the Popes have power to forbid the Clergy to alienat any goods of the Church unto persons secular without leave, Princes may do the same, and take Order that the goods of seculars shall not be alienated to the Clergy without permission; nor do the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastics lose any thing bequeath'd unto them herby, seeing they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave a price answerable in value, to the immoveable adjoyning; that it tends to the great prejudice, not only of the temporall State, but also
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49798:82"/>
of the spirituall to weaken the Forces of the Republic, which by such alienations is depriv'd of necessary services, and which in effect is a vangard or fortresse for all Christendom against Infidels: That for these reasons the Senat could not perswade themselfs to have incurr'd any Censures, since secular Princes have by Divine Law, from which no human Law may derogat, a power to establish Laws in things tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; as also that the admonitions of his Holines have here no place, wher the question is not of any thing spirituall, or any way trenching upon the Pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </q>
               <p>This was the substance of the Senat's Answer, remitting themselfs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their Ambassador extraordinary.</p>
               <p>Ther happen'd a businesse in <hi>Savoy</hi> about this time, which might have scatr'd the Venetian, being much of the same nature; for Pope <hi>Paul</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having notice that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had commanded the Bishop of <hi>Fossano</hi> to depart out of his Dominions, the Pope being incens'd therat, did so menace the Duke with Excommunication, that he revok'd his Commandement.</p>
               <p>The Senats Letter being deliver'd to the Pope by <hi>Nani</hi> the Venetian Ambassador in ordinary, to prepare the way for <hi>Duodo</hi> the Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; he sayed, being a little transported, <q>that <hi>Monitory Breve's</hi> must not be answer'd by Letter, and that the Answers of the Senat were frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; He added that lately he had heard of another Law touching goods Ecclesiastic holden as <hi>Emphyteutike,</hi> which was fit to be revok'd with the other, and although he had not till then made any mention of it, yet he had more to say against it then any other, therfore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd them to obey him, because the cause was Gods, <hi>Et portae Inferi non praevalebunt contra eam;</hi> and if they wold not revoke the sayed Lawes, they were Tyrants, and degenerating from their Ancestors, &amp;c.</q>

               <p>A little after he sent another <hi>Breve</hi> to be deliver'd the Duke, for the release of the Canon and the Abbot under pain of Excommunication, <hi>latae sententiae,</hi> which he commanded shold be deliver'd into the hands of his <hi>Nuntio,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Senat consulted the Doctors again about this <hi>Breve,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon after some Eventilations of the matters, this Answer was sent:</p>
               <q>That the <hi>Breve</hi> of his Holines was read with much reverence, and no lesse regret, as perceaving therby that matters tended to encrease dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, that his Holines went about to destroy the Laws of their Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, which so many Ages had bin kept entire; to deliver up the Canon and Abbot, was nothing els but to demand that they shold despoile themselfs of their just power to chastise crimes and wickednes, which power they had enjoy'd with the approbation of his Predecessors, from the Originall of the Republic: that God the Founder of all States had bestow'd this power upon them from the beginning, and that they did derive it from their Progenitors, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duodo</hi> the Extraordinary Ambassador made no great hast to <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:49798:82"/>
wherat the Pope receav'd offence; being arriv'd ther at last, he was not suffer'd to passe his first Audience with complement as the custom is, but the Pope wish'd him to fall to the businesse presently; so he deliver'd with much gravity and pressing elocution the reasons that mov'd the Republic not to revoke those Laws, and to detain the persons of the sayed Churchmen.</p>
               <p>The Pope answer'd with som heat, that the exemption of the Clergy was <hi>Iure Divino;</hi> he sayed, that he wold not meddle with things temporall, but their three aforssayed Laws were Usurpations.</p>
               <p>As the Pope had formerly acquainted most Princes with these tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses 'twixt him and <hi>Venice</hi> in a complaining way, so the Senat sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Republics Ambassadors abroad, that they shold truly inform those Princes in whose Courts they resided, of the truth of things; In <hi>Venice</hi> ther were at that time Ambassadors from the Emperour, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> to whom the businesse was communicated by some of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators; The Imperiall Ambassador sayed, <hi>That his Master desired peace, and that in such matters he wold not foment the will of the Pope.</hi> The Count of <hi>Santa Cruz</hi> who was for <hi>Spain, approv'd of the reasons already alledg'd in</hi> Rome <hi>for the Republic; Mons du Fresne</hi> the French Ambassador an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd, <hi>That he knew not what to make of those pontificall Laws, whereby Princes are restrain'd to govern their Subjects, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Pope <hi>Paul</hi> was still eager in the businesse, telling the Venetian Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador that ther were none in the Senat that understood rightly the case, which made them have recourse to Doctors, but that he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to such persons as were able to set their Doctors at School, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he wold proceed with his spirituall Arms in this matter, but touching other things, he wold still account of the Venetians, as of his children.</p>
               <p>Herupon a Consistory was call'd, and most of the Cardinalls ran bias with the Pope, except the Cardinalls of <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Vicenza,</hi> who were more moderat; examples against <hi>Hen.</hi> II. King of <hi>England,</hi> the King of <hi>Castile,</hi> and against the Kings <hi>Charles,</hi> II. IV. were produc'd, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent the spirituall Censures in like cases; so he resolv'd upon an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdiction, yet he wold give the Senat twenty four daies of longer time to consider herof, wherunto the Cardinalls gave their suffrages, but a Libell was cast up and down the streets of <hi>Venice,</hi> that the Consistory herin was brought to <hi>assentari,</hi> not <hi>assentiri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little while after the <hi>Interdict</hi> was affix'd in the accustomed places of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and scatter'd ev'ry wher, som in <hi>Latin,</hi> som in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> wherin after recapitulation of those Decrees in <hi>Venice,</hi> and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment of the foresayed Church-men, </p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Pope declar'd that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of ten of his Predecessors, with the Councell and consent of the Cardinalls, after mature deliberation, though the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sayed Decrees of the Senat were of themselfs void, and of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, neverthelesse he now declar'd them to be such; therfore he did excommunicat, declare and pronounce for excommunicated, as if they had bin particularly nam'd, the Duke and Senat of <hi>Venice</hi> which then were, and which shold be herafter together with all their favourers,

                  </p>
                  <p>That from this Excommunication they could not be absolv'd but by the Pope, except it were upon the point of death, in which case if any one receav'd absolution and shold afterwards recover health, he shold fall again within this Excommunication, if he did not as far as in him lay obey this his commandment; that untill they had obey'd, he forbad any one to be buried in holy place; and if after the sayed twenty four daies, the Duke and Senat shold continue in their obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, he put all their State under the <hi>Interdict,</hi> in such sort, that none shold celebrat <hi>Masse</hi> or Divine Service; he depriv'd the Duke and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat likewise of all their goods which they held of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or of other Churches, as also of all their Priviledges and indults ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by it, and specially of that Priviledge inabling them to proceed against Clerks in certain cases, reserving to himself and his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors a power to aggravat and re-aggravat this Censure against them and their adherents, &amp;c.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The public Ministers of State who were than resident at <hi>Rome,</hi> made instances to the Pope to retard a while this Interdict: the Marquis of <hi>Chastillon</hi> who was for the Emperor, <hi>D' Alincourt</hi> who was for the French King, The Count of <hi>Verriie</hi> who was for <hi>Savoy,</hi> but his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes was inflexible, saying, <hi>he wold bring the offendors to obey;</hi> wherupon the Savoy Ambassador replied, that the word <hi>obey</hi> was too harsh to be us'd towards a Soveraign Prince; yet after the publication of the sayed <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdict,</hi> the sayed Ambassadors gave a solemn visit to the Venetian Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, and communicated unto them what they had don with the Pope in the transaction of affairs.</p>
               <p>The publication of this <hi>Interdict</hi> being flown to <hi>Venice,</hi> it was order'd by the <hi>Senat,</hi> that ev'ry one shold have recours to his prayers; it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd upon to recall the Ambassador Extraordinary from <hi>Rome,</hi> to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie the resentment they had of the wrong, but to leave the Leger Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador ther still, to prevent an absolut rupture; It was also determin'd to write to <hi>Gregorio Iustiniano</hi> then Ambassador in England, that he shold inform the King herof: Sir <hi>Henry Wootton</hi> Ambassador at that time in <hi>Venice,</hi> complain'd that the Senat had communicated these things to other Forren Ministers before him, but for the pretensions of the Pope, he sayed, <hi>he could not understand that Roman Theology, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ther was public command given to all Prelats and Ecclesiasticall persons, that they shold not publish, or cause and suffer to be publish'd or affix'd in any place whatsoever, any <hi>Bulls, Monitories, Breves,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writings which shold be sent unto them from <hi>Rome:</hi> furthermore Proclamation was made under pain of incurring the displeasure of the Prince, that whosoever had any copy of a certain <hi>Breve</hi> divulg'd at <hi>Rome</hi> touching the Republic, he shold bring it to the Magistrats at <hi>Venice,</hi>

or to Governers of Castles and other Officers of the State.</p>
               <p>Hereupon all peeple did so cheerfully obey this command, that 'twas a marvailous thing to see how many had bin imprinted and scatter'd; neither was any one of them affix'd in any place, by reason of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diligence of the peeple.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Duodo</hi> the Ambassador Extraordinary at <hi>Rome,</hi> having receav'd order for his revocation, went to take his leave of <hi>Pope Paul,</hi> telling him, that since his Holines wold not take into consideration the reasons by him represented, and having no more to say or act, he was recall'd: the Pope answer'd with more mildnesse than ordinary, <q>That touching the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, he had don nothing but what his conscience and duty oblig'd him to do, that the case was cleer and decided, that in the whole order of his proceedings he had follow'd the example of his Predecessors, that his weapons in this quarrell were spirituall, the use wherof accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded well with that fatherly love which he had ever born to the Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, requiring only such obedience as the greatest Princes render him.</q>

The sayed <hi>Nuntio</hi> came som daies after to the Senat, wher first shewing a resentment of what had pass'd, he sayed that they ought not to proceed towards his Holines with such a repugnance, that the Pope was mov'd by pure zeal, and that yet, if they yeelded a little, all things might be accommoded; to which effect he desir'd that his <hi>Serenity</hi> wold think upon a tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that for his part he was not most ready to present and favour it.</p>
               <p>The Duke answer'd that none of sound understanding could approve that a Republic so pious and Catholic shold be vex'd in such a fashion, and that the actions of the Pope could not be justified; that he had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd a Monitory which ev'ry one held injust without scruple, that he fell upon so weighty a resolution, without weighing before hand how the world is govern'd; that his Holines could not have don an act more perillous to cast the Apostolic See upon the censure and hatred of all peeple, and into a manifest danger, that if the Republic shold think upon a separation, it wold be follow'd with an irreparable losse; but though the Republic wold not depart from her piety, yet wold she defend her self; that for his particular (meaning the <hi>Nuntio</hi>) he did well to perswade peace, but he shold turn his speech to the Pope who troubled it. Eight daies after the <hi>Nuntio</hi> had Audience again, wherin speaking much of the Popes prudence, he shew'd a displeasure, that he saw no appearance of a temperament, concluding, <hi>That the Senat shold take heed, lest while they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd to support a particular Law, they might draw on themselfs universall ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine;</hi> wherunto the Duke answer'd, <hi>That he ought not to speak of prudence in the Pope, who had us'd so much precipitation, and that he shold do well to set before his eyes the imminent danger which may follow herupon, and tell him that these Councells came from a man old in affairs of State, as well as years.</hi>

                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:49798:84"/>The Pope hearing of the Proclamation against his Monitory, &amp; how the pulse of the Venetians did beat, who shew'd themselfs so obedient to the Senat, and so forward to uphold their liberty, he thought his <hi>Nuntio</hi> could not stay in <hi>Venice</hi> any longer with his honor; therfore he sent him Letters of revocation, and dismis'd from Rome <hi>Nani</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiques Ambassador, charging him expresly not to leave behind him any of his company: yet he desir'd to see him before he went provided, if he came unto him in quality of a privat man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Nani</hi> made answer, <hi>that he could not tell how to separat from his person the title of Ambassador;</hi> so he left <hi>Rome,</hi> being well accompanied out of Town with Roman Barons and gentlemen, but with few Prelats<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The next morning, the Pope sent after him a Colonell to accompany him throughout the State of the <hi>Church,</hi> who o'retook him at <hi>Gorligno.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Venice</hi> the Duke had caus'd a Manifesto to be publish'd and affix'd at ev'ry door, <hi>That wheras he had receav'd advice of a publication made at</hi> Rome <hi>of a certain</hi> Breve <hi>fulminated against the Senat and Signory, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oblig'd to have a care of the public tranquillity, and of the Authority of a Soveraign Prince, did protest before God and all the world, that he had not omitted any means possible to make the Pope capable of the most clear and strong reasons that were produc'd in behalf of the Republic, but having found his ears shut, and seen the</hi> Breve <hi>publish'd against reason and justice, against the Doctrines of Holy Scriptures, of the Fathers, and Canons in prejudice of the secular Authority given by God, and of the liberty of the State, with the trouble of the repose of his Subjects, and to the great scandall of all the world, he did pronounce that</hi> Breve <hi>not only injust, but meerly void and null, and so unlawfull, that he need not repute it needfull to have recours to such remedies, as in other occasions the Republic, and many Soveraign Princes have us'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such Popes as out-pass'd their power, exhorting and injoying that the Prelats continu in their accustomed cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>Upon this <hi>Interdict,</hi> the only Ecclesiastics that went out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, were the <hi>Iesuits</hi> and <hi>Capuchines,</hi> wherof the first was banish'd, the other dismiss'd, the rest did still officiat, alledging, that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence 'twixt the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Signory was not touching any point of the Catholic Faith.</p>
               <p>But at <hi>Rome</hi> her self it was expected that the sayed Interdict wold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce three effects: 1. That the Religious wold al depart: 2. That the Cities and peeple seeing themselfs depriv'd of <hi>Church</hi> Offices wold raise a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and so force the Senat to give the Pope satisfaction: 3. That the Nobility upon this occasion might be disordered, terrified, and divided among themselfs, but none of all these three effects hapned; for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat was greatly united in their resolutions, the City of <hi>Venice</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon peeple kept themselfs in wonderfull obedience: and this so generall a calm did not only proceed from the voluntary conformablenes of the peeple, but also from the providence of the Senat, and diligence of the Magistrat, who provided for all accidents; Besides, this great affair was
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:49798:84"/>
conducted with so much prudence and dexterity, that no bloud of any man was shed for contempt or mutiny, which made the world to stand at a gaze, that so great a Body and Government shold be kept npright without any violence, execution, or the least shock given; notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ther were many under practises us'd afterwards.</p>
               <p>The Jesuits in ev'ry place wher they had taken footing, did put all i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons in the fire, and fell a beating them to brand the Republic of <hi>Venice,</hi> insomuch that her Ambassadors receav'd affronts in som places, as in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Prague,</hi> but it was by privat persons, for which they had satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from the Emperour, and the King of <hi>Poland;</hi> for the Signory was not so carelesse, but she sent a punctuall account of all these tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses 'twixt the Pope and Her; <hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> was also displeas'd with Her, because both they had bin succumbent to the Popes Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures before, and submitted.</p>
               <p>Among other Princes, <hi>Iustiniano</hi> the Venetian Ambassador residing then in <hi>London,</hi> had command to acquaint the King of <hi>England</hi> with his <hi>Contrasto</hi> 'twixt the Pope and the Senat. King <hi>Iames</hi> after he had very attentively heard the relation of the Ambassador, shew'd how well he accepted that esteem, and highly commended the Laws of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, adding, that he long'd to see the whole Church of God reform'd, to which end, he much desir'd a free Councell to determine so many controversies, which have no other cause but the usurpations of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Bishops, in which desire, he thought the King of <hi>France</hi> and other Princes wold joyn with him; that perhaps God meant to produce this happines out of these troubles of the Signory; that he had sent word therof to Pope <hi>Clement,</hi> then when he was mov'd by him, the first time he came to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> to unite himself to the Roman Church, but he wold not hear any thing of a Councell; that this union was much to be desired, but clearly ther was no other means to effect it then by a Generall Councell; he added moreover, that that ruine of the Church proceeded from this, that the Popes esteem'd themselfs as Gods, and were so corrupted by flattery, that 'twas no marvail they could give no ear to any reason, and if they proceeded oftentimes with such precipitation.</p>
               <p>The separated States of <hi>Holland</hi> writ letters full of of affection unto the Republie upon this occasion, offring Her a supply of Arms, Ships, and Victualls, if the case requir'd, with any other good office of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
               <p>All Christian Princes were sensible of this rupture 'twixt the Pope and the Republic, specially the Roman Catholikes, in whose Courts the Venetian Ambassadors did refrain for a while, to go with the rest into their Chappells after the accustomed manner.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> did appear more against the Republic then any other, not treating her Ambassador as formerly, though he took hold of another occasion, because She had written to his children by the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Excellency</hi> not of <hi>Highnesse.</hi>

               <p>The Senat took this as a very high respect, and sayed, that the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic who us'd to be accounted the Right Hand of <hi>Rome,</hi> wold do nothing unworthy of her self; and it was just, that he who had first offended shold repair the offence; therfore it was fitting that the Pope shold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his Censures, and so open the way to a Treaty; for no wound can heal, till the inflammation be taken away.</p>
               <p>While this difference lasted 'twixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> a certain writing was affix'd at <hi>Vicenza,</hi> and other places, wherin the Republic was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to shake off the Popes Yoke, calling him <hi>Antichrist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> in these doubtfull traverses of things, writ a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter full of terms of reverence and complement unto the Pope, that if need were, he wold joyn his temporall Arms to maintain the spirituall Arms of the <hi>Church;</hi> to which purpose, he had written both to his Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> and Governor of <hi>Milan:</hi> upon the receit of this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ther were Bonfires made at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the flames of the fire flew upon the wings of fame all Christendome over, which gave the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic such an alarm, that She began by Land and Sea to arm apace; She was offer'd assistance if need were from som of the Greek Christians, that were subjects to the Turk, as also from the reformed Churches of <hi>France,</hi> but she wav'd both; but it was thought that this Letter of the Spanish King, wherin he promis'd warlike succours to the Pope, was not a thing really meant, but only to terrifie the Republic, and bring her the sooner to an agreement; which appear'd, in regard he had sent expresse commands to <hi>Don Innigo de Cardenas</hi> his Ambassador, residing in <hi>Venice,</hi> to propound som Overtures of Treaty: wherupon he propos'd to the Duke and the Senat, <hi>That his Catholic Majesty affecting the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of peace, desir'd that the disgusts 'twixt his Holines and the Republic might cease, to which end he had commanded all his Ministers to co-operat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and particularly had commanded him to pray the Senat according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke much extolling the good inclinations of the Catholic King, answer'd, <hi>That the Republic could not do more then what they had done already, that it was more proper to begin with him who had bin the cause of all these broils, that it was not for them to open the way which had bin stopped up by others; that the Pope by dismissing their Ambassador, and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his</hi> Nuntio, <hi>had broken off all means of Treaty, which could not be set</hi>

               <q>The Duke rejoyn'd, that it was necessary to remove the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that this shold be don by this means or that, by the free-will of the Pope, or at the instance of another, it little imported for the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the thing, and that his Majesty might do what pleas'd him.</q>
               <p>The Ambassador answer'd, <q>Your Serenity may well be content that the Pope be entreated by your Name; the Duke sayed, That for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of <hi>Italy,</hi> if the Catholic King were certain that the Pope being thus mov'd wold do the thing, he wold not hold it any inconvenience to be so contented; He sayed further, that neither himself nor the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat had given any occasion of disgust to the Pope, if he had taken any of himself they could not help it, that in voluntary discontents ther is no other remedy then a voluntary acknowledgement</q>, besides he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd him to consider, that the King his Masters Interest, and of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Princes besides, was involv'd in the cause of the Republic.</p>
               <p>The French Ambassador <hi>du Fresne</hi> being then also in the Senat, sayed, <q>That the Pope could not be induc'd to revoke the Censures, unlesse ther were som assurance given what the Republic wold do in point of correspondence, that it was needfull for her in some sort to submit, for no temporall Prince could be disparag'd to yeeld unto his Holines, it being a <hi>jus commune</hi> to humble ones self to the Soveraign Bishop.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke answer'd, <q>That it was necessary to apply the remedy to the part whence the evill proceeded, therfore since his Christian Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty desir'd a pacification, it was meet that he shold make his addresse to the Pope, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>While these Traverses happen'd at <hi>Venice,</hi> the Pope by the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant advice of som Cardinalls, and relying much upon the foresayed Letter which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had written unto him, made a shew of arming, wherunto the <hi>Conte de Fuentes</hi> Governor of <hi>Milan</hi> was very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, therfore it did not stand with the prudence of the Republic to be idle. Herupon She sent to Her Ambassadors abroad to acquaint the Princes, wherwith they resided, to inform them accordingly; She im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted the businesse likewise to those Ambassadors that lay at <hi>Venice,</hi> and among the rest to the English, who having thank'd the Senat for this communication of affairs, <q>He prayed their generosity and resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to defend their honor, assuring them, that upon so important occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, they shold have from his King all furtherance and aid, as well in good offices, as in <hi>arms and succours:</hi> he sayed further, That he had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular commandement from the King his Master, to oblige him under the word of a King to a neer Union with the Signory, to assist Her with councell and forces, as also to labour that all his friends shold do the same, not for any base ends or privat interest, or to foment division,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:49798:86"/>
or com into concurrence and opposition with any other Prince, but specially for two reasons. First, for that acknowledging himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to God for infinit favours receav'd from him, he thought it his duty to defend his cause, that is, to conserve the power which his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty had establish'd upon earth: Secondly, in regard of that Bond of Amity which he renew'd with the Republic, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The main knot in the businesse was, whether upon a promise of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokement of the Ecclesiasticall Censures by the Pope, the Signory wold also promise an abrogation of the foresayed Decrees touching Church-Lands, which She could not be induc'd to do; but somthing shold be don if a Treaty were comenc'd, wherof the Senat was thought incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble while they lay under the sayed Censures.</p>
               <p>The French Ambassador a few daies after came to the Senat, where he made a long discours for an accord; <q>But he was advertis'd from <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Pope had receav'd som new offences from the Signory, for hindring Navigation into the places of the Church, and for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Ban against the Jesuits.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Wherunto the Senat made answer, that touching that point of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation it appertain'd to ev'ry good Government to provide that the State may be well furnish'd with things necessary for her self, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that they be not carried away to others; that in order to this, the Republic had stayed all Vessells at Sea, wherin ther were provisions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the State; wherupon if the State Ecclesiastic was in want, this was not their fault, but the order of human things so requir'd: Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Jesuits, it was alledg'd, that they were not banish'd, but rather were gone away of themselfs, as refusing to obey the Commandements sent unto them to continue Divine Service; but after their departure, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice of an infinit nomber of injuries, machinations and treasons contriv'd by them, the Senat ordain'd, as Justice requir'd, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more return.</p>
               <p>Whilst these things were in agitation, the Spaniards were like to have imbroil'd the Signory in a war with the Turk, in regard the Marquis of <hi>Santa Cruz</hi> with a Fleet of Napolitan and Sicilian Gallies had sack'd and burnt <hi>Durazzo,</hi> a Town of the Turks in <hi>Albany;</hi> som thought this was done of purpose to make the Turk fall upon the Venetian, and so impell him to make his addresse to the Spaniard for aid; therefore at <hi>Constantinople</hi> the Gran Visier perceaving well the Artifice of <hi>Spain</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and that the taking of <hi>Durazzo</hi> had bin attempted to no other end, then to set them at odds with the Signory; Letters were sent to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Aga</hi> the Admirall, that he shold still keep good union and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the Venetian Forces, to the domage of the Pope and the Spaniard.</p>
               <p>This year ther were divers Libells, Pasquills flew up and down in ev'ry corner of <hi>Italy,</hi> some in favour of <hi>Rome,</hi> som of <hi>Venice:</hi> ther were also many Books and Tractats came forth on both sides. The Doctrine of the Venetian Writers was, That God had establish'd two Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Earth, the one Spirituall, the other Temporall, each of them being Supreme, and independent one from the other: the one is the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:49798:86"/>
Church Regiment, the other the Civill; Of the first he gave charge to his Apostles and their Successors; Of the temporall, the charge is put in the hands of secular Princes, in such sort, that one may not intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with that which appertains to either: Therfore the Pope hath no power to abrogat the Laws of Princes in civill matters, nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of their estates, or free their Subjects from their alleageance which they owe unto them; That to depose Kings, is a new thing never attempted but within these five hundred years, it is against the Holy Scriptures, the examples of Christ and his Saints: That to teach, that in case of conscience 'twixt the Pope and a Prince, 'tis lawfull to poursue him with fraud and force, and that the Subjects therby do obtain remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins, is a Doctrine seditious and sacrilegious; That Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by Divine Law are not exempted from their secular power, neither in their persons or goods, whensoever his necessities constrain him to serve himself of them; that the Pope ought not to think himself infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, unlesse wher God hath promis'd him his Divine assistance, which must be understood only in the fundamentall points of Faith; that the Authority of binding and loosing ought to be understood with this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Clave non errante,</hi> seeing that God hath commanded the Pastor to follow the merit and justice of the cause, and not his own inclination; that when the Pope thunders out any Censures, it is for the Doctors to consider whether they have proceeded <hi>Clave errante aut non er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the new name of blind obedience, invented by <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> is a Psudodoxall tenet, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, the Doctrine of the Roman Writers or Papalines, as they term'd them, was, that the civill power of Princes is subordinat to the power Ecclesiastic, and subject unto it; therfore the Pope hath authority to deprive Princes of their estates and honors, for their faults and errors which they commit in Government; yea though they have committed no fault, when the Pope shall judge it fit for the common good of the <hi>Church;</hi> That the Pope may free Subjects from obedience, and from their <hi>Oath</hi> of Fidelity which they owe the temporall Prince, in which case they are to shake off all subjection, and even to poursue the Prince if the Pope command it; som of the modester sort held that this Authority did not reside in the Pope, because Christ gave him any temporall Authority, but because this was necessary for the spirituall Monarchy.</p>
               <p>Divers Tretises were imprinted and publish'd <hi>pro &amp; con</hi> 'twixt the Pope and the Republic to this effect, and <hi>Bellarmin</hi> was very busie in upholding S. <hi>Peters</hi> Chair, at last ther was a strict inhibition ther shold be no more writing on this point, so the Treaty began to advance, wherin the French Ambassador was very active, therefore he propos'd two things to the Senat.</p>
               <p>The first was, That the Duke and Senat wold suspend the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Laws, and the <hi>Protestation</hi> publish'd against the Monitory of the Pope, upon condition that his Holines wold do the like to his Censures for five moneths, during which time they might treat of the merit of the Laws that were question'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:49798:87"/>The second was, That the Ecclesiastic Prisoners might be rendred without prejudice to the cause of the Republic; That the Religious gon out of <hi>Venice</hi> by reason of the Interdict might return; he concluded that it was not the intention of his Christian Majesty that any thing shold be don against the Dignity and Justice of the Signory, and if either of these proposalls were to Her prejudice, he was content to let them passe in silence: He desir'd them further to consider, that it was necessary to give som apparent occasion to his Holines to induce him to a retractati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because it was never heard that a Pope had revok'd his Bulls, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Councell of <hi>Constance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Senat did fall to deliberat of things with more maturity then was usual; at last they resolv'd with one joynt consent to prefer the conserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Liberty before all other respects, together with the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Laws: But for yeelding up the prisoners in gratification to his Christian Majesty, they thought this did not trench much upon their Liberty, in regard it was a particular fact which drew not with it any consequence, that the like ought not to be don in time to come; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Senat answer'd the Ambassador, thanking his Majesty for his mediation, &amp; adjoyn'd, it was easie to perceave, wherat the designs of the Pope aim'd, who seeing that the Justice of the Republic, for the merit &amp; ground of the cause was known and confess'd by all, wold therfore find out som error in the form of proceeding, wherin the Justice of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public was so clear that it was manifest to all, and the errors of the Pope so grosse, that they could not be excus'd: wherfore it was not consenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous to reason, to correct the faults of another with their own detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and dishonor, They added further, that these proceedings of the Popes were of such pernicious consequence, that they might have hurl'd the whole Signory into flames of civil combustions.</p>
               <p>The Senat at last granted, that when the King shold be assured and have the firm word of the Pope that he wold totally take away the Censures, the two prisoners shold be render'd unto him, although they were guilty of foul Crimes; They wold also let fall their protestation, yet saving their public reasons, and their power to judge Ecclesiastics when it shold be expedient for the State; this was all the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador could wring from the Senat, wherof when the King was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd, he writ a Letter, wherin he thank'd them for their fair respects, in which Letter he took occasion to renew the memory of the favour they did him to co opt him into the body of their Nobility.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Don Innigo de Cardenas</hi> the Spanish Ambassador, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly sollicited the Senat for an accommodation, but he could hardly prevail as much as the other: In the <hi>interim</hi> ther was a new kind of Councell erected at <hi>Rome,</hi> cal'd <hi>la Congregation de Guerra,</hi> the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of War, which consisted of fifteen Cardinals, and this was don, to strike som apprehensions of fear into the Signory.</p>
               <p>The Senat inform'd the French and Spanish Ambassadors of this strange news from <hi>Rome,</hi> touching a Councel of War; they also impa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ed to the English Ambassador, telling him, that he might now publish the Declaration of the King his Master, and think upon the succours he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd.</p>

                     </gap>tton</hi> (then Ambassador) testified very much contentment to do this office, affirming that it was to publish the glory of his King; He pass'd further, and sayed, that ther were but three ways to compound this difference, <hi>either by yeelding, or referring the matter to Princes, or by Warr:</hi> he saw well the Signory had no mind to the first, and if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to make a reference to any, they could not make choice of any fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his King, who marvailously well understood how much it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him to maintain the Authority given by God to Princes; but if the matter shold come to Arms, he prayed his <hi>Serenity</hi> to consider, that though Philosophie tells us the Sun warms these inferior bodies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heat in it self, yet in human things it is not so, but he that wold heat in his favour, must first be hot himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Senat determin'd to signifie unto all Princes the Declaration of the King of great <hi>Britain,</hi> wherin he call'd God to witnesse, 'That his resolution to defend the cause of the Republic, had no other end but the service of God, and to conserve the Liberty which God gave to all Princes, not for any ill will that he carried to the Pope, nor was he mov'd by the particular interest of the Republic, but only so far, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knew She defended a cause most just and acceptable to God, which the more he considered in his mind, so much the more was he confirm'd in Her protection and defence, not finding any the least shadow of reason to relinquish Her; That he had already taken this resolution, and wold sustain it suddenly; That he wold not do as the Spaniard, who by a Letter had fill'd the Popes spirit with vanity to carry him into a precipice, but that he wold execut with courage and sincerity what he had promis'd: he consider'd also as a thing of great consequence, that the Pope prepar'd himself for warr, and had to this effect erected that new Congregation of men disaffected to the Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and all dependents of <hi>Spain:</hi> herunto he added, that he wold be as ready to perform his promise, as to publish his Declaration, and wold besides procure som good offices from his brother the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and other <hi>Princes of</hi> Germany <hi>his Allies.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> appearing so earnestly in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, the Emperour also did contribut his intercession; the Grand Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> likewise stir'd in it, yet nothing could be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to any purpose.</p>
               <p>Therfore the Spaniard begins to arm in the Duchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> to which end the Count <hi>de Fuentes</hi> had particular Commission.

               <p>The rumor of these preparations fill'd ev'ry corner of Christendome, therfore the Kings and Princes who were already engag'd in quality of Mediators 'twixt the Pope and the Republic, stir'd more nimbly in the businesse, specially the <hi>French,</hi> who to accelerat things, and do them with greater countenance, employed to that end the Cardinall <hi>de Ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euse</hi> in a splendid Embassie both to <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Spain</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> complain'd to the English Ambassadour for the proser of such assistance that his King had made to the Republic, which had put her to stand higher a tiptoe against the Holy Father, and impeded the Treaty, for She wold not shew Her self so obstinat against him, if She were not so much incouraged by his King, because from <hi>France</hi> She could expect but words, or peradventure som troops hired with her own silver.</p>

Crowns value, and <hi>Don Francisco de Castro</hi> had another of 3000. who had bin sent from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> expressely to compose these differences, which charge, in his first Speech before the Duke &amp; Senat, he sayed, that he had willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undertaken both in obedience to his Catholic Majesty, and for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affection he did bear unto so illustrious a Signory, hoping easily to conclude a peace betwixt the Holy Father and his Serenity, specially seeing he shold not meet with those three impediments that usually render all Treaties difficult; which are, first, the passion or extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affection of him in whose name men treat, or of him who treateth: secondly, the inconvenience of the matter treated; and thirdly, the inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity or want of good will in the person with whom the treaty is. For touching the first, it was certain that the King his Master was well-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and had no other aims but the common good; That the greatnesse
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:49798:88"/>
of the Republic was advantagious unto him, as being the Bullwark of Christendome against the power of the Turk; and for his own person, he protested, that he was not com to use deceit or subtilty being Noble by birth, and therfore oblig'd to tell truth above all things. Touching the second, the point of treaty was for peace, a thing excellent in its own nature, and for an union with the See Apostolic, a thing very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the Republic, all stories being full of the mutuall good offices which they have ever rendred one to the other, as on the contrary, their disunion must needs be pernicious to the Republic; for if their cause were injust it wold incense all Princes against them, and though it were reasonable, yet was it not fit therfore to forget what reverence men shold owe to the Soveraign Bishop. Touching the third, That the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was with a Senat of great prudence, lovers of peace, enemies of novelty, who had bin Authors alwaies of tranquillity in <hi>Italy,</hi> not of troubles: he discours'd further of the domages of war, and the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Senat herupon, to justifie and uphold what they had done, sent for all the Religious Orders, and commanded them, notwithstanding this Interdiction, to officiat, and sing Masse as formerly, otherwise they shold expect severity from the Duke and Senat: The Jesuits, among others, were convented before the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat, who appearing, they were interrogated, <hi>if they wold continu to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat and say Masse notwithstanding this Interdiction;</hi> they answer'd, <hi>That they wold do their Offices.</hi> The Senat herupon not expecting any equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, dismiss'd them to their Cells; so they departed, and instead of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiating they did shut up their Church doors, and refuse to say Masse: Herupon the Senat sent for them again, and ask'd them whether they had not promis'd to <hi>officiat,</hi> and celebrat the <hi>Masse;</hi> they answer'd, <hi>We promis'd to do our Office;</hi> by which they meant to read so much ev'ry day in the Roman Breviary as was enjoyn'd them: The Senat finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs thus trifled withall, and affronted by these equivocations, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dismiss'd them for the time, and falling to a serious consultation what to do, and weighing well the danger of their stay, took occasion forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to banish them, both from the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> and out of all the rest of Her Dominions: this businesse was carried so closely, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two daies after, in one and the same day and hour, they were exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated out of ev'ry part of the Republic to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and to other parts of the Popes State.

               </p>
               <p>This Vow looks full upon another Power, that under which they live, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pope, to whom they commit both soul and body, and to be no more their own, not to beleeve their own sense, judgment or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, but to transfer all, and to submit themselfs totally to him, to go, com, do, say, execut upon all, and against all, whatsoever he shall command, according to the form of their Vow, which is not improper to insert here, and runs as followeth;</p>
               <q>As many as shall make profession in this Society, let them not only know before they make it, but remember as long as they live, that all
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:49798:90"/>
this Society in generall, and more particularly those that are profess'd in it, serve God under a faithfull obedience to the most Holy Father the Pope, and although we be taught by the Gospell, and do know by the Orthodox Faith, and firmly hold that all the faithfull people of Christ are subject to the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to the Head and Vicar of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, yet notwithstanding for the greater devotion to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the See Apostolic, and the greater deniall of our own wills, and the more certain direction of the Holy Ghost, we have judg'd that it wold be very commodious that ev'ry one of us, and ev'ry one that shall herafter follow the same profession, besides the common tie of the three ordinary Vows, be bound herunto by a more speciall Vow, to wit, that whatsoever the present Pope, and all others herafter for the time being, shall command for the good of souls, and the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Faith, or into what Countrey soever they shall please to send us, that we be bound to perform their pleasure immediatly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any tergiversation or excuse for as much as lies in our power, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be aminded to send us against the Turks, or other Infidells whatsoever, yea though it be even unto those that are call'd Indians, among Heretics and Scismatics, whosoever they be, or among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; and to the end that no ambition or refusall may take place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, by occasion of these deputations and elections of Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; let ev'ry one know that he need not trouble himself about it, nor take thought for it, in as much as all the care therof must be left to God, and the Pope as his Vicar, and to the Generall of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</q>
               <p>Besides this generall astringing Vow reflecting upon spirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and missions, they have other Tenets which are pernicious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive to the temporall Jurisdiction of the Prince, as <hi>Emanuel Sa,</hi> who was accounted one of the chiefest Oracles of that Order, hath it in his book entitled, <hi>Aphorismi Confessartorum,</hi> wherin after that he had studied the point forty years, as he professeth in his preface, he doth assert, <hi>That the rebellion of a Clergie-man against the King is no Treason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is no subject of his.</hi> They have another Tenet, that <hi>subesse Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Pontifici est de necessitate salutis,</hi> viz. That to be subordinate to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is of the necessity of Salvation; besides, they hold that an error in points of Faith is no other thing then an opinion held against the Papall Decision; but the most dangerous of all is, That the Pope can dispence with Subjects from their Alleageance to their Prince, though lawfull and naturall.</p>
               <p>For these and other politicall considerations, the wise Venetian did rid himself of the Jesuit, fearing that in a short time this subtile Society might prove to be <hi>Respublica</hi> in <hi>Republica;</hi> nor since that day wold any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede or stir for their re-admission, till this year 1650. that the King of <hi>Polands</hi> brother being of that <hi>Order,</hi> hath made an Overture of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction in their behalf, with a profer of three hundred thousand Crowns, which businesse is now in agitation.</p>

               <p>FRANCISCO ERIZZO was sworn Duke of <hi>Venice</hi> afterwards, which swearing they do not call an <hi>oath,</hi> but by a more civill term, 'tis stil'd, <hi>Promissione Ducale</hi> in the record: he was a person full of years, and freighted with experience, therfore ripe enough for the Government.</p>
               <p>At the beginning of his time the Republic enjoyed a profound uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall peace by Sea and Land; but the growing greatnesse of the house of <hi>Austria</hi> did trouble Her, in regard of their new acquests in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Emperor having reduc'd the <hi>Bohemians</hi> to an exact obedience by way of conquest, and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> having the <hi>Palatinat</hi> in his hands, therfore she was well pleas'd that the <hi>Swed</hi> did rush into <hi>Germany,</hi> which wars she fomented with her countenance, and somthing els: Besides the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had a little before disturbed the peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> by the imperiall ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle he claim'd to the tutele and protection of the young Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> during his Minority, which the French King his Oncle by the mater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall side took upon him, but the Emperor, back'd by the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> thought to get it by the sword, which caus'd som perturbations in <hi>Italy,</hi> therfore the Pope also was well contented that the Emperor was shaken a little by the <hi>Swed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ther was employed about this time <hi>M. Capello</hi> a Venetian gentleman of an ancient extraction, a person of a small bulk, but well timber'd both for body and brain, to have the charge of the garding the Gulph, with a nomber of well appointed Gallies. At <hi>Vallona</hi> upon the Coasts of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> he met with the Barbary Fleet, whom he assaulted so vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, ther being many gentlemen of his own kindred engag'd in the

service, that he sunk divers of them, and took the Admirall Gally of <hi>Algier,</hi> (a Vessell of vast bignesse) which he brought with him away, and she remains to this day for a Trophy in the Arsenall of <hi>Venice:</hi> The Gran Turk did very much storm at this; therfore the Republic, rather then enter into open hostility against so potent a Neighbour, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to part with three hundred thousand Crowns to accommode the difference, wherof she recover'd part out of the Comendams of the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> which they enjoy'd within Her Dominions; but the foresayed <hi>Capello</hi> was clowded a good while after, and had it not bin for his great Alliance, it might have gon worse with him for having excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Commission in this action, such an exact obedience the Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expects to be had to her <hi>Orders,</hi> be the successe never so glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
               <p>Ther was another piece of Justice executed also upon <hi>C.

               <p>Amonst those Princes who reverence <hi>Rome,</hi> your <hi>Serenity</hi> is She, most renowned Republic, who being free from all superstitious creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do conserve your Christian Empire from all insidious pretences of Religion; by a most sage L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Now, this redounds to the greater advantage of the Clergy; for while the residuary seculars of the Testators undergo the weight of all public duties and assessements, by keeping in their hands
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49798:94"/>
the fee, the Churchmen do by vertu of their annuall Legacies sweep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the rents without any burthen at all; The zeal of your known pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will stir you the rather for regulating this abuse, when you consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the perpetuity of Legacies was introduc'd at first, rather by the cunning of the Ecclesiastics, then for the advantage of souls in Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: for if the pains of Purgatory are sayed to be but <hi>temporary,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shold the simplicity of peeple be perswaded to bequeath in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of their souls perpetuall Legacies and Mansionaries? Moreover your Serenity ought to consider, that the obligation of Masses multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying ev'ry day, with the nomber of Legacies, a necessity seems to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The second abuse consists in the multiplicity of Pensions, which are payed annually to <hi>Rome</hi> from the State of <hi>Venice:</hi> Touching this, it comes into my mind to remember your Serenity, that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> is like the middle Region of the Air, who useth to make her thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts against the earth, ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> being arriv'd at <hi>Venice,</hi> and sojourning there som daies, saw a Priest drag'd into prison by order of the secular power, and it being ask'd why the temporall Magistrat did exercise his jurisdiction so over an Ecclesiastic, a Venetian answer'd him thus.</p>

                  <p>The Republic of <hi>Venice,</hi> nor for any other mens threats, or insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ever deviated from that constant path which Her Progenitors hath pointed her out for her own safety from the beginning, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther jurisdictions which She hath alwaies conserv'd in the very face of <hi>Romes</hi> pretensions and power, one is, to have authority to punish the persons of Ecclesiastic Delinquents, esteeming that Dominion to be absolute and universall, which heaven hath afforded Her within Her own Territories.</p>
                  <p>This Republic knows well, That when God did institut Soveraign Power, he confer'd it upon <hi>Saul</hi> over all his people, and over all the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> without exception; Now, you cannot deny but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the twelve Tribes, ther were a great nomber of Levites and Priests; ought the Priests therfore to disswade the people from that obedience which was ordain'd by the Divine Majesty it self towards their naturall Princes? The Sacraments were ordain'd by God to wash
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49798:94"/>
away the pollutions <hi>of sin in the soul,</hi> but not to deface the Characters of subjects on the body: Nor was the Law of Christ ever incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the jurisdiction of <hi>Caesar,</hi> but in their opinions only, who seek pretences to traduce and calumniat it.

In the administration of Justice <hi>Lay-Princes</hi> also represent God. Now, for any to pretend a withdrawing of himself from their authority, is no other thing, then to be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be subordinat to divine institution: If Ecclesiastics wold inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Scriptures with more reason then passion and partiality, they wold discern that those words <hi>Nolite tangere Christos meos</hi> bear no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sense, then to prohibit any injust outrage against those Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stics, who for the goodnesse of their lifes, and innocency of their manners deserve the title of Christs; when a Church-man is naught, he falls from that title, and consequently from the priviledge of it; nor can the Clergy of these times pretend to be exempted from the power of temporall Justice by the foresayed words, unlesse it had bin in case that Christ had sayed, <hi>Nolite tangere</hi> Anti-<hi>Christos meos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Signory which can discern things in their tru essences, doth not admit the falshood of any interessed opinion to purblind Her own proper understanding: If a Clerk may err <hi>temporally</hi> against the State, the State thinks it reasonable that he may be punish'd <hi>temporally,</hi> by no other hand, then by that to whom God hath committed the care of the State. The danger of a State wold be too too evident, and the confusion also, if the Crimes that are committed against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and common tranquillity therof, shold stand in fear of no other punishment then what shall come from a forraign Prince, who regulating himself by certain politic interests in lieu of correction, wold haply tolerat, or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That wisdom which sits at the Stern of the Republic of <hi>Venice,</hi> will never suffer Her own subjects to be able to supplant Her, by the protection and support of any forraign Authority; Clerks are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd <hi>temporally,</hi> when they offend <hi>temporally</hi> against the tranquillity of the State, not els, and if it seems strange to the Pope that the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians

But Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the VIII. since he differeth so much from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> will not confesse when he denieth the truth <hi>imo nec voce Galli,</hi> but perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in an obstinat opinion not to restore the Elogy, being contented by a foolish <hi>capriccio</hi> of his own to give this generall attestation only, that the Church of Christ hath bin alwaies serv'd by Princes of all sorts: Insomuch that that ancient inscription which was seen registred in the <hi>Vatican,</hi> as a monument of Ecclesiastic gratitud towards <hi>Venice,</hi> that monument which Time it self could not deface all this while, the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berini</hi> have annihilated at last, because peradventure that having ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd all vertu from <hi>Rome,</hi> it displeaseth them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to see gratitud lodg'd under the roof of their house; or rather because the <hi>Barberini</hi> do not hold themselfs beholden for those services that the Church receav'd from S. <hi>Mark,</hi> in regard they are more her Betrayers then Governors; In the <hi>interim</hi> we cannot but be sensible of this monstrous ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tud, yet we comfort our selfs to see that the Popes disaffection and power to do us hurt, can extend it self no further then the walls of his own house.</q>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> having parted with <hi>Venice,</hi> goes to <hi>Lucca,</hi> where understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the contumacy of that little Republic, he wold know the grounds of it, and a Citizen answers him thus in a sad and solemn posture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad of the occasion to make the truth known.</p>
               <q>Among the Popes of our age, <hi>Vrban</hi> the eighth hath bin most prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall of <hi>Iubilees</hi> and <hi>Indulgences</hi> untill these his latter years; but to shew, peradventure, that he hath no lesse power over curses, then over benedictions, he hath at last by altering his stile, put forth his hand to dart out Excommunications: It was the fortune of this small Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:49798:95"/>
to bear the brunt of his first Censure in this kind; he therby imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating those who use to try the vertu of poison upon the lesser animalls first: The connivency wherby other Princes dissembled this out mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap, gave him scope to thunder out the second against the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> nor must Christendom expect other things herafter but Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications; in regard that if the affairs of the world use to succeed one another in equall <hi>vicissitudes,</hi> 'tis necessary that <hi>Excommunications</hi> be as frequent as <hi>Iubilees</hi> have bin.</q>
               <p>Now touching the grounds of the Papall distasts with us, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy manifested to the world, I must say, though very sparingly, <q>That the originall of ev'ry accident here, sprung from the insupportable li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnesse of Churchmen, who did necessitat us to a just resentment. It seem'd strange to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that so small a Republic as ours durst resent the outrages of Ecclesiastics, who shold rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them, considering that this State is too narrow to be sensible of such insolencies; and so persisting in an obstinat Censure, he choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth rather to see our perdition hastned, then the exorbitances of his Clergy moderated; but we being not conscious to have committed any Delinquency which might deserve to exclude us from the face of God, we comfort our selfs in this case with the memory of <hi>Balaam,</hi> who injustly curs'd the people of <hi>Israel;</hi> nor have we ever rested since, to procure a right understanding, by the interposition of a person of great credit with the Cardinall Nephews, that they wold be pleasd to appease his Holines's displeasure (expecting still a miracle from the words of some Asse) but to this hour ther hath nothing come of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Barberini</hi> are in Armes, and this Martiall appearance they think will inforce us to desire a reconciliation; as for the rest which concerns the soul, if an Excommunication hath power to cut us off from the union of this present Church, why shold we think it capitall to be separated from so infected a body, and freed so by continuall examples of sacrilegious lifes, and from the despair wherinto the Clericall Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny wold plunge us! Confiding therfore in the Justice of our Cause, and in the assistance of those wise Princes who cannot away with the ravenousnesse of this Pope, we trust to receave som fruits of the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of these Censures, in regard that if this course hold, the world will see that as <hi>Iubilees</hi> pass'd were pretexts for som new impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, <hi>Excommunications</hi> will serve herafter as pretext for some new Rapin.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> having understood the grievances of the <hi>Luqueses,</hi> passeth on to <hi>Parma,</hi> wher having in the habit of a Fryer insinuated into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of the Duke, he desires to understand from his mouth the Contestation he hath with the Roman Church, and the Duke answer'd him thus.</p>
               <p>The world hath already understood too much the causes of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell I have with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> being publish'd not only by my <hi>Manifestos,</hi> but by the writings of other particular pens, who have wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly protected the justnesse of my cause. But since it pleaseth you,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:49798:96"/>
good Father, to hear from my own mouth the grounds of these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which have kept such a noise. I will relate them unto you with that brevity of words, which may suit rather with the present encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances that afflict me, then with the nature of the thing it self.</p>
               <q>Know then that the particular urgencies of my house have erected in <hi>Rome</hi> a Bank call'd the <hi>Farnese Bank,</hi> which obligeth my fortunes to contribut an annuall cense to my Creditors. Now <hi>Vrban</hi> the VIII. being assail'd by some turbulent spirit in these last periods of his life, thought with himself to build a little new Fort of divers pretences upon this bank, therby to set upon my Duchy of <hi>Castro:</hi> But I had good reason to hope now in these my troubles som support, rather then any oppression from that Seat, of whom the ashes of my Proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors do yet glory to have merited so well; but all <hi>gratitud</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish'd in the brests of Ecclesiastics, <hi>charity</hi> is also much diminish'd amongst them, which neither moves them to any compassion, nor to be a whit aggriev'd, though they see mountains of miseries heaped on one's back; a desire to enrich the Nephews, which is the <hi>primum Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> of the Popes mind in these times, prevail'd over all reason, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of plundring did facilitat the way to dispossesse me of mine own; nor did the tyranny of <hi>Vrban</hi> the VIII. stop here, but he thought that I wold take it nothing ill if he did excommunicat me, that being so segregated from the Communion of the Faithfull, none durst hear my grievances, or reach a hand to help me: A great cruelty in a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, that flaying his sheep alive, wold not have them to carry natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affections about them to resent the hard case of one another; More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to varnish the pretext of his Censures, he publisheth me for a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient son to the universall Father of <hi>Christianity,</hi> But whether he is to be acknowledg'd as a Father, who enemy-like robs his children, judge you? Can he expect to be reverenc'd as S. <hi>Peters</hi> Successor, when diffring from S. <hi>Peter,</hi> he stops his ears to the words of Christ, who commanded him to sheath his sword? Christ did institut a peacefull Kingdom, nor did he ever ordain that his Cause shold be handled with Armes: Neverthelesse the present Bishops make use of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are ready to meddle with any other Cause then with that of Christ: In the <hi>interim,</hi> good Fryer, my fortune is worse then that of <hi>Malchus,</hi> for if <hi>Malchus</hi> was offended with the weapon of <hi>Peter,</hi> he was heal'd again by the hands of <hi>Peter;</hi> but I find my self hurt by S. <hi>Peters</hi> sword, yet cannot perceave his hand is dispos'd to cure me, or restore me mine own.</q>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> being departed from <hi>Parma</hi> goes to <hi>Florence,</hi> wher being brought to the Court, he heard the Gran Duke much transported with choler, speaking to a Councellor of his in this manner.</p>
               <q>Then <hi>Vrban</hi> the VIII. intendeth that a Clergie-man shall go exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the imposition of Milstone, wherunto the interests of my State oblige me to subject without exception any one that lives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Government; and who is he that arrogats temporall Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over anothers Authority? In the time of Christ secular Princes had their tribut, and shall they now be refus'd in <hi>Vrban's</hi> time? By this
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49798:96"/>
means the credulous simplicity of the Laity shall be continually taught to contribut so many Gabells to the Clergy, and the Clergy shall be free from all taxes to them, and who at any time leaves possessions to the Ecclesiastics, they must be free from such Contributions which the Law of Nature awards ev'ry protecting Prince. Who did ever affirm that the Legacies of privat men can be exempt from the public Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of their Prince? These are new Doctrines which tear the world in pieces, being introduc'd by those Bishops, who together with the Evangelicall precepts, have forgot that Christ himself when he was upon earth payed tribut to <hi>Caesar,</hi> professing that he came to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law, not toabrogat it; and shall we admit in our free States an Authority, which beyond the Order and example of Christ pretends to have power to controul, and transvolve the Dominions of others; yea to trample upon the Princes themselfs; Is this the paradise that Christ promiseth to them that observe his Law, or rather a Hell, which they worthily deserve who beleeve too much in an adulterated <hi>Church.</hi> But I observe that the Ecclesiastics by too many stiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do subject the simple seculars to pay contribution for Indulgencies, for Dispensations, for the Word of God, for sacrifices of the Altar, and in sum for all the Sacraments, which the Divine goodnesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ath affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>gratis</hi> to all the faithfull: But what do I say? the avarice of the Clergy is grown to that height, that it doth not permit those poor souls that are under the agonies of <hi>Death</hi> to depart from this world to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till they conjure them under the pretext of pious Legacies to pay a toll for their safe conduct, constraining to bargain for their very graves, they sell them for ready money the embraces of our common Mother the earth; and I in my free State must not impose the least Tax as that of the Milstone upon my subjects: But let <hi>Vrban</hi> practise what he please, let Him thunder what Excommunications he will upon my Gabelleers, I shall learn well enough how to fence away his blowes, I will make the Jews my Receavers; nor shall I ever suffer that <hi>Tosca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> be oppress'd by such rapacious Tyrants, who under the mantle of Religion exercise such robberies upon us.</q>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> leaving <hi>Florence,</hi> resolves to visit the State of the <hi>Church;</hi> in his journey he is accompanied with a subject of the Popes, who vented forth his discontentments unto him in these words, upon som expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of S. <hi>Pauls.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>I was born a subject under the particular Dominion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that's enough, good Frier, to pronounce me miserable; The Civill Justice administred in my Countrey by Ecclesiastics, the Authority abus'd by them that govern, and their custom degenerating daily into cruelty and rapine, have made the subjection insupportable, and the lifes of those unhappy who live under the temporall Scepter of the Roman Clergy; my toung cannot sufficiently expresse the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidnes of their Government, let ev'ry one comprehend by their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall practises they do exercise abroad what they do at home; I was enforc'd to forsake my house for a Tax impos'd upon me for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well; when a young rich man is discover'd by greennesse of Age,

and heat of bloud to be prone to any lightnesse, presently comes a new Edict which will make him lie under a grosse sum of money; herby it comes oft to passe, that a small fillip somtimes doth equall murther, and words are as dangerous as deeds; for all comes under the title of transgression, though the fault be no other then a slip of youthful light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Furthermore, the Ministers who govern our State of <hi>Rome</hi> under colour of zeal to our Salvation, are wont ever and anon to send certain Catchpouls to search mean blind places &amp; cottages, to see whether any subject cohabit with a Concubine; ev'ry thing lies under the search of prowling eyes, and the insolent hands of those Ragamuffins; I will say no more then this, that under the Domination of other Princes the Jews are more gently us'd then we are under the regiment of the Ecclesiastics; nor is it a wonder; for som <hi>Churchmen</hi> of our times are haply greater Enemies to the Gospell of Christ, then som Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are to the Talmud of the Hebrews.</q>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> a little after meets with a <hi>Maronit</hi> passenger, who had taken a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from Mount <hi>Libanus</hi> in <hi>Syria</hi> to see <hi>Rome,</hi> and was returning home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; S. <hi>Paul</hi> begins to mingle speech with him, asking him of his Countrey, and of the Motives that induc'd him to com to <hi>Italy,</hi> and what opinion he had form'd within himself of <hi>Rome?</hi> wherunto he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>My Countrey is <hi>Armenia,</hi> the cause which brought me to <hi>Italy</hi> was no other then a desire to learn the tru Tenets of the Catholic Doctrine, which in our Region is adulterated with such a multiplicity of Sects, that they confound one another. The eleventh year is now coming about that I have breath'd air under the climes of <hi>Europe,</hi> having so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ'd longest in <hi>Rome,</hi> being led thither by Fame, which somtimes useth to represent things otherwise then they are in their own essence: I figur'd within my self <hi>That City</hi> to be She, who as She pretends, so She had deserv'd to be the Head of all Christian people, as being the School of Sanctity, and patern of all vertu. And truly at the first sight I thought I was not a whit deceav'd by any extern appearance which oft times doth dazzle and fascinat the eyes of the simple. The magnificence of Her Temples, the great nomber of pardons, such a confluence of people flocking to <hi>Church,</hi> and the visit of holy places, imprinted within me such an opinion of the Roman piety, that when afterwards I fell to observe the lifes and luxury of the Cardinalls, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle compatible with the Doctrine of Christ, I ascrib'd the cause of my mistake rather to my own ignorance, then want of Religion in others; but when I seriously descended into my self, I thought I was not born senslesse: Processe of time and mature reflexions, made me discern af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards that the Roman Religion consisted most in Ceremonies of exterior worship, which were it properly defin'd, might be call'd a kind of practise of life in the small sort, and an hypocrisie in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For the rest, ev'ry action being judiciously examin'd, you will find it tending chiefly to objects of privat interest and temporall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit; profit and delight are the two poles wheron the Firmament of Roman designs wheel about; if Christ and his Law be embrac'd, it is
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:49798:97"/>
not embrac'd for the tru finall end, but as means to compasse some ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene businesse, which transform'd me to wonder while I observ'd how much Christ was vilified among the Romans, considering how much he serves their turn for encreasing their temporall interests: You shall find all vices reduc'd in this City, as to their proper center, and which is worse, with specious titles of holines; their pomp appears under the name of Church <hi>decorum,</hi> and their ambition under the title of Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, their tyranny under the semblance of zeal, nay most scandalous lusts are brought into the houses of the greater sort under the mantle of spirituall recreations: Adulation hath founded here her Palace, for you shall have it preach'd most impudently that the Pope cannot err, notwithstanding that his actions are the very tops of errors: Tell me O reverend Frier, if the Pope cannot erre, wherfore are ther Decrees and Ordinances of Councells instituted; 'twere enough to be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his will, only without importuning any Synod, or attending any rules from the universall fuffrage of Christianity; But to unbowell unto you my tru meaning, I hold that the Ecclesiastics now that they see they cannot fit the custom of the Pope to the Laws, they procure to fit the Laws to his customes; God forgive them who so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting a parasiticall Doctrine introduce so many enormities to Gods House, so frontlesse and void of all shame; these men being dandled with ambition, have transported S. <hi>Peters</hi> Seat from Caves to Thrones of Gold; these being carried away with avarice to declare this magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence to be necessary for the dignity of the Church, together with those worldly Dominions so expressely forbidden by Christ: Poor <hi>Church,</hi> to what case art thou reduc'd? the time was when the Clergy were reverenc'd for the Sanctity of their lifes, and profoundnesse of their learning, and for the fame of their miracles; but now they raise respect unto themsels by worldly rule and greatnesse, for nothing els makes them to be reverenc'd now adaies. But to compasse this <hi>mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane grandeur,</hi> which is founded most commonly upon Bases of gold, what unlawfull path is not troden? what iniquity is not practis'd? the Law of Christ being turn'd by the Ministery of the Romans to be a Law of ruin and rapin: ther is no action exercis'd in the Roman Church, but you shall find it conjoyn'd with the interests of worldly emolument? O how deplorable are these times, were they parallel'd with those of the Ancients, yea, when the world was depriv'd of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelicall Light! Then, if an <hi>Alexander</hi> rose up, who with an immense kind of cupidity snatch'd at ev'ry thing; Nature who is a friend to counterpoises, created a Philosopher, who glorying in his poverty, contemn'd the possession of all transitory Princes. But now among the Christians, if a Pope starts up, who with insatiable appetit goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to grapple all, we do not find that vertu hath such a force as to dispose any Ecclesiastic to shew an example of that poverty which is commanded him by heaven: Good Frier, if you have ever bin in the Dominions of the Church, you will be astonish'd at such abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherwith the Worship of God is daily prophaned. Moreover, you
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:49798:98"/>
shall hear nothing els preach'd in the Pulpits but Paradoxes, Delight, not the utility of souls being the scope of their matter, and so the ears being tickled with the Doctrine the Collections use to be greater, which under the name of Almes is drain'd afterwards from the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; but their sacrilegious greedines stops not here, you shall see of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten lame miracles publish'd for gain, you shall often see those inspired Fathers use certain acts of Conjuration, rather to draw money out of the purse, then to cast devills out of the body; you shall oft times see many neglected Images making themselfs miraculous upon a sudden to enrich the Ecclesiastic professors, deluding by this trick the simplicity of those who hold that the vertu of doing miracles being lost in men, is retir'd into statues of stone and wooden pictures. In somm, the abuses are so many which are introduc'd by the covetousnesse and rapacity of the Romans, that I prognosticat that all reality of Religion will be quite extinguish'd e're it be long, and faith her self also as much as remains; for I have observ'd that Christ did not live long upon earth when he was put between two theeves.</p>
                  <p>Ther is an opinion that's current among som Theologues, that when the Host begins to moulder the Divine Presence, immediately departs from the Eucharist. Now, if Christ cannot stay, no not the least mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in corrupted bread, how shall we think that he can abide to stay amongst a corrupt people? Friend, if your salvation be dear unto you, turn face about and never go to <hi>Rome,</hi> cast your self rather upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest shores of <hi>India,</hi> whither they say all vertu and Religion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd perhaps to be the further off from <hi>Rome;</hi> one cannot so journ in this City without endangering his Faith; take example by me, who being com from among the Mahumetans to learn to lead the life of a Catholic, do now go away hence with strange kind of confus'd imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thoughts within me to turn Turk.</p>
               </q>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> having parted with the <hi>Maronit,</hi> and advancing towards <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rette,</hi> while he pass'd in a Friers froc hard by a village, he was call'd in to confesse a dying Cardinall, he goes in, and hears his confession, which was thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Father, I feel the pangs of death com upon me, God summons me to satisfie the last debt of human nature; my soul finding her self in these extremes, trembleth to appear before the face of God, in regard She is so full of carnall spots. It is your function to help me to wash them off, while these eys of mine shall afford you tears, and this panting spirit, though strugling with the assaults of death, shall endeavour to declare unto you in short periods the sum totall of all my offences pass'd.</p>
                  <p>Know then that I was born to a poor fortune, but nature, who hath also her portion of goods in this world to dispense among mortals, was pleas'd to endow this body with such Prerogatives, that my parents might well formalize som hopes within themselfs of my greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement at <hi>Rome,</hi> Being grown up to twelve years, devoting my self not to God but to Ambition, they cloath'd me with the habit of an Ecclesiastic, and to stablish the foundation of their hopes the better,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49798:98"/>
they applied me to the service of a Cardinall. Now 'tis a rule, that wher the end is crooked, the means tending to that end can hardly prosper: Hence it coms to passe, that now adaies in <hi>Rome</hi> to arrive to the end of their designs, they do not use learning and vertu, the effects of a tru heavenly vocation, for means, but courtship and flattery, which are the base parts of that interest which hath alwaies an eye to the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantage of ones self: I applied my particular study to be a profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the garb &amp; fashion of the Court, which is no other thing then to devote ones person to any pleasure of the great ones; He who confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth must not conceal any thing, but be pleas'd Father to comprehend in your imagination whatsoever, wherin an engaged and well respected youth may sin, and suppose it in me, so my feeble toung shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the labour of my Narration; only this I tell you, that I knew how to gain the entire affection of the Prelat my protector, and he, for my sake was not ill look'd upon at Court. Pensions did reign upon my person, which made me wonder at that which the Ancients write, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> shold Metamorphose himself into a showr of Gold only for <hi>Danae,</hi> since he converts himself so more often now for <hi>Gani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meds:</hi> This my youthful age was free from those passions which use or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily to transport the minds of young men, <hi>viz.</hi> from the love of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; yet I do not deny to have tried it oft, it seeming to me very strange that I shold pray, who was us'd to be prayed unto; but I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued not long in that state, my humor alter'd with my age, then I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled my self in Feminine Love, and in a short time I tried what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, fornication and incest were; In the mean time I arriv'd to that age which was capable of Priesthood, then taking Holy Orders I liv'd a while retir'd within my self, being perswaded to a moderation of life by that Synedresis, that touch of conscience, which coms somtimes by nature, and teacheth som sort of respect which is to be had to that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; but at the end too much familiarity turn'd into contempt, for wheras at first I began to sin with som scruple, those scruples quickly flew away from my conscience, and so I came to such a reprobat sense, that fornication, rebellion of the heart, and celebrating of the Masse, was in my person but the act of one hour oftentimes. Father, 'twas no Sacrament, 'twas a Devill that entred into my soul when I took the Character of a Priest; it was an infernall Spirit that perswaded me not to fear that Christ, which was daily to passe through my hands; I found my self immediatly dispos'd to ev'ry wickednes: And wheras at first no affection molested me, but that of Lust, me thought that all vices as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sail'd me in a moment: Nor is it to be wondred at; for if <hi>Iudas</hi> found himself to betray Christ after he had taken the sop unworthily, though but once, much more must it be suppos'd, that those impious Priests must be inclinable to all motions of prophanesse, who ev'ry day receave the Sacramentated Redeemer, peradventure more unworthily then <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das:</hi> Covetousnesse also came to be my inseparable companion, fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted chiefly by occasion of that command &amp; authority, I began to get in the State of the Church; while I exercis'd the Office of a Shepheard,

I learnt quickly the art to shear my sheep, all that belong'd to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was created, me thought, by nature; for the service of my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: my favors were still expos'd to the highest offerer, nor did I ever refuse a present from any hand, I did wonder at the custom of the Priests of the old Testament, who rejected many Oblations as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy for the Sacrifice, and so concluded within my self, that because the times and Laws were alter'd, the Priests of the New Testament ought to receave any thing offer'd them: But this was the the least; for if the Parishoners did not do it voluntarily, I found waies to snatch it from them. I remember that among other passages, taking occasion once to visit a young gentleman, who was within the compasse of my Jurisdiction, I observ'd in his house som pictures of good value, and giving him an inkling of my desire, he with many humble comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments answer'd, That he wold be very unwilling to be dispossess'd of them; I kept this deniall in my brest, and having trac'd a way by means of the Holy Inquisition to clap him in prison, he presented unto me the foresayed Pictures, that he might be remov'd only to a gentler Goal, and afterwards, for his full Liberty, was forc'd to suffer the better part of his estate to be confiscated; but fearing that by his appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> this act of mine might be too narrowly win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now'd, and so I might run a hazard of the precipitation of my fortunes not yet so firmly grounded, to secure my self from after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps, I call'd him unto me, and rebuking him for his course car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards me at first, it made me by right of that incumbency I held over him, to reform all misdemeanours, and to teach him how to comply with Church Governours for the future: In fine, for the reparation of his losses pass'd, I made him a friendly promise to point him out a way how he might be made capable to weare an Ecclesiastic habit, and so ascend to the Dignity of a Prelat: For they in the Romane State, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:49798:99"/>While I did lead this splendid life, the Cardinall my Protector came to the Popedom; By this exaltation myhopes soard very high, nor did ther much time passe, when I saw my person, being a Creature of the Popes, advanced to the dignity of a Hat; so I moumed to the degree of a Cardinall, wherein I stand now. Now if my voice had strength to unmask every particular thing, you would be struck with amazement to discover a life so impious in the persons of them who glory in the title of Christs Disciples. I'le tell you in a word, that from the time I obtain'd the Cardinallship, I never kept Lent, I never recited my <hi>houres,</hi> I never confess'd to God, till now in these extream agonies of my sicknes: Such being the custome almost of all Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls, who finding themselfs in a posture to aspire to the Keyes of Heaven, doe think perchance to be able one day to find a way to enter there, without any necessity of good workes. But woe is me, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive now to have deviated from the wayes of Heaven; I discern too well by the light of Divine grace (which I know not by what excesse of mercy may please to save me for all this) that to lead an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall life is an now accustomed is nothing at all to live a Christian: But if Pagans, yea Atheists, preceiving their own errours, have hopes to be sav'd, why should I dispair? This is the onely argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my hopes, although I think the salvation of an Infidell more easy, than that of a perverse Christian; because my soul finds at this very moment that the <hi>understanding</hi> is more easily illuminated, than the <hi>will</hi> humbled and rectified being too tenacious of her delights in those pleasures, which she must now relinquish with the Hat; But, father, my spirit failes me, give me an absolution, for I feel my self upon point of expiring.</p>

               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> having absolv'd the Cardinall, upon his departure thence he met with an Angell, who after som salutations fell to relate unto him what he had overheard in a <hi>Parlatory of Nunnes</hi> as followeth.</p>
               <p>You know allredy, O Apostle of God, that I am of those Angells which never descended before on Earth, and if in strange Countrys the curious mind of the passenger desires to satisfy it self, I confesse that among other things, which I coveted to see, one was a Monastry of <hi>Nuns,</hi> who were so much spoken of in Heaven that I took them to be Angells on earth. Being come therfore to one of the prime Citties of <hi>Italy,</hi> I took the form of a strange youth, and entred at the privatest hour I could into a Monacall Parlatory. I found at the windows a young <hi>Nun,</hi> which had no other busines it seemes, but to attend the comming of som body. I was scarce spyed by her, when she asked me an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my Country, and what fancy took me to traverse the World up and down in that maner; I, bethinking my self of Heaven, answerd, my Country, most gentle Sister, is too far distant from this place, and whereunto few of this Region arrive. Touching the fancy that leads me to traverse up and down the World, it is no other than curiosity, which often draws youthfull lightnes to neglect their own profit, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard others. Foolish youthfulnes which canst not learn how to value thy Countries good but a far of; then I added, happy are they who
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:49798:100"/>
never departing from within the Paradise of these holy walls, seem as so many Angels alwayes appearing before the face of God. She being as full of Spirit as She was of beauty answered thus, O how many of us would willingly change our Paradise for your peregrination, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then doe you complain so causelesly of your travels? which being no other than the motions of a civill life, it cannot chuse but be so much the sweeter to elevated minds, by how much the higher the movements of their souls are. Behold the Sun, behold the Planets, which never stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still in one place delight to be continuall travellers in the Univers.</p>
               <p>I being much taken with the vivacity of this femal spirit, replyed: It is true Lady, that the Sun and the Planets are in a continuall peregrination, but there are in Heaven fixed Stars also, which, because haply they are more noble, are superiour to the other, and consequently nearer the throne of the Almighty; These <hi>Nuns</hi> then, who to serve God are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways permanent in one place, like the fixed Stars, may more than any other mortalls comfort themselves with an assurance that they are nearer God. The beauteous Maiden sighed at these words, and then answered: God, I deny not, dwels nearer to the fixed Stars, but not to desperate souls; And now you discover your self to be a stranger, that you are not acquainted with our condition. The cruelty of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and the rigour of our destiny hath pend us in here for ever, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> concurring hereunto by admitting any pretext what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, bear with me Sir, that I speak thus. It is a hard fate to be born to a perpetuall prison, while it is seen that all other living creatures have the whole World to solace themselves in; And that Prison, which it seems the very infants fly from, when they sally out of their Mothers wombs before they have as it were any sense of life, we are constrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de to endure, after that nature hath given us the perfect use of our sense, and life, and the knowledge of our miseries; The destiny of that mortall must needs be a hard one who is born to live in restles infelicity. This Cloyster, which surrounds our Liberty, is not, as you imagine, a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise; for in Paradise there dwels no discontentment; It is rather a Hell wherein the flames of inextinguible desire the naturall affections of our humanity are condemned to be tortured every minute. I will not stand to expresse the cause why our Parents are so inhumanly cruell unto us, for it is too well known, that for to spare that dowry which is due to our Sex, they condemne us twixt these walls, to be deprived for ever of any worldly delight, for no other cause, but because we are born Women, yet you must know, that the shutting us thus by force between these stones, cannot deprive us of those carnall affections which may well be covered but not quench'd in that religious habit that you see about us; Nor can this kind of life conduce to Heaven, considering ther's no concurrence of the will, which is so acceptable to the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing Lord, we are rather destinated to an Abisse, by a course clean contrary to our genius, being bereft also of that common privilege, which other souls use to have to go to Hell what way they please. In ancient times it was the custom to slay the <hi>Victimes</hi> first, and then Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice them to God, because haply the principall seat of the corporeall
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:49798:100"/>
affections lying in the blood, 'twas not held convenient to offer his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty any holocaust, which was not first purg'd by effusion of that bloud from all earthly passions; But this is not observ'd in us by our Parents, who do make Sacrifices of us with all our blood and passions about us, then, how can we believe that it is gratefull to God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? and being not gratefull to him, consider what despair our souls are plung'd in, which see themselfs shut out of the world here, without any assurance of Heaven herafter in regard we have not power to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish our naturall affections, and so are in danger to precipitate our selfes headlong into Hell through a kind of suppos'd innocence. If <hi>Christ</hi> died to reduce us to such a hard condition, oh how better were it for us that he had not died. Be not offended O stranger at the words, for the tongues of the damned can bring forth nothing but blasphemies: yet we know that <hi>Christ</hi> hath no hand in this our hard condition, for his death had for its principall object the freedom and enlargement of souls, not their captivity. The <hi>Popes</hi> are most in fault, by yeelding to the cruell covetousnes of our Parents to transvert the Keys of Paradise into the Keys of a Prison. It was not <hi>Christ,</hi> no, it was the impiety of <hi>Herod,</hi> that by reason of the humanation of our Saviour caus'd so many innocents to be slain. Behold, we are in a case equall to theirs, because we being yet innocent children under the mark of holines, we are segre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and cut off from the society of the living, ther being no difference twixt us and them, but they dye before Buriall, and we are buried before Death. Nor can our innocency, or our fears Prevaile any thing, nor are those privileges sufficient which nature hath granted these faces of ours (for which peradventure you stiled us Angells) to implore from others pity and succour, having found the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> so ingratefull, while we consider that the time was when St. <hi>Peter</hi> was freed by an Angell out of prison, but now clean contrary Angells are cast into prison by the successors of S. <hi>Peter.</hi> But whither doth violence of just passion transport me thus to rave? Helas, the name of Angell doth not suit with our condition, and l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But what shall I say of that Maiden-chastity for the conservation whereof we are principally penn'd in here? I leave that for you to imagine, it being not permitted to femal modesty to make any further expressions in this kind; I only tell you this, that we procure all means possible to outrage and abuse it, and not without reason, for if this Chastity hath been the principall thing that hath retrench'd our liberties in this maner, we ought to aym and bend our chiefest forces to be reveng'd of our chiefest enemy. And here this beauteous <hi>Nun</hi> blush'd, and broke the thread

of her Discours. I confess unto you O holy <hi>Paul,</hi> that if I had a breast capable of terrene affections, I wold doubtles have tenderly resented the misery of this discontented soul; but compassion is vain, where ther's no power to comfort; therfore I held it expedient to take my leave, that I might not imbitter her passions any further; so at my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, I said, When I came in hither, Oh most beauteous <hi>Nuns,</hi> I look'd upon you as on so many <hi>Seraphins,</hi> but hearing the state of your hard condition, I find you to be the unhappiest creatures that live under the Law of <hi>Christ.</hi> Wer it permitted me for to help you, I promise you I wold batter down these walls and give you that liberty which others take from you; but since 'tis not lawfull for any to do so, comfort your selfs at least that Heaven is reserv'd for your suffrances. And although you protest not to suffer for <hi>Christ,</hi> yet <hi>Christ</hi> is so mercifull, that he can give beatitudes to those <hi>Cyreneans</hi> who cary his Cross though forc'd therunto; And I dare assure you, that if you cannot gain Heaven as <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,</hi> you shall gain it at least as <hi>Martyrs.</hi>

And now that you have understood the grounds of my grievances, tell me freely whether I complain without cause, for perchance God hath sent you hither either to check me, or comfort me. The twentieth yeer runns now on that <hi>Urban</hi> the 8. holds the Papacy, whence one may easily calculat how few yeers are left behind, if it be tru whats commonly
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:49798:101"/>
spoken, that no Pope shall see as many daies as <hi>Peter;</hi> But if I may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold my thoughts, I do beleeve that he who spoke those words seemd to prophecy, that none shall see the Church of God in that state of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian perfection as it was in the daies of <hi>Peter;</hi> But be it as it will, the more yeers com on, the faster evry man runns to that pitt which is the center wher all Mortalls terminat their cours, being drawn down by the weight of that Earth wherof Humanity is composd: Most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly old men when they com to such a period of yeers use to check within themselfs those spiritts which in their youth were usd to lash out into a thousand inordinat passions, endeavouring, being now as it were abandond by the World, to acquire unto themselfs by meanes of a tru repentance som sort of shelter in the Sanctuary of Divine grace which is ever redy to receave all those that are forlorn; But be astonishd, O <hi>Paul, Urban</hi> the 8. the older he growes, the more loose he leaves the reignes to his own senses, and the neerer he approcheth death, the further he goeth from good operations: He excessively loves the plesure of his Nephews, nor doth he study any thing but what aymes at their interest: He seldom reflects upon the incumbency of his charge, and if at any time som flying thoughts represent unto him his own duty, he discerneth well that a kind of relation passeth twixt the Papacy and his Person, yet he flattereth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with this fond conceit, that the Papacy is more bound to serve his Person, than his Person the Papacy: He detests in the extreme the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of his excesses, the most effectuall meanes wherby the garding Angells use to tame the prowdest soules; He will not as much as think on death, or if somtimes he is brought to think ont, by converting the physick into poyson, he applies his cogitations presently in ruminating how he may aggrandize his house before he goes. If I should tell you how often I found him chimerising within himself how he might make it possible to render the Popedom electif, and to depend no more upon the Consistory, but solely upon the person regnant, that he might esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish it in his posterity, you would be amazed at those extravagant ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations that possesse the mind, even of the Vicar of Christ. But would God were pleasd, that such wishes did terminat altogether in the vanity of the designe, They end commonly in more practicall resolutions, to drain the patrimony of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> for to enrich their own houses with the spoiles of the holy Church. But the avidity of <hi>Urban</hi> stops not here, He little esteems the millions of Gold purloynd from the Altar, to leave his Nephews the possession of an independent Principality, wher they may lay up the unsecurd tropheys of their own rapines; Ther was ever yet in the World a greater nomber of those who wish to be Princes than Principalities themselves.</p>
               <p>Hence it comes, that to purchase these from the tenacious hands of others, there must be force necessarily usd, because hardly any reasons can be found, which may perswade the mind of man to lay down vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily the right of a free dominion; which makes <hi>Urban</hi> the 8. being transported by his passions to machinat violent means for to invest his Nephews in another Princes Estate. I could tell you som further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and fury of his. He accounts often upon the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi>
                  <pb n="188" facs="tcp:49798:102"/>
but he finds the enterprise to be fuller of desire than hopes; He thinks upon the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> lending his eare unto the glozing offers of som Minister of a Tramontane Crown, but he dares not trust to that, for if others should intervene, he cannot leave all to the <hi>Barberini.</hi> He fixd his eyes upon <hi>Lucca,</hi> but perceiving it a petty State, he doubts whether the benefit will countervaile the charge. He hath a months mind to <hi>Mirandola,</hi> but being feudetary to the Empire, and a place that breeds som jealousy twixt the neighbouring Princes, he is afraid to draw <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>Lombardy</hi> on his back. Lastly, he turns his eyes to <hi>Parma,</hi> and this enterprize being made lesse difficult by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of som pretences, he purposes to deprive the poor Duke (beginning with <hi>Castro</hi>) of all his possessions. I put him in mind how much it did misbecom Bishops, and other Prelats of the holy Church, who make profession of a life differing from Sword-men, to change the Crosier into Musket-rests, Rochets into Corslets, and their Miters to Murrions. I put before his eyes the scandall that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to all Christendome therby, the scorn that Infidells would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of it, and the danger the Church should incur, foretold by our Saviour, who positively warneth that every Kingdom divided in it self hath its dissolution near at hand: But it is to beat the Aire, to tell <hi>Urban</hi> of all this, which hath everything for his aime, but the indemnity of the Church. Finding that these arguments were of little force, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto him the spur of nature, alleging that the events of War were dubious and dangerous, to raise in him therby some apprehensions of fear, which commonly takes place in old mens breasts; But nature could prevaile little, reason lesse, and the inspiration of an Angell nothing at all over the hair-braind humors of <hi>Urban.</hi> He who now entreth <hi>Rome,</hi> may see a Pope turn'd Armiger, now in his decrepit times, one that takes up Armes then, when he should meditate how to lay down his life to nature; And which is worse, he thinks all this to be according to the dictamen of reason, so that <hi>Vrban</hi> the Eighth never doth that which he believes, but believes in that which he doth, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that at the same time when he tears <hi>Italy</hi> to pieces, and snatcheth the state of another, he publisheth his actions to be right, his intentions holy, and that all tends to the service of God, and the object of good; as if the formality of good in his Idea were different from that which is in the opinion of other men. But I omit many extravagances wherwith this capricious soul hath abusd my last patience. Once he setled a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution within himself, not to give any satisfaction at all to the Princes of Christendome, notwithstanding, that I often put him in mind that this was the basis whereon was founded the conservation of Christian obedience. Another time he resolved to create no more Cardinalls, it may be to merit the more of the Church of God by abolishing so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse a generation; but he repented himself afterwards of this, for no other reason, but because I opposd him in this resolution. If a tutelar Angell can suffer greater contempts, tell me, O thou Apostle of God? I find that the reputation of Angelicall custody is too much engagd in continuing to stand about him thus: Therfore in despair of his amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49798:102"/>
I have given over all care of his person that I should not delay my return to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> having understood the complaints of the Tutelar Angell of <hi>Urban,</hi> enters <hi>Rome,</hi> but an accident befell him which enforcd him to fly, and as he was going along another Angell comes in his way, whom he encounters with these expressions.</p>
               <p>YOu come, O Heavenly Messenger, peradventure to charge me from his Divine Majesty that I should avoid <hi>Rome:</hi> Behold how I have left her already before your comming; for divine inspirations forerun the very flight of Angells: But now that I am come out of <hi>Rome,</hi> let's repose a while, and I wil relate unto you the unexpected cause of my hasty departure. You know, O Angell of God, that I was sent from Heaven to Earth to hear the complaints of Mortalls, and to form a proces against this adulterons naughty Spouse: I lighted to this purpose in many places, wher having fully understood by all degrees of people her dissolute deportments, to confirm with mine own eyes what came from other tongues, I resolvd at last to come to the City of <hi>Rome</hi> it self. I passd too and fro at first in the froc of a Frier, There, as I went through a little blind Hamlet, I was calld in to confesse a dying Cardinall, which gave me warning, that the habit descrying me to be a religious person, twas likely, that entring so to <hi>Rome,</hi> I might (according to the custome) be questiond for the Patent of my Orders, or the License of my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours; I hereupon to evade the telling of any lye, held it expedient to lay down the Froc and take my Sword: So I came into <hi>Rome</hi> intending to lodge in some Covent of Friers, who being usd to thrust themselves into worldly affaires more than the Seculars themselves, I thought I could there very leisurely have a free and exact information of all things, specially because the freedom of speech is retird now into Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters for more security, in regard of the extream rigour which is usd to punish those who speak any thing against the Court. The Monastery where I was lodgd was famous for the study of Letters, and so it was frequented by many Learned men; But the greatest concours was of Strangers, who so abound in <hi>Rome</hi> of all Nations where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to know what conceit Forrenners had of that Church, I disputed often upon some point of Religion: There happened to come thither a Turk, rather to hear, as I imagine, the noise of the disputation, than to inform his judgment; so I askd him his opinion of Christian Religion, wherunto beyond all expectation, he answered thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amongst the Turks it is held for certain that God doth favour those people most, where he is truly ador'd; so, from the prosperity of the Turkish Empire, we inferr, that our faith is good, and the observance of it not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to God. Touching the Christians Religion, we have an opinion, that she was not naught, untill she was adulterated, and made naught by Christians themselves: But in the state she is now in this City, we believe her to be abhominable to God Almighty, specially since we see that of late she goes annihilating and mouldring away by little and little, by her own inward and</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:49798:103"/>
                  <hi>endlesse discords.</hi> Such was the conclusion of the Turk, which made me, I confesse, to marvell not a little, while I observed, that even those who professe not much knowledge, can deduce from far-fetchd Principles Consequences so near the truth.</p>
               <p>Having had his opinion, I went on in making a further scrutiny, and I fell to expostulate with a Greek, who was usd to repair to <hi>Rome</hi> for the opportunity of studying in <hi>Clementine</hi> Colledg, who answered to my interrogatories thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Roman and Greek Churches are Sisters issued from one Father, but the Greek is the first born, and I know not by what wiles the Roman came to take away her birthright. For this cause they live in most grievous disgusts one with another; But the one enjoyes the possession of all her Paternall goods, wheras the other lives as</hi> Esau <hi>did excluded, and under the dominion of another. Touching the particular customes of the Roman Church, I say nothing; for the that censures her in this City, shews he knows not his own danger, And he who approves her carriage, understands not the Law of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With such words the Greek satisfied my demands. As touching the opportunity which was offered me to mingle speech with a Frenchman upon the same subject, I understood his conceit thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The name of the</hi> Church <hi>is reverenced by a great part of the Kingdome of</hi> France, <hi>but the wisedom of our Governors hath never permitted the Pope to extend that excesse of pre-dominion beyond the Alps, which he doth exercise in</hi> Italy; <hi>for our policy is supported by particular Gallican rites: And the reason is, because the French being naturally impatient, and now that nere halfe</hi> France <hi>(to withdraw it self from under the Roman yoak) is infected with Heresy, certainly if the Pope should exercise upon the Consciences of that spritfull people the tyranny he doth exercise in</hi> Italy, <hi>the rest of that great Kingdome would fall from him quite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such were the expressions of the Frenchman, which did stir in me a curiosity by way of opposition, to hear what the Spaniard would say. Nor was it difficult for me to obtain my desire, by meeting with a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Sevill,</hi> who frequented the same Convent, I entred into his friendship, and he rendred me satisfied by such discours.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friend, to serve you I will speak beyond the customes of this Nation, with all ingenuity of heart: The reverence which the Spaniards do professe to the Roman Church, may be considered in two manners, inward and outward: If you ask me of the inward reverence, suppose it to be not unlike that of other people who have full knowledge of her Customes (The Spaniards being of a genius apt to esteem things as they are in value) But if you ask me of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reverence, knew, that the Spanish Nation in extern appearance shew themselves very observant of the Roman Church, because that having found her alwaies most partiall to the interests of their Crowns, they hold themselves obligd by termes of gratitude to correspond with her at least in outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance. My King knows well how available for depressing of the suspected greatnes of his Subjects hath bin the pretext of the holy inquisition: He lives mindfull of that promptitude shewd in the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>to deny an absolution to the House of</hi> Bourbon, <hi>untill he had conformd himself to the</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:49798:103"/>
Austrian <hi>satisfaction; And lastly he knows how much to this very howr the pragmaticall Iesuits have serv'd him to dilate in evry part, (with their own advantage) the bounds of the</hi> Castilian <hi>Empire; So that in contemplation of all these respects, the</hi> Spaniards <hi>hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs oblig'd to reverence the Roman-Church, in exterior appearance at least, though she were far wors than she is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the <hi>Spaniard</hi> did terminat his censure, while my dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which desisted not to procure all punctuall advertisements brought me to discourse with an <hi>English-man,</hi> who gave this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Answer: <hi>Sir, I am a declared Enemy of the Roman Church, therfore, I presume, my words can gain no credit with you; but if you desire to know what respects this Church finds Northward, read our Doctors and perchance your curiosity will be fully satisfied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus O Angell of God, I endeavour'd in <hi>Rome</hi> to bring to perfection the Proces which was committed to my charge against the adultrous spouse; And passing one Morning by a Church, where they wer casting out a Devill, I went in because of the noise, and then the ill Spirit knew my person, and began to cry out, her's S. <hi>Paul,</hi> her's S. <hi>Paul;</hi> Truly he is com in an ill time from Heaven, to view the state of that Church for which he shed so much sweat; good Saint, what motives brought him to this lower World? was it to see how his labours fructified? Ah, the pure grains of that Doctrine which his eloquence sow'd in the Vineyard of the Lord are turn'd to tares, and becom food for ravenous Birds such as these are, who stand about me now, to disconjure me with their hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous noise. Upon this cry the Priests began to fix their looks upon me, wherupon, fearing to be discovered, I softly rotir'd; but the words took such impressions in the mind of the Exorcist, that he did conjure the Spirit by violent threats to manifest who I was, who being not able to resist the violence confess'd I was S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who by resumption of humane shape (he knew not why) wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred now upon Earth; The Priest had no sooner knowledge herof, but he presently found means to give notice to the Pope; A little after, my lodging being found out by spies (wherof ther are a multitude in <hi>Rome</hi>) I suddenly perceiv'd a Courtier making to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and breathing out these words; O holy <hi>Paul,</hi> in the name of <hi>Urban</hi> the Eight I com to do you reverence; He is well informed of the condition of your being here: He earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires that you would be pleas'd to favour his House with your presence, for he is ambitious to have a stranger of so high a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity for his Guest. The Courtier spoke to me, O Angell of God, thus in very proper phrase; for in these times Saints use to be call'd strangers in the state Ecclesiastique; whither I was astonish'd or no to see my self thus surpriz'd and discover'd, judge you; I thank'd his Beatitude in the best manner I could, for his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous offer, and excus'd my self not to be able to receive that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in regard I was of necessity to depart from <hi>Rome</hi> within a a few howres: when I had disintangled my self thus from the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49798:104"/>
I call'd my thoughts to counsell, and feeling, that my heart did presage me som sinister accident, I resolved upon flight; and I was gon but few paces further, when the same Courtier came again and told me thus; <hi>Urban</hi> the Eighth, O holy <hi>Paul,</hi> doth remand me to you, to second his first invitation, but if in case you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd not to grace his Palace with your presence, I have order to propose another request unto you: In your Epistles we read, O Apostle of God, certain passages which manifestly contradict the humors of our holy Father <hi>Urban</hi> the Eighth, he prays you to mend them, because it is not fitting that <hi>Paul</hi> should ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nsay the will of <hi>Peters</hi> successor: And if you desire to know which are those passages, one among the rest is, that, <hi>Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. Urban</hi> the Eighth would, that from this universall propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition the souls of Popes should be exempted; He thinking it not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the Popes shold be subordinate to any other Law, but that of their own affections and fancy, for so their actions shold not be censur'd by every sensles man, as they are ever and anon now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes; His Holines also much desires, that the words be utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pung'd, which assigning to every Bishop his own incumbencys, do speak in particular, <hi>Diaconos habeant non turpe lucrum facientes,</hi> Let them have Deacons not given to base lucre. These periods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please in a high measure <hi>Urban</hi> the Eighth, for he of necessity must have about him his Nephew Cardinalls and to grow rich. Here the Courtier stop'd, when I poor <hi>Paul</hi> fell to discours with my self thus: See, thou art in danger to be entrappd, notwithstanding that thou hast been confirm'd in the state of grace, but what could be expected lesse in <hi>Rome?</hi> perceiving at last that he attended no answer, I put my self to reason with him thus: O Papall messenger, the busines which you propound to me, is of no light moment; for he who is tender of his own repute, cannot be easily induced to unsay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; you know that my Doctrin hath run through the World till this day without alteration, Now what will people say to see it now differ from times past! And who will not perswade himself that the alteration proceeds rather from the caprichio of some convicted Hereticks, than from <hi>Pauls</hi> Pen. Moreover to what purpose will it be to vary Apostolicall Doctrins, when the Popes without any regard to them do operat still according to their own fancies? But now that his Beatitude doth desire this superfluous alteration, I will not faile to serve him in the best maner that God shall inspire me. The Courtier departed with this answer, which he took for a promise; but I to reserve my self to execute what God had injoyn'd me did immediately fly away from <hi>Rome,</hi> being warn'd from Heaven so to do. I was scarce out of the Citty, when I remembred to have left my Sword behind, and being in suspense with my self, whether I shold return to fetch it or no, I spyed coming after me, one who was also a forrener in the same Convent where I had lodgd, and had often shewed me arguments of love, who coming near me, cryed out, friend, begon, begon, I come after you of purpose to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49798:104"/>
tell you, that you were scarce gon, but another Courtier came to seek you, and inform'd of your flight, he carried news therof to the Pope, and a little after the Pope himself came to your lodging, who finding not your person, took away your Sword, saying in a kind of choler, that if <hi>Pauls</hi> Pen refuse to serve him his Sword shall. This Sword shall force Princes to bend and bow at my feet; This, this shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <hi>Castro,</hi> subdu <hi>Parma,</hi> and shew the world that ther is no neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of reason, where the edge of a brandishing Sword shall make a way. Giving thousand thanks to my frend, who knew not what <hi>Paul</hi> nor what Sword the Pope spake of, I took my leave of him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued my flight, being troubled in my thoughts, that my arms shold be left in such a hand which imployes them for the service of his own tyrannicall affections to the universall scandall of Christianity. If it were possible, O Angell of God, to bend him to the voyce of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, I could wish you to go and inspire him to peace; But <hi>Urban</hi> hath too too refractory a soul; therfore I hold it more expedient, that you wold please to diffuse your inspirations amongst the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> to incite them to take out of his hands these Armes, which were taken from me without reason, and are now drawn out against them without justice. To this end I have fram'd a Letter, addressed to the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes wherunto I held it not much necessary to affix my name, because it is known already I am on Earth, and it is of this tenor.</p>

                        <hi>URban</hi> the Eighth, O Princes, transported with the violence of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known wrath, took possession of my Sword, of purpose to make use of it against the quietnes of your States; If you will not resolve to take it out of his hands, I doe exhort you in the name of the Divine Majesty to do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is not fit, that that blade which is designed for the conversion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidells, should be stained in your blood; Nor let that idle scruple amuse you, that he is your shepheard, for the true shepheards do guide their flocks with gentle <hi>wands</hi> not with <hi>weapons.</hi> Remember that <hi>Isaac</hi> suffered himself to be slain with the hands of his Father, to be sacrificed to God, not to the fury and passion of his Father. And S. <hi>Peter</hi> left a Fishers knife behind him to be us'd against Fish, which are not creatures of our element. Encourage your selfs therefore by his Counsell and mine, neither think yee the designe difficult, for although <hi>Urban</hi> seem furious, yet he that is not habituated to handle weapons may easily let loose his hold.

               <p>This is the tenor O Angell of God of this Letter, which I beseech you to carry (with your inspirations) to the hearts of Christian Princes. I in the interim, before I return to Heaven, must go and visit <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> to kiss that place again, wher the very inanimate <hi>stones</hi> being more gratefull than <hi>Men,</hi> keep <hi>yet</hi> fresh the memory of Divine Mercy.</p>

               <p>THe aforesayd Confederacy being made between the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> in behalf of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> his spirits were so heightned ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, specially the Republic of <hi>Venice</hi> being engagd therin, that he put spurrs to his Horse, and entred like a whirlwind into the Papall Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, finding no opposition at all in his passage; He incamped the first night not far from <hi>Urban Fort,</hi> whence Don <hi>Taddeo</hi> the <hi>Nephew</hi> had got away upon the newes of his march; From the felicity of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning his heart being elevated, he resolves to push on his fortunes to the very walls of <hi>Rome;</hi> All Forts, and Townes at his approch did open their gates to receave him rather for a frend than a foe; And although the Countrey could not choose but be damnified by the march of such a tumultuary sudden unfurnish'd Army, yet as one observ'd, the Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals of the Ecclesiastic state are so accustomed to hard usage from their own Governors, that the domages of forren troops seem'd but light unto them; yet ther were such strict rigid injunctions, and martiall comands given out for regulating the Army that none durst commit any rapin or outrage under pain of life.</p>
               <p>The Duke with these inexpected successes advanced towards the walls of <hi>Rome</hi> with 3000 well appointed horse, which caus'd a great deal of confusion and terror in the Citty; Pope <hi>Urban,</hi> with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls and chiefest of the Roman Inhabitants, retir'd to the Castle of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> where for more security they stowed their tresure, and richest moveables; Thus that <hi>Rome</hi> which in times pass'd, could look <hi>Hanniball,</hi> and the <hi>Gaules</hi> in the face, doth now shake as it were into a quivering Palsie at the approch of 3000 horse only which came to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat the quarrell of the <hi>Farneses;</hi> In this confusion ther was not one wold propose the facing of the insolent enemy, evry one be took himself to stand on his gard, and the defensive part; Evry gate look'd like a <hi>Diocesse</hi> having som <hi>Bishop</hi> appointed to keep it; Herupon Pope <hi>Urban</hi> sent Cardinall <hi>Spada</hi> to propound a Trety with the Duke, which Negotiation was carried so politiquely that it took effect, and so a truce was agreed upon for the present; so the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> return'd, having reap'd no other fruit by this march, but the name to have displayed his Colours almost in the face of <hi>Rome;</hi> which, as the most serious sort of men were of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, became him least of any Prince in regard he was a Vassall of the Church, his Progenitors having receav'd such temporall possessions from Her.</p>
               <p>This little War produc'd good effects in <hi>Italy</hi> at last, for it took off afterwards various sorts of discontentments, these temporall Armes took off the censures of the <hi>spirituall</hi> Armes under which divers Princes lay; For by the vigorous interposition of <hi>France</hi> a Trety was to be held at <hi>Venice,</hi> where the Dukes of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Modena</hi> came in person, and Cardinall <hi>Bichi,</hi> a person <hi>par negotio,</hi> being a moderat grave pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man came as Plenipotentiary from the Pope, who in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of this busines carried himself with that dexterity and height of wisdom, that in one afternoon he made an end of all differences; The <hi>Signorie</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> was to have her ancient Elogium set up in the

                  <hi>Sala Regia</hi> in the Vatican, It was to be renew'd, and inscrib'd in a larger Table; The Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> was to have the Excomunication taken off, and for the future, the Churchmen shold be subject to new imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as well as the laity, provided that his Holines be acquainted ther with before hand, and his consent had; the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> was absolv'd from the spirituall censures, and got the Gabells of som places in right to the Duchy of <hi>Ferrara;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had the Church censures taken off of him, and got further time for the repayment of his arreares putting in caution accordingly; Lastly the little Republic of <hi>Luca</hi> fish'd so well in these troubled waters, that she also got her-self absolv'd from the Church censures which lay upon her: Thus the <hi>Italian</hi> like a wise Nation compos'd in a short time so many differences that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb'd the public peace, which was don by the sage management of the <hi>Venetian,</hi> as allso by the discreet comportment of the aforesayed Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiary Cardinall <hi>Bichi</hi> a <hi>Sienese</hi> born, a kind of War having lasted above two yeers, in all which time ther were not 200. men lost in all, which argues that the <hi>Italian</hi> is more parsimonious of his bloud, and more carefull of his life, than either <hi>German, French</hi> or <hi>English</hi> who in <hi>their</hi> civill Wars have lost I cannot tell how many thousands in a far shorter time especially the <hi>last,</hi> which shews that they are not so indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of nature, and of that image which God Almighty hath imprinted upon man, as the <hi>Italian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOt long after that the Republic of <hi>Venice</hi> had got out of these bryars, &amp; that principally by her intervention the Pope and the <hi>Italian</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were reconcild, an illfavourd black cloud began to engender against her in the Levant, the Mahumetan Moon appeerd red, and her hornes very sharp, which portended windy and tempestuous wether as it happend afterwards and continueth so to this day; The vapor that went to condense this hideous clowd issued first from the Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> who had taken at Sea som Gallies and Caramusalls that carried pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers upon a Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecha,</hi> among whom was one of <hi>Ibraims Sultana's,</hi> and another of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> race.

                  <hi>Ibriam</hi> the great <hi>Turk</hi> upon news herof storm'd mightily, and rag'd so far that he vow'd a revenge; Therupon he sent for the Christian Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors that resided at that time in the <hi>Port,</hi> relating unto them by the mouth of his Visier what affronts he had receiv'd of the <hi>Malteses,</hi> and that he wold peck that little scabb of an Island into the bottom of the Sea, disguising his displesure all the while he bore against the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who was more in his thoughts; so a great Fleet was provided against <hi>Malta</hi> as was given out, though his aym was against <hi>Candy;</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Sackvile Crow</hi> then Ambassador in <hi>Constantinople</hi> for the King of great <hi>Britain,</hi> had such choice intelligence that he acquainted the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Bailio</hi> herof, and writ allso to the late Earl of <hi>Arundell</hi> who was then in <hi>Padua</hi> to give advice herof to the Senat, that the <hi>Turk</hi> arm'd for <hi>Candy:</hi> but the Senat having no notice therof from their own <hi>Bailio</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:49798:106"/>
made no account of the intelligence, wherin the World adjudg'd <hi>Venice</hi> to com far short of her wonted circumpection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For that Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer the <hi>Turks</hi> with a formidable Fleet and Land-Army did in a maner surprize <hi>Canea</hi> the second <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>Candy,</hi> coming with such a resolution as if they came to meet a Victory and not expect one; The newes herof being brought to <hi>Ibraim</hi> it puff'd him up very much, though he was over-heard to mutter, That if he overcame so often he shold lose all at last, for above 50000 <hi>Turks,</hi> wherof the third part were <hi>Ianizaries,</hi> perish'd in that expedition. The next Sommer the Bassa of <hi>Bosnia</hi> tumbled into <hi>Dalmatia</hi> with a great land Army, but he was repell'd with much vigor, so that in regard he did no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit, he was sent for to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> wher <hi>Ibraim</hi> caus'd him to be strangled.</p>
               <p>The Republic being now sadly engag'd in a War against so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent an enemy, betook Her-self to Her Prayers more fervently, making a vow to build a Chappell to Saint <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> a holy man, who had liv'd about 400 yeers since in <hi>Venice,</hi> which She perform'd with much magnificence.</p>
               <p>The next Sommer She had notable successe against the <hi>Turk</hi> in <hi>Dalmatia</hi> in divers places, and made Her-self Mistresse of <hi>Clissa</hi> a place of mighty strength, and much consequence; being frontire twixt <hi>Bosnia</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> The Baron of <hi>Dagenfelt</hi> was employed by the Republic in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> but in this expedition of <hi>Clissa</hi> Generall <hi>Foscolo,</hi> Count <hi>Schotto,</hi> and Proveditor <hi>Georgio</hi> were chief; <hi>Mehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met Bei</hi> Sangiac of <hi>Clissa</hi> after the Articles of rendition were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, was to send four Hostages whereof <hi>Filippovich</hi> was chief, who after fled away, whereupon the Sangiac himself stood for him and sent a Letter of this humble tenor to <hi>Foscolo.</hi>

                  <hi>TO the most mercifull, and preordain'd by God to all good fortune, the most excellent Lord Generall of the</hi> Venetians, <hi>the most humble reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Master</hi> Mehemet Bei <hi>Sangiac of</hi> Clissa. <hi>After that we had tasted of your Excellencies grace, and concluded the Trety,</hi> Filippovich <hi>hath betray'd us, whose face ought for ever to freeze with shame, but his base flight hath not only stain'd his own honor, but it hath allso don us much wrong; if you think that I had any hand in his escape, I stand to your mercy, for we are all in your hands, and I will be responsible for the fugitif. I attend your answer, and God exalt you to higher honors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the taking of this Town the Christian Soldiers were so flesh'd in bloud, and heated for losses they had formerly receav'd, for a great many of the <hi>Morlacchi</hi> perish'd in the action, that the Generall could not hold them within the bounds of obedience, but they fell furiously upon the <hi>Turks</hi> after they had entred the Town, and hack'd them to peeces, notwithstanding the Articles to the contrary. Generall <hi>Foscolo</hi> being got into the Town planted the <hi>Venetian</hi> Standard in the Market place, and then kneeling upon the <hi>Turkish</hi> Banners, he heard Masse sayd by the Archbishop of <hi>Scutari,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Te Deum</hi> was solemnly Sung, and so lowd that the very Heavens
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49798:106"/>
ecchoed with the sound. 700 <hi>Ianizaries</hi> were slain and above 300 wounded in this siege, and about 200 Christians.</p>
               <p>Ther was a great debate in the Senat at <hi>Venice</hi> touching <hi>Clissa,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she shold still stand or be demolish'd, they who perswaded a demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition usd these arguments. <hi>That</hi> Clissa <hi>though never so famous and well fortified yet was she known to be expugnable, insomuch that the</hi> Turk <hi>might recover her by the same meanes as the</hi> Venetian <hi>got her; That</hi> Ibraim <hi>finding his greatnes to be eclipsd herby, wold venture all his forces to regain her; Or that happly the Turkish Army might leave her behind and march on to</hi> Spalato <hi>or</hi> Tragurio, <hi>and so cut off all succors from her; That in case a peace ensued,</hi> Clissa <hi>must be rendred, therfore to bestow any money to fortifie Her was superfluous; The</hi> Venetian <hi>tresure shold be employd to strengthen her own Forts, and not the enemies; lastly, that it stood more with the prudence of the Republic to conserve rather than conquer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They of the contrary opinion alleg'd <hi>that</hi> Clissa <hi>was allwayes esteem'd a thing inexpugnable for her situation, as allso for the valour of the puissant</hi> State <hi>that now holds her; that she hath repell'd in former times an Army of</hi> 20000 <hi>Combatants, that she stood very conveniently to stave off the</hi> Turk <hi>from rushing into</hi> Dalmatia; <hi>Moreover it wold tend to the dishonor of the Republic to raze</hi> Clissa, <hi>in regard the World will judg that she did it for want of strength or courage to preserve her; That</hi> Venice <hi>was us'd to shew her power not only upon the ruines, but allso within the fortifications of the enemy; That the keeping of</hi> Clissa <hi>will render a peace more easy; That the Soldiers wold lose the comfort they use to receave in a conquer'd place, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>As by Land, so by Sea allso the Republic bore up stoutly and successfully against her formidable Foe this yeer, for meeting with a great Fleet of Turkish Gallies and Mahoons in the <hi>Egean</hi> Sea, she chas'd them into the Bay of <hi>Foggia (Phocis</hi> of old) where som English Ships, and a Scottish Vessell did her som signall service; for the Turkish Fleet having fled into the bottom of the Bay, the <hi>Iani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaries</hi> ran ashore, insomuch that the Captain <hi>Aga</hi> set out a Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, wherin he promised such a reward for any that wold bring the Head of a dead <hi>Ianizary,</hi> or his living Body: Had the <hi>Venetian</hi> Fleet poursued the <hi>Turks</hi> into the bottom of the Bay, in all probability they might have don the <hi>Turks</hi> much mischief at this conjuncture of time; but it seems the Generalls Comission extended not so far, and <hi>Venice</hi> loves to have her Comissions punctually observ'd. The Sommer following the Republic did hold the great <hi>Turks</hi> Nose so close to the Grindstone, that his Gallies durst not peep out of the <hi>Dardanelli</hi> into the <hi>Egean</hi> Sea; yet hath he powr'd new forces since into <hi>Canea</hi> by the Gallies of <hi>Rhodes, Sio, Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Negrepont.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>TOuching the interests and disposition of the Dukes of <hi>Toscany,</hi> in regard they were first introduc'd and establishd in that Dutchy by the Armes of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> they hold their chiefest interest to be a dependency upon that House, adhering allwayes to that party with money &amp; Armes; yet this tie was not so strong but it slackned sometimes, when public liberty was at the stake; wisely considering that the oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their neighbours wold not exempt them, but reserve them for a more certain ruin. Whereupon <hi>Cosmo</hi> the first stuck not to assist the <hi>Genoways</hi> in a quarrell that was abetted by the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> And after him Duke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> with great sums of moneys assisted <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and Henry the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> perswading the latter to break with <hi>Savoy,</hi> that by possession of the Marchisat of <hi>Salucces, France</hi> might alwayes have a gate open to <hi>Italy;</hi> And <hi>Cosmo</hi> the second to the same purpose supported the Duke of <hi>Mantoua</hi> against him of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy;</hi> But this present Duke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> although he makes shew to breath nothing els than a kind of religious observance to the <hi>Austrian</hi> Family, yet he hath utterly refusd at present to engage against <hi>France,</hi> whereupon in policy he disarmd those Gallies wherewith he was usd formerly to scowr some of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Seas, to prevent that neither Kings shold desire his assistance.</p>
               <p>TOuching the interests of the Republic of <hi>Genoa,</hi> since by meanes of <hi>Andrew Doria</hi> She drew her neck out of the <hi>French</hi> yoke, and put Her self under the protection of <hi>Spain,</hi> She hath still mingled interests with that Crown; <hi>Charles</hi> the first finding that the Citty of <hi>Genoa</hi> stood
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49798:109"/>
very commodiously for him to convey his forces to <hi>Italy,</hi> sollicited often <hi>Andrew Doria</hi> to consent to the erecting of a sortresse, which, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that he was movd thereunto by the Emperour both with menaces and money, he wold never agree unto; whereupon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour thought upon another new and more ingenious way to engage that Citty, by putting a bridle of Gold into her mouth insteed of that Iron one he thought of at first; for ever since <hi>Genoa</hi> serves <hi>Spain</hi> for a scale to convey her treasure to high and low <hi>Germany,</hi> whereby her bank of S. <hi>George</hi> hath so swelld, and the whole Citty hath so enriched her self that it is wonderfull; for it may be sayed that most of the <hi>Indian</hi> Gold hath pass'd ever since through their fingers, so that much thereof must needs stick unto them, by the use the <hi>Spaniard</hi> gives them when they advance any sum by way of <hi>assiento</hi> as they call it, untill his fleets com from the <hi>Indies;</hi> So that they have a saying in <hi>Spain</hi> that the <hi>Genoways</hi> did use to carry their consciences in thin Pocketts, but the weight of the <hi>Indian</hi> Gold hath broken thorough, so that now ther is neither bottom or bounds left in them.</p>
               <p>Now, ther is no state in <hi>Italy</hi> that's more capable to incommode the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> than that of <hi>Genova,</hi> and to put him in a hazard to lose <hi>Milan,</hi> and consequently the other territories he enjoyes in <hi>Italy,</hi> which She may do if She denies Him her ports, and hinder the landing of his Ships upon her coasts, or by shutting the passages in that long list of Land which is calld the River of <hi>Genoa;</hi> Therefore the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> because he wold not depend soly upon the affection of that City, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up a Fort at <hi>Monaco,</hi> and another at <hi>Finale,</hi> thereby, if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, to reduce the Republic to an entire dependence upon <hi>Him;</hi> In the last War with <hi>Savoy</hi> the <hi>Genoways</hi> felt the benefit of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> protection, which by way of diversion preservd them from much danger. Therefore in point of interest <hi>Genoa</hi> may be sayed to be an inseparable confederat of the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> both for profit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, She is in relation to him like a Partridg under a Faulcons wings, as the little Republic of <hi>Luca</hi> is to the Duke of <hi>Florence,</hi> who can seize upon her when he list, but that he finds it more advantagious unto him to permit Her to continu an industrious <hi>Republic</hi> still of Herself.</p>
               <p>TOuching the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> their interest hath bin allwayes to keep good intelligence with <hi>France,</hi> therfore they never swervd from Her friendship, but once in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, when by the inducements of a <hi>Portuguez</hi> Wife, <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> refusd pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to the <hi>French</hi> King, which cost him afterwards very deare; And it had cost him much more, unlesse he had comported himself with extraordinary cunning and artifice, which made Him to be termd the <hi>little Fox of the Mountaines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe Dukes of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> as the rest of the Minor Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> were usd to professe a totall dependence upon the house of <hi>Austria;</hi> yet Duke <hi>Ferdinand</hi> a wise Prince, knowing that in the first motions of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> the designes of <hi>Savoy</hi> were fomented by Offices underhand
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:49798:109"/>
from the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for his own advantage, he chose rather to defend himself from <hi>Savoy</hi> without the <hi>Spaniards</hi> help: but D. <hi>Carlo</hi> succeeding he was forcd to adhere to the King of <hi>France</hi> for his safety, in regard of divers Garrisons he had up and down <hi>Monferrat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe Dukes of <hi>Parma,</hi> though thrust out of <hi>Piacenza</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. and having bin beaten by him in <hi>Parma,</hi> they had good reason to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the interests of <hi>France,</hi> by whom they had receavd both their conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and restablishment, more than once, yet they thought safer still to stick unto <hi>Him</hi> that was Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> till now of late that this present Duke is much <hi>Frenchified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TOuching the politicall interests, and inclinations of the Duke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena,</hi> and the State of <hi>Luca,</hi> they have more confidence in the House of <hi>Austria</hi> than in the French, and so they apply themselfs accordingly in point of respect and compliances: Nor indeed can it be denied but all <hi>Italie</hi> is beholding to the Spaniard in divers respects, as for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing of <hi>Tresure,</hi> and increse of <hi>Trade;</hi> as allso that his outpoising power keeps the inferior Princes in peace, and from encroching one upon the other, lest if he shold strike in by way of Auxiliary, he might swallow up both parties; yet, it may be observd, that the Italians respect the Spaniard out of meer politicall interest, not out of any affection; so that all of them would restrain his power if they could, but like the Mice in the Fable, they cannot find any that will venture first to hang the Bell about the Catts neck.</p>
               <p>HAving by these short expatiations given a few touches of the rest of the Principalities of <hi>Italy</hi> in point of <hi>politicall interests,</hi> we now return to poursue and perfect the survay of the <hi>Signorie</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular allso; which, taking her power by Land and Sea conjunctly, is acknowledgd to be the strongest knot of strength in <hi>Italie,</hi> if we consider the reaches of her Dominions, with the firmenes and solidity of her establishment, as allso the prudent and cautious conduct of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
               <p>Now touching her <hi>interests,</hi> and disposition towards the two great Kings forementiond, all her counsells and designs, ever since the entrance of forren Armies into <hi>Italie,</hi> have tended to conserve her own liberty and greatnes: It being an old observation, that all States do retain still the humor of their first Founders; as ambition, and desire of warr appeerd allwayes in the Citty of <hi>Rome,</hi> because her first Founders were full of that humor; But those of <hi>Venice</hi> being not transported with such exorbitant thoughts, but addicted to peace, trafic, wealth and repose, having bin formerly harassd by the long calamities of <hi>Italie,</hi> and the inundation of barbarous peeple, when they had gott into those safe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirements, the first and fundamentall maxime of policy they proposd to themselfs, was to maintain their common freedom, and live secure. And herin the Republic of <hi>Venice</hi> may be sayed to differ from the late States of <hi>Holland</hi> allso, whose first foundation was layed in bloud by Armes and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:49798:110"/>
Warr; Now it is a Rule that <hi>Eodem modo, Res conservatur, quo acquiritur;</hi> By the same meanes things are conservd wherby they are gott; In so much that if <hi>Holland</hi> follow the humors of her first Founders, She will love <hi>warr</hi> better than <hi>peace,</hi> and happly be incited therunto by an old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy that runns of her;</p>

               <p>Now, one of the wayes wherby the Republic of <hi>Venice</hi> hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourd to preserve her Maydenhead and freedom so long, hath bin to keep the power of the potentst Princes in a counterpoise; wherby She hath often adapted her designes, and accommoded Her-self to the condition of the times, and frequently changd thoughts, will, frends, and enemies; She hath bin allwayes usd to suspect any great power, to fear much, and confide little, to be perpetually vigilant of the operations of others, and accordingly to regulat her own consultations and proceedings; wherby She hath bin often accusd of exces in circumspection.</p>

kind of <hi>Regal power</hi> in the Duke, an <hi>Aristocracy</hi> in the Senat, And a <hi>Democracy</hi> in the great Councell. But <hi>Ianotus</hi> who hath described the state of that Common-wealth from her first originalls, and written most accuratly of her secrecies of Goverment convinceth <hi>Contarenus,</hi> and accuseth him of grosse errors; He demonstrates therefore that before <hi>Sebastiano Cyani</hi> who was Doge of <hi>Venice,</hi> which is about 300 yeers since, the Republic then was plainly a Monarchicall Goverment. <hi>Contarenus</hi> averrs, that She hath remaind about 800 yeers in the very same condition She is now in; <hi>Paulus Magustius</hi> speakes of 1200 yeers, which <hi>Ianotus</hi> proves to be false out of the public Acts, and the History of the Times.</p>
               <p>Howsoever it be, It is most evident that, <hi>in statu quo nunc</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of <hi>Venice</hi> is a pure <hi>Aristocracy:</hi> For by the description of the Citty and the cense that was made of the Inhabitants 30 yeers since, ther were about 60000. Cittizens excepting Women, and Children that had not exceeded seven yeers of Age; as also the <hi>Patricians</hi> in whom the power of the Republic is seated, whose nomber may amount to 4000. All kind of Churchmen are exempted out of this nomber, and young men under five and twenty, who have no accesse either to the great Councell, or the administration of any Office, unlesse upon request made by their <hi>Seniors</hi> the same be obtaind; Nor is ther in the Assembly of the great Councell, which hath bin so long establishd both in our Ancestors, and late Progenitors times, more than 1500; but in former times ther were much fewer as appeers among the Historians; This Convention therefore of the <hi>Patricians,</hi> Gentry or Nobility hath the supreme power over all Lawes and Magistrats, of Peace and War, of last appeales, of life and death as <hi>Contarenus</hi> himself confesseth. Which being so who can doubt but this Republic is a pure <hi>Aristocracy?</hi> For if the better sort of men had nothing els but the power of the Law and Magistracy, it were argument enough to judg that it is an <hi>Optimacy</hi> as we taught before; since that the election of Magistrats, of the Senat, of the Colleges, of the <hi>Septemvirat,</hi> of the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> of the forty privat, and so many public Judges criminal and civil, depends meerly upon the grand councell of the Nobility or Gentry, and the rest meere precarian powers.</p>
               <p>The Duke is He, who being a Soverain Governor may be sayed only to want comand, for he can neither summon any one before him, or apprehend any by his sole comand, or demand any, nor hath He more power in any Colledg of Senators, whether great or small but only that he gives the last suffrage; nor can He open any Letters either from forren Princes, or any Magistrat, or Officer, nor admit or dismisse any Ambassadors without som of the Colledg of the <hi>Septemvirat,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemvirat;</hi> nor can He marry a stranger, or go out of the Citty of <hi>Venice</hi> without leave. Duke <hi>Falerio,</hi> because he married a Lady that was born out of the Dominions of the Republic without the consent of the Senat, was by the <hi>Decemvirat</hi> Councell sentencd to death, and executed; besides Him <hi>Sabellious</hi> enumerats twelve Dukes that either were slain in a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar tumult, or punishd when they abusd their power.</p>

               <p>This Citty above all other is worthy to be admired, as being singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar by Her self, and brooking no comparison with any other; For what other Citty soever hath bin either plesant by situation, or glorious in goodlines of buildings, yet it had som kind of resemblance with others; but only this being seated in the midst of the waters hath not any thing upon Earth to which it may be resembled, the rare position whereof being such, that it injoyeth the comodities of the waters, and the ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the Land, secure by being among the waves from Land assaults, and free by not being founded in the depths of the Sea from Maritim violences; So that whereas other Citties do keep and defend their Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens with Walls, Towers, and Gates, This being naked and without Ramparts, is not only secure Her-self, but rendereth allso with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable prudence such Citties secure as do sleep under Her wings. Among many other rare Edifices sumptuous as well in the richnes of the matter, as marvailous for the most singular curiosity of workmanship the Steeple of S. <hi>Mark</hi> is most miraculous, the same being so huge high and stately, that in faire wether it is seen and discernd by those that sayl from <hi>Istria</hi> 100 miles off; the speciall care and oversight wherof is comitted allwayes to a person of speciall quality, who hath for his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance 150. Crowns yeerly stipend.</p>
               <p>VVE will now descend to som particular customes of this <hi>Mayden</hi> Citty as her maner of marying, and of the fruits therof Her Christnings. Mariages among the Nobility ar for the most part al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes treted of by a third person, the Bride being never suffer'd as much as to see her future Husband, nor He Her, untill the mariage dower, and all things therunto appertaining, be fully agreed upon and concluded, which being don, the next morning the Bridegrome goeth to the Court of the Palace, and there the match being publish'd he receaveth well-wishing speeches, and salutations from such of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility as doe enter into the Pallace, and withall inviteth his frends to the house of the Brides Father, to be there at a certain time appointed in the afternoon; At the entry of the dore they are attended by the Bridegroom and his kinred, and brought up to a Hall wher ther are none but men only, and there the Bride is brought forth apparrell'd by an ancient custom all in white, her haires dischevell'd, and hanging about her sholdiers woven in and out with filletts of Gold; where being betroth'd with many solemn Ceremonies, She is led about the Hall with Flutes, Drums and other instruments, still dancing in a soft me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:49798:114"/>
then She boweth down to those that salute Her; Having so shew'd Her-self She goeth in &amp; returneth out again, If any men friends do chance to com that had not seen Her before, She comes out and presents Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, then She entreth to a <hi>Gondola,</hi> and being attended by divers other She goeth up and down to the Nunneries, specially to those where any of Her Kinred are reclusd; Now this shewing of Her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> self abroad is to no other end, but in regard of Her Children and sundry other things, it may after happen She may make Her Nuptialls apparant to all: At evry Wedding ther is a Gentleman or two calld <hi>Compari,</hi> that are as it were Masters of the Revells, because their charge is to see unto the Musik, and whatsoever other shewes or pastimes appertain to the Feast, the next Morning their Friends and Kinred present the new Married couple with sundry sorts of Restoratives and sweet Meates.</p>
               <p>THe Christnings in <hi>Venice</hi> are somewhat diffring from other places, for the Father inviteth not two God-fathers and a God-mother, or two God-mothers and a God-father, but as many as they list, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that somtimes ther have bin above 150 at a Christning, but to the end that this Goshipship shold no way be a bar or impediment among the Gentlewomen in matter of Mariage, it was by a Law ordained, that one Gentleman shold not take another Gentleman for his Goship, whence it cometh that when the Priest powreth the Water on the Childs Head, he first maketh mention of the Law, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth if ther be among the Goships any one of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility. Nor are ther any Women admitted to the Christning but only the Nurse, who hath the charge of the Child; The next day the Father sends to evry Goship a Marchpane, and evry of them sendeth back som present or other to the Child according to the custom of the Citty; Their greatest magnificence and charge, is at the nativity of the Child, for then they wonderfully exceed not only in the sumptuousnes of their Banquetts, but also in rich furniture, and adorning of their houses.</p>
               <p>Likewise ther is no place on Earth wher the Funerall of the meanest Cittizen is solemnizd with greater Ceremony and Expence; nor is ther any Countrey wher strangers find better entertainment, and live in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter security.</p>
               <p>The Plesures, Recreations and Pastimes of the Gentlemen are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds, among the rest they take great delight in Fowling making great matches who can kill most Fowle in a day, turning still the end therof to banqueting and plesure. They have Boats of purpose calld <hi>Fisolari</hi> so nam'd from <hi>Fisolo,</hi> which is the name of the Bird they seek after; In evry of these Boates they have six or eight servants appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell'd in blewish, or greenish garments, suited as nere as they can to the colour of the Water, These row the Boat up and down, turning her suddenly to evry side as they are commanded by their Masters, who sits close with his Peece or Bow wholy intentive upon his sport; If he chance to misse when he shooteth, the <hi>Fisolo</hi> divers under water, and where he riseth again thither they turn their Boats with much nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49798:114"/>
Divers Boates use to goe to this pastime, which is very chargeable to the Gentlemen; Upon their return they hang the Fowle they have killd out of the Window, as Hunters do upon their Dores the heads of Beares, Bores, Hares, taking it as a great reputation to kill more of these in a day than their fellowes can.</p>
               <p>The Dukes of <hi>Venice</hi> have by ancient priviledges confirmd by sundry Emperours, authority to create Erles and Knights, and likewise Poetts Laureat, with either of which dignities the Prince of <hi>Venice</hi> doth use to honor and reward persons of merit and virtu.</p>
               <p>The Dukes have oftentimes matchd in the greatest and royallest Houses of Christendom, which alliances with forren Princes growing suspected to the Commonwealth, ther was a Law made in the yeer 1327. that the Duke might not marry the Daughter of any Stranger, though by priviledg and adoption he had obtaind the right and title of a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Gentleman; And in the yeer 1383. it was ordaind that he shold not marry the Daughter, Sister or Kinswoman of any forren Prince, without the licence and consent of the great Councell.</p>
               <p>The Dukes of <hi>Venice</hi> were wont in times passd to honor themselfs with high and Princely titles, as calling themselfs <hi>Dukes of</hi> Venice, Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia <hi>and</hi> Croatia, <hi>Lords of a half part, and a quarter of the whole Roman Empire, &amp;c.</hi> which vanity of titles was taken away in the yeer 1360. and utterly prohibited, and this title only allowd, <hi>I. D. By the grace of God Duke of</hi> Venice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The common coin is stampd with the inscription of the Dukes name then in being, but it is against the Law that any Duke shold ingrave, imborder or paint his peculiar Coat of Armes in any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, Banners, Gallies, Seats of Justice, or public places of honor, but only within the Precincts of the Palace. Yet is He buried with all the Princely magnificence that may be: Being dead, His Bowells are taken out, and His Body embalmd, after which He is kept divers daies openly in the Hall attended by the Senators (as sayed before) His Herse being coverd over with a large Cloth of rich Gold, and his Sword and Spurres lying athwart of the Herse; He is wayted on to His Grave by all the Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternities of the Cittie, and the Churchmen with an innumerable company of Torches; Next follow the Officers and chief Servants of the Dukes Familie all apparrelld in black, with Hoods ore their heads, and a long train; Next them com the Senators all in Scarlett and grain, signifying the Cittie of <hi>Venice</hi> to be ever free, therfore ought not to mourn at the death of any Prince how virtuous soever: With this pomp they passe to Saint <hi>Marks</hi> Place, where the Beer is lifted up on high nine times that evry one might take his perpetuall farewell of Him; Then is He carried to the Church, and a solemn Funerall Oration is made for Him; then the Senators return to the Palace, and presently proceed to the Election of a new Duke, which they cannot do by the ancient constitution till the other be first under ground; and so <hi>Corruptio unius, est generatio al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius.</hi>

               <p>IT being the main designe of this Discours to make the Reader per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly acquainted with this <hi>Mayden</hi> Republic, it will not be amisse to insert here the Instructions that were given by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> to his Nuntio, when he was employd upon an extraordinary Legation to the Signorie of <hi>Venice;</hi> for it will conduce much to understand the stile of the Signorie, and compliances that must be usd in that Court.</p>
               <p>THe first Discours your Excellency shall hold with the Prince and Signorie of <hi>Venice</hi> shall ayme at two ends; The one, to expose unto his <hi>Serenity</hi> the plesure of his Holines, therin declaring the ocasion and aymes of your Legation; The other, to expresse the particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections you bear to that most excellent Signorie.</p>
               <p>Touching the first, it shall suffice that you follow the tenor and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of your Commission, having a speciall charge not to recede from it in any materiall point.</p>
               <p>Touching the second, it is referrd chiefly to your own election and judgment what to deliver, for endearing your self to the Duke, and Senators.</p>
               <p>And in generall you may say that what employment soever his <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> had cast upon you, you had esteemd it a high favor, being entirely addicted to Him, and the Holy Seat; But that you were far more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligd to his Holines, that He vouchsafd to employ you to his <hi>Serenity,</hi> and that most illustrious Republic, because you had a long desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the memory of that servitude, and high affections which the Arch-Bishop your Oncle had vowd to the Signorie, to whom both your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage and person will be ever well affected; Besides, you held it a great honor that you had to negotiat with a Prince so full of Majesty, and Grandeur, being the Head of the greatest, the most florishing, and best orderd Commonwealth in the world; In so much that after the service of his <hi>Sanctitie,</hi> you will preferr that of his <hi>Serenity</hi> before all other, and that you will be ever ready to make it good in effect, as well as in affection, and turn your words to actions, and that you stand there most ready to give proof therof; Moreover, that the bent of your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, and study will be to preserve, and improve the paternall love which his Holines beares towards that most noble Republic; that you love the very name of <hi>Venice;</hi> therfore nothing shall take greater room in your thoughts than to maintain the good intelligence, and union which is, and ought to be betwixt the Popedom and the Republic, in regard that the Princes of both aym at the same object, They have the same wills, and incumbency to conserve the authority of their States; That in order to this you will employ your main strength, with all your spirits, and that you will be so zealous herin as if you were born his Holines vassall, being very loth that your Oncle shold go before you but only in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:49798:115"/>
time in point of good will and affection towards that most illustrious <hi>Signorie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your own prudence shall direct you herin, and how to place your words, that they may be more or lesse moving to gain the amity and confidence of the Lords of the Senat, wherin <hi>gravity</hi> will advantage you much, and it may be, more than any thing els: In this first discours you are to mingle with your best dexterity som honorable mention of the Republiques Ambassador at <hi>Rome,</hi> and what contentment he gives to his holines in all Treaties, and how well he deserves of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; As allso what respect and benevolence all the Prelats of the <hi>Roman</hi> Court do professe unto him; This intimation shall serve you for two ends, for you will therby draw thanks from the Kinred of the sayd Ambassador, and making them your confidents they will further you in all your negotiations; Besides, you will therby oblige the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador himself, who will take ocasion to correspond with you in like civilities, therfore you must not fayl to give the sayed Ambassador here a solemn visit, and take conge of him, desiring that he wold comand you in any service to his Kinred and Friends, whither you are going, endeavouring thereby to make the deepest impressions you can upon his soul, That you go to <hi>Venice</hi> with a resolution to serve and honor him and his upon all occurrences, wherof you are to desire him to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them by Letters, and possesse them before hand in your behalf that they wold love, and favour you with their friendship; you may assure the Ambassador allso that you will never propose any thing that may be prejudiciall to any of them. In sum, you are allwayes to preserve the friendship of the Ambassador entire, both by Letters, and other good Offices you shall do to his Friends, and Kinsmen, but not engaging your self to do the like in his behalf to others, for that wold haply turn to a disservice to the Gentleman, and be no advantage to your self.</p>
               <p>Som dayes after your first audience you must think what visits to make, and because you need no instruction how to comport your self towards the Prelats, I must give you a speciall caution not to visit the Doge by himself, or speak to him alone; Nor must you visit all sorts of Senators, specially those that be young, for that wold be unseemly; Nor indeed doth any Senator much desire to be visited because it may breed jealousy, and so draw danger upon him; And ther may be two reasons alledg'd why they do not desire to be visited by strangers; The first is the parsimonious and privat lifes they lead; The other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have som of their Brothers or Children that are Prelats, so that it wold be a kind of offence to them to visit their Parents, either for the small splendor of their dwellings, or for the simplicity of their maners. Therfore allthough no exact rule can be given you what persons you are to visit, yet in the Generall, they must be those that for Office or Magistracy live with more Magnificence, and splendor than others having Palaces accordingly, such as are the Procurators of S. <hi>Mark;</hi> nor must these visits be frequent, but only twice a yeer will suffice, or it may be a longer interposition of time, according as custom shall
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:49798:116"/>
teach you, allthough they who com to visitt you do it oftner.</p>
               <p>When any of the principall Senators shall com to your House to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute you, or treat of any busines, those of your Family must be all ready to receave him at the Gate, and you must meet him upon the staires, but when they depart, you are to bring them to the bottom of the staires, though they reject it never so much: your comportment towards Gentlemen of younger yeers, and lesse dignity shall be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by your own judgment, and in such a maner as shall be obliging to them but not undervaluing your self; You must propose this as an universall rule to your self, that if you entreat the Prelats well, and bind them unto you, as I know you will evertuat your self to do, they may becom instruments of great matters by the meanes of their Parents, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their Parents may not make any shew that you are so affected to them, or they to you: the Prelats being well satisfied by you, will much avayle you, in giving good reports of you at <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I must advise your Excellency again that gravity will steed you much, because the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentlemen make profession thereof, and esteem it above any thing, not as much for apparances only, as for well becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing public Ministers of State; because it is an argument of staydnes, of vertu and prudence. Yet this gravity must not turn to an austerity, or take away that affability, candor and sweetnes which you are to use towards all people, for so you may be esteemed to be fantasticall and proud. Therfore you must speak, and treat with such an unaffected gravity that may be sutable to your person: And when you have any thing to do in the Senat, be mindfull of the rank you hold, and of the quality of that Prince whom you represent; yet shewing a great deal of reverence, and presupposing that you are in the presence of a King. All the discours you shall make in the Senat, shall be addressed to the Prince, and allthough you speak to the whole Colledg, yet you shall allwayes use these words, <hi>Vestra serenitá,</hi> or <hi>Serenissimo Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You must have a speciall care to honor the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentlemen, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Age and Dignity, And you must know that those Gentlemen love to be courted and complimented, specially if they be invested in any Office of Dignity; And honor is the more dear unto them, when it comes from a person of noble Employment and Extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Wheras otherwise they will deem it an injury not to be respected, turning such disrespects into disdain and scorn of him that will not give them their due, because the Senators and Patricians of <hi>Venice</hi> have high conceits of themselfs for their antiquity, and for their freedom continued so many Ages inviolable.</p>
               <p>Besides the difference that ought to be put betwixt old and young, or those that are graduated with offices or not graduated, wherof the first of both are to be the more esteemd, you must allso make som distinction betwixt Families. Now, the Families of the Venetian Gentry is divided to three ranks, <hi>viz.</hi> to ancient, new, and midling Houses; The ancientst are the most honorable, and esteemd more then others, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore allthough you are to respect all Gentlemen in generall, yet you must
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:49798:116"/>
have a speciall regard to put your self in lower postures of reverence towards those ancient families; but you must beware not to doe it in public, so that others take notice therof, but particularly, and in privat discours; So that this distinction of old and new Families must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servd within your own brest, otherwise the other rank of Nobles will take exception at your partiall behaviour, which may turn to your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
               <p>Among the Prelats of that Nation the <hi>Patriark</hi> is the Prince, and more highly esteemd than any other, as well for his age, as eminency, as allso commonly for his parentage, and frends, and that he lives more splendidly and hospitably then any other; And the Senators affoord him in som cases as much respect as they doe to the Colledg of ten when they send to him for his opinion, which yet cannot turn to a suffrage: You must make great account of him therfore, but take heed that this great Prelat doe not overact himself in point of return. I beleeve you know well what was negotiated of old at <hi>Rome</hi> in behalf of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, and how the <hi>Signorie</hi> Her-self recommended him unto the Pope, and thought to pourchase him that honor; but seing him excepted against, She stirrd no further, or made any more instance for any other during the time of that Pope. That Prelat nevertheles ceaseth not to aggrandize himself by recommending his cause to all the <hi>Nuntio's:</hi> Therfore you shall be easily prayed to do som good offices for him about his Holines, it may be, you may receave high answers, and replies, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you must carry your self with a great deal of dexterity, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in this busines; But if you undertake to do such an office, the Signorie will be ill satisfied, and the refusall he receavd from other <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio's</hi> will serve you for directions what you ought to doe: You must declare to such as shall discourse with you about this Prelat, the high respect you bear unto him, for his singular parts of vertu, and merit, making shew to serve him in all things to the utmost extent of your abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, provided that it be acceptable to the Signorie, and herin your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer must be short and strict.</p>
               <p>You must not invite any Venetian Gentleman to take a repast with you, specially any Senator; yet in som case one may doe it, and so your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation will not be unpleasing, but well accepted; This must be don, when any of those Gentlemen chance to negotiat with you about eating time, because that inviting him then, is a signe that you rather comply with the time, then that you doe it out of a reall desire, but this rarely happens. If he who is invited doth not refuse to stay, you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that he is a Senator, therfore you must not suffer him to sit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Prelats, but you must place him in the highest Seat, allthough haply he make resistance; but I beleeve you will find but little oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, in regard that the Prelats themselfs will concurr with you in this observance; A little after the repast you must rise from the Table, and give this Senator the oportunity for to depart, without detaining him longer, and when he departs you shall accompany him to the bottom of the Staires.</p>
               <p>You must refrain to shew your self over curious to know the secrets,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49798:117"/>
and pry much into the mysteries of this Republic, for then you may deprive your self of their conversation; therfore you must not seem to make any streight friendship with her Secretaries, yet you must honour them upon all ocasions, that it may appeer how much you esteem them; and for public transactions you may be well assurd, that they will com home to your dores without the trouble of making any reserches after them.</p>
               <p>If it happen that you be requird to recommend anybody to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators, ponder the busines so well before hand that you may not com off with a deniall; You must take heed to recommend to any temporall Judges the persons of Churchmen in processes against the Laiks: You must not favour in that Citty or Signorie the execution of any sentence given at <hi>Rome,</hi> unlesse you have comandement from his Holines so to doe, which you must shew.</p>
               <p>Let your Servants be observant to know the customes and fashions of the Cittie, not geering at such things that may haply breed laughter in a Stranger; But on the contrary, let them be pliable to accommodat themselfs to the modes of the place; for som fashions that are held comly in other places, may seem ridiculous here. And oftentimes they will not disdain to use in ordinary discours som termes of that Countrey, and the Venetian dialect, which you must not slight.</p>
               <p>Allthough the commendation and praises which are given one, are accustomed commonly to procure frendship, and the good grace of him who is praisd, yet the custom and humor of the Venetian cannot brook, that a Nuntio or Ambassador shold extoll and commend such that are in authority among them, either in their own presence, or before any other, for those kind of praises doe not use to sound or relish well: 'Tis tru, that before parents or kinred or intimat frends one may blazon the worth and vertu of som Senator; but the surest way is to abstain from commending any at all, and to be reservd in this point: But as a public Minister cannot commend the actions or exploits of any Venetian Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman without endangering the party, and wronging his own judgment, yet the Venetians are very well pleasd to hear the praises of the Republic in generall, or any thing that may tend to the glory therof, or of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; specially if one points at those things which are peculiar to that peeple or Citty, and cannot be applied to any other, as the marvailous site of the Cittie; the maner wherby She is preservd, and securd, with the causes therof; The public and privat magnificences, the Patrician bloud, wherin the chief extractions of the Roman Nobility, and of many other Townes of <hi>Italy,</hi> with other places of <hi>Europe,</hi> was conservd pure from mingling with the Goths, Vandalls, Hunns, Sarracens and Longobards neer upon 13. hundred yeers: the Christian nativity of this Republic, having never followd any other Religion; the method of Her Goverment, and that She hath particular constitutions of Her own which She never borrowed of others, but She did constitut Her-self; That She hath conservd Her-self a longer tract of time than any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public that ever was; having never lost or diminishd any part of Her first liberty, or acknowledgd any other superiority but Her own; Her

And not to extend my self further, I say you will extremely plese the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in elevating the achievments, ancient and modern, of the Signorie; Moreover, twill be very gustfull unto Her if you speak of Her piety, and munificence to the Church, and to have oftentimes bin the Protectresse of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, renewing the memory of what passd twixt <hi>Frederic</hi> the second and Her, with the Negotiations and Protestations made by Her before the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> in the Warr against his <hi>Holines,</hi> and all things els that you can alledg conducible to this purpose; Lastly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member well to extoll the royal and sincere proceedings of the <hi>Republic</hi> upon all occurrences in public treaties; commending Her that She useth to negotiat frankly, without any artifice or disguise, but really, and without palliations.</p>
               <p>I will not name heer the Princes that are belov'd or hated by the <hi>Signorie,</hi> for it will tend to little purpose. The Republic of <hi>Ragusa,</hi> and <hi>Genoa</hi> are no great friends to this <hi>Signorie,;</hi> yet They hate Her not, but use to be sensible of her dangers, and troubles; because that whosoever growes to be master of any of these Republiques will have the greater strength; which is just contrary to the aymes of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of <hi>Venice,</hi> whose policy tends that the state of <hi>Italy</hi> receaves no alteration, but be allwayes at a constant stand; And for this cause She wold be contented that the Dominions which the Spaniard hath in that Countrey were equally divided twixt <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> that the power of those two great Kings might be counterpoisd, and that neither of them were so powerfull in <hi>Italie.</hi> Wherupon the Signorie of <hi>Venice</hi> extremely desireth that <hi>Rome,</hi> with the State Ecclesiastic, and the Apostolic Seat, might be preservd, in regard that beside the affair of Religion, She ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the excellent Regiment of the Church, wherin all the vigor, and reputation of <hi>Italie</hi> consists; And touching the holy Father, were he reducd to any extremity or danger, this pious Republic would employ all Her power to protect Him, being wisely perswaded that all the domage which wold fall upon his Sanctity, wold rebound upon Her. I have forborn to observe hitherunto that the principall object of the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49798:118"/>
consultations of this noble <hi>Signory</hi> is the repose of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to preserve her from revolutions of intestin broyles.</p>
               <p>You must allso take it among your instructions that in the Discourses you shall hold with the <hi>Venetians</hi> or others, you must not shew your self inclinable to make a new league against the <hi>Turk,</hi> but rather when you fall upon this subject, you shall appeer rather for peace, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the prudence of the <hi>Signorie</hi> in her cariage towards this huge Potentat to have no actuall hostility with him; In which Discours you must be mindfull of the three reasons, which the <hi>Venetians</hi> use to alledg that it is necessary for that state to have peace with the <hi>Turk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first is in regard that all the Iles, Coasts and <hi>Maritime</hi> places which the <hi>Signorie</hi> possesseth do confine with som part of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, therupon She may be easily surpriz'd and invaded that way.</p>
               <p>The second is in regard that the Citty of <hi>Venice</hi> being the best peepled of all <hi>Italy,</hi> She hath not territory enough to maintain and support Her-self, or afford her all sorts of necessaries, therfore She must be oblig'd to other Countries for Her sustentation, now, ther is no Prince upon Earth, that lieth so oportunely to furnish Her as the <hi>Turk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, if a War be declar'd in the <hi>Levant</hi> all traffick will cease by Sea, as also commerce by Land, therfore the Citty of <hi>Venice</hi> being one of the greatest Mercantile Towns in the World, her Cittizens will grow poor, and want employment.</p>
               <p>You must add to these considerations the form and institution of the Republic, being from the first time of her foundation ordained and born as it were for peace and plenty, as She hath found by experience; Therfore the <hi>Venetian</hi> Senators are alwayes pleas'd, when any motion is made of Peace, and when any mention is made of the <hi>Turk</hi> they will not be discontented to heer him extoll'd for a mighty great Prince, implying thereby that the <hi>Signorie</hi> is the wiser to be at good termes with him; The Reasons whereby the <hi>Venetians</hi> did justify their proceedings, when against the capitulations of the league they did accommode them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the <hi>Turk,</hi> are so known to the World that it were a peece of impertinency to insist upon them here; but in your Discours among the <hi>Venetians,</hi> you may make use of them as ocasion shall invite you.</p>
               <p>I finish these Instructions with this necessary Rule that evry Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador, or public Minister of state ought to render himself agreeable to the Prince, with whom he negotiates, which may tend much to the happy conduct, and advancement of all his Negotiations.</p>

               <head>A Review of the Navall strength of <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN regard the main strength and incolumity, together with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall defence and glory of this <hi>Neptunian</hi> Damsell is derived from the Sea, it will not be amisse to make inspection once more into her waters, and fadom the depth of her navall power.</p>
               <p>Now, to treat of her strength this way it will not be amisse to give a little touch once more at Her <hi>Arsenall,</hi> which strikes an admiration into all men that are curious to survey it, and may be rank'd one of the wonders of the World in that kind; It is sited and encompass'd with a great chanell of the Sea, It is girt about with strong walls three miles in circuit; Ther have been counted there at one time 300 Gallies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those that were in cours to secure the gulf whereof ther were above 22 Galeasses, which in comparison of the other Gallies may be call'd men in compleat Armes, or Cuirasses, because they'are not so nimble in their motion neither for Sayle or Oar as others, but they give a far greater shock, and if they have a rowsing gale of wind and favorable, 20 of these are able to encounter 100. of other Gallies; besides they have the advantage of <hi>Galeons,</hi> because they have Feet as well as Wings.</p>
               <p>For Timber to build all sorts of sayling Vessells, ther is such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance that by an extraordinary providence grow up and down upon the Coasts not far remote from the Cittie in the firm Land that she never wants any, but can furnish her self out of her own stock.</p>
               <p>For Rowers and Sayles besides those that the Citty can affoord, Her-self, She hath great nombers in all the <hi>Maritime</hi> Townes; And for Souldiers for her Gallies She employes those of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Croatia</hi> with other places call'd the <hi>Cernides;</hi> The Captaines and Lieutenants of Her Gallies are for the most part <hi>Venetian</hi> Gentlemen, wherof ther is a great multitude; And besides the Lieutenant, She employes alwayes two young Gentlemen more to be exercis'd in <hi>Maritime</hi> affaires, the art of Navigation, and navall Militia; The greatest inconveniences She hath is scarcity of Bread and Bisket; howsoever She is allwayes very carefull to supply their want, by those huge Magazins of all sort of grain which She stores up in the <hi>Arsenall,</hi> and other places: She hath commonly evry yeer, though She be in peace with all the World, about 40 Gallies to scowre the gulph, and secure her Islands in the <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea, wherof ther is an Admirall call'd <hi>the Captain of the Gulph,</hi> who hath 5000 Duketts for his annual salary.</p>
               <p>These Gallies do not only free the Gulph from <hi>Corsaries</hi> or Pyratts, but they preserve the Reputation of the Republic, and Breed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a nursery of able Sea-Comanders: whensoever She under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands that the <hi>Turk</hi> Arms at Sea, She doth accordingly encrease this nomber of Gallies, and names a Generall. She is infested somtimes with petty compagnons call'd the <hi>Uscocchi</hi> upon the coasts of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> who having snap'd up any little prize, use to retire suddenly to som of the territories of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> which causeth her to be at the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:49798:119"/>
charge of maintaining a Fleet of small vessells calld <hi>Fusti</hi> upon those Coasts to secure her Marchants. Indeed, it cannot be imagind what nomber of Vessells the <hi>Signorie</hi> can put to Sea, in regard She hath all kind of Provisions, Materialls, Armes and other necessaries alwayes in a readines; And She doth dayly improve Her strength rather than diminish it; Therefore if about 300 yeers agoe she did arme above 200. Gallies and other Vessells towards the conquest of the Holy Land, and so many in the conquest of <hi>Constantinople</hi> where She joyned with the <hi>French,</hi> it is easy to conjecture how her power hath bin aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented since; considering that all her Neighbours have encreas'd in strength since that time, and it hath bin one of her prime Rules of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to have an eye to that, and proportion her Forces accordingly, This being the chiefest thing that those great Officers the three Sages of the Sea, and the three Sages <hi>de Terra firma</hi> have given them in charge: therfore when they are elected for those Offices they have more honor given them than ordinary; yet when any are so chosen ther is not any useth to congratulat them, or go to kisse their hands as was usuall when the great Councell was risen after the Election; And this is one of the modernst Lawes of <hi>Venice,</hi> which was ratified and enacted with great approbation, <hi>viz.</hi> That when any was nominated to any office of honor or public trust, none of the Senat shold congratulat them, whereas before evry man at the recesse of the Councell wold presse to take those by the hand who were chosen Magistrats, protesting with many vowes that they were seriously glad in their hearts of the advancement that had befallen them, yea even those wold say so that had given their suffrages against them by way of complement, which was adjudgd by the <hi>Censors</hi> to be a great abuse and unworthy of the Venetian Nobility, being in all other things so grave and honorable.</p>
               <p>The sayed <hi>Censors</hi> allso are of no long institution, they are created with great solemnity, their office being to represse the ambition and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality of the Gentry, and to look with severity into their deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <head>The Defects of the Signorie of <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BUt now we have taken paines to recount the perfections and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of this powerfull and so well policed Commonwealth, which are so many in nomber, and such, that they fill all the world with wonder; It will not be impertinent to discover what are Her defects and vices, considering that ther is no created body in this sublunary world, either naturall or civill, but is subject to imperfections, and no conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is without its inconvenience.</p>
               <p>The first defect then and the greatest that <hi>Venice</hi> is thought to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto, is, that being Lady of so many Countreys, She must import nourishment for Her Children out of other places, and if She had not the Sea for Her frend She might endure a great deal of hardship, for want of bread (which is the staff of life) and of all sorts of grain; Therfore
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49798:119"/>
it is the principall motif that induceth Her to be very loth to fall out with the Turk, from whose Dominions She fetcheth many commodities that conduce to sustenance and well being.</p>
               <p>It is another inconvenience unto Her that <hi>Candy</hi> in the Mediterranean, and other Iles She hath in the Ionian Seas, are so remote from Her, and they so distant one from the other.</p>
               <p>Another is, that She is enforcd in time of actuall warr to employ Suisses, and Germanes, with other Strangers, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the new modes of combating; For touching the Italian Infantery, they are softer, and hardly drawn from their old fashion of fight, and military discipline.</p>
               <p>Another may be, that by reason of Her overmuch jelousy and caution She dares not employ any of Her own Subjects in quality of Generall by Land for fear lest he shold grow too popular.</p>
               <p>Lastly, That She being the next neighbour to the Turk; if any other Christian Prince or State offends Him or His Subjects, he is ready ever and anon to throw the Catt at her shinns, to pick a quarrell, and wreck his revenge upon Her, by setting upon Her skirts either by Land or Sea, and this She hath often felt; Add herunto that this vicinity with so huge a Potentat encreaseth both Her cares and expences, for ther is no State consumes more in Fortifications.</p>
               <p>TOuching Her Vices, She is taxd all the World over for the latitud of liberty She gives to carnall plesure, and the large conscience She hath under the navill, though <hi>Naples</hi> exceed Her in this kind, whence some wold derive the ground of the proverb, That Venice <hi>and</hi> Naples <hi>are two Paradises where Devills dwell;</hi> But She may receave this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Turk</hi> Her Neighbours, who hold that the Creator inordred his handmayd Nature to infuse hott bloud into hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane veines, and into that bloud appetits and motions not to be a torment unto him, but to be turnd into delight and plesure; To this they say ther be multitudes of reclusd men and women in <hi>Venice,</hi> who by their austere cours of continency make som compensation for this loosnes in others, and keep Her Citty from <hi>sinking;</hi> for when the last cense was made, ther were neer upon 5000. Fryers and Nunns immurd within the Citty, who make vowes of continency, and have divorcd themselfs for such sensuall plesures.</p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>Venice</hi> is taxd that Her Children are so mortally revengefull; but this humor is incident to all Italians, and other Nations besides; who if they receave a weighty injury from any, they will make sure work with him, and dispatch him, So that he shall not wrong them twice; which a Duellist useth to doe by exposing his life to equall hazard with his Enemy.</p>

                  <hi>Iacobus Lauredanus, Nicolaus Canalis, Petrus Mocenicus,</hi> were famous both in the Greek, the Mediterranean and all the Levant Seas; <hi>Victor Superantius</hi> made his name good by his actions, being a man of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted spirit, yet very circumspect in the conduct of all his actions; <hi>Hieronymus Canalis</hi> pourchasd an egregious name by taking <hi>Maurus Alexandrinus</hi> after a fierce and bloudy combat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vicentius Capellus</hi> was renowned farr and neer for his exploits against the Moors &amp; Turks, who durst not peep out while he was at Sea for many yeers; <hi>Andreas Trevisanus</hi> a Knight though slow in deliberation, yet quick in execution, brought to the Citty many prizes which enrichd Her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, and had he livd to it he had worn the Ducall Capp. Many other most illustrious Heroes receavd their birth in <hi>Venice,</hi> as <hi>Antonius Cornarius, Nicolaus Priulus, Gieronimus Georgius</hi> Knight of Saint <hi>Mark</hi> a famous Orator, who was employed Ambassador to most of the Kings of Christendom, and was admired for his wisedom as well as for his eloquence; <hi>Marcus Fuscarus, Thomas Contarenus,</hi> and <hi>Laurentius Amulius</hi> were men admird in their time both for their prudence in the Senat, and prowesse at Sea, where they took that notorious Pyrat <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banassa,</hi> who so infested the <hi>Archipelago</hi> that he became a terror to all Marchants and Passengers; To these may be added <hi>Sebastianus Venerius,</hi> who though he comes in the rere of all the rest, yet may he be deservedly rankd among the formost, both for his magnanimity, his rare knowledg in the Art of Navigation, and in prudent conduct of all his designes, but specially for his notable successes; In that glorious battail of <hi>Lepanto</hi> he was the man that did the most signal peece of service when he rescued <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> the <hi>Generalissimo</hi> of the whole Fleet when he was ready to sink being orepowerd by the Turks, and <hi>Don Iohn</hi> did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg it, calling him ever after his Preserver and Father, though ther had happend a little before an ill-favourd clash betwixt them (as hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peerd in the bulk of the Story) wherin <hi>Venieri</hi> shewd that he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to him in courage, though he was an Emperours Son; This brave Sea-Generall was chosen after to sitt at the Stern of the whole Republic, and to be Prince of <hi>Venice,</hi> which was don not only by the suffrage of the Senat, but by the universall acclamations of the peeple; When he died, divers forren Princes sent for his picture, to preserve the memory of so gallant a man.</p>
               <p>These, with nomberles more, are those brave spirits which issued out of the womb of this Mayden-City, wherof som were supereminent for holines, and high virtues; others for erudition and learning of all kinds, whose works are yet extant up and down the Libraries of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom</hi> as eternall Monuments of their worth; others excell'd in pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and prowesse, in counsell and courage; Nor doe I beleeve, if one were curious to penetrat the whole bulk of the Roman Story, and peruse all Her Annalls, I say he will not be able to produce so many gallant men; though we know that no Citty in the world usd to magnifie her own Children more than old <hi>Rome,</hi> wherin She was somtimes so Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolicall, that among other things it was imputed to Her as a vanity, wherof <hi>Venice</hi> was allwayes free; Nor could <hi>Athens, Sparta,</hi> or <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon</hi>

histrionicall shewes, where they surprizd and seazd upon all the Mayds, and kept them, whence issued a Warr; Such an accident happend in <hi>Venice</hi> upon Her first erection; For a great Wedding being to be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, where the <hi>Bride</hi> being full of rich Jewells, as also the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayds, with others that were invited, according to the ancient custom; They were assaulted upon a sudden by certain Pyratts who carried them all away as prize to <hi>Dalmatia;</hi> But the Venetians arming those few Gallies they had then, poursued them so eagerly, and overtaking them they sett upon them with such a resolution, that they not onely redeemd the Bride with all the Maydens, but having made a great slaughter of the Enemy, they took all their Shipps, by giving them an utter overthrow; And this was the first victory that <hi>Venice</hi> gott.</p>
               <p>As in quality of Enemies, and Warrs, so <hi>Venice</hi> hath much resemblance with old <hi>Rome</hi> in the management of Her Martiall affaires, specially in expecting an exact obedience to Her <hi>Commissions</hi> and Instructions, which must not be exceeded under pain of life, or indispensable punishment; for if good successe follow, it will be imputed to the weaknes of Her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators who shold have given a larger Commission, which prejudice is taken off by chastising the party; Herof ther are divers examples, but a late one shall serve the turn in the person of <hi>Capello,</hi> who notwithstanding that he had performd a most noble exploit by overcoming the <hi>Barbary</hi> Fleet som few yeers since, and carrying away with him the Admirall Gallie of <hi>Algier,</hi> which now lyeth in the Arsenall among the chiefest Tropheys, yet in regard he transcended his Commission, he was arraignd as Criminall before the Decemvirat, and, but for good frends, he had breathd his last, and hangd by the legg betwixt the two Columns in Saint <hi>Marks</hi> Place.

               <p>HAving made these parallels twixt old <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> I will conclude with divers things wherin the <hi>last</hi> may be sayed to have the advantage, or may deserve the priority of the former.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Rome</hi> was born a <hi>Pagan, Venice</hi> a <hi>Christian</hi> when She was but an Embryon, and so suckd farr better milk in her <hi>infancy.</hi> The Romanes <hi>added</hi> still to their Religion by entertaining new Gods ever and anon from those Countreys they subdued, alledging <hi>ther could not be too many Gods to support so great an Empire,</hi> though tis tru a Decree of the Senat was usd to passe before they were admitted into the Pantheon, and other Temples, which Decree ran in these old Latin words, <hi>Nemo habescit Deos</hi>

                     </gap>as nisi publicè ascitos,</hi> Let none have new Gods or Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers till they be publickly allowed; <hi>Venice</hi> was never subject to such levities.</p>
               <p>2. In rarenes of <hi>situation Venice</hi> is superior to <hi>Rome,</hi> and indeed to any other Cittie on the surface of the Earth, for herin She brooks no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison; for when any Stranger comes to see <hi>Venice</hi> evry day will strike a fresh admiration into him for a long time together, and in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <hi>Rome</hi> may be sayed to be as farr inferior to <hi>Venice</hi> as <hi>Tyber</hi> is to the <hi>Sea,</hi> in whom the Cittie may be sayed to shine as a pearl in a Muscle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shell.</p>
               <p>3. In point of navall strength, <hi>Rome</hi> was never comparable to <hi>Venice,</hi> for She never had such a <hi>grandeza</hi> as Her <hi>Arsenall;</hi> Her Sea-vessells were but shallopps compard to those which are now in use; She did but lick the shore, whereas <hi>Venice</hi> did launch out into the <hi>Main,</hi> and rid trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly upon <hi>Neptune's</hi> back.</p>
               <p>Old <hi>Rome</hi> was ever inclin'd to war, her mud-walls having been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brued with bloud at her first foundation, She still thirsted after more dominions, and Her ambition was interminable, so that her Republic was made up of <hi>Magna Latrocinia</hi> as one sayed; <hi>Venice</hi> on the contrary hath ever sought after peace both for Her-self and Her Neighbours, having don the best Offices that way of any state in <hi>Christendom;</hi> It was the vainglory of old <hi>Rome</hi> to brag of the exploits of Her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which <hi>Venice</hi> never useth to do, but ther is a Law to the trary.</p>
               <p>5. For extent of Territories 'tis tru that old <hi>Rome</hi> went beyond <hi>Venice,</hi> yet <hi>Venice</hi> had a title than which old <hi>Rome</hi> never had a greater, which was that Her Duke was call'd while the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire lasted <hi>Protospiter Graci imperii, first father of the Grecian Empire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Old <hi>Rome</hi> had never such potent foes, and formidable Armies to cope withall as <hi>Venice</hi> hath had, She never had such a confederacy as that league of <hi>Cambray</hi> against Her; She never had an enemy of such a vast power as the <hi>Turk</hi> is; It were a paradox to hold, that old <hi>Rome</hi> had not brave magnanimous men whom Her own stories magnifie so much, and it is as great a paradox to hold, that <hi>Venice</hi> hath not had more; though She be far more free from that humor of ostentation. Ther were divers brave spirits in <hi>Rome</hi> that did <hi>murther</hi> themselfs in height of spirit, And ther were braver spirits in <hi>Venice</hi> that did <hi>mortifie</hi> themselfs, as divers of Her Princes have don, by shaking off the Ducall robes for a froc, and so bidding a farwell to the pomp and plesures of the world.</p>
               <p>7. In point of duration and longaevity old <hi>Rome</hi> was not made of so strong a constitution as <hi>Venice,</hi> who hath almost lasted twice her time, for She hardly continued a Republic 700 yeers; yet <hi>Venice</hi> to this day is plump and buxom, as if She meant to hold touch with <hi>Time</hi> himself, and coexpire with the world.</p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>Venice</hi> hath this preheminence of old <hi>Rome,</hi> that she hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd her Maydenhead to this day though situated in hot salt waters, and though oftentimes forc'd, yet was She never ravish'd; whereas <hi>Rome</hi> becam a prostitut to all Nations, who ridd Her often out of breath,

               <p>HAving in this large Prospective or <hi>Murano</hi> Looking-glasse more properly, (though I confesse not cut with a <hi>Diamond cut</hi>) represented unto the world the true face and Physiognomy of this renowned Virgin, having fetched Her from Her very Cradle, set Her forth in all Her proportions, and attended Her to that stature of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection She is now grown unto, having allso dissected Her government, and anatomiz'd evry lim thereof by pourtraying Her in all her colours, both inward and outward; Having likewise taken an abstract of the story of all Her Princes, and felt the pulse of Her courage by shewing what glorious exploits She hath perform'd up and down the World against the mightiest Potentats on earth, having moreover pryed into Her interests of state in relation to other Princes, Having allso made you know Her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as well as Her advantages, and unvayl'd Her vices as well as Her vertues; Lastly, having declared in what trepidations, and dangerous condition She stands at present, by having clos'd in actuall lucation with that great Eastern Giant the common Enemy, who as <hi>the Wolfe in the Fable useth to take hold of any slight ocasion, if the waters be troubled, to quarrell</hi> with Her, and ther her to peeces; I take the boldnes now to direct this seasonable hortative or alarum rather, to all Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and States, that it is high time for them to be sensible of her present engagements and consequently to reach her a helping hand, which as by a generall tie of Christianity, so for sundry particular respects and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensable obligations they are bound to do.</p>
               <p>1. In regard 'tis known and confess'd by all, that She is the main Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of the principallst parts of <hi>Europe</hi> against the <hi>Turk,</hi> for in the bottom of her Gallies lieth the security and wellfare of all her Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; It is She that holds him at the Oares end that he cannot take any sure footing in <hi>Italy,</hi> as he hath attempted often, and it is known by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full experience that whersoever he or his <hi>horse once sets his foot, the grasse</hi>

                  <hi>will never grow there again,</hi> Therfore, under favour, they are oblig'd by the common and mutuall tie of danger to preserve this Republic from sinking.</p>
               <p>2. All Christendom is beholden unto this wise Republic, in regard She hath interceded from time to time, and labourd more for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall peace and tranquility of Christendom, and by her moderation and prudent comportment hath don better Offices in this kind then any other whatsoever <hi>Rome</hi> excepted.</p>
               <p>3. It is She that hath bin the chiefest instrument to keep even the scales of the great balance of State betwixt the Princes of the Western world, that the power of one might not so out-poize and be trabocant that the rest shold be in danger to be blown up.</p>
               <p>4. Ther is an extraordinary respect and honor due unto the <hi>Signorie</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> from the rest of Christendom, in regard that wheras other Princes have made use of the <hi>Turk</hi> against their fellow <hi>Christians</hi> as could be prov'd by many instances, yet the Republic of <hi>Venice,</hi> though fairely offer'd, and importun'd thereunto, wold never make use of him that way in her greatest extremities; Neither in that mighty league of <hi>Cambray,</hi> when all the power of <hi>Europe</hi> was knotted against her; Nor during the time of the <hi>Interdict</hi> when the Pope, and the House of <hi>Austria</hi> were like to joyn against Her with temporall and spirituall Armes, yet She never wold accept the assistance of the <hi>Turk;</hi> though it be lawfull when ones House is set on fire to use foule water as well as fair, to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it.</p>
               <p>5. Lastly, The <hi>Signorie</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> is to be more look'd upon then other States, because they who have had pratic in the world, and observ'd generall dependencies confesse, that her peace hath caus'd the plenty, and her warrs the peace of most Regions of <hi>Europe;</hi> It was She that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the Trade, and taught the Northwest world a way to all the Levant parts, as also into <hi>Afric,</hi> and the Southern Coasts of <hi>Asia</hi> as far as the Red-sea and the <hi>Indies;</hi> moreover Her <hi>Bank</hi> of money, as it hath bin the Ground and Rule of all other banks, so it is the most usefull for Marchants or Gentlemen to any part of the world, nor do I see how Christendom can subsist conveniently without it.</p>
               <p>Therefore, humbly under favour, it highly behoves all other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes to be ayding and assisting unto this gallant and usefull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, to preserve this Virgin from being ravish'd by that rude Tyrant of the Levant, the common enemy, who is now actually uniting and banding all his forces both by Land and Sea, to shoot <hi>Her</hi> twixt Wind and Water, and utterly to sink Her; having <hi>now got</hi> out from between the <hi>Dardanelli</hi> with a great Fleet to succour <hi>Canea,</hi> and make good what he hath already got in <hi>Candie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides these generall ties, ther be som motifs of encouragement now more then formerly that may serve to incite all Christian Princes against the <hi>Turk</hi> at this time, in regard that, according to the judgement of the wiser sort of men, that tyrannicall Empire is upon point of declining, or to suffer som notable change<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because the <hi>Ianizares</hi> of late yeers have much degenerated from what they were from their Primitive

               <p>Besides, som late Astronomers, and those of the best rank among the Jewish Rabbins, do hold that the fate and fortune of a Kingdom may be read in the Heavens; for they have observd that all the Hebrew Letters may be found out among the Starrs; <hi>Rabbi Chomer</hi> assures the World that it is now a good while since this hath bin observd, for the Hebrew toung wherein God himself vouchsafd to speak, and was the first among Mankind, hath certainly somthing of mysterie and excellence in it more than the other that had their beginning at the confusion of <hi>Babel;</hi> Divers of the Chaldeans and Jewish Rabbies, as <hi>Rabbi Kap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus, a little before the Temple of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was burnt, and utterly consumd by <hi>Nabuzaradan,</hi> it was noted that the verticall Starrs which hung over that Cittie made this Hebrew word <hi>Hickschich,</hi> which signifieth <hi>to reject and forsake without mercy.</hi> Thus the end of the Grecian Empire was likewise foreshewd by fower Starrs which were verticall, that made this word <hi>Parad,</hi> which signifieth in Hebrew <hi>divide.</hi> Thus over <hi>Athens</hi> fower Starrs were observd to be verticall a little before her dissolution, which made this Hebrew word <hi>Tsarar,</hi> the sense wherof is <hi>Angustiis affici, To be troubled;</hi> with divers other examples which a late curious French Author doth produce. But that somthing may be instanced to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose, and concerning things to com, the sayed <hi>Rabbi Chomer</hi> doth confidently affirm (as the sayed French Author hath it) that this Celestiall writing hath pointed out the declining of two great Empires of the East; The one is that of <hi>China,</hi> which Countrey we know by the Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars

irruption is in a fearfull confusion allredy; The other is that of the Turks, over which ther are observd seven verticall Starrs, which being read from the West to the East this Hebrew word <hi>Caah</hi> is made, which signifieth <hi>to be batterd, to be feeble, languishing, and drawing to an end:</hi> But now seeing it may be doubted at which time this Empire shall be reducd to this extremity, the same Letters do allso resolve the doubt, for those Letters being numericall make up the nomber of 1025. So that when this Kingdom shall have accomplishd the nomber of 1025. yeers, it shall then be overthrown, and brought to ruin; Now, if we reckon from the yeer of our Lord 630. which was the yeer according to our vulgar computation wherin the basis of this Empire was layed, we shall find that it is to last till the yeer of our Lord 1655. for the completing of the foresayed nomber 1025. So that reckoning from this present yeer 1651. this Empire is to last but fower yeers by this account. But one will say, these are but conjectures or curiosities rather, &amp; fancies, yet we know that the Heavens are calld a <hi>Book</hi> in an uncontroulable text, and in a Book ther must be letters and writing, which may foretell the good or ill omen of a Countrey; the first by reading them from <hi>West</hi> to <hi>East,</hi> the second from <hi>North</hi> to <hi>West,</hi> because <hi>ab Aquilone pandetur omne malum,</hi> as poor <hi>England</hi> knowes too well: But as the Chymists hold that none can com to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistery</hi> unlesse he be a perfect good man, so he must be such a one that can attain the sense of this Celestiall writing.</p>
               <p>I will enforce this cohortation or <hi>Caveat</hi> rather, with a saying which the Turks have, <hi>That</hi> Italy <hi>is the Gate of Christendom, and</hi> Venice <hi>is the Key of</hi> Italy; That <hi>Candie</hi> is a Bridg archd with <hi>Zant, Cephalonia,</hi> and <hi>Corfù,</hi> and <hi>Corfù</hi> is the chief Watergate of <hi>Venice.</hi> Therfore it is an easy thing to inferr this consequence, or rather to be a <hi>Prophet,</hi> That the <hi>day</hi> when <hi>Venice</hi> is lost, will be the eve of the winning of <hi>Italy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>To put a conclusive period to all, ther is a saying that carries no less wisdom than witt with it, <hi>when one's Neighbours house is afire, by the light therof, he may discerne his own danger;</hi> The <hi>Venetian</hi> Flames at this time are of such a vast extent, that they may enlighten, not only the <hi>Italians</hi> their next Neighbours, but all <hi>Europe</hi> besides, to foresee her future dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, if the aforesaid <hi>Islands,</hi> which are as so many Limbs of <hi>Christendom,</hi> be cut off, and that the Mahumetan <hi>Moon, increasing by</hi> such additions, come to <hi>predominat</hi> o're those Seas.</p>
