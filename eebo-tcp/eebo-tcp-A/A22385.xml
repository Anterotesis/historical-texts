            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE King our Soueraigne Lord considering the great and generall infection of the
Plague which at this present is in the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> and other places
neere adioyning, and how perilous it might bee to His louing Subiects, if they should
bee enforced to repaire thither for their suites and causes before such time as it shall
please Almighty God of his goodnesse and mercy to remooue or ease that heauy visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
His Maiestie therefore of His especiall grace and fauour to His people: and
for their better safety and preseruation, is pleased to adiourne part of the Tearme of
Saint <hi>Michael</hi> now next comming: That is to say, from the <hi>Vtas</hi> thereof vnto the
fourth Returne of the same Tearme called <hi>Mense Michaelis,</hi> which His Maiestie signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
to all and singular His louing Subiects of this His Realme, to the intent that they and euery of them
which hath cause or Commandement to appeare in any of His Highnesse Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in, or at any
day or time, from and after the said <hi>Vtas</hi> of Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> may tarry at their dwellings, or where their businesse
otherwise shall lye, without resorting to any of the said Courts for that cause, before the said <hi>Mense Michaelis</hi>
next comming, and that without danger of forfeiture, penalty, or contempt to incurre towards His Highnesse
in that behalfe. And neuerthelesse His Maiesties pleasure is, that two of His Iustices, That is to say, of either
Bench one, shall the first day of <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Tearme next, called <hi>Octabis Michaelis,</hi> according to the ancient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Lawes, keepe the Essoines of the said <hi>Octabis Michaelis,</hi> at which <hi>Vtas</hi> of Saint <hi>Michael,</hi> Writs of adiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
(which His Maiestie hereby Commandeth the Lord Keeper of the Great Seale of <hi>England</hi> to make
foorth, shall bee directed to the said Iustices, giuing them authority to adiourne the said Tearme of Saint <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi>
(That is to say) from the <hi>Vtas</hi> thereof, vntill the fourth Returne, as before is said: And the said adiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
shall bee made in the first day of the said <hi>Vtas,</hi> commonly called the day of Essoines. And further His
Maiesties pleasure is, That all Matters, Causes, and Suites depending in any of His other Courts betweene party
and party, as in his Highnesse Courts of Chauncery, Star-chamber, and Exchequer, Courts of Wardes and
<unclear>Liueries</unclear>, Dutchie of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and Court of Requests shall haue continuance, and the parties shall haue day

               </gap>nter into any accompt in any of the said Courts, shall repaire vnto His Maiesties House of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi>
where His Highnesse hath appointed such Officers and Ministers, as for that purpose His Maiestie hath
thought expedient, and there to pay and doe in euery behalfe, as though no such Proclamation of adiourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had beene had or made. And His Maiesties further pleasure and Commandement is, that all Sheriffes
shall returne their Writs and Proces against all such Accomptants and Debtors, at the dayes therein appointed.
And if any person, or persons, who ought to accompt, or pay any summe, or summes of money to His Maiestie
in any of the Courts and places afore-said doe make default therein, that then His Highnesse Writs and Proces
shall bee awarded and sent foorth against euery such person and persons, and the same to bee duly and orderly
serued, and returned by the Sheriffes and Officers thereunto appointed in such like manner and forme as the
same should haue beene if this present Proclamantion had not beene made. And if any Sheriffe or other
Officer shall make default, or bee negligent in seruing, executing, or returning of any the Writs and Proces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,
that then euery such Sheriffe and other Officer shall incurre such paines and penalties as by the said
Courts, or any of them shall bee taxed and assessed, Willing and Commanding all and euery His Maiesties
Sheriffes, Officers, Ministers and Subiects, to whom it doeth, or shall appertaine to obserue and keepe their
