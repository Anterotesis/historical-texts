            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore I wyll take the whole fragmente and shred, taken oute of goddes boke for the gospel of this day, wrytten in the gospell of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewe the .xxii. Chapter.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Tunc abierunt Pharisei.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then wente the Pharisies and toke a counsell. Luke hathe <hi>Obseruantes,</hi> marckinge, spyinge, lookynge, totinge, watchynge: lyke suttel, crafty and sleyghtie felowes they toke a councel and se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to him theyr disciples, which shuld fain the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selfs iust me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, glad to learn his doctrine
<pb facs="tcp:8710:3"/>
And wyth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Herods seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to trap him in his words: &amp; they sayd to him: Master we knowe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou arte a trewe man, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest the waye of God, <hi>in ueritate,</hi> truly, and carest for no manne. For thou regardest not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage of man. Tel vs therfore, what thinckest thou? Is it lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to geue Cesar tribute mony or no? This was theyr question that they wold haue snarled him with. In answeryng to this they woulde haue caught him by the fote. But Iesus <hi>Cognita malicia eo rum,</hi> knowing theyr malice, theyr wyckednes, theyr vncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he sayd to them: hypocrytes whi do ye tempt me? Shew me a pece of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tribute mony. And they broughte hym a penye. And he sayde to them: whose image is
<pb facs="tcp:8710:3"/>
thys, and the wrytynge? They answered: Cesars. He sayde to them. Gyue to Cesar that that belongeth to Cesar, &amp; to god that that is goddes.</p>
            <p>Thus ye maye perceyue, it was our sauyoure Chryste that spake these wordes, and they wer spoken vnto the Pharyseis that tempted him. But they be a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne vnto vs that are Chrystes Dyscyples. For whose wordes shulde we delite to heare &amp; learn, but the wordes and doctryne of oure sauyour Chryste? And that I maye at thys tyme so declare them, as may be for goddes glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, your edifying, and my dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge: I praye you all to helpe me with your prayer.</p>
            <p>In the whych prayer. &amp;c. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vniuersall church of Chryst tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe

Secondly for the kynges most honorable councell? Thirdly I commende vnto you the soules departed thys lyfe in the faythe of Chryste, that ye remember to geue laudes, praise, and thankes to almightye God for his great goodnesse and mercye shewed vnto theym in that greate nede and conflicte ageynste the deuil and synne.

for youre selues, that it may please god to gyue you the lyke faythe and grace, to truste only vnto the death of his deare sonne, as he gaue vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For as they be gone, so must we: and the deuyll wyll be as readye to tempt vs as he was them, &amp; our synnes wyl lyght as heuy vpon vs as theirs did vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and we are as weake and vnable to resyst as were they. Praye ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we may haue grace to dye in the same fayth of Chryste as they did, &amp; at the latter daye be raysed wyth Abraham, Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac and Iacob, and be partaker wyth Chryste in the kyngdome of heauen: for this and grace, let vs saye the Lordes prayer. <hi>Tunc abcuntes. Tunc,</hi> then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on a text before. Chryst told
<pb facs="tcp:8710:5"/>
them a similitude that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heauen is lyke to a king that made a bridal to his sonne, he maryed hys sonne, and sente hys seruauntes oute to byd hys gestes. Wel they wold not come althoughe he had made greate preparing &amp; much cost for them: ambycion, couetousnes, and cru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eltye would not lette them come. Then he sente hys warryoures and destroyed them: and agayne sente other seruauntes to bydde gestes to hys brydal, hande o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heade come who wold. Thei dyd hys bydding, and the house was full of gestes. The kynge nowe wold vewe his gests: and fyndyng there one not cladde in Mariyng garmentes, he asked hym: frende how cammest thou here, not hauing a mariage gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mente?
<pb facs="tcp:8710:5"/>
And commaunded to bynde hym hande and fote, and caste him into vtter darkenesse: there was wayling &amp; gri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of teeth. For many be chosen &amp; few be called. Nowe Chryst expoun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>deth this. The kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen is preaching of the Gospel. This mariage is the ioyning of Chryst &amp; his church, which was begun by Christ, here in earth, &amp; shal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. The bidders of his gestes are preachers, but here are so many lets &amp; hinderances: couetise is a let, ambicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is a let, crueltie is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest lette. For they bett hys seruauntes, brake theyr heades, yea murdered them, whiche bad them to thys brydal. Wyth this the kynge was angrye, and sent hys men of warre to destroye
<pb facs="tcp:8710:6"/>
those vnthankful people. Was he not angrye wyth couetouse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and wyth ambition? Yes he is angrye wyth couetouse men, with ambiciouse men: But most of all wyth crueltye. Thys is an angre aboue commune an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre, when men be not onlye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanckfull but also adde cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye to persecute the preachers, that commeth to call vs to thys maryage. This toucheth god so nyghe, that he sayeth. <hi>Qui uos au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit me audit.</hi> Thys crueltye the kynge wolde not leaue vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, but sente furthe his menne of warre. They are called hys men of warre, his men, his men, for warres come at hys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente. Titus and Uas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian were sente of god to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshe those couetouse Iewes,
<pb facs="tcp:8710:6"/>
Ambiciouse Iewes, cruel Iews, that wold not credit Chryst, nor beleue the preachinge of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Now in warre, what parte soeuer gette the victorye, that is Goddes parte, that is Goddes host. Nabuchodonosor was an euyl manne, a wicked ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, yet was he sent of God to punyshe the stubbourne and Couetouse Iewes for theyr ambicion, and crueltye, and forsakyng goddes moste holye woorde: And he is called in scrypture goddes ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt. It is no good argument He hathe the vyctorye, Ergo he is a good manne. But thys is a good argumente. He hathe the vyctorye, ergo God was on hys syde, and by hym punyshed the contrarye parte.
<pb facs="tcp:8710:7"/>
The preachers called good and bad. Thei canne do nomore but call, God is he that must bryng in, god muste open the hertes, as it is in the Actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. When Paule preached to the womenne, there was a silke woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Cuius cor deus aperuit,</hi> whose herte god opened. None coulde open it but god. Paule coulde but onelye preache, god muste worcke, god must do the thyng inwardelye. But good and bad came. Therfore the preachynge is lykened to a Fyshers nette, that taketh good fysh and bad, and draweth all too the shoore. In the whole multytude that professe the gospell, all be not good, all canne not awaye wyth the mortyfyinge of theyr fleshe, they wyll wyth good will beare
<pb facs="tcp:8710:7"/>
the name of Chrystians, of gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers, but to do the dedes they grudge, they repyne, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not awaye wyth it. Amonge the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, al were not honest, naye, one was a deuyll: So amonge so greate number of gospellers, some ar Carde gospellers, some are dyse gospellers, some pot-gospellers: all are not good, all seeke not amendmente of lyfe. Then commeth the kynge to se hys gestes. And findeth one not hauynge the maryage garment, and saythe to hym: Frende how cammest thou hither, and haste not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maryage garment? Faith is the maryage garmente, not a fayned fayth wythout good ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, but fayth that worketh by loue. He was blamed because he professed one thynge, and was
<pb facs="tcp:8710:8"/>
in dede another. Whi did he not blame the preachers? There was no faulte in them, they dyd theyr dewtyes, they had no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commaundemente but to call them to the maryage. The garmente he shulde haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyded hym selfe. Therefore he quarrelleth not wyth the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: what dothe thys felowe here? Whye suffered ye hym to enter. &amp;c. for theyr commission extended no further but only to cal him.</p>
            <p>Manye are greued that there is so lytell fruite of their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng. And when as they are as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: why do you not preache ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng so greate giftes geuen you of God? I woulde preache saye they, but I se so lytle fruite, so lytle amendmente of lyfe, that

it maketh me werye. A noughty aunswere, a verye noughty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere. Thou arte troubled with that god gaue the no charge of, and leauest vndone, that thou arte charged wythe.
