            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore it is once again over-seen and perused, that the same may be at length correspondent to the Authors minde, and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the Reader, because this Book doth teach ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, that we be bound to learn and know on pain of everlasting death, as the Laws of God sheweth us how we may know to keep his Commandements, and to know the remedies to with-stand deadly sin, there be many men and women think themselves wise, and know and learn many things, but that they bee bound to learn and know that they know not.</p>
            <p>As first, the Ten Commandements of God, and the Five Commandements of the Church, That every Creature that purposes to be saved, should learn and know, and have them as perfect as their Pater-noster. You people, how will you confess you, and if you break any of the Ten Commandements, and you know not them? Truly there is but a few that know them; therefore yee that do not know them, do your diligence to learn them; for yee be bound to learn them as well as to learn your Pater-noster. For how can you keep our Lords Commandements and yee know them not? And yee be bound to break not one of them on pain of Damnation, for and if thou breakest one thou breakest all. Offend the Law in one point, and offend it in all; for if thou break one thou dost not Gods bidding, for he biddeth thee break none. And all that yee do in this World here, if it be not of God, or in God, or for God, all is in vain; you should not occupy your self in vain matters, but in reading of good Books, for vanity engendereth vain thoughts, and destroyeth devotion in man. What need have we to study on a thing that is naught? study on your Sin, and what Grace by God in you is wrought. Also in this Book is many more matters, look in the Table following.</p>

                  <p>THe Shepheards in a morning before the day being in the fields, beheld the firmament that was fixed full of stars, one amongst the other said to his fellow, I demand of thee how many stars be on the twelve parts
<pb facs="tcp:57505:5"/>
of the Zodiack<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is under one sign only. The other shepheard answered and said, let be found a peece of land in a plain Country, as upon the plain of Salisbury, and that the said peece of land be xl miles long, and xxiiii. miles broad. After that, take great long nailes with great broad heads, as the nailes be that are made for cart-wheeles, as many as shall suffice for the said peece of land, and let the said nailes be stricken unto the heads, in the said peece of land, four fingers distant one from another, till that the peece of land be covered over from one side to the other: I say that there be as many stars contained under one signe only as there should be nailes struck in the foresaid peece of land, and there is as many under each of the other, and to the equipollent by the other places of the firmament. The first Shepheard demanded how wilt thou prove it? the second an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered and said, that no man is bound nor tied to prove things unpossible, and that it ought to suffice for shepheards touching this matter to beleeve simply without overmuch enquirie, of that their predecessors shepheards have said before.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S here before time there was a Shepheard keeping Sheep in the Fields, which was no Clerk, nor had no understanding of the literal sence, nor of no manner of Scripture, nor Writing, but of his Natural wit and understanding said; Howbeit though li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and dying be all at the pleasure of Almighty GOD, yet man may live by the course of Nature lxxii. years or more. This was his reason. And he saith, as much time as a man hath to grow in beauty, length, breadth,
<pb facs="tcp:57505:6"/>
and strength, so much time hath he to wax old and feeble to his end: But the term to grow in beauty, height and strength, is xxxvi, yeer, and the term to wax old, feeble, and weak, and turn to the earth ward, which is in all together lxxii. year. that he ought to live by course of nature. And they that dye before this time, often it is by violence and outrage done to their complexion and nature. But they that live above this term, is by good regiment and ensignments, after the which a man hath govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himself. To this purpose of living and dying, the said shepheard saith, the thing that we desire most in this world, is to live long, and the thing that wee most fear, is to dye soon: thus he travailed his understanding, and made great diligence to know and to do things possible and requisite for to live long whole, and ioyfully, which this present compost and Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Shepheards sheweth and teacheth. Wherefore we will shew you of the bodies celestiall, and of their nature and movings: and this present book is named the compost, for it comprehendeth fully all the compost, and more, for the daies, hours, and moments, and the new Moons, and the Eclipse of the Sunne and the Moon, and the signs that the Moon is in every day, and this book was made for them that be no Clarks: to bring them to great understanding.</p>
                  <p>He said also that the desire to live long was in his soul, the which alway lasteth, wherefore hee would that his desire was accomplished after death as afore. He said, sith the soul dieth not, and in her is the desire to live long, it should be an infallible pain, not to live after death, as afore, for he that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not after his corporal death, shall not have that that he hath desired, that is to wit, to live long, &amp; should abide in eternal pain if his desire were not accomplished. So concluded the said Shepheard necessary things for him and other to know, and do that which appertaineth to live after death, as afore. And truth it is, that he which liveth but the life of this world only, though hee lived an hundred year, he lived not properly long: but he should live long, that at the end of this present life should begin the life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall that is to say, the life everlasting in heaven. So a man ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his life in this world corporally, that he may live spiritually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. For as hee said, one shall live everlasting without dying, and when he hath the perdurable life, hee shall bee perfect. And also by this point, and none otherwise, shall be accomplished the desire of long living in this world. The foresaid Shepheard also knowledged, that the life of this world was soon past and gone, wherefore this Shepheard thought that lxxii. years in this vale of wretched misery is but a little and a small term of life to the everlasting, the which never shall have ending. And therefore he saith he that offereth himself here to live vertuously in this world, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this life he shall receive the sweet life that is sure and lasteth ever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. For though a man lived here an C. yeer and more, it is but a little term to the life to come. Therefore saith this shepheard, I will live soberly
<pb facs="tcp:57505:7"/>
with these small temporal goods that Iesus hath lent me, and ever to exile the desire of worldly riches and worldly worship. For they that labour for it, and have love to their goods, and vain worships, oft it parteth man from the heavenly treasure. It shutteth mans heart, that God may not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and buildeth man a place of no rest in the low land of darknesse.</p>

                  <head>Here beginneth the Master Shepheard.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is to be understood, that there be in the year four quarters, that are called <hi>Ver, Aestas, Autumnus,</hi> and <hi>Hyems</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> These de the four seasons of the year, as Prime-time is the spring of the year, as February, March, and April, these three months.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57505:7"/>Then commeth Summer, as May, Iune, and Iuly: and these three months every hearb, grain, and tree is in his kind, &amp; in his most strength and fairnesse, even at the highest.</p>
                  <p>Then commeth Autumne, as August, September, and October, then all these fruits waxe ripe, and be gathered and housed.</p>
                  <p>Then commeth November, December, and Ianuary, and these three months be the Winter, the time of little profit. We Shepheards say that the age of man is lxxii. years, and that we liken but to one whole year, for evermore we take six years to every month, as Ianuary, or Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; so forth; for as the year changeth by the twelve months, into twelve sundry manners, so doth a man change himself twelve times in his life by twelve ages, and every age lasteth six year, if so be that he live to <hi>lxxii.</hi> for three times six maketh eighteen, and six times six maketh <hi>xxx</hi>vi. And then is man at the best, and also at the highest, and twelve times six maketh lxxii. and that is the age of a man.</p>
                  <p>Thus must ye reckon for every month six year or else it may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by the four quarters and seasons of the year: So man is divided into four parts, as to youth, strength, wisedome, and age: He to be xviii. yeer yong, xviii. yeer strong, xviii. yeer in wisdome, and the fourth xviii yeer to go to the full age of lxxii.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>And now to shew you how man changeth xii. times, as the xii months do.</head>
                  <p>TAke the first six yeer of Ianuary, the which is for no vertue nor strength, in that season nothing on the earth groweth. So man after he is born, till he be six year of age, is without wit, strength, or cunning, and may do nothing that profiteth.</p>
                  <p>Then commeth February, and then the days begin to wax in length, and the Sunne more hotter, then the fields begin to waxe green: So the other six yeers till he come to twelve, the child beginneth to grow bigger, &amp; serve, and learn such as is taught him.</p>
                  <p>Then commeth March, in the which the laborer soweth the earth, &amp; plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth trees, &amp; edifieth houses: the child in these six yeers waxeth big to learn doctrin &amp; science, and to be fair &amp; honest, for then he is xviii years of age.</p>
                  <p>Then commeth Aprill, that the earth and the trees are covered in green and flowers, and in every part goods increase abundantly: then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the child to gather the sweet flowers of hardinesse, but then beware that the cold winds &amp; stormes of vices beat not down the flowers of good manners, that he should bring man to honor, for then he is xxiiii. yeer old.</p>
                  <p>Then commeth May, that is both fair and pleasant, for then birds sing in woods and Forrests night and day, the Sunne shineth hot: and as then is man most ioyfull and pleasant, and of livelier strength, and seeketh plaies, sports, and lusty pastime, for then he is full <hi>xxx</hi> years.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:57505:8"/>Then cometh Iune, and then is the sunne highest in his meridional, he may ascend no higher in his station, his glimering golden beams ripe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the corn; and when a man is xxxvi. year, he may ascend no more, for then hath nature given him beauty and strength at the full, and ripeneth the seeds of perfect understanding.</p>
                  <p>Then commeth Iuly, that our fruits been set a sunning, and our corn a hardning, but then the Sun beginneth a little for to descend downward; so man then goeth from youth toward age, and beginneth to acquaint him with sadnesse, for then he is xlii. year.</p>
                  <p>After that then commeth August, then we gather in our corn, and also the fruits of the earth; and then doth man his diligence to gather for to find himself withall, in the time that he may neither get nor win, and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that vi. yeers, is he xlviii. year old.</p>
                  <p>Then commeth September, that wines be made, and the fruits of trees be gathered. And then therewithall he doth freshly beginne to garnish his house and make provision of needfull things for to live in winter, which draweth very neer and then is man in his most ioyful &amp; couragious estate, prosperous in wisdome, purposing to gather, and keep as much as should be sufficient for him in his old age, when he may gather no more, and these six years maketh him liv. years.</p>
                  <p>And then commeth October, that all is into the foresaid house gathered but corn, and also other maner fruits; And also the labourer soweth new seeds in the earth, for the yeer to come. And then he that soweth nought shall nought gather. And then in these other six years, a man shall take himself unto God for to do penance &amp; good works, and then the benefits the yeer after his death he may gather, and have spiritual profit, and then is man full in the term lx. year.</p>
                  <p>Then commeth November, that the days are very short, and the sun in manner giveth little heat, &amp; the trees lose their leaves. The fields that were green look hory and gray. When all manner of herbs be hidde in the ground, and then appeareth no flowers: And then winter is come that a man hath understanding of age, and hath lost his kindly heat &amp; strength: His teeth begin to rot, and also to chatter, and then hath he no more hope of long life, but desireth to come to the life everlasting, and these six for this month maketh him lx. and six years.</p>
                  <p>Then commeth December, full of cold, with frost and snow, with great winds and stormy weather, that a man may not labour nor nought do: the sun is then at the lowest that it may desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, then the trees &amp; the earth is hid in snow, then is it good to hold them nigh the fire, &amp; to spend the goods that they gathered in summer: For then beginneth mans hair to wax white &amp; gray, &amp; his body crooked &amp; feeble, &amp; then he loseth the perfect understa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, and that six years maketh him full lxxii. year, and if he live any more, it is by his good guiding and dieting in his youth. Howbeit, it is possible
<pb facs="tcp:57505:8"/>
that a man may live till he be an hundred yeers of age, but there are but few that come thereto.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore I Shepheard said moreover, that of living or dying the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies may stirre a man both to good and evill without doubt of a surety: but yet may a man withstand it by his own free will, to do what he will himself good or bad evermore. Above the which inclination is the might and will of God, that longeth the life of man by his goodnesse, or to take it short by his iustice.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we will shew you of the bodies celestiall, and of the nature and movings: and this present book is named the Compost, for it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth fully all the compost and more, for the days<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hours, &amp; moments, and the new Moons, and the eclipse of the Sun and Moon, and of the sign that the Moon is in every day, and this book was made for them that are no Clerks, to bring them to great understanding.</p>
                  <p>And this Calender is divided into five parts.</p>
                  <p>The first, of our signs of the compost and the Kalender.</p>
                  <p>The second is, the tree of vices with the paines of hell.</p>
                  <p>The third is, the way of health of man: the tree of vertues.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is physick and governance of health.</p>
                  <p>The fift is, Astrology and physnomy, for to understand many decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, and which they be by likelihood, the which by nature are inclined and can do them, as you shall read ere you come to the end.</p>
                  <p>For to have the Shepheards understanding of their Kalender, ye should understand that the year is the measure of the time that the sunne passeth the twelve signs, returning to his first point, &amp; is divided into the twelve months.</p>
                  <p>As Ianuary, February, March, and so forth to December.</p>
                  <p>So the sunne in these twelve months passeth by twelve signs one time.</p>
                  <p>The days of his entring into the signs in the Kalender, and the days also when he parteth the yeer, as the xii. months into lii. weeks, three hundred sixty and five days, and when bysext is, it is threescore and vi. one day, is xxiv. hours, every hour lx minutes. After these divisions yee must understand for every year three things.</p>
                  <p>The first speaketh of the Golden number.</p>
                  <p>The second of the letter dominicall</p>
                  <p>And the third is the letter tabular, in the which lyeth all the chief know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this Kalender, for the which letter and number to understand all that they would, whether it be past or to come, ye shall put three figures after the Kalender, of the which the first shall shew the value and declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two other, and it is to be underst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

the latter day of S. Matthew, the which is vigill, and is put with the day upon one letter by himself.</p>
                  <p>Also the letters Ferials of this Kalender, be to be understood as they of the other kalenders, before the which are the numbers, and the other three after the letters ferials. First, for because the letters descendeth low, is the golden number above the day of the new Moon. And the which to be the hour and moments of the said month: which when they are in service before noon of the day above there. And when they are black service for afternoon of the same day in the places of the number, betokeneth that number where it is. The naturall day is to be understood from midnight to midnight xxiv houres, and shall serve the said numbers for the letters Ferials, xix. yeer complete from the year that this Kalender was made one thousand four hundred fourescore and seventeen, unto the yeer one thousand five hundred and sixteen. In the which yeer shall begin all to serve this golden number, and the other numbers after the letters ferials, all in the manner as they be before for the other xix yeers.</p>
                  <p>And all the remnant of the compost, and of the kalender is perpetual for the golden number, so shall they be xxxviii. yeers, of the which yeers, one thousand four hundred fourscore &amp; seventeen is the first. The feasts of the kalender are in their daies, of the which the solennall are in red &amp; storied in the unity, nigh the which unity in the end of the bodies, above every day is one letter of the A. b. c. for to understand in what signs the Moon is in that day. And yet the said letters and the rubrish, for the which shall be one figure before the Kalender, which shall shew how they should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it.

And then the said <hi>Lazarus</hi> recounted how that he had seen in the parts infernal of hell, many great and intollerable pains, whereas sinfull men and women were pained. First of pride, and consequently of all the seven deadly sinnes, each pain by himself.</p>

And as a king keepeth that which is his, in like wise doth pride keep the proud folke that be in his iurisdiction. Great sign of reprobation it is to persevere long in pride. Pride then is a sin that displeaseth God above all other sinnes, as much as humility pleaseth him among vertues. And there is no sinne that maketh a man more semblable to the Devill than pride doth. For the proud man will not be as other men, but he must be as the Pharisie with the devil. And for that the proud man wil inhance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self above other men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the devil doth with him as the Crow having a hard nut in her bil, the which she may not crack, she beareth it up a hie in the air, and then letteth it fall upon a stone whereon it breaketh, and then she des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth and eateth it. In like wise the devil raiseth the proud man and woman for to let them fall in the hard pains of hell. As much difference is
<pb facs="tcp:57505:39"/>
between pride and humility, as the chaffe and the corn, for the chaffe is light and mounteth high, and the wind carrieth it about, and so is lost, and the corn which is heavy abideth low on the ground, and is gathered up &amp; put in garners of the farmer, and is kept for the common profit, and the chaffe is burnt, lost, and devoured of beasts. And in this wise are the proud people raised and enhansed through the entisement of the fiend of hell, and then fall down by the moist rain of death, which maketh them heavy, and causeth them to tumble by the strength of their superbious blasts into the furnace everlasting, and there to be burnt and devoured with the horrible beasts of hell. Secondly, said <hi>Lazarus,</hi> I have seen in hell a floud frozen as ice, wherein the envious men and women were plunged unto the navel, and then suddenly came over them a right cold and a great wind, that greeved, and pained them right sore, and when they would evite and eschue the wonderfull blasts of the wind, they plunged into the water with great shouts and crys lamentable to hear.</p>

Envious men be so infect and corrupt, that good odors to them stinketh, and sweet things unto them seem soure, in like wise is the good name and prosperity of other, but stinking things, and soure to them be sweet, the which be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, reproaches, adversities and evil fortunes, that they know or hear said of other. The envious folk seek their wealth in the adversity of other, as when of the harm of other, they seek the good in reioycing them, but with this they be not yet satisfied, but of a new they be tormented, for they have not such ioy without displeasure and affliction of the heart, whereby they be tormented, for hee that seeketh his wealth in the adversity of another, is like to him that seeketh the fire in the bottome of a water, or looketh for wool on an Vrchins back, the which things be but follies and abusions. Envy is but the goods and felicitys of this world, for the cursed sinne of Envy may not ascend into Heaven.

In like wise the covetous men with-hold the goods that poor men may get none, and letteth them dye for hunger. and holdeth them in their subiection, and the devill holdeth the rich men in his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection that doth the poor men wrong.</p>

And for this cause it were necessary to have a good guard at the gate, that the devil enter not. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one holdeth a horse by the bridle, he may lead him where he will, so doth the devill the gluttenous man where him list. The servant that is over easily nourished rebelleth oft against his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, the belly over filled with meat &amp; drink is rebell to the soul, so that it wil do no good operations. By gluttony many be dead which might have lived longer, &amp; so they have bin homicides of themselves, for excess of too much eating and drinking corrupteth the bodies and engendereth sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
<pb facs="tcp:57505:43"/>
the which often abridgeth and shortneth the lives. And they that nourish well the flesh, prepare meats for worms, and so the glutton is cook of worms. A man of worship would be ashamed for to be a cook of a great Lord, more ashamed should he be, to be a cook for worms. They that live after the desire of the flesh, live after the rule of the Swine, in eating with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out measure like an unreasonable beast. This is the hogge as it were an Abbot over gluttonous people, of whom they hold their order and regule, whereby they bee constrained to keep them in their cloister, that is, in the Tavern, and Ale-houses.

Letcherous men and women bee more deformed and ougly than the devill in the superaboundance of that sinne. He is a foolish marchant that makes a bargain of the which hee knoweth right well that hee shall lose thereby, and repent him of his bargain again. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wise, each Letcherous man hath great pain, and spendeth his goods and his understanding to fulfil and accomplish his lusts &amp; delights, and after repenteth him of his expence, and yet the worst is he is in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his soul till he be repentant, and do sufficient penance. The letche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous men and women living bee tormented with three infernall pains, as heat, stink, and remorse of their Conscience: For they be hot by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, they be stinking by their immundicity, for such sinne is all stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and maculateth the body and soul, where all other sinnes file but the soul.</p>
                  <p>Also they be not without remorse of conscience for the offence they have done to God, Letchery is the pit of the devill, wherein he maketh sinners to fall, to the which many helpeth the devil to cast themselves in it, when willingly they go to the brimme, knowing that the devill will cast them in; good it is not to hearken to women, better it is, not to behold them, and much better it is not to touch them.

               <p>Then sith that here before hath been spoken of vices rudely and lightly, now it behoveth hereafter to speak of vertues in the third part of this present book, the which shall be as a little garden, pleasant, full of trees &amp; flowers, in the which the contemplative person may sport &amp; play, &amp; by good ensignments gather sundry vertues, and edify himself in good exercise, wherewith his soul shall bee enormed and ordained after his spouse Iesus Christ, when he shall come to visit and dwell with him. In the beginning of the which part shall be the Orason dominicall of our Lord, with the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the better to understand it, and the said part shall contain six parts.</p>
               <p>The first part shall be the declaration of the said prayer, the second of the salutation Angelike that <hi>Gabriel</hi> made to <hi>Mary</hi> when shee conceived
<pb facs="tcp:57505:45"/>
her child Iesus, the third shall be of the twelve articles of our faith, the iv. shall be of the ten Commandements of the Law, the v. shalbe of the field of vertues. For the first, ye ought to know that by the orison of our Lord, that is the Pater noster, when wee say it wee demand of God suffisance of all things necessary, for salute and help of our souls and of our bodys, not only for us, but for all other, and for all this cause we ought to have the said orison in great contemplation, &amp; say it with great devotion unto God And unto young people it should be taught and said to them, for though they understand it not, yet it profiteth them to have the kingdom of heaven and they say it in perfect love and charity. In the <hi>Pater noster</hi> we ask seven petitions, by each petition we may understand seven other things, as the seven Sacraments of holy Church, the seven gifts of the holy ghost, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven armours of iustice spirituall. The seven vertues principall that wee should exercise. The seven works of mercy bodily. The seven works of mercy ghostly. The seven deadly sinnes, that we should dread. The declaration is this, Our father which art in heaven, thy name be made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. In this petition we ask of God our Father to be his Sons, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we cannot be called his Sons, nor he our Father, and that his name may be made by us more holy than any other thing, wherefore we receive the Sacrament of baptism, without that man may not be made the Son of God, and to receive the vertue of meeknesse against pride, and then to cloth the naked and help the needy both bodily and ghostly. The second is thy kingdome come to us, in this petition. Insomuch the name of God may not be perfectly hallowed of us in this world, we ask his realm, in the which perfectly we shall hallow it, for to that kingdome we be very heirs, This petition is the sacrament of priesthood by the which we are taught to good works, and the gift of the holy ghost is the gift of understanding, for to understand and desire the kingdome of heaven, and we arm us with the helm of largess against covetous. The third petition is, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven, for it is the perfect will of God that his will should be fulfilled, that is his commandement: by this petition we make obeisance to God in our hearts when we desire to do his will, by this is understood the sacrament of marriage, by the which we avoid fornication and the gift of counsell of the holy ghost, for to order our obeysance verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and so we arm us with the armour of salvation against Envy. The fourth petition is our daily bread give us this day. Here we ask of God to be sustained with materiall bread for our bodies, and spirituall bread for our souls, that is the bread of life the body of Iesus Christ the which wee receive by faith, in mind of his passion. The gift of the holy ghost is strength to be faithfull in our belief, take we the sword of patience against the sinne of ire, and visit the sick men bodily, and use vertue of temperance against wrath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The fift petition is forgive us our sinnes, as we forgive all men, for trust well, he that will not forgive for the love of God, God will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
<pb facs="tcp:57505:45"/>
him his sinnes. And these three petitions following we ask of God to be delivered from all evill, as of the sin that we have done deadly, and by these wee ask of God to be assoiled, and to give us pardon by his mercy, by the which we understand the sacrament of penance and forgiveness of sinne, the holy ghosts gift is science for to understand the works of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and to escape sin.</p>
               <p>And so clothe us with lightnes against covetise, &amp; comfort poor prisoners and give good counsell to them that ask and need it, and take the vertue of faith against covetise. The vi. petition is, suffer us not to be overcome in temptation by the second evill that is done, but it may happen and we fall by the way of temptation. Here we ask of God to be stedfast in the faith, &amp; that we may gladly do good works in the vertue of hope and strength to do good deeds, and to withstand temptation, to the which profiteth to us the sacrament of confirmation, which giveth to us the knowledge of God by the vertue of verity. The gift of the holy ghost, &amp; so take we the spear of soberness against gluttony, &amp; comfort Pilgrims by vertue of hope. The vii. petition is to deliver us from evill. Amen. The third evill, is evill of pain, that sinners may have if they serve not God, &amp; by this petition we ask that we may be delivered from all pains, and saved in Paradice, unto this say we all. Amen. By these we ask, so it be done as we desire. By the which we receive the sacrament of the latter annointing, which giveth us the sure way of salvation, the gift of the holy ghost is dread of iudgements of God, and gird us with the girdle of chastity against letchery, and bury we them that be dead bodily, and pray for our enemies ghostly, get in us the vertue of charity, and eschue the sin of letchery.</p>

They knowledge God and love him that keep his commandements, &amp; they misknow him that do not so, to whom in the great necessity of their deceasing, and at the day of iudgment, shall misknow them, and say to them, I know ye not, nor wot not what ye be, go ye cursed out of my company. Knowledg we then God and love him, and if we will do thus, know we first our self, &amp; by the knowledge of our self, we shall come to the knowledge and love of God, and the more wee know our self the better we shall know God, and if we be ignorant of our self, we shall have no knowledge of God. To this purpose we must note one thing and know seaven. The thing wee must note is this, whosoever knoweth himself, knoweth God, and shall not be damned, and who is knoweth not himself, knoweth not God, and shall not be saved: understand of them that have wit and discretion with lawfull age, of the which knowledge none is excused after he hath sinned deadly, for to say that he was ignorant. By this appeareth the ignorance of himself &amp; of God right perillous. Deadly sin is beginning of all evill, &amp; contrarily, knowledge of God, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, is soveraign science and vertue, beginning of all goodnesse. The seven things we ought to have, been the xii. articles of the faith which wee ought to beleeve stedfastly. Also the petitions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in the Pater noster, by the which we demand all things necessary for our health, and that we ought to
<pb facs="tcp:57505:51"/>
hope in him, also the commandements of the Law, and of the holy Church which ensigneth us what we should do, and what we should not do, and all things belonging to the same. Also if we be in the grace of our Lord, or not. And howbeit we may not know it certainly, neverthelesse wee may have some coniectures, which be good to know, and knowledge of GOD. Also knowledge of himselfe, by the which things we may come to the true love and charitie of God, to accomplish his commandements, and merit in the realme of heaven, wherein wee shall live perdurably. Of the iii. first is enough said, that is, to know the twelve articles of the faith, in the which lieth our faith and beleefe, and the things that we ought to demand of God be contained in the Pater noster, wherein our hope lyeth. Also the ten com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Law, and of holy Church, whereas charity is shewed in such as keep them, by probation of the love of God, and doe his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements and good works. Now will we speak of the other foure, and first of the vocation in which we be, which is the fourth thing that each man ought to know. Each man ought to know his vocation, &amp; the things belonging to the same be iust and honest for his health, and rest of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
               <p>A good shepheard ought to know the art of sheep-keeping, and to govern sheep, and lead them into pastures, and to heale them when they be sicke, and sheere them in season, to the intent, through his default no damage come to his master. In like wise hee that laboureth the corne, to know what ground were good for every manner of graine, and ought to till the earth, and when time is, to sow, weed, reape, and thresh, so that his Master may have no damage by him. Semblably a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ought to know how to comfort and heale such folkes, as hee hath charge of, without hiding of his art or Surgery. Consequently a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant ought to know the utterance of his marchandise to others, with no more fraud than he would himself should have. Also an Advocate or a Proctor ought to know the rites and customes of places, that by their fault Iustice be not perverted. A Iudge also ought to know (both the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties heard) who hath right and who hath wrong, and iudge equally after true Iustice. Also a Priest or a religious man ought to know their orders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and keep them, and above all things ought to know the law of God, and teach them unto the ignorant. And thus of all other vocations. For all them as know not their vocation be not worthy to be, and live in peril of their soules for their ignorance. The fift, that all men ought to know, is, if he have discretion and understanding, to know if he be in the grace of God or not. And how it be right difficile, for God only knoweth it, neverthelesse we may have coniectures that sheweth it, and sufficient for Shepheards and lay people to know, if they be in the love of the Lord, &amp; if they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture to be in it, therefore there ought none to repute themselves iust, but ought to humble themselves, &amp; ask him mercy, as maketh sinners become
<pb facs="tcp:57505:51"/>
and none other. Principally we ought to know this science when we will receive the body of Iesus Christ. For who that receiveth his grace and good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes, receiveth his salvation, and who that receiveth him otherwise, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth everlasting damnation, of the which thing every man is iudge in himself of his owne conscience, and none other. The coniectures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may know if that we be in the grace of God or not. The first coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is when we do travel for to clense our conscience of our faults by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance as much as if we laboured to get some great good, that wee be not culpable of any deadly sin done, or in will to doe, nor in any sentence, then it is good coniecturing to be in the grace of God. The second coniecture that sheweth in like wise to be in the grace of God is, when we bee more prompt and ready to good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> observing and keeping the commandements of God, and doe all good workes that we should have accustomed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The third coniecture is, when wee hear gladly the word of God, as Sermons and good counsellers for our saluation. The fourth when we be sorry and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite at our heart to have commised and done any sin. The fift is, when with good purpose and will of our selves, we persever to keep us from sin in time to come. These coniectures be they, whereby Shepheards and lay people know if they be in his grace or not, as much as in them is possible to know. The sixt thing that every man ought to know is God, for all men ought to know God, for to accomplish his will and commandement, by the which he would be loved with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all the force that we have, which we may not doe if we know him not, then who that would love God, ought to know him, and the more that they know him, the more they love him: wherefore hereafter shall be said how Shepheards and simple people doe know him. Shepheards and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple people for to have knowledge of God, of their possibility considering 3 things. The first is that they consider the right great riches of God his puissance, his soveraign dignity, his soveraign noblenesse, his sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign ioy and blisse. The second is, for they consider the right noble, right great and marvellous operations and workes of our Lord God. And the third consideration is, for they consider the innumerable benefits that they have received of God, and that continually every day they receive of him, and by these considerations they come to his cognisance and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. First to know God, Shepheards and lay people consider his great riches, plenteous abundance of the goodnesse that he hath, for all the treasures and riches of heaven and of the earth bee his, and all goodnesse he hath made, of the which he is fountaine, creator, and master, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributeth them largely unto every creature, and he hath no need of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wherfore it behoveth to say that he is right rich. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly he is right puissant, for by his great puissance hee hath made heaven, earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the sea, with all things contained in them, and might undoe them if it were his will, unto the which puissance all other be subiect, and tremble before
<pb facs="tcp:57505:52"/>
him for his great excellency. And who that would consider every work of God, should find enough to marvell on. By the first of these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s God is known to be right rich by gifts that he giveth to his friends: and by the second he is known right puissant, for to avenge him on his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Thirdly he is soveraignly worthie, for all the things of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth oweth him honour, and reverence, as to their Creatour and him that made them, as wee see children honour father and mother of whom they be descended by a generation: and all things be descended of God by a creation, to whom ought to be given great reverence, and he is so worthie. Fourthly, hee is soveraignly noble, for who that is soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rich, puissant, and worthie, him behoveth to be soveraignlie noble, but none other but God hath riches, puissance, and dignity as he hath, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of such nobles ought to be said that he is right noble. Fifthly he hath soveraign ioy, for he that is rich, puissant, worthie, and right noble, is not without soveraign ioy, and this ioy is full of all goodnesse, and ought to be our felicitie, to the which we hope to come. That is, to know and see God in his soveraign ioy, and gladnesse, for to have with him eternall ioy that ever shall endure. And this is the first consideration of GOD. that shepheards and other simple people ought to have. Secondly for to know God, considering his great noblenesse and marvellous workes, the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the beauty of the things that he hath made, for it is commonly said, one may know the workman by the work· Knowledge wee then the work of God, and knowledge we that his beauty &amp; bounty shineth in the operations that he hath made, which if they bee fair and good, the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath made them must needs bee fair and good without compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, more than any thing that he hath made. Be it considered of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the things therein set, what noble and marvellous work, how may one consider their excellence &amp; beauty. Bee it considered also as we may of the earth, the right noble &amp; marvellous works of God, the gold, the silver, and all manner of metals &amp; precious stones in it, the fruits that it beareth, the trees, the beasts that it sustaineth, and of the bountie that it nourisheth. Be it in like wise considered of the sea, the rivers, &amp; the fish nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in them. The weather, the elements, the ayre, the winds, &amp; the birds that flie in them, and all the usage and service of men. And consider the workeman that of his puissance hath made all, &amp; by his sapience hath right well ordered his works, and governeth them by his great bounty, and by this manner we may know God, as shepheards and simple folkes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering his work. Thirdly for to know God, consider the great benefits that we receive daily of him, which may not be numbred for their great multitude, nor spoken of for their noblenesse &amp; dignity, albeit in their hearts be vi. principally noted. For the which another Shepheard giving prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to God, said in this manner. Lord God I know thou hast indued me with thy infinit benefits by thy great bounty. First the benefit of thy crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:57505:52"/>
by the which thou madest me a reasonable man unto thy image and similitude, giving me body and soul, and raiment to clothe me. Lord thou hast given me my wits of nature, understanding for to govern my life, my health, my beautie, my strength, and my science for to get my living honestly, I yeeld to thee graces and great thankes. Secondly, Lord I know the goodnes of my redemption, how by thy misericordious pity thou boughtst me dearly by the affection of thy most precious bloud, paines, and torments, that for me thou hast suffered, &amp; finally endured death, thou hast given me thy body, thy soul, and thy life, for to keep me from damnation, wherefore humblie I yeeld to thee graces and great thankes. Thirdlie, Lord I know the goodnesse of my vocation, how of thy great grace thou hast called me again, for to inherit thy eternall benediction, and also thou hast given unto me faith and knowledge of thine owne self, as baptism, and all the other sacraments that none intendment may comprize their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse and dignity, &amp; that so many times hath pardoned me of my sinnes. Lord I know that this is to mee a singular gift, that thou hast not given to them which have no knowledge of thee, whereof I am more beholding &amp; humblie bound, I yeeld thee graces and thanks. Fourthly, Lord I know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that thou hast given this world and the things that be therein made for my service and use, the office, the benefit, and the dignity in the which I am, for sir I bear your similitude and image, which is reputed right wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie &amp; noble, whereof humbly I yeeld thee graces and thanks. Fiftly, Lord thou hast given me the skie and his fair ornaments, the Sun, the Moon, and the Starres, that the day and night serveth me, giving brightnes and light without to be recompenced by me, whereof I yeeld to thee graces and thanks. Sixtly, Lord I knowledge thou hast made Paradise readie for to give me, where I shal live with thee in ioyes without end, if I do thy wil and keep thy commandements, &amp; also I knowledge thy other infinit good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes each day done to me by thy bounty, the which ensigneth me to know my God, my Saviour, and Redeemer, wherefore I humbly give thanks to thee. By these considerations Shepheards and simple people contempleth the bounty of God, and the benefits that they receive of him. And know we him, and be we not in great knowledge of his benefits, in yeelding thanks and praisings to him, and recompence of your goods in giving to poor folkes for his sake, for ingratitude is a villain sinne that much displeaseth God. The seventh, and the last thing that each man ought to know, is to know himself, for it is the best meanes for to come unto the knowledge of God, and for to make his salvation, so to know himself first. Divers folk know many things that know not themselves, to whom should profit more to know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than all things in the world. They that know the things of the world love them, seek them, and keep them, &amp; know not, ne love, ne praise not, ne keep not, God in like wise, for they know him not. What profiteth man to win all the world &amp; lose himself for to be damned?
<pb facs="tcp:57505:53"/>
Better it were for him to leese all the world, if it were his, if he knew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be saved. Shepheards say the needfull beginning of his salvation is to know himself, and contrariwise ignorance of himself is the beginning of damnation, anv of all evill that may befall unto him.</p>
               <p>A question of a Master Shepheard to a simple shepheard, to weet, how he knew himself, and he said, Shepheard tell me how thou knowest thy self, what art thou? answer to me. And hee said, I know my self, for I am a Christian man, a Shepheard. What is it to be a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard? And he answered, unto that thou askest what man is, I say that man is a substance composed of body &amp; soul, the body is mortall and made of earth, as beasts be, but the soul is made of spirituall matter, as Angells be, immortall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> My body is come of abominable sin, and as a sack full of durt and filth, and meat for wormes, my beginning was vile, my life is pain, labour, feare, and in subiection to death, and my end shall be wofull: but my soul is created of GOD, noblie and worthilie to his own image and semblance, after the Angels, the most fairest and perfect of all creatures, by baptism and by faith is made his daughter, his spouse, his heir of his realm, that is Paradise, and for her noblenesse and dignitie ought to be a Lady, and my body as servant ought to obey her, for reason hath ordained and will that it be so: and who that doth otherwise, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth his body before his soul, leeseth the usage of reason, and maketh himself semblable unto beasts, descending from noble dignity, into mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable servitude of sensuality, by the which it is grounded, so that I know my self man. As to the second, he demandeth what thing it is to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man: I answer, in my understanding, to be a Christian man is to be baptized or christned, and follow Iesus Christ, of whom we be said Christians for to be baptized, and not to follow him, or to follow him and not to be baptized saveth not man, and therefore when we receive baptism, we renounce the devill and all his pomps, and we make promise for to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Iesus Christ: when we say (we will be baptized) and who that kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth this promise hath the very name of a Christian man, And who that keepeth it not, is a sinner and a lyer to God, and servant to the devil, and is no more christian than a dead man, or a painting on a wall, we say that is a man. Here demandeth the master Shepheard, in how manie things the Christian man ought to follow Iesus Christ for to accomplish the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of baptism. The simple shepheard answereth, I say in six things, the first in cleannesse of conscience, for there is nothing more pleasant to God than a clean conscience, and it will be made clean in two manners, one is, by baptism when we receive it, and the other by patience, that is, contrition of heart, confession of mouth, satisfaction of work, and then when we be clean, we be pleasant to Iesus Christ, which with the water of his mercie cleanseth the sinners that do penance, and maketh them fair. The second thing in which we ought to follow Iesus Christ, is humility, at the example of him,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57505:53"/>Lord of all the world, which humbled him to take our humanity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came mortall that was immortall, to live in poverty with us, bare oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pried pain, and finally suffer to be crucified. Thus the christian man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing him ought to meek himself. The third thing is to hold and love truth, and specially three truths; the first truth is to know our selves, for we be mortall, and sinfull, and who that dyeth in sin shall be damned, and this truth withholdeth sin, and exhorteth the sinner to doe penance and amend. The second truth is of temporall goods, for they be transitory and must be left, and this truth dispraiseth them to desire the heavenly goods that be eternall. The third truth is of God, which is the ioy that all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men ought to desire, and this truth draweth the Christian ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to love, and induceth him to good works for to merit the ioyes of Paradise. The fourth thing wherein every man ought to follow Iesus Christ, is patience in adversity, and in the spirit of life by pennace confirming of our selves in the estate of Iesus Christ, of whom the life was all in pain and poverty which he endured for us. The fift is in compassion of the poor, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Iesus Christ, that by his mercie healed the poor of all corporall infirmities, and the sinner of all ghostly sicknesse, and wee by compassion ought to give of our goods to poor folke, and comfort them bodily &amp; ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The sixt thing wherein the christian man ought to follow Iesus Christ, is dolour, devotion, charity, in contemplation of the mysteries of his nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, of his death and passion, of his resurrection, of his ascension, and of his advancing to the iudgement, that oftentimes ought to be at our heart by holy meditations. And as to the last, what thing a shepheard is, I say it is the knowledge of my vocation, as each hath his, as afore is said, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to know the transgressions of all these aforesaid things, how many times in each we have transgressed, for many times we have offended God, and who that taketh heed, shall find omissions and offences without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the which known, we ought to doubt and eschue, and do penance And thus it is as I know man is christian and shepheard.</p>

CHAP. XIX. It is written in the Apocalyps, that Saint John saw an horse of a pale colour on the which horse sate death, and hell following the horse. The horse signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the sinner that hath a pale colour, for the infirmity of sin, and beareth death, for sin is death to the soul, and hell followeth for to englut and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him if he die impenitent.</head>
               <l>ABove this horse blacke and hideous,</l>
               <l>Death I am that fiercely doe sit.</l>
               <l>There is no fairnesse but sight tedious.</l>
               <l>All gay colours I doe hit.</l>
               <l>My horse runneth by dales and hilles,</l>
               <l>And many he smiteth dead and killes.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:57505:57"/>In my trap I take some by every way,</l>
               <l>By townes and castles I take my rent,</l>
               <l>I will not respite one an houre of a day.</l>
               <l>Before me they must needs be present·</l>
               <l>I slay all with my mortall knife,</l>

               <l>With my dart I slay weake and starke.</l>
               <l>A great number it hath of me,</l>

               <l>Scant the tenth part wrong hath he.</l>
               <l>I cause many to sight at the heart.</l>

ages, as youth, strength, age, and decrepit, and been likened to the four sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the yeer: That is to wit, youth to Prime time, that is hot and moist and as the herbs and trees of the earth grow, so doth man in youth, unto xv yeers, grow of body, in strength, beauty and vigor. Force is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto summer, hot &amp; dry, &amp; the body of man is in force &amp; vigor, &amp; enripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth unto xlv. yeers. Age is compared to the time of Harvest, cold &amp; dry, then man leaveth off growing &amp; feebleth, &amp; thinketh how to gather &amp; spare for fear of default &amp; need when as hee commeth to stooping age, &amp; dureth to lvi yeers. Decrepit is likened unto the season of the Winter, cold &amp; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid by abundance of cold humors, &amp; default of naturall heat: in which time man spendeth that which he had gathered &amp; kept in the time passed, and if he have spared nothing, he abideth poor and naked, as the earth, trees, and dureth unto lxii. yeers or more. Prime time is hot and moist, nature of ayr, complexion of the sanguine. Summer is hot dry, nature of fire, complexion of cholerick. Harvest is cold and dry, nature of earth, and complexion of the melancholy. Winter is cold and moist, nature of water, complexion of the flegmatick. When complexion is well proportioned it feeleth it self better disposed in the time sembable to it, than it doth in other times. But for that every man is not well complexioned, they ought to doe as shepheards doe, that is, to take regiment to keep themselves after the seasons, and governeth them by their ensignements and teachings, which they use in every quarter of the yeer, to live the longer, wiselier, and merrily.</p>

                  <p>IN Prime time, shepheards keep themselves meetly well clothed, not over cold, nor over hot, as with linsie wolsie, Doublets of Fustian, and gownes of a meetly length, furred with Lamb most commonly. In this time is good letting bloud, to avoid the evill humours that were gathered in the winter time. If sicknesse doe happen in prime time, it is not of his nature, but proceedeth of the humors gathered in the winter passed. Prime time is a temperat time to take medicines for them that be corporate and full of thick humors to purge them. In this time they ought to eat light meats, which doe refresh, as Chickens, Kids with veriuyce, Borage, Beets, yolks of egges, egges in moon shine, Roches, Perches, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerels, and all skaled fish. Drink temperate wine, Beer, or Ale, so that they be not too strong, ne oversweet: for in this time all sweet things ought not to be used: and a man ought to sleep long in the morning, and not on the day. The shepheards have a generall rule or custome for all seasons, that availeth much against all infirmities and sicknesses, that is, not to leese his appetite for eating, and never to eat without hunger. Also say they, that all manner of flesh and fish is better rosted than soden, and if they ben sodden, to

And also they eat of meats that do refresh. Also they eat little and often; they break their fast or dine in the morning before the sun arise, and goe to supper ere it discend, and they eat often of the above said meats and sowrer for to give the man appetite. They eat but little salt meats, and refrain them from scratching, they drink oft fresh water when they be thirsty, save only at dinner and supper time, and then they do drink feebl green Wine, single Beer, or small Ale. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so they keep them from over great travell, or over forcing themselves, for in this time is nothing grievouser than chafing. In this season they eschue the company of women, and they bathe them oft in cold water to asswage the heat of their bodies enforced by labours. Alway they have with them sugarcandy or other Sugar whereof they take little and often, and each day in the morning they do force them by coughing and spitting, to void flegmes, and void them above and below the best that they can, and wash their hands with fresh water, their mouth and visage.</p>

In this season they use diligence to purge and clense themselves, bleeding also to temper the humours of their bodyes: For it is the contagiousest season of the yeer, in the which perillous infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties happen, and therefore they eat good and wholesome food, as Capons, Hens, yong Pigeons that begin to fly, and drink good wines, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good drinkes without making excesse. In this season they refrain eating of fruits, for it is a dangerous season for agues: and they say, that he had never ague that never eat fruit. In this season they drink no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and they put no part of them in cold water, but their hands &amp; face.

And after wise men say there is nothing so round as it. For it is rounder than any thing artificiall. And moreover, in this world we see nothing ne never shall, that is so iust and equall round as it self is, and is composed of the heaven, and the four elements in five princi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Vpon the earth is the water or the sea, but it covereth not the earth, to the end that men and beasts may live therein, and the part that is unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered is call'd the face of the earth, for it is as the face of a man alwayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and the part which is covered with water, is as the body of man, which is cloathed &amp; hid. On the water is the ayr, that incloseth the earth &amp; the water, and is divided into three Regions, one is low, whereas inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth beasts and birds, another mean, whereas been the cloudes, the which maketh the impressions, as lightnings thunder and other, &amp; is alway cold: the third is the highest, whereas is neither wind nor rain, nor tempest, nor other impressions, &amp; there be some mountaines that attain unto it, as is

               </p>
               <p>After that is the element of fire, which is neither flame ne coales, but is pure &amp; invisible, for the great brightnesse, for so much as the water is more clear and light than the earth, and the ayr more cleer and light than the water, of so much the fire is more cleer light, and fayrer than ayr, and the skies in equipollent been clearer, lighter, &amp; fairer than the fire, the which turneth with the movings of the heavens, and the next region of the ayr also, in the which is ingendred comets, the which been called starres, for so much as they be shining and move as stars. After the saying of some shepheards, the fire is invisible, for his subtilty, and not for his cleernesse, forasmuch as a thing is more cleer, of so much it is the more visible, for we see the skies well, but not the fire, for it is overmuch more subtile than the ayr that is invisible, for the same cause the earth and the water be thick, and therefore they be visible. The skies be neither properly heavy ne lighht, hard, ne soft, cleer, ne dark, hot, ne cold, sweet, ne soure, colour ne sound, ne such other qualities, save that they be hot in vertue, for they may cause heat here beneath by their lights, movings and influences, and be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly hard, for they may not be divided, ne broken. And also they be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly colours of light in some parts, and bee thick, as be the partes of the Stars. In the which, there may no star, nor other party be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nusted &amp; put to nor none maye be diminished, ne taken away, and they may neither increase, ne wax lesse, nor be of other figure than round, ne they may not change, ne pair, ne wax old, ne be corrupted, ne altered, but in light only, as in tyme of the Eclipse of the Son and Moon, ne they may not rest and stand still, ne turn any other wayes, later ne sooner, in part ne all, ne behave them otherwise, than after their common course, but by miracle divine, and therefore the Stars and skies be of another nature than the elements and the things of them composed, the which be transmutable and corruptible. The Elements and all things of them composed be inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed within the first skie, as the yolke of an eg is inclosed within the white, and the first skie is inclosed of the second, and the second in the third, and the third in the fourth, and so of the other. The first skie next the elements is the sky of the Moon, next is the sky of Mercury, and next is the sky of Venus, then is the sky of the Sun, then is of Mars, then of Iupiter, and after it of Saturn. And thus be the skies of the planets after their order. The eighth sky, is of the stars fixed and bee called so, for that they move more regularly, and after one guise than the planets doe. Then above, which is the first mobile: in the which nothing appeareth, as shepheards may see.</p>
               <p>Some shepheards say, above this ninth skie is one Immobile, for it turneth not, and above that is one of christall, over the which is the sky
<pb facs="tcp:57505:72"/>
imperiall, in the which is the throne of God, of the which sky shepheards ought not to speak, but onely of the first mobile, and that it containeth all together called the world. Of one thing they marvell much, that is, how God hath distributed the stars, that he hath put none in the ninth sky, and hath put so many in the eight sky, that they may not be numbred, and in each of the other seven but one onely, in calling the sun and the moon stars, as appeareth in the figure hereafter.</p>
               <trailer>Hereafter the great master Shepheard sheweth more plainly of the four ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of the similitude of the earth, &amp; how that every planet is one above another, and telleth which of them be masculine, as these five, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, and Mercury. And of two feminine as Venus and Luna. And which of them is northerly and southerly, and which be orientall or occidentall.</trailer>

The other moving is of the seven planets, and is from occident to orient above the earth, and from orient into the occident under it, and is contrary to the first, and bee the two movings that
<pb facs="tcp:57505:73"/>
shepheards knowledgeth, and how wel they been opposites yet they move continually, and be passible, as is shewed by example. If a ship on the sea came from orient into occident and that he of his own moving went in the ship softly toward orient, this man should move a double moving, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one should be of the ship and of himself together, and the other should be of his own moving that he maketh softly toward orient. Semblably, the planets be transported with their sky from orient to occident by the diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall moving of the first mobile, but later and otherwise than the fixed stars, by which each planet hath his proper moving, contrary to the moving of the stars, for the Moon maketh a course lesse in a month about the earth, than a star fixed, and the sun a course lesse in a yeer, and the other planets in a certain time, each after the quantity of his movings. Thus it appeareth that the planets move two movings. Some shepheards suppose by imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that all the skies ceased to move by the dayly moving, the Moon would make a course in going from the occident into the orient, in as much time as lasteth now xxvii. dayes and eight houres, and Mercury, Venus, and Sol would make in manner course in the space of a yeer, and Mars, in two yeer or there about, and Saturn in thirty yeer or there about. For now they make their course or revolutions, and accomplish their proper movings in the time here named. The proper movings of Planets is not straight from occident to orient, but it is
<figure/>
as sideway, and shepheards see them sensibly, for when they see the moon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a star one night, the second or third night it is behind, not straight toward orient, but shall be drawed one time toward Septentrion and another time toward midday, and this is because of the latitude of the zodiake, in the which be the xii. signes under whom the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net reigneth.</p>

For the Zodiak crosseth crookedly, and the places where it crosseth been said Equinoctials. For to understand the Equinoctial, we see sensibly all the sky turn from orient into occident, and it is called the dayly moving or diurnall; then ought one to imagine a straight line that passeth through the middle of the earth, comming from the one end of the sky to the other, about the which line is made this moving, and the two ends be two points in the sky that move not, and be called the poles of the world, of the which one is over us, by the Star of the North, that alwayes appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth unto us, and is the Pole artick or Septentrionall, and the other is under the earth, alwayes hid, called the pole Antartick, or pole Australl, in the middest of the which pole, in the first mobile, is the circle equinoctiall equally before in the part, as in the other of the said poles, and after this circle, is made and measured the daily moving of xxiiii. houres, that is a naturall day, and it is called equinoctiall, for that when the Sun is in it, the day and the night been equall through all the world. The large Zodiake as is said is in the first mobile, also it is as a girdle mannerly figured &amp; set with Images of signes intrailed subtilly and well composed, and set with fixed stars as shining Carbuncle or precious gems full of great vertue, set by the mistris right nobly adorned, in the which Zodiacke be iiii. prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal points that divide them equally in 4. parts.

                  <p>Meridian is a great circle imagined on the sky, which passeth by the poles of the world, and by the point of the sky right over our heads, the which is called Zenith, and when the Sun is come over from Orient unto that circle it is midday, and therefore it is called Meridian, and the half of that circle is over the earth, and the other under it, that passeth by the point of midnight, directly opposite to Zenith and when the Sun toucheth the part of the circle, it is midnight, and if a man goe toward orient or occident, he hath new meridian, and therefore it is sooner midday to them that bee toward Orient, then to other: if a man stand still, his Meridian is one stil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or if he goe toward mid-day or septentrion, but if he stirre, he hath other Zenith, and these two circles crosseth directly. Orison is a great circle that divideth the part of the sky that we see, from that we see not. And shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards say, that if a man were in a plaine Country, he should see iustly half of the sky, which they call their emisphery, that is to say, half spheare, &amp; orison is ioyning nigh to the earth, of the which orison, the entry is the middle and is the place in the which we have been: thus each is always in the midst of his orison and Zenith is the pole, and as a man transporteth him from one place to another, he is in the other places against the sky, &amp; hath other Zenith &amp; other Orison, all Orison is right or oblik. They have right Orison that abideth under the Equinoctiall, and have their Zenith in the Equinoctial, for their Orison intersequeth and divideth the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, even by these two poles of the world, in such wise, that none of the poles of the world is raised above their Orison ne deprived under it, but they that habit other where than under the equinoctiall have their Orison oblike for their Orison followeth and divideth the Equinoctiall side way, and not right, and there appeareth unto them of all times, one of the poles of the world, raised above their Orison, and the other be ever hid, so that they see them not, more or lesse after divers habitations, and after that they be of farnesse from the Equinoctiall, and the more that the one pole is raised, the more the orison oblike, and the other pole deprived<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; is to wit, that there is as much distance from the Orison to the pole, as from the Zenith to the Equinoctiall, and that Zenith is the fourth part of Meridian, or the middest of the bow diurnall, of the which the two ends be on the Orison. And also that of the Pole unto the Equinoctiall, is the fourth part of all the roundnesse of the skies and also of the Meridian circle, sith it passeth by the poles, and crosseth the Equinoctiall directly.

Meridian also riseth not ne resconceth. Equinoctiall is the diurnall circle, that riseth and resconceth regularly, as much in one hour as in another, and all in 23. hours. Zodiake the large circle and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, whereon the signs be, riseth and resconceth all on a day naturall, but not regularly, for it riseth more in one hour than in another, for that is ever over our orison is oblike and divideth the zodiake in two parts, whereof one is over our orison, and the other underneath. Thus half of the signes riseth over our orison every day artificially, be it short or long, and the other half by night, wherefore it behoveth, that in daies which be shorter then the nights, the signes riseth sooner, and in long dayes more at leasure, and thus the zodiake riseth not regularly in these parts as the equinoctiall, but there is double variation, for half of the zodiacke, that is from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Aries unto the end of Virgo, altogether taketh as much time in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, as half the equinoctiall that is by it, and they begin to rise in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and end in a moment also. But this half of the zodiake riseth sooner in the begining, and this half of the equinoctiall more at leasure, and this is called their obliquement.

And whether that riseth sooner the equinoctiall or the zodiake, yet allwayes they end together.

                  <figure/> FIrst, ere we speak of the stars, and knowledge that shepheards have, we will say of the division of the earth, and of the parts after their opinion. Wherefore it is to be noted that the earth is round, and therefore as a man goes from one country to another, he hath other orison then he had, and there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth other part of the sky, and if a man went from septentrion strait toward midday, the pole artike to him shall be lesse raised, that is to say, more nigh approching to the earth, and if he went contrarywise it should be more raised, that is to say, appearing higher, and therefore if he went toward midday under a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian wheel, that the pole artike were lesse raised over his orison by the 30. part of one of the vi. parts, of the Arke Meredian, he should passe the 30. part of the 6. parts of half the circuit on the earth, and to him the pole should be lesse raised by one degree, or to the contrary, till it were more raised of one degree, then he should passe one degree of the circuit of the earth, of the which all the degrees together be ccc.lx. And one degree of the earth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth 12. leagues and an half or there about, and every league is 2. mile. And as the speare of the sky is divided by the four lesse circles, five partes called Zones, so the earth is divided into five regions whereof the first is between the pole artike, and the circle artike. The second is between the circle artike and the tropike of summer. The third is between the tropike of summer &amp; the tropike of winter. The fourth is between the tropike of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the circle Antartike. The fift between the circle antartike, and the pole antartike. Of which parts of the earth some shepheards say, that the first and the fift be inhabitable for their over great coldnesse, for they be too far from the Sun. The third is in the middle, is too near, under the way of the Sun, and is inhabitable for the great heat. The other two parts the second and the fourth, be neither too near, ne too far from the Sun, but be moderate in heate and cold, and therefore they be inhabitable if there be no other letting: and suppose it be true, yet it is not impossible to passe overthwart the region under the way of the Sun, called Zone, turned to go from the second to the fourth. For some shepheards would have pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed which would have shewed it, wherefore they say that there is no region habited but the second wherein we and all other be.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:57505:76"/>SHepheards say, that if it were possible that the earth were inhabited all about, and pose the case that it were so, first they that inhabit under the Equinoctiall have alwayes the dayes and the nights equall, and have the two poles of the world, at the 2. corners of the orison, and may see all the stars, when they see the two poles, and the sun passeth twice a year over them, that is, when it passeth by the equinoctials. Thus the sun is to them the one half of the yeer toward the pole artick, and the other half toward the other pole, and therefore they have two winters in a yeer without great cold; one is, when we have winter, and the other when we have summer. Semblably they have two Summers, one in March, when we have prime time, and the other in September, when we have harvest, and by this they have four solstices, two high, when the sun passeth by their zenich, and two low, when it declineth one way or other, and thus they have four umbres or shadowes in a yeer, for when the sun is in the equinocts twice in the yeer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the morning their shadowes be in the occident, and at night in the orient, and then at noon they have no shadowes, but when the Sun is in the signes septentrionals, their shadowes be toward the parts of the signes meridiona<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> summer, have in like wise two summers, and two winters, and four shadowes in a yeer, and they have no difference of the first, save that they have longer dayes in summer, and shorter in winter, for as the Equinoctiall lengtheneth, so likewise doth the dayes in summer, and in that part of the earth is the first climate, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most half of the second, &amp; is named Araby, wherein is Ethiopia. Thirdly they that inhabit under the Tropike of summer, have the Sun over their heads: and at the day of the solstice of Summer at noon, they have their shadowes smaller then we have, and there is a part of Ethiopia Fourthly, they that be between the tropike of summer, and the circle Artike have longer daies in summer then the above said, in as much as they be further from the Equinoctiall, and shorter in winter, and they have the sun over their heads, ne toward septentrion, and that part of the earth we inhabit. Fiftly, they that inhabit under the circle Artike, have the eclyptike of the Zodiake to their orison, and when the sun is in the solstice of summer it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sconceth not, and thus they have no night but naturall dayes of 24. hours. Semblably when the Sun is in the solstice of winter, it is natural day when they have continuall night<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the Sun riseth not to them. Sixtly, they that be between the Circle artike, and the pole artike have in summer divers natural dayes, that be to them one day artificial without any night. And in winter be many naturall daies, which are to them alwayes night, &amp; the more that it approcheth the pole, the more is the artificial day all sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer long, and dureth in some place a week, in other a month in other two, in other three, in other more, &amp; proportionally the night is greater, for some of the signes be ever on their orison, and some alwayes under, and as long
<pb facs="tcp:57505:77"/>
as the Sun is in the signes above, it is day, and while it is in the signs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, it is night. Seventhly, they that inhabit right under the Pole, have the Sun half of the year on their horison, and have continuall day, and the other half of the year continuall night, and the equinoctiall is in their orison that divideth the signes six above &amp; six beneath wherefore when the sun is in the signes that be high, and toward them, they have continual day, and when it is in the signes toward midday they have continual night, and thus in a year they have but one day and one night. And as it is said of that part of the earth toward the pole Artick, a man may understand of the other half, and of the habitations toward the pole Antartick.</p>

                  <p>SHepheards and other, as they divide the earth inhabitable in 7. parts, that they call climates. The first Diamerous. The second Climate Diaciens. The third Dalixandry. The fourth, Diathodes. The fift climate Diaromes. The sixt Daboristines. The seventh Diaripheos. Of the which, each hath his longitude determined, and the latitude also, and the nearer they be to the Equinoctiall, the longer they be, and larger, and proceed in longitude from orient to occident, and in latitude, from midday to Septentrion. The first climate after some shepheards containeth in length half the circuit of the earth, that is, two hundred thousand &amp; 4 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred mile, &amp; it hath a hundred thousand &amp; two hundred mile of length. The second, and so of the other, for the lessening of the earth comming toward Septentrion. To understand what a climate is, after the saying of the shepheards. A climate is a space of earth equally large, whereof the length is from orient to occident, and the breadth is comming from midday, and from the earth inhabitable, toward the Equinoctiall, drawing to septentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as much as an horologe or clock changeth not. For in earth habitable the clocks change vii. times in the breath of the climates. It is of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to say that they be seaven, and where the variation of horologes is, there is the diversity of climates, howbeit that such variation properly ought to be taken in the midst of the climates, and not in the beginning or end, for the proximity and covenance the one of the other. Also one climate, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a day artificial of summer, shorter or longer then another climate &amp; this day sheweth the difference in the midst of every climate, better than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning or end, the which thing wee may sensibly know at eye, and thereby iudge the difference of the climates. And it is to be noted that under the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall, the dayes and the nights in all times are equal, each of twelve houres, but comming toward septentrion the dayes of summer longeth, and the winter dayes shorteth, and the more that one approcheth sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentrion, the more waxeth the dayes in such wise, that at the five of the last climate the dayes in summer be longer by three houres and an

At the beginning of the first climate, the longest day of summer hath 12. houers and xlv. minutes, and in the pole is raised on the orison 12. degrees and xlv minutes, and the midst of the climate, the longest day hath 13. hours, and the pole raised xvi. degrees and the latitude dures unto the longest day of summer that is 13. houres, and xv. minutes, and the pole raised 20. degrees and an half, which largenesse is ccccxl. mile of earth.

<pb facs="tcp:57505:78"/>
began now at midday, he should passe every day naturall, the twelfth part of the circuit of the earth, and be 20. degrees, whereof it behoveth that the Sun make a course about the earth, and 30. degrees further or he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned on the morrow at the meridian of the said man, and so the said man should have his day and night of 26. houres, and should bee further by the twelfth part of a naturall day than if he rested him, wherefore it followeth of necessity, that in twelve naturall days the sayd man should only have but 11. dayes and 11. nights, and somewhat lesse, and that the Sun should light him but eleven times, &amp; resconce eleven times, for eleven dayes, and eleven nights, every day &amp; night of 26. hours make 12. naturall dayes, each day of 24. houres. In like manner it behoveth that another man should make this course going toward Orient have his day and night shorter than a naturall day by 2. houres, then his day and night should bee but of 22. hours, then if he made this course in like space, to wit, in twelve days and somewhat more. Thus if <hi>John</hi> made the course toward occident, and <hi>Peter</hi> toward orient, and that <hi>Robert</hi> abode them at the place whence they depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the one as soon as the other, and they meet at <hi>Robert</hi> both together. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> would say he had 2 dayes and 2. nights more than <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> who had rested a day lesse than <hi>Peter,</hi> and a day more than <hi>John,</hi> howbeit they have made this course in 12. naturall dayes, or an hundred, or in 10. yeers all is one. This is a pleasant consideration among shepheards how <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> arive one self day, put case it were on sunday: <hi>John</hi> would say it is Saturday, <hi>Peter</hi> would say munday, and <hi>Robert</hi> would say Sunday.</p>

               <p>THe heavens and the earth may be divided in four parts by two circles which crosse directly over the two poles, and crosseth four times the Equinoctiall line. Each of the four parts divided into three equally, is in all 12. equall parts, as well in the sky as in the earth, which shepheards call houses, and be twelve. Of the which six be alwayes above the earth, and six under it, and these houses move not, but be always each in their place, and the signes and planets passeth by them always once in four and twenty hours. Three of these houses be from Orient to mid-night going under the earth, the first, second, and the third, whereof the first under the earth beginneth at Orient named the house of life. The second house of substance and riches. The third that finisheth at mid-night is the house of fraternity. The fourth that beginneth at mid-night comming in Occident, is named the house of patrimony. The fift following is the house of sons. The sixt finisheth in Occident under the earth, is the house of sicknesse. The seventh beginneth in Occident on the earth, and stretcheth towards mid-day, and is the house of marriage. The eight is the house of death. The ix. finishing at mid-day, is called the house of faith, of religion, and pilgrimage. The tenth beginning at mid-day comming towards Orient is the house of honor and regality. The eleventh after that is the house of true friends.

The second hour is for the planet ensuing, &amp; the third for the other as they are here figured by order, and it behoveth to go from Sol to Venus, Mercury &amp; Luna them come again to Saturn, unto 12. that is the hour before the Sunnes going down: and incontinent after the Sun is down, beginneth the first hour of the night that is for the xiii planet, and the 2. hour of the night for the 14. and so unto 12. hours for the night, that is the nexte hour before the Sun rising and come directly falling upon the 24. planet, that is next before that of the day following. And thus the day hath 12. hours, and the night 12. also, the which be temporall hours, different to the hours of the clocks, the which be artificials. Shepheards say, that Saturn and Mars

               <p>The houres of the planets been different to them of clocks, for the hours of clocks been equall at all times each of lx. minutes, but they of the planets when the dayes and the nights be equall that the Sun is in one of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinocts, they be equall, but as soon as the dayes lengthen or shorten, so do the naturall houres. By this it is convenient alway for the day to have 12. temporall houres, and the night also, and when the days be long, and the houres long, and when the dayes be short, and the houres short, in like manner is the night, and neverthelesse an hour of the day, and an hour of the night together have six score minutes, as many as two hours for ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificials, that the one leaveth the other taketh.

The moon taketh her light of the Sun 22. times in a year, and also the moon is cold and moist of nature: and her colour is much fairer than silver, and her chief house is Cancer, and there is none of the other planets that is so slow and goeth so little ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>PHysnomy of the which been spoken a fore, is a science that shepheards have to know the naturall inclination of man and woman, good or evill, by divers signes on them in beholding them onely. The which incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation we ought to follow if it be good, but if it be evill by vertue &amp; strength of understanding wee ought to eschue and avoide it, and to withstand the said evill inclinations. Shepheards use this science none otherwise. The prudent, vertuous and wise man, may bee of all other as touching their manners, otherwise than their signs shew in their reign. Thus the things demonstred, as to vice is not in a wise man, though the sign be so, as an ale stake, or a sign is sometime hanged before a house<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the which oft times is no Ale. Howbeit that a man by his wisedome and understanding follow not the evill influences of the celestiall bodies that be upon him, and yet he corrupteth not the signs and demonstrations of the said influences, but those signes naturally have seignory on them in which they bee, for to have naturally that which they signifie, whether a man have them or not,
<pb facs="tcp:57505:86"/>
wherefore shepheards say that the most part of men &amp; women follow their naturall inclinations to vice or vertue, for that the most part of them be not wise &amp; prudent as they ought to be, and they use no vertue of their own minds, but ensue their sensuality, and by this the celestiall influence of the which is shewed by signes exteriors, and of such signs is the said science of Phisnomy. For the which it behoveth first to know that the time is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into four parts, as it hath been before said, that is to wit, Prime time, Summer, Harvest, and Winter, that be compared to the four Elements, Prime time to the ayr, Summer to the fire, Harvest to the earth, &amp; Winter to the water. Of the which four Elements every man and woman is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and made, and without the which none may live. The fire is hot and dry. The ayr is hot and moist. The water is moist and cold. The earth is cold and dry. Also some say, the person on whom the fire domineth, is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick of complexion, which is to say hot &amp; dry. He on whom the ayr domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is sanguine of complexion, which is hot and moist. He on whom the water domineth, is Flegmatick of complexion, which is moist and cold. Hee on whom the earth domineth, is melancholy of complexion, which is cold and dry. The which complexions they know and discern the one from the other by signs which are said here-after.</p>

               <head>CHAP XLII. The judgment of mans body.</head>
               <p>TO come to our purpose of speaking visible signes, we will begin to speak at the signes of the head. First wee advertise that one ought to beware of all persons that hath default of members naturally, as of foot, hand, eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or other member, and though he be but a criple, and specially of a man that hath no beard, for such be inclined to divers vices and evils, and one ought to eschue his company as his mortall enemy. Also shepheards say, that much and plain hair signifieth a person piteous and debonair. They that have red hair be commonly irefull and lack wit, and been of little truth. Black hair, good visage, and good colour, signifieth very love of Iustice. Hard hair signifieth that the person loveth peace and concord, and is of good and subtile wit. A man that hath black hair and a red beard, signifies to be letcherous, disloyall, a vanter, and one ought not to trust in him.

Black hair and crisp signifieth melancholy, letchery, evill thought, and very large hanging hair, signifieth wit with malice. Great plenty of hair in a woman signifieth boisterousnesse and covetise.

But when any looketh in casting his eyes aside, as by wantonnesse, such persons be deceitfull, and purchaseth to grieve him and such persons will dishonor women, and they ought to be taken heed of, for such looks be false, letcherous and deceivable. They that have small greyish eyes and sharp, signifieth a person melancholous, hardy, an evill speaker and cruell. And if a little vein appear between the eyes and the nose of a wench, they say it signifieth virginity, and in a man subtilty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and if it appear great and black, it signifies corruption, heat and melancholy in women, and in man rudenesse and default of wit, but that vein appeareth not always.

               <p>Shepheards say, for that there are divers signes in a man and woman, and that they be sometime contrary one to the other, one ought to iudge for the most part after the signes in the visage. First of the eyes, for they be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, they say also God formed no creature to inhabit the world wiser then man, for there is no condition in a beast but is comprehended in man. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally a man is hardy as the Lyon, true and worthy as the Ox, large and liberall as the Cock, avaricious as the Dog, and aspre as the Hart, debonair and true as the Turtle, malicious as the Leopard, prevy and tame as the Dove, dolorous &amp; guilefull as the Fox, simple and debonaire as the Lambe, shrewd as the Ape, light as the Horse, soft and pitifull as the Bear, dear and precious as the Eliphant, good and wholsome as the Vnicorn, vile &amp;

               <head>CHAP. XLIII Shepheards practise that quadrant of the night, as yee may see by this figure.</head>
               <p>BY this figure one may know the hours by night as followeth, let the Star be known we call the pomel of the sky, right under is the summer, at the hour of mid-night, &amp; the place on the earth against the star that we call the Angel of the earth. When we wil see it at eie we behold
<pb facs="tcp:57505:89"/>
our Pomel, and I behold under this cord and the nether end of my cord is the angle of the earth, and the Sun is right under it. The long line that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseth the star of the figure, that is the pomel of the skies, serveth for two hours, and the small lines for one hour. But yet serve lines as the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the star that signifieth mid-night, &amp; consequently the other hours for the long hours serve to a month, and the small to fifteen days. Let the cord be stretched, that it be seen over the pomel, note some star un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cord, that may be alway known, and that shall be it that alway shall shew us the hours of the night. After imagine a circle about the pomel, and distance of the star marked, in which circle be imagined the lines or semblable distances, as in the figure. As many distances as the marked star shall be before the cord, so many hours shall there be before midnight, and as many as shalbe behind the cord, so many hours be after midnight. It must be known that the star marked changed the place in xv. days, by the distinction of an hour, in a month of two. Wherfore it behoveth to take midnight in xv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> days further by the distance of an hour, and in a month

                  <pb facs="tcp:57505:89"/>
of two, and in two months of four, and in three months of six, so as in six months the star marked that was right under the pomell shall be right over, and in other six months it will come to the point where as it was first marked, and this said marked star one ought not to change, but ought to choose it among many for the most knowledgable, and for the most to be found among other.</p>

                  <head>By this present figure, shepheards know by night in the fields all seasons, what time and hour it is, be it before midnight or after.</head>
                  <p>The xxiv. letters without the figure, be for the xxiv. hours of a naturall day, and the xii. within been for the xii. months. The star in the middest is the pomel of the skies, with the which it behoveth to know one that is next it, which shall be a marked star, and it by the which one may know
<figure/>
the hour in the manner as afore is said, in taking mid-night in fifteen days, further more by the distance of an hour.</p>
                  <p>FOr to know by night the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst mid-day as of midnight, the high Orient, and the high Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the low Orient, &amp; the low Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and the place in the sky, over against which every signe riseth. Shepheards useth this practice. They hang a cord that is made sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast above and beneath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then another with a plomb, that descendeth till it be time for to stay it that they may be a little distance one from another, so that one may see the star of the pomel right under the two cordes at once, then they stay the cord with the plomb above, or beneath. Now who that will see mid-day directly be it night or day, goe on the other side the cords, and thou shalt see the place against midday. Then come on the first side, &amp; thou shalt see the place against midnight though it be day. For the highest point of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diak in the longest day of Summer let the Sun be seen under the two cords at the hour of midday, and that
<pb facs="tcp:57505:90"/>
he be so near that he touch the cords, and marke in the cord toward the Sun, the height that he hath seen it, then by night mark some stars that one may alway know on, in the same place is the passage of the solstice of Summer. And when the days be at the shortest, the star which we see at midnight in the said point of mid-day, been directly they that be next to the solstice of Summer, that which hath the sign next toward orient is Cancer, and the sign next toward Occident is Gemini. And it is said from the height of the solstice of Summer, one may practice the low solstice of Winter, the which we see on the mid-day, when the day is at the shortest over the place against midnight, and his next sign toward Orient is Capricorn, and that toward Occident is Sagittarius. One may mark the high Orient or the low, but it behoveth that it be when the days be at the longest or shortest &amp; the distance between the two Orients divided into six equall parts, by each riseth two signes, by the nearest part of the high Orient, riseth Gemini and Cancer, by the second Taurus and Leo, by the third Aries and Virgo, by the fourth Pisces and Libra, by the fift Aquarius and Scorpio, by the sixt more near the Occident Capricornus and Sagittarius, and divers other things which may be practiced on the sky.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T behoveth for to think afore the beginning of Matins on the words that Iesus said in the garden, the night afore that he took his blessed passion, Father if it be possible transport from me this chalyce. How be it my will be not don, but thine, and that in so saying, he suffered so great payn, that he sweat droppes of bloud, in such abundance, that it ran down to the ground.</p>
               <p>And at Matins time it behoveth to think how as the traytour <hi>Judas</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched him to our Lord, and kissing him sayd, <hi>Ave rabbi.</hi> I salute thee Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. And that the meek and benign Iesus withdrew not his visage from the traitour, and how hee suffered himself to be taken and bounden as a theef, and cast to the earth, reviled, spitten on, and left of his disciples and servants. At Landes, it behoveth to think and consider, Iesus being in the house of <hi>Annas,</hi> and after in the house of <hi>Caiphas</hi> dispyteously beaten, blasphemed, stretched, and bespitten in his most precious visage, his eies bounden, and after troden under foot inhumanely.</p>
               <p>At Prime it behoveth to think how as Iesus was led from the house of <hi>Caiphas</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the beatings that he had. And how <hi>Pilate</hi> exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him of that they had wrongfully accused him of, and how he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly beaten at a piller before a great multitude of people, and crowned with thornes.</p>
               <p>At Tierce it behoveth to think how Iesus was presented before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with a crown of thornes, clothed with a mantle of purple, and the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed people cryed <hi>Crucifige, Crucifige eum.</hi> And how <hi>Pilate</hi> condemned him to the most bitterfull death, and how he bare the heavy cross upon his sacred shoulders.</p>
               <p>At noon it behoveth to think how Iesus was lead to the mount of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vary, shedding his precious blood, and how he fell divers times under his Crosse. And how he was nailed with great blunt nailes, and the dolour that he suffered when it was let fall into the morteis. And think also of the dolours of his sorrowfull mother.</p>
               <p>At high noon it behoveth to think what dolour he was in when he said, my God, my God, wherefore hast thou left me. And when he said, I thirst, they gave him vineger and gall mingled, and how he abode the death, after sighes made, he gave up the ghost to God his father. And how his mother had great sorrow also.</p>
               <p>At Evensong it behoveth to think how Iesus had his side opened with a speare, and how he hung dead on the Crosse full of wounds from the top
<pb facs="tcp:57505:93"/>
of his head to the soles of his feet, and he taken down, and how his mother layed him on her lappe weeping.</p>
               <p>At Complyne think how Iesus was wounded and layed in sepulture, and kept of the Iewes to the end that he should not rise.</p>
               <p>Clarkes and lay people ought to think on these, or they go to Matins.</p>

               <p>TO know under what planet a man or a woman is born, it is needfull to wit that there is seven planets on the sky, that is to say, Sol Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Mars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mercurius, Iupiter, Luna, and Saturnus. Of the seven pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, is named the seven days of the week, for every day hath his name of
<pb facs="tcp:57505:95"/>
the planet reigning in the beginning of it. The ancient Philosophers saith that Sol domineth the Sunday, the cause is (they say for the Sun among other planets is most worthy, wherefore it taketh the worthyest day, that is Sunday. Luna domineth the first hour of Munday. Mars the first hour of Tuesday. Mercurius of Wensday. Iupiter for Thursday. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus for Friday, and Saturnus for Saturday. The day naturall hath xxiv. hours, and every hour reigneth a planet.</p>
               <p>It is to be noted, that when a man will begin to reckon at Sunday, he must reckon thus, Sol, Venus, Mercurius, Luna, Saturnus, Iupiter, Mars.</p>
               <p>And when the number is failed, he must begin at the hour that he would know what planet reigneth. The Munday he ought to begin at Luna, the Tuesday at Mars, the Wensday at Mercury, the Thursday at Iupiter, the Fryday at Venus, the Saturday at Saturnus. And ever when the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the planets is failed, he must begin by order as it is afore-said.</p>
               <p>Also it is to be noted, that the Greeks beginneth their day in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The Iewes at noon. And the Christian-men at mid-night, and there we ought to begin to reckon. For at one of the clock on Sunday in the morning reigneth Sol, at two reigneth Venus, at three reigneth Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, at four reigneth Luna, at five Saturnus, at six Iupiter, at seven Mars, at eight begin againe at Sol, at nine, at Venus, at ten Mercury, and consequently of the other by order in order in every hour.</p>
               <p>When a child is born, it is to be known at what hour, and if it be in the begining of the hour, in the middest, at the end. If it be in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he shall hold of the same planet and of the other before. If it be in the middest, it shall hold of that only. If it be born in the end, it shall hold of the same, and of that that commeth next after, but neverthelesse the planet that it is born under, ne shall not domineth other, and that of the day shal be above it, which is the cause that a child holdeth of divers planets, and hath divers conditions. He that is born under Sol shalbe prudent and wise, a great speaker, and that which he praiseth hee holdeth vertuous in himself. Who that is born under Venus is loved of every man, good to God-ward and regular. Who that is born under Mercurie is well bearded, subtile, milde, veritable, and is not most prudent. Who that is born under Luna, hath an high forehead, ruddy, merry visage, shamefast, and religious. Who that is born under Saturn is hardy, curteous of living, &amp; is not avaricious. Who that is born under Iupiter is hardy, fair visage and ruddy, chast and vagabond.</p>
               <p>Who that is born under Mars is a great speaker, a lyer, a theef, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, big, and ofred colour.</p>
               <p>They that will know of this more evidently, let them turn to the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the seven Planets afore rehearsed.</p>
