            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TO HIS

               <abbr>Esq</abbr>
            </byline>
            <l>COME hither Son, and learn thy Fathers Lore,</l>
            <l>It is not now as hath been heretofore:</l>
            <l>For in my Youth no Man would read to me,</l>
            <l>That now in Age I can deliver thee.</l>
            <l>If thou wouldst be a Man of much esteem,</l>
            <l>Be not the same whatever so thou seem;</l>
            <l>Speak fair to all, be Courteous, Gentle, Kind,</l>
            <l>But let the World know nothing of thy mind.</l>
            <l>Let slip no time may be for thy avail,</l>
            <l>But trust no Friend, for faith begins to fail.</l>
            <l>Refuse no gift to fill thy Coffers full,</l>
            <l>The wisest Poor-man passes for a Gull.</l>
            <l>Be temperate in Effect, sober in talk,</l>
            <l>And often make a Solitary walk.</l>
            <l>Fickle conceits commit to memory,</l>
            <l>For written lines may lye in jeopardy.</l>
            <l>Affect no follies, do no quarrels move;</l>
            <l>And if thou love, thy self fail not to love.</l>
            <l>Have Ears for all Men, but confer with few,</l>
            <l>And count fair words to be but as a shew.</l>
            <l>Follow the Time, find Humours, flatter pride,</l>
            <l>And praise the Groom, but only please the Bride.</l>
            <l>Promise enough but not perform too much,</l>
            <l>But with thy Betters evermore keep touch.</l>
            <l>Strive not with great ones, meddle not with small,</l>
            <l>For trifles trouble not thy self withall.</l>
            <l>Frequent the Church, make show of great Devotion;</l>
            <l>And be not bashful to receive Promotion.</l>
            <l>Look big at Beggars; wear thine own Cloaths neat,</l>
            <l>And spend not too much Money on thy Meat.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49970:2"/>
Break Jests on Cowards, but take heed of Knaves,</l>
            <l>And love no Bawds, for they are beastly Slaves.</l>
            <l>Be perfect in Arithmetick's close Art,</l>
            <l>In all accounts to make a saving part.</l>
            <l>Stand not to stare upon a Peacocks Tail,</l>
            <l>Who if he see his Legs will stoop his Sail.</l>
            <l>When <hi>Iack daws</hi> chatter, let their Language go,</l>
            <l>Better be silent than to prattle so.</l>
            <l>Observe the Lyon, do not stir the Bear,</l>
            <l>And love the VVolf, but only for his Hair.</l>
            <l>Learn of the Ass to bear, the Dog to wait,</l>
            <l>And of the Ape to counterfeit conceit.</l>
            <l>Catch not at Flyes, they are but Swallows Food,</l>
            <l>But love the Meat that nourishes the Blood.</l>
            <l>Feed like the Wolf on blood whilst it is warm,</l>
            <l>He is a Fool that feels anothers harm.</l>
            <l>Yet seem as kind as she that seems to cry,</l>
            <l>To see him sick that she could wish to dye.</l>
            <l>Take heed of Interest, hell, mortgage no Land:</l>
            <l>And from Assurance ever keep thy hand.</l>
            <l>Take no Mans word, for Coin is hard to get,</l>
            <l>It is a Custom now to pay no debt.</l>
            <l>Learn to get Riches by the Beggars Purse,</l>
            <l>The Fox fares best, when Geese begin to curse.</l>
            <l>Work all the week for profit every way,</l>
            <l>But keep thy Conscience for the Holy-day.</l>
            <l>Pry into Trades, to Traffick, Train, and Trick,</l>
            <l>And live not by the Dead, but by the quick.</l>
            <l>And if thou be a Courtier, know thy Place;</l>
            <l>But do not starve for only show of Grace:</l>
            <l>But let thy Profit answer thy Expence,</l>
            <l>Lest VVant do prove a woful Patience:</l>
            <l>And thou do prove the Proverb often told,</l>
            <l>A careless Courtier young, a Beggar old.</l>
            <l>If that thou be a Scholar, and canst Preach,</l>
            <l>And knowest how the Vulgar sort to Teach;</l>
            <l>Let never Conscience at thy Profit knock,</l>
            <l>But sheer thy Sheep, and Fleece anothers Flock,</l>
            <l>For be thou poor, what e're thy Preaching be,</l>
            <l>Thy Parish will not care a Pin for thee.</l>
            <l>If that thou be a Souldier, serve for Fame;</l>
            <l>But let thy Golden Pay maintain the same:</l>
            <l>For he that spends more than he gets by Fight,</l>
            <l>Shall be a Beggar, though he be a Knight:</l>
            <l>If thou a Lawyer be, then know the right:</l>
            <l>But keep thy Client in a coming plight.</l>
            <l>For how canst thou a hearty pleading hold,</l>
            <l>If that thy Tongue be not well tip'd with Gold?</l>
            <l>And rich attir'd thou shalt have room to stand,</l>
            <l>And plead the Cause, what e're thou hast in hand.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49970:2"/>
But barely clad, and come in poor array,</l>
            <l>Thou maist perhaps have hearing at Dooms-day.</l>
            <l>For though the Law be right, and Judge be just<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>Yet with the Rich the Beggar may not thrust.</l>
            <l>If thou a Merchant be, then know thy Trade,</l>
            <l>And of thy Wars what reckoning will be made.</l>
            <l>And be not Lavish in a lewd expence:</l>
            <l>Lest Bankrupt prove a bad experience.</l>
            <l>If that thou be a Crafts-man, know thy pains,</l>
            <l>And let no Ale-house eat out all thy gains.</l>
            <l>For if expence above thy getting go,</l>
            <l>Thou wilt be quickly in the Beggars row.</l>
            <l>What says the crafty Clown in clouted Shoes.</l>
            <l>Time was ordain'd to get and not to lose.</l>
            <l>What though the Poor lye starving in the Ditch,</l>
            <l>It is the Dearth of Corn makes Farmers rich.</l>
            <l>Wear not thy Shoes too short, nor Cloak too long;</l>
            <l>Use thy Friends well, but do thy self no wrong.</l>
            <l>Abandon Fools, make much of rising Wits;</l>
            <l>But favour most that most thy profit fits.</l>
            <l>Sit not up late unless it be for gain,</l>
            <l>For want of sleep is hurtful to the Brain.</l>
            <l>Come not at Brawls, no quarrels see thou make,</l>
            <l>In a whole Skin 'tis best thy sleep to take.</l>
            <l>Go not to Sea, whilst thou mayst live at Land,</l>
            <l>Lest scaping Rocks thou fall upon a Sand.</l>
            <l>Be sociable in every Company;</l>
            <l>But have no hand in any Villany.</l>
            <l>Converse with Strangers, and learn Languages,</l>
            <l>Sound their Estates, but not their Carriages.</l>
            <l>Know their Diversities of Wares, their worth and prices,</l>
            <l>But trouble not thy self with vain devises.</l>
            <l>Aim still at profit, how so e're it grow,</l>
            <l>Make the Wind serve thee whereso e're it blow.</l>
            <l>For 'tis this Wealth, this Profit, and this Gain;</l>
            <l>That dies the Colour evermore in Grain.</l>
            <l>Learn the Physitians and the Lawyers Fee,</l>
            <l>And for thy Profit speak as fair as he.</l>
            <l>Promise the one good speed, the other health.</l>
            <l>In any course 'tis good to gather Wealth.</l>
            <l>Learn all Diseases, and their several Cures,</l>
            <l>And care not what the Patients Heart endures.</l>
            <l>But give him one day grief, another ease,</l>
            <l>Not as his Patience but his Purse doth please.</l>
            <l>Learn Cards and Dice and any cheating Play,</l>
            <l>That may bring in thy Profit any way.</l>
            <l>Learn how to stop a Card, or cog a Dye;</l>
            <l>But shift it cleanly from the Gamesters Eye.</l>
            <l>At Ruff and Trump, note how the Dealer rubs,</l>
            <l>There is no Pack without the Knave of Clubs.</l>
            <l>

Dandle the Child, grow inward with the Nurse,</l>
            <l>And think no Slavery base that fills the Purse.</l>
            <l>Laugh with the Leacher at Maidens bashfulness;</l>
            <l>And with the chaste at fleshly filthiness:</l>
            <l>And with the Spend-thrift at the Misers Bags,</l>
            <l>And with the Miser at the Beggars Rags.</l>
            <l>Learn all Religions, be of every Sect;</l>
            <l>But chiefly to thy Profit have respect.</l>
            <l>In sum, of what Estate so e're thou be,</l>
            <l>Learn to be rich, for that will hold with thee.</l>
            <l>Perswade a Slave he is a Gentleman,</l>
            <l>Though he be crept out of the Dripping-pan.</l>
            <l>It is no matter, if his Purse can bear it,</l>
            <l>His Rascal Pride will never blush to hear it.</l>
            <l>Perswade a Clown that he is half a Knight,</l>
            <l>And that his Wealth deserves the Place aright:</l>
            <l>And his Maid <hi>Marrian,</hi> with her VVainscot-Face,</l>
            <l>Might be a Lady, but for want of Grace:</l>
            <l>And make her think that she is half a Queen,</l>
            <l>And scarce on Earth is such another seen;</l>
            <l>For Virtue, Beauty, VVit, Shape and Feature;</l>
