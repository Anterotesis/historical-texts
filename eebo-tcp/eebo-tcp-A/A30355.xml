            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In caſe of a repulſe, (to which all attempters are ſubject) in an enemies dominions, and ſo diſtant from relief, which will daunt many a ſwelling ſpirit, this Common-wealth will be Involv'd out of honour and intereſt to a ſecond engagement, <note rend="inter">Beſide, our Army being ſo diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably repulft<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diſpirited at <hi>Sancto Domingo,</hi> what ſupplies of men and other neceſſaries have, to little purpoſe, been ſince ſent to <hi>Jamaica,</hi> is rather felt then duely conſidered, or rightly known.</note>that muſt be more coſtly, and neceſſarily burthen the ſubject, which will be the more reſented, when ſucceſſe thwarts the great expectations firſt entertained of the deſign, for undoubtedly the enemies ſo long time of adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, will give them time

            <p n="5">5. Let it be granted, that the place intended be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, yet before it can be put in a thriving way, what an endleſſe treaſure muſt be disburſed, beſide the loſſe of men and ſhipping, and 'tis queſtionable whether ever the benefit from thenee will pay it again, theſe deſignes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing great matters, but in effect come to nothing, we have the example in hand of <hi>New-England, Barbadoes, Chriſtophers,</hi> &amp;c. <note rend="inter">The ſucceſſe we had in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia's</hi> fully anſwers this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</note>the firſt Planters whereof were all undone, and yet they were void lands, purchaſt without the price of blood, and little expence of money, and the Proceedings of the <hi>Holland</hi> Weſt-<hi>India</hi> Company in <hi>Brazil,</hi> may be pettinently recited, which have not only been baffled by their enemies, but outed of more wealth then ever they had from thence, the ſea reprizals ſet aſide, but here is hope of ſilver and gold mines; it may ſo fall out, that there are ſuch, which yet is doubtful, give it for granted, and let attention be had to the trouble in bringing them to perfection, and the extraordinary expences upon ſlaves and other people that muſt work in them, with the materials requiſite to ſuch a task, and it will appear that we have <note rend="inter">By our traffick, Manufactories, and employment of our ſhipping, were we furniſh't with the <hi>India</hi>-ſilver.</note>eaſier, and more profitable wayes to draw into <hi>England</hi> that treaſure, and if accounts were deliberately made up, it would be found that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> himſelf is not ſuch a great Gainer by the <hi>India</hi>'s, as many in the world have conceived, though he have all in poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p n="6">6.

            <p n="7">7. And if we muſt have to do at the <hi>India</hi>'s, let a more opportune time be waited for, which may be at any other better then now, for the Spaniard ſeeing that we proceed not, will grow careleſſe, and our ſhips being already ſheathed, and warlike Proviſions <note rend="inter">The Merchants of this Nation loſt in the yeare <hi>1655.</hi> by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <hi>Imbargo:</hi> which was made by reaſon of this Fleets Proceeding to the <hi>India's,</hi> above <hi>500000 li.</hi> ſterling, to the ruining of many able men and their families.</note>fitted, may inſenſibly be put forth to fall upon them, when not ſo warned, and conſequently armed, as at preſent they are, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, though not made fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the intentions of States, may moderate and draw home their adventures in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim,</hi> and a yeares poſſeſſion more or leſſe of the places intended, cannot import by too great a quantity what may be loſt, in that the Merchants of this Common-wealth have trade in all the dominions of <hi>Spain,</hi> and great eſtates there depending, that cannot be ſo ſuddenly withdrawn, the entercourſe having been of long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, that hath contracted many debts, and occaſioned the tranſmiſſion of goods for ſales, from one place to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, yea, many to the very <hi>India</hi>'s, though in Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards names, all which will undoubtedly be ſeized on, if this Fleet fall upon any of that Kings territories, and will be of farre more value then is to be feared will be had from the <hi>India</hi>'s in many years: and to him will prove a good Exchange, to have ſo many ready effects for his preſent occaſions, in ſtead of an Iſland that yields him little or nothing of revenue.</p>

            <p>Doubtleſſe his Highneſſe will have deeply weighed what buſineſſe may be undertaken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially of ſuch importance, yet <note rend="inter">Was not the Jeſuites hand in this deſigne, aiming at the ruine of our Fleets and men, with the diſrepute of the Nation, and indeed its to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired that ſuch a Conduct ſhould be committed to a perſon that had never been out of <hi>England,</hi> and ſcarce heard of, much leſſe experimented, what People and Countrey he was to deal with in <hi>America.</hi>
               </note>foraſmuch as this is a matter that falls not into the reach of all men, and that heed muſt be given to ſuch as pretend to know moſt in it, 'tis to be hoped that thoſe private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will not eye more any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar end of intereſt, or revenge of wrongs received, before the good of their Countrey, which his Highneſs is beſeeched to examine, as alſo that their Drifts be not to ſcatter the Nations forces, that are now terrible to its enemies, into many places for their deſtruction, which otherwiſe cannot be ſo eaſily wrought.</p>

               <p>The condition of the Iſland of <hi>Thenerife,</hi> in regard the inhabitants are numerous, is ſcantie in point of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, being in part ordinarily ſupplied from the reſt of the Iſlands of the <hi>Canaries</hi> and other places, with Corn, Fiſh, and other neceſſaries, without which they cannot well live.</p>
               <p>Now the Spaniſh Silver Fleets being there, will have made an addition of near 4000 men, which with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants will in ſhort time very <note rend="inter">They could not have ſubſiſted ſix moneths without ſupplies from abroad.</note>much ſtreighten that Iſland, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if they be interrupted in drawing relief from the other I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands.</p>

               <head>Another Paper was given for the <hi>Protector,</hi> immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on advice that General <hi>Blake</hi> had burnt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet, in the Port of <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> at <hi>Thenerife. viz.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The Iſland of <hi>Thenerife,</hi> in regard of the large trade it hath of late yeares enjoy'd, is numerous in people, and of it ſelf for ſo many is bare of Proviſions, but their lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſupplies have been of Corne and Cattel, from <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carots, Fuerte Ventura,</hi> the grand <hi>Canaries Hiero</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera,</hi> and with Fiſh from the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> by their

own Frigats and Ships from <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The late addition of men in the Weſt-<hi>India</hi> Fleet, will have occaſioned a greater ſcarcity, which will very much diſtract the greater part of the inhabitants that are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring men, eſpecially if the trade of Wine ſhould be ſhortened, or altogether cut off, which is their chief de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance.</p>
               <p>The ſucceſſe which General <hi>Blake</hi> had in <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> contrary to the ignorant expectations of the Iſlanders, who having never ſeen enemy, thought themſelves ſtrong enough to withſtand any power whatſoever, will much diſcompoſe them, and the rather when they ſee their King unable to ſupply them with neceſſaries, it being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable, that in the laſt <note rend="inter">They were poſſest with ſuch fear after the fight in <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Treaſure might have been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized by a ſmall Army of well diſciplin'd Soldiers and Seamen.</note>fight they ſpent the greater part of the ſmall ſtore they had of powder and ammunition, of which at beſt they were never well provided.</p>
               <p>The riches which the Weſt-<hi>India</hi> Fleet brought to the Iſland, and what was there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, will amount unto ſo conſiderable a quantity, that it were worth the employment of a great ſtrength to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour obtaining the ſame, <note rend="inter">The Fleets was worth near foure mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of pounds ſterling, and the Iland for its bigneſſe one of the beſt in the world.</note>but a ſmaller force well order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will reduce the place to ſuch ſtreights, as that in ſhort time it may be taken by force, or neceſſitated to a Compoſition, and the rather when ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities ariſe among the people, as queſtionleſſe there will, when the major part of the ordinary ſort ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in harder meaſure then the reſt, and the truth is, at beſt thoſe Ilanders being a mixt generation, will not be very zealous for their King, which looks upon them to no other purpoſe, then to oppreſſe them by taxes and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies of ſouldiers, and the loſſe of their men by reaſon of the Spaniſh Fleets coming thither, will heighten their diſcontent.</p>
               <p>Now the ready way, as is humbly conceived, to obtain
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45201:8"/>
our ends, if for the preſent a full attempt may not be made upon the Iland, is to keep about fourteen Sail of men of Warre from 40 to 10 guns, reparted in ſeveral ſtations, where they may moſt of the yeare ride at Auchor before the enemies Ports, and deprive them of all kinde of ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from abroad, yea, of their very fiſhing in ſmall boats in their <note rend="inter">Never a ſhip went, nor any other diligence uſed, as to this thing.</note>Creeks, which is a relief unto them.</p>
               <p>And theſe ſhips will not only curb <hi>Thenerife,</hi> but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode the grand <hi>Canaries, Palma</hi> and the other Ilands, which as it depends on them for proviſions, ſo do they upon this, for their trade, and ſupplies of Goods with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for their defence, the General of all the Ilands li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in <hi>Thenerife,</hi> the reduction whereof will prove the ſubjecting of all the reſt of the Ilands affairs, being due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly managed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lancarte</hi> and <hi>Fuerte Ventura,</hi> are Iſlands thinly inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and may with ſmall ſtrength be brought to ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from whence our Fleets may be ſupplied with bread and cattel, and a ſufficient number of good horſes to joyne with our Army to attempt <hi>Thenerife,</hi> in caſe it be reſolved to aſſault the ſame.</p>
               <p>Moreover, our ſhips lying there, will be a meanes to interrupt any veſſels of the Spaniards coming from the Weſt-<hi>Indiaes,</hi> whereof many are expected, and deprive them from carrying Wines thither, of which they ſtand in great want, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially <note rend="inter">Two dayes after General <hi>Blake</hi> burnt the Calions in <hi>Sancta Cruz,</hi> came thither from the <hi>Indies</hi> a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Ship, worth above <hi>300000 li.</hi> which might have bin taken, had any of our Frigats layn thereabout, and ſo might many others that arriv'd.</note>now, that no Galions or <hi>New Spaines</hi> Fleets can go out of <hi>Cales,</hi> as in former years, and the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland will be ſo alarmed, that the people will not be able to hold out in hard duty, which they muſt be put upon, being altogether unaccuſtomed thereunto, beſide, they muſt wholly neglect their labour, and conſequently the Vintage of Wines, which is near at hand, will be much empaired; and ſhips being hindred from fetching away any Wines from <hi>Thenerife,</hi> for <hi>Holland</hi> and

               <p>Severall other Papers have bin given in with pertinent and ſeaſonable hints, as to the ſecuring our Comerce, and offending the <hi>Spaniard:</hi> who every way as is ſhewne hath done us ſo much miſcheif, the contents whereof beeing fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the States conſideration then to bee communicated, I forbare to inſert, but nothing was put in execution how uſefull ſoever.
