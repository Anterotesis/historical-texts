         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
Author's Preface.</head>
            <p>AMONG all the Points in Controverſy betwixt us, and
the Gentlemen of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion, it is plain
there is not any one wherein they think better of their Cauſe
than this, which hath been ſtarted ſince our Reformation,
Concerning the Church; and yet, perhaps there is not
any one wherein they have leſs reaſon to think ſo. Were this
groundleſs confidence obſerved to be predominant among the Vulgar
only, who ſeldom look beyond the prejudices of their Infancy; or among
the buſy men of intrigue in the Age, who are ever raiſing their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Advantages, as a Bulwark againſt the Truth; there would be no great
reaſon to be ſurpriſed at it. But the moſt amazing thing of all is, that
we continually meet with the ſame Opinion in perſons that want neither
Underſtanding, nor ſound Senſe and Judgment; and which otherwiſe ſeem
men of Integrity and Sincerity; ſo that there is ſcarce any queſtion to be
made, but that they are verily perſwaded of the thing, as a certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Truth.</p>
            <p>Now for the undeceiving theſe Perſons, it will, in my opinion, be
convenient, not only to ſet their own Conceptions before them; but alſo
to go back as far as the ground and original of thoſe Conceptions, that
ſo they themſelves may pleſe to make ſuch Reflexions upon them, as
they ſhall judg fit and neceſſary. The ground then of all this miſtake is,
that upon pretence of the Churches being a Society, they immediately
ſuffer themſelves to be poſſeſt at firſt with an Opinion, That we are to
judg of it almoſt in the ſame manner, that we do of a Civil Society; and
ſo never give themſelves the trouble of enquiring into the differences by
which theſe two are diſtinguiſht from one another. Hence they have fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied,
that the Eſſence of the Church conſiſts intirely in ſomething Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
and that as a man need do no more to become a true Member of a
Civil Society, than only live in an outward obſervance of the Laws; ſo
to become a true Member of the Church, no more was required, than
barely an outward Profeſſion of the Faith and Religion; and that there
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:98207:3"/>
was no neceſſity at all of any inward Virtues, ſuch as Faith, Hope, and
Charity. This is the very thing that hath made the Definitions of, moſt
of their modern Divines, who place it in a meer outward Profeſſion, be
entertained with Approbation and Applauſe. And when once theſe Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
are received, they are under a neceſſity of looking upon, not any
one part of theſe Profeſſors, to be the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt; but
in general, the whole Body of Profeſſors, whether they be good or bad men,
juſt or unjuſt, hypocrites or ſincere Believers.</p>
            <p>From hence, by another unavoidable conſequence, they are forced to
conceive of the Church, not only as an exterior and viſible Body, but as
a Body diſtinctly, and certainly viſible, to ſuch a degree I mean, that a
man might point out, without any danger of miſtake, the particular men
of whom it is compoſed; as plainly and diſtinctly, as you can point the
Perſons that make up any other Society; and declare without the leaſt fear
of miſtaking your men, <hi>ſuch and ſuch are members of it.</hi> Such a viſibility of
the Church as this it is, that <hi>Bellarmin</hi> hath explained thus:<note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſia eſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>The Church
is a company of Men as viſible, and as palpable, as the Citizens of</hi> Rome, <hi>the
Kingdom of</hi> France, <hi>or the Republick of</hi> Venice. So that his meaning is,
that as the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Venetians,</hi> may plainly and particularly be
ſingled out; ſo likewiſe may the Perſons that make the Body of the Church
be, as particularly, and with the ſame degree of certainty that they were.
Indeed, if there be nothing beſides a bare outward Profeſſion required,
to make men truly Members of the Church, This Profeſſion is a thing
diſcernable by the eye, in every ſingle perſon; and thus the Church will
be viſible, ſo as that particular men may be plainly diſtinguiſhed to be of it.</p>
            <p>By another neceſſary and unavoidable Conſequence, they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to apply all the Promiſes made by God to his Church, whether in
the Old or New Teſtament, to this viſible and exteriour Body. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe Promiſes include the Churches perpetuity, that they might keep
as cloſe to their firſt Notions as they could, there was a neceſſity of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Churches ſubſiſtence in this ſenſe: That the Church muſt always
ſubſiſt after the manner of a ſenſible and palpable body, ſo as to be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our ſight, and diſcernable by all the World, even to a plain and
poſitive diſtinction of particular perſons. Hence it is, that they have
drawn their ſo much boaſted Succeſſion, and which all their diſputes run
ſo much upon. Whereby they underſtand a continued train of Prieſts,
one after another, in the ſame Epiſcopal Sees, and a continued train of
people, making up the ſame Congregations; ſo as that both People and
Prieſts always make profeſſion of the ſame Religion, without any change
or alteration, except it be perhaps in matters of Diſcipline, which are
things that may very well admit of a change, without making the Church
to differ from what it was before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:98207:3"/>
Then carrying theſe Conceptions of theirs ſtill further, they fancied,
that as in order to the preſervation of the Civil Society, an abſolute Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority, to which all muſt bend, is neceſſary, becauſe without
ſuch a one there would be no poſſible means of compoſing differences, or
preventing Domeſtick quarrels; the ſame was likewiſe neceſſary in the
Church: That in this, one Supreme and Abſolute Tribunal muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
upon Earth; that without this and an intire obedience paid
to it, even in matters of Conſcience, Diſpute would never be ended, nor
Unity preſerved, but at laſt things would come to ſuch a paſs that there
would ſtart up as many Churches, and different Religions, as Families.
And this gave birth to their pretentions to Infallibility, and a blind impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
obedience to the determinations of Councils, without preſuming to
examine them at all.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It is by all theſe prejudicate opinions, that the Gentlemen of
the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion ſuppoſe themſelves able to overthrow the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant-Cauſe,
and make that of their own Church impregnable. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Reformed Church, ſay they, cannot be this exterior body, always
viſible, and palpable, which muſt have continued in this ſtate of viſibility,
and that without any alteration, ever ſince Jeſus Chriſt, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
time, down to ours; becauſe this is not above a hundred or ſixſcore
years old, Therefore it is not the Church of Chriſt. This cannot ſhew a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
ſucceſſion of Prieſts and People, Aſſemblies and Epiſcopal Sees, nor
a profeſſion of one and the ſame Religion without any variation, which is
exactly what Chriſt promiſed. Therefore this is not the Church of Jeſus
Chriſt. This Church hath forſaken the Supreme Authority and Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and refuſed to pay obedience to her deciſions;
on the contrary the hath taken upon her to examine thoſe Deciſions, and
hath done all that in her lay utterly to ſubvert this Tribunal, which is
ſo neceſſary to the ſubſiſtence of the true Church: Therefore ſhe is not
the Church of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Of theſe Objections eſpecially hath <hi>M. de Meaux</hi> made his Book to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt;
and becauſe this of mine is made publick only with a deſign to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
that, it is not fit I ſhould prevent the reading of it in this Preface,
nor foreſtal the judgment men may make of my Anſwers, when they ſee
them at large. I ſhall think it therefore ſufficient to ſay in general, by way
of preparation, That all theſe pretended Principles which the Gentlemen of
the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion take the freedom to ſuppoſe, are every one of them
falſe and ſophiſtical, and capable of being confuted more ways than one,
becauſe all built upon a falſe and vain foundation. For in truth what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vanity can there be, than to go about to form an Idea of the Church,
after the pattern of a Civil Society? The Civil Society is a humane contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:98207:4"/>
that owes its birth to natural inſtinct, under the Government of a
General Providence, and is kept up and preſerved by Rules of Juſtice and
humane Policy. The Church is a Divine and Supernatural work, born
only of the Blood of the Son of God, and animated only by his Spirit. His
hands have made it, and his particular Providence watches over it, and
preſerves it. The Laws of the Civil Society do not properly reſpect any
more than the outward man, they never make it any part of their End or
buſineſs to regulate mens hearts, or alter the inclinations, or inward mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
there; all within, they leave perfectly free, and are ſatisfied with an
outward obſervation, which comes within the reach of man's power. The
Laws of the Church do chiefly regard the inward man, their deſign is to
ſanctifie the heart, and fix themſelves eſpecially in the ſoul, which are
effects above any power of man, and can belong to none but God
only.</p>
            <p>The matters in which the Civil Society is imployed, are meerly tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
ſuch as we call the Goods of Fortune, Honour, Trade, the Exerciſe
of Arts and Sciences, and other things of this kind, which may be cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable
by men, and brought under their Juriſdiction. But the matters
in which the Society of the Church is concerned, conſiſt in Myſteries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
to us by a Supernatural Revelation; in Laws impoſed upon the
Conſcience; in the internal and external practice of Chriſtian Vertues.
Now all theſe things are Heavenly, Spiritual, unchangeable, having no
dependance upon the will, authority, or declaration of men, but ſolely
and immediately upon the will of God, and his declaring them to be ſuch.
To make a man a true member of the Civil Society, there is no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
than to ſeem ſo in the eyes of the world, who can paſs a judgment
only on the outward appearance, without being able to dive into the
heart. To be a member of the Church, it is required that a man be ſo,
not in the eyes of men only, but of God too, who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
it, <hi>trieth the very hearts and reins,</hi> and will not be ſatisfied with a
pare outſide. The deſign of Civil Societies, is, that every man may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his quality and ſtation, enjoy the publick Priviledges, that his
Perſonal Rights and Properties may be preſerved intire, that each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
perſon may live quietly and peaceably under the protection of the
whole Body; and theſe are Advantages not out of the power of men to
give. The end for which the Church is deſigned, is everlaſting Salvation,
a Heavenly Paradiſe, the happineſs of a life to come, which are all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
not within the power of men to confer. In the Civil Society,
private men ought rather to ſuffer injuries that are put upon them, than
diſturb the peace of the whole Body, becauſe ſuch injuries may be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and yet not approved; and beſides if they do it, the evil is not paſt
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:98207:4"/>
all redreſs; for God who protects the innocent and oppreſſed, is able to
right them, and recompence their loſſes with intereſt: In the Church it is
far otherwiſe, where the Conſcience muſt acquieſce, and a quiet ſubmiſſion
cannot be given to a lye, an error, or an unjuſt thing, without approving
it; and when it is approved, the evil is paſt redreſs, for God will avenge
that fault, and nothing can make us amends for the loſs of our Eternal
Salvation: Beſides, that the peace we hereby allow the whole Body, is ſo
far from a Bleſſing, that it is the worſt of Evils, being, in truth, no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than a War againſt God. I repeat it therefore once again, That there
is not in the World a greater falſity, nor a more ſophiſtical impoſture,
than the framing ſuch a notion of the Church, after the model of Civil
Societies.</p>
            <p>The caſe ſtanding thus, who does not perceive that all the concluſions
from this falſe ſuppoſition fall to the ground, and utterly vaniſh? A man
muſt not after this, fancy the Church to be a Body merely external, nor
that all its eſſence conſiſts in a bare Profeſſion; nor that theſe Definitions
given us of it, which run upon an outward profeſſion of the ſame Faith,
a participation of the ſame Sacraments, a ſubmiſſion to the ſame Pope,
without allowing internal Graces any ſhare, are good and valid definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
nor that wicked men, worldlings and hypocrites, are Members of
Jeſus Chriſt's true Church. All this would do, if the queſtion
were concerning a Body, or contrivance merely humane, as the Civil So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
is. But when we diſcourſe of a thing that is the work and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of God, and muſt bear ſome proportion to the excellency of its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
we muſt affirm that Faith, Hope and Charity, and in one word, all
the parts of true Regeneration are eſſential to it; and that this conſiſts of
the Faithful and Elect only, excluding thence the Hypocrites and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.
We muſt not afterwards fancy the Church ſo be a body or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of men, viſible at the ſame rate that Kingdoms and Commonwealths
are; Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>an, ſo as to diſtinguiſh plainly, and without danger of miſtake,
the very perſons whereof it is compoſed. This were allowable, provided
the Church conſiſted in an outward appearance, and bare profeſſion only.
But we muſt affirm it to be viſible in the midſt of diſſemblers, as honeſt
men are viſible, when mixt with thoſe that act otherwiſe; or to make
uſe of a Scripture inſtance, as the good Corn is viſible, tho mingled in
the ſame field with Tares that look like it. The Promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt
muſt no longer be applied to all the exterior Body made up of a mere
profeſſion, nor muſt the perpetuity of the Church be imagined to mean a
continuance of this exterior Body in the ſame condition, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
any alteration; or a conſtant equal ſucceſſion of Prieſts, People,
Sees and Councils. This might be admitted, if all this exterior body
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:98207:5"/>
were the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt, if that were not mixt with world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
and wicked men, who change the Church as to outward appearances;
or if it's Miniſtry were ſure to be always intruſted in the hands of good
men. But the caſe being otherwiſe, theſe Promiſes muſt be confined to
the true Believers, and the Church conceived to ſubſiſt for ever in this mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of wicked perſons, and conſequently, that it ſhall ſubſiſt ſometimes
among the publick corruptions of the Miniſtry, to which Almighty God
ſets bounds, as his wiſdom ſees fit for the preſervation of his Children.
We muſt not any longer believe a ſupream, viſible, and ſpeaking authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the Church, to be neceſſary for putting an end to differences and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes;
nor upon this pretence allow Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies to be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or forbid the faithful to examine their determinations. This might
paſs, if the Church were I reſerved, as Civil Societies are, by rules of
humane policy; or if ſome temporal advantages were the only thing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
after; or if the matters ſo determined, required only an outward
compliance, as thoſe in Civil Societies do. But now, that the Church is
under a protection infinitely more effectual than all the wiſdom of Man;
now that Salvation is the thing in queſtion, and a ſubmiſſion of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
the thing required, it muſt be confeſt, that ſince Divine Revelation
ceaſed, there is no further need of any other ſupreme infallible: Authority,
beſides that of the Scripture, which is the Churches Law, its Oracle,
and perpetual Rule; a Rule plain and clear in what it expreſſes in all
things neceſſary to be believed; plain and clear in its ſilence with relation
to other things not neceſſary to be believed: It muſt be owned, that ſince
God does not call men to Miniſterial functions immediately, and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
it may happen that theſe Functions may generally be exerciſed by
Reprobates; and to ſuppoſe that ſuch people as theſe, who can challenge
no ſhare in God's Promiſes to his Church, are infallible, would be the
moſt palpable abſurdity in the World. We muſt acknowledg, that ſince
it is ſo uncertain, whether the men that make up theſe Aſſemblies, are
themſelves really of Jeſus Chriſt's Church, it would be not only raſh, but
wicked, to receive their Decrees implicitly, and ſubmit to them without
any Examination at all; becauſe this were really to put our Salvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the venture, which ought to be infinitely dearer to us than any thing
in the World, and which, if once loſt, can never be made amends for
again. Laſtly, we muſt not upon theſe pretended Principles take up Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
againſt the Proteſtant Churches, nor tax them with Novelty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are not united to this viſible, exterior Body, which was before
the Reformation; or becauſe they do not ſhew that uniform ſucceſſion of
Sees, and Councils, and the profeſſion of the ſame Religion, without
any alteration at all, and every thing as was practiſed before; nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:98207:5"/>
they have ſubverted a Tribunal neceſſary for the ſubſiſtence of the
true Church, becauſe they refuſe to acknowledg the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s
Authority, and to comply with her determinations. Theſe ſeveral char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
upon us might be tolerably well laid, if a man could aſſert that the
Church conſiſts of all this exterior body, as it might be aſſerted, if a
Civil Society were the matter in queſtion. But being that body muſt be
diſtinguiſhed into two parts, the one conſiſting of good, the other of ill
men; the one of good Corn, the other of Tares; the Proteſtant Church
cannot be called new, if it only oppoſe this latter part, which had gotten
poſſeſſion of all the outward advantages, to wit, the Miniſtry, the Sees,
the Churches, the Councils, the Schools, and in one word, the Exterior
Profeſſion, and which had changed and corrupted all theſe. For is there
any neceſſity that a Church ſhould groan under the ſame oppreſſion,
in order to being the ſame with a Church that was before? Is there a
neceſſity of lying under the Tares that choak'd and encompaſſed the Corn,
in order to being of the Corn? And are not men the ſame Children of
<hi>Jacob,</hi> without being among the ſame ſtrangers among whom that Family
hath been? The Proteſtants have not one jot the leſs really, and truly,
a ſucceſſion of Sees, of Councils, and the profeſſion of Religion, for not
having that part of them which was earthly and unclean. I acknowledg
they have given quite another aſpect and appearance to the Houſe of God,
by this cleanſing; but ſtill there is the ſame Miniſtry, the ſame Sees, the
ſame Aſſemblies, the ſame Profeſſion, not with reſpect to the corruptions
that appeared in them, but in regard of the Chriſtian Order which ſtill
continued under all this filth and naſtineſs. The veſſels of the Temple
are ſtill the ſame, only they are waſhed, made clean, and reſtored to
their natural uſe. And as for that pretended Tribunal of the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Church, which the Reformation has ſubverted, it never having any more
foundation than what was imaginary, and merely humane, there is no
reaſon to complain of the Proteſtants, for not ſubmitting to it, becauſe
they would thereby have done wrong to that of the Scripture, which is
Jeſus Chriſt's true Tribunal, fixed, and to continue for ever, in the
midſt of his people.</p>
            <p>But this ſhewing the many differences between the Church and Civil
Societies, is not the only method of confuting theſe Gentlemen's Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
Take which way you will, their falſity and weakneſs is eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
and they are likewiſe attended with this inconvenience, that
as ſoon as one of them is overthrown, all the reſt fall with it. Overthrow
for inſtance but that one principle, that the true Church muſt be an exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
viſible Body, even to the pointing out of the particular perſons
whereof it is compoſed, and at the ſame time you overthrow all thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions.
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:98207:6"/>
they give of it, which include bad men as well as good, and
make reprobates to be no leſs members than the Elect; you overthrow
their application of God's Promiſes to this whole Body; you overthrow
its perpetuity in this Condition, by virtue of thoſe Promiſes; you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the neceſſity of this pretended external Succeſſion, upon which
they lay ſuch mighty ſtreſs; you evacuate the ſupreme Authority, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of Church Aſſemblies, and the blind obedience required to
their determinations. The caſe is the ſame with all their other principles
particularly, which muſt of neceſſity, either all ſtand, or all fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>I might truly ſay, that you can no where obſerve a Syſteme more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
deſtroyed in the ſeveral parts of it, than this is in the Book now
publiſhed by me: For there is not any one of the propoſitions that help
to make that Syſteme, but I have confuted it ſubſtantially, by Arguments
that amount even to a Demonſtration. Which way can any one maintain
that Definition of the Church which goes upon a bare outward profeſſion,
and makes it conſiſt of bad as well as good men; and which <hi>Stapleton,
Bellarmin,</hi> Cardinal <hi>du Perron,</hi> and ſome other Controverſial Divines look
upon as a principal point, after having obſerved what I have written on
this ſubject, in the ſecond queſtion of the Letter to my Friend, and the
Examination of <hi>M. de Meaux</hi>'s ninth Reflection? What pretence can men
have for carrying on the Churches viſibility ſo far, as to a plain, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and conſtant deſignation of mens perſons that help to make up that
Body, after having conſidered what is ſaid to this purpoſe in my Third
Queſtion, and in the Examination of <hi>M. de Meaux</hi>'s Eleventh Reflection?
How can men fancy that Jeſus Chriſt's Promiſes belong to this exterior
Body compoſed of good and bad men promiſcuouſly, after what I have
written to this purpoſe upon the fourth Queſtion, and the Examination
of the Twelfth Reflection? Which way can the External Succeſſion be
defended, in the ſenſe theſe Gentlemen underſtand it, after having weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
my <hi>anſwer to the Second Part of</hi> M. de Condom<hi>'s Diſcourſe,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
it with my Examination of the Eighth and Thirteenth Reflection?
What can be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>d in behalf of the Supreme Authority Church Aſſemblies
pretend to, and the ready Obedience to them, without any trying their
deciſions, which theſe Gentlemen would make us believe ought to be
paid them, after having compared the Relation of our Conference, with
what I have written on the Six firſt Reflections? I muſt confeſs the ſtrength
of my Reaſons may poſſibly receive ſome diſadvantage from the manner
of my delivering them; and that it required a more skilful hand than
mine, which might have ſpoke with all the elegance, and addreſs of my
renowned Adverſary. But yet I dare aver, that even in my plain way,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:98207:6"/>
and in the midſt of all my bluntneſs, there will be found enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
and convince my Readers, That the Syſteme treated of is upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
accounts quite deſtroyed, both as to the whole, and as to each of its
parts.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible, this Syſteme is a thing contrived with abundance of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and skill, that it was never the invention of one ſingle Brain; that
they have made it look as ſpecious as the thing could poſſibly bear; But
all the skill and cunning in the World can never give a thing ſo great a
luſtre as Truth; and it is plain, that That Syſteme can never be true,
which is repugnant to the evidence both of Scripture and Reaſon. I may
add too, that notwithſtanding all the pains taken to contrive it as ſtrong
as might be, they are forced to leave it with many weakneſſes, which it
was impoſſible for them to conceal. Nay, ſuch a Syſteme particularly is
This, which contradicts experience, and contradicts it ſo far too, that
were the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, for whoſe advantage it was firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd,
to be tryed by theſe Principles that compoſe it, ſhe could not
make her party good. Let us, if you pleaſe, venture an experiment upon
that principle which aſſerts the perpetuity of the ſame Exterior Body.
Will you take the confidence to call that of the three firſt Ages, the ſame
Body with the modern Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> where there is not the leaſt tittle
to be found of direct Invocation of Saints and Angels in the publick ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Church; where there is not the leaſt addreſſing to Images
and Pictures in their worſhip; where there is no prohibition of the Cup
to the Laity; nor of the uſe of Scripture in the vulgar Tongue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leave granted by the Ordinary; nor of Praying in a Language which
the people do not underſtand; where we find nothing to the contrary,
but that the Scripture is the only, and the ſufficient Rule of Faith, in all
things neceſſary to Salvation; where we meet with no ſuch number of
Sacraments as ſeven, no uſe made of Papal Indulgences, no neceſſity of
Auricular Confeſſion, no Elevation of the Hoſt that the people may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
themſelves in adoration to it; no Tranſubſtantiation, nor Real pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
made Doctrines; no mention of the Church of <hi>Rome's</hi> being the
Mother and Miſtreſs of all other Churches, nor of I know not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things beſides which are of very conſiderable importance? Will you
call the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it ſtands at this day, as it looks upon the
opinion of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llenaries</hi> to be erroneous, as it prohibits giving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lord's Supper to little Children, as it believes the beatifick
viſion of God antecedent to the laſt Judgment, as it forbids the Clergy
to Marry; will you call this, I ſay, the ſame Exterior Body with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church, which believed and practiſed directly the contrary? To
call this the ſame Body, is like <hi>Theſeus</hi> his Ship, which was always
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:98207:7"/>
called the ſame Ship, tho there was ſcarce a Plank in it all, that had not
been changed.</p>
            <p>A Second experiment may be made in that Principle which relates to
the Succeſſion in Epiſcopal Sees, as theſe Gentlemen are pleaſed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
it: For how can they ever maintain this Succeſſion in the See of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which they look upon as the very Original and Centre of Church-Unity,
while they agree, as they do, that many of thoſe Popes were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders

               <hi>Sylverius</hi> his death, he of his own accord reſigned the Popedom uſurped
by him before, and at the ſame time got the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> to chuſe
him into it again. This conjecture he grounds upon four words in <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſius,</hi>
that the See was vacant ſix days. But this is a very idle ſtory:
There is not any Author mentions this voluntary reſignation of <hi>Vigilius,</hi>
nor his being choſen in again by the Clergy of <hi>Rome,</hi> as is pretended; 'tis
all a pure fancy of <hi>Baronius,</hi> without any manner of probability for it;
and the five or ſix days which the See continued vacant, are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
to follow, not <hi>Sylverius</hi> his death, but the time of his being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by <hi>Beliſarius</hi> illegally and by force, who took away his <hi>Pallium,</hi> and
compelled him to reſume a Monks habit. He lived after that a year in
exile in the Iſland of <hi>Palmenia;</hi> there he excommunicated <hi>Vigilius</hi> and
his faction, to wit, the Clergy of <hi>Rome,</hi> that very Clergy which choſe
<hi>Vigilius</hi> to ſucceed him; ſo that the Excommunication being juſt and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
as <hi>Baronius</hi> owns it was, we cannot look upon <hi>Vigilius</hi> and his Clergy,
and all the Biſhops in the World then, any otherwiſe than as men degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and cut off from the Church: And then according to <hi>M. de Meaux</hi>'s
principles, there was no way left, but for Chriſt to come into the World
once more, to re-eſtabliſh the call to the Miniſtry. The truth of what I
aſſert, may be tryed a third way, in that Principle of the ſupreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and Infallibility of Councils, and the blind implicit obedience they
pretend is due to them. For ſuppoſing this Principle to take place, the

and better authorities than the Council, he ought to ſtick to his own judgment.
For the Council may, and ſometimes actually has erred, as particularly in the caſe
of a Raviſhers marrying with the woman on whom the Rape was committed. Saint
<hi>Jerom</hi>'s opinion was preferred before the Decree of a Council, becauſe it was really
better. For in matters of Faith, a ſingle private mans judgment ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before the Pope's, if this private judgment be grounded upon better reaſons,
taken out of the Old and New Teſtament. It ſignifies nothing to alledg the Council
cannot err becauſe Jeſus Chriſt hath prayed for his Church that it fail not. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to this I ſay, that although a General Council do indeed repreſent the Church
univerſally, yet it is plain the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church is not there really, but only by way
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:98207:9"/>
of repreſentation. For the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church is made up of the company of all the
Faithful, ſo that they are the Faithful throughout the whole world, that conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
the Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally, of which Chriſt is the Head, and the Spouſe. The
Pope is Chriſts Vicar, but he is not truly the Head of the Church. And this Church
it is, that cannot err. Thus then it may ſo happen that the true Faith of Chriſt may
continue entire in a ſingle perſon, and then the true Faith would not fail in the
Church, as the right of a Community may be preſerved in a ſingle member of it.</p>
            <p>See now what the force of truth made one of the greateſt Doctors of
his Age ſay: The Catholick Church in his opinion conſiſts only of the
Faithful, it is of them only that Chriſt is the Head and the Spouſe, to
them alone he hath promiſed that they ſhall abide for ever. Councils
may repreſent the Church, but it does not follow from thence that they
are the Church. They may fall into Errors. The true Church which refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to fall with them, may ſubſiſt in a very few, and theſe few by
preſerving the true Faith, will alſo preſerve all the Priviledges of Jeſus
Chriſts Church. All this is exactly what we aſſert in this caſe.</p>
            <p>The Abbot of <hi>Palermo</hi>'s opinion was likewiſe common to many of the
Schools. <hi>Occam</hi> a famous Doctor among the Schoolmen, of the fourteenth

Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles had likewiſe any proper right to the
things they uſed. But this is no argument why ſuch an Authors Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony

               </note> Others there are that oppoſe this opinion, by ſaying that Councils may
err, and actually bave erred, as for inſtance, the Council of <hi>Arimini,</hi> the ſecond
Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> concerning Images, and that of <hi>Aix
la Chapelle,</hi> about the marriage of Virgins that were forced. And if theſe <hi>(ſay
they)</hi> have erred, others may err as well as they; whereupon ſome hold, that ſuch
General Councils as the Pope does not preſide in by his Authority, may err, but
thoſe where he does, cannot. To which others return, that the Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi>
was lawfully convened, that the Pope's Legates preſided in it, and yet the Faith was
ſubverted there, and the regulation of this very matter was it that moved Pope <hi>Leo</hi>
to call the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> They ſay further, that their pretending to find
out remedies for knowing when two Councils claſh, whether of the two a man ought
to hold to, is an evident ſign that General Councils may err.</p>
            <p>It is certain then, that the Doctrine we now aſſert, when we affirm,
that even the moſt numerous Aſſemblies are liable to error, that they may
conſiſt of ſuch men as ſhall not be of the true Church, and conſequently
may fall off from their function, is neither a new Doctrine, nor any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
we are driven to for the juſtfying our Reformation; but an old Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
which the evidence of Truth hath always ſuggeſted to ſincere and
unbiaſſed men. So that if <hi>M. de Meaux</hi> had but pleaſed to reflect a little
upon this, he would not have ſaid, as he did, <hi>That it was a Monſter, the
birth whereof was reſerved for the time of the New Reformation.</hi> It is convenient
ſometimes to be a little more adviſed and ſparing in paſſing ones judgment.
It would queſtionleſs be very foul to conclude form what hath been juſt
now ſaid againſt the abſolute Authority and Infallibility of Eccleſiaſtical
Aſſemblies, that we quite caſt off all theſe humane Orders, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
guidance and government of the Church. To ſix any ſuch opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as this upon us, would be the unjuſteſt thing in the world. Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:98207:10"/>
of Faith; our Diſcipline, and the Writings of our Authors, as well
as our conſtant practice in all places, are a vindication of us in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
beyond all ſcruple or exception. Firſt then, we hold the Miniſtry to
be of Divine Inſtitution, and conſequently become neceſſary by <hi>the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Command;</hi> and that tho the uſe of it is not abſolutely neceſſary <hi>by
the neceſſity of the means,</hi> for the Exiſtence of the Church; it is however
of ſuch excellent uſe and advantage in order to the preſerving and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
of the Church, that to go about to take it away, would be a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
impiety. Secondly, We are of opinion, that in matters of Diſcipline
relating to the publick, ſuch as the manner and form of Religious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
of Adminiſtring the Sacraments, and others of this kind, theſe
ſhould be left to the determination of Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they bring in no Rite offenſive to the Conſcience, or contrary to the
nature of the Evangelical Worſhip, an abſolute obedience is due to them.
Further yet, We allow theſe Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies a power of Cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
private perſons, and proceeding to the laſt and higheſt Cenſure, that
of Excommunication. And although we make no queſtion at all, but this
power may ſometimes be abuſed by them, and unjuſt ſentences pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
yet we think that out of veneration for the Order, a man ought to
ſuffer ſuch to be executed upon him, provided this do not engage us in any
thing that may wound a good conſcience.</p>
            <p>As for matters of Faith, Worſhip, and general Rules for ordering mens
Manners, we are perſwaded that theſe Aſſemblies continuing the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to one another, may not only attain to the knowledg of them, by
the Word of God, but that they muſt and ought to do ſo, for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the encreaſe of error, and the preſerving Gods truth in its genuine
purity. It is part of their office and buſineſs to reſtrain the exorbitances
of mens minds, to help the weak, and to the utmoſt of their power, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
and maintain publick peace in the midſt of this Society. But becauſe
on one hand the perſons making theſe Aſſemblies are neither inſpired, nor
infallible, nor have any power over mens conſciences; and on the other
hand, becauſe no body can be ſure, that they are good men, and will
diſcharge their duty faithfully, there being ſo many ſeveral ſorts of by-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
that influence men, when the Spirit of God does not guide them;
we think it a very faulty indifference, and a manifeſt ſlighting a man's
own ſalvation, to reveive their deciſions blindfold, and upon truſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any trial or examination of them at all. But ſtill, though we think
this examination highly juſt, and indiſpenſably neceſſary, yet we think
withal it is to be uſed with abundance of caution. Beſides, that it muſt
be undertaken in the fear of God, and with a diſpoſition full of modeſty,
and Chriſtian humility; beſides that we muſt beg for grace from above,
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:98207:10"/>
and not preſume upon our own abilities; beſides that, we muſt bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with us, not only charitable, but reverent, and reſpectful thoughts
of ſuch Aſſemblies, and judg favourably of them, till we have manifeſt
conviction of the contrary. Beſides all this, I ſay, the ignorant ſort of
people muſt not be too raſh in offering to interpoſe their judgments about
matters which either are not plainly expreſt in Scripture, or naturally and
neceſſarily deduced from thence. They muſt ſatisfie themſelves with
uſing theſe two ways, The Scriptures being ſilent, And the clear and plain
inſtructions to be met with there. From its being ſilent, they muſt
learn to reject what it does not teach, for ſtrange and novel Doctrines.
For whatever is not in Scripture, is not of Divine Revelation, and nothing
that is not revealed by God, can be the object of Faith. By the clear and
plain Inſtructions to be met with there, they muſt learn to embrace the
Doctrines neceſſary for Salvation, and to reject all things contrary to the
ſame, as dangerous and deſtructive Errors. And this is ſufficient for the
more ignorant ſort of people.</p>
            <p>As for other particulars, for which no certain rule can be given, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from the Scriptures being ſilent, nor from the plain and clear inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
contained in it, nor by natural inferences deduced from thence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they either receive them, or condemn them, they muſt endeavour to
get information by ſuch means as God hath diſcovered, and eſtabliſhed
in his Church; and in the mean time entertain a good opinion of the
Aſſemblies determinations. Thus they will preſerve their Faith incorrupt,
and ſufficient for Salvation; they will pay to Aſſemblies their due reſpects,
and keep themſelves in the peace and unity of the Church.</p>
            <p>If the Gentlemen of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion are not content with this,
but ſtill would have us believe whatever ſuch Aſſemblies may determine
blindfold, we muſt beg of them to conſider, That to exclude thus all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of amendment, is to open a mighty inlet to Error and Superſtition;
'tis an expoſing believers to a manifeſt danger of having their Faith cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
and themſelves damned; in a word, 'tis perfectly to ruine Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
unleſs the goodneſs of God interpoſe with ſome remedy. Will not
theſe Gentlemen, who are ſo ready at exclaiming againſt the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
that may poſſibly proceed from our principle, at laſt open their eyes,
and take a view of what their own hath actually produced already? Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,
Purgatory, Indulgences, Merit of Good-works, worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of Images and Relicks, Service in an unknown Tongue, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
other devotions, which have no great appearance of wiſdom in
them: Theſe are the products of their pretended Infallibility, and all this
they are forced to defend now, becauſe they would not loſe the point of
an implicit obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:98207:11"/>
And now if I were ſpeaking any thing here concerning the occaſion of
this diſpute between the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> and me, or the Circumſtances
that went before, or followed after our Conference, the world will eaſily
perceive I do it, becauſe this Biſhop hath already been at the trouble of
giving the publick a ſufficient account of them. One word only I muſt
ſay, which reſpects one of our Auditors, Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> who no doubt would
have received a better Character from <hi>M. de Meaux,</hi> had he been ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
as to be known to him more particularly. Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> is a Gentleman
of great honour, and wants neither apprehenſion, nor judgment; he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
his Religion; and though diſpute be no part of his buſineſs, is
well verſed in the main Controverſies between us. If his modeſty, or
ſome other conſiderations prevailed upon him to ſay ſomething that lookt
like declining to engage in diſpute with <hi>M. de Meaux,</hi> I do not think he
ought to have taken his words in their ſtrict and literal ſenſe.</p>
            <p>As for the difference between our two Relations, I leave it as <hi>M. de
Meaux</hi> hath done, to the Reader's judgment. He hath obſerved very wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that let him ſay what he would of me, it was in my power to ſay
the ſame of him: That all our Auditors were intereſted on one ſide or
other; and that the world hath nothing at all to do with our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.
To all which let me add, that I will not give any occaſion
for any private quarrel with a perſon I honour to that degree, that I do
<hi>M. de Meaux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only thing I need ſay more, is concerning the method I have
obſerved in this Book. It is divided into Two Parts. The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
an Anſwer to the Inſtruction given <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras,</hi> by this
Biſhop, the day before our Conference; together with an Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Reflexions upon that Anſwer, beginning at the ninth, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on to the thirteenth, incluſively. The ſecond part contains a Relation
of what paſt in our Conference, with an Examination of <hi>M. de Meaux</hi>'s
Reflexions thereupon, which are his eight firſt. This method in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is very natural.</p>
            <p>And now, as I have made it my buſineſs to be very exact, and
paſt nothing in his whole Book over, without giving a direct Anſwer
to it; ſo I hope that when he ſhall think fit to ſet Pen to Paper
againſt me next, he will be as exact, and apply himſelf as cloſe to
the pinch of the Queſtion; and not imagine, as men commonly do,
that provided they can but pick up here and there ſome looſe paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and from thence ſtart a few difficulties and objections, there
need no more be done, and this muſt go for a full Anſwer. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:98207:11"/>
God to ſhed forth his Bleſſing upon an undertaking, wherein
the only Ends I propoſed to my ſelf, were his Glory, and the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration
of the Truth. Thus much I am encouraged to hope from
his mercy; and that as he hath hitherto preſerved his little Ship the
Church, in the midſt of the billows and ſtorms of the world, he will
ſtill continue to preſerve her, as he hath promiſed, even to the end of
the world.</p>

FROM THE

TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>WHEN perſons of <hi>M. de Meaux</hi>'s, and <hi>Mr. Claude</hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
engage, and in a Controverſy ſo important too, as that
between the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe who have ſeparated
from her; Men muſt naturally be deſirous to know the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and iſſue of ſuch a debate. For, beſides what expectations the reputation
of their Learning and Judgment might raiſe, This is a Cauſe, that ſcarce any
body in our part of the World can be ſuppoſed perfectly indifferent in. Every Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
muſt look on Theſe, not only as Diſputants, but Advocates; and even they,
who deſign no more than the gratifying their curioſity by peruſing ſuch Conferences,
do yet inſenſibly find themſelves affected with ſome degree of Concern.</p>
            <p>The particular Argument inſiſted upon here, is likewiſe of the higheſt conſequence;
for it cannot but be a mighty help and direction, to know exactly how far we are
obliged to comply with the Churches Deciſions in matters of Faith; In what Caſes
we may venture to depend upon our own Collections from Reaſon and Scripture; and
in what we muſt renounce theſe in deference to a higher Authority; Whether Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
and their pretended Infallibility ought to ſilence all, even the moſt juſt ſcruples,
againſt whatever they ſhall pleaſe to determine; or whether Almighty God have not
ordered the matter ſo, that without ſome recourſe had to our private Judgments,
<pb n="xxii" facs="tcp:98207:13"/>
even Theſe cannot be received as a Rule of Faith to us; but, all imaginable care,
and an impartial examination of the thing always preſuppoſed, the deciſive voice
does of neceſſity belong at laſt to a mans own ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. de Meaux,</hi> we ſee, took a great deal of pains by a previous diſcourſe upon
this Topick, to prepare his Proſelyte for the enſuing Conference; and he was, no
doubt, in the right, to pitch upon this as the main Argument for her Converſion: It
being indeed the very foundation and ſupport of all the points in diſpute between
us; the beſt and moſt cunningly contrived expedient, to make men firſt embrace,
and then perſevere in Error and Superſtition. For <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are uſually apt to be
ſqueamiſh, and cannot digeſt Opinions contrary to Senſe and Reaſon; they ſometimes
grow ſo bold too, as to queſtion their Adverſaries integrity: Now what can be more
ſatisfactory in ſuch Circumſtances, than to be invited into the Communion of a
Church, which you are told, in all, even her moſt abſurd Decrees, is continually
aſſiſted with the unerring guidance of the Holy Ghoſt; and put under a happy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility
of deceiving her Members, tho illnatured people ſhould imagine her ſo
wicked to deſire and endeavour it. This then being fixed as a firſt principle, the
underſtanding is ſufficiently ſubdued; for humane reaſonings to interpoſe afterwards,
would be impertinent and ſawcy; and ſo the harſheſt and moſt unpalatable Doctrines
go glibly down, by the help of this excellent Vehicle, the Churches Authority and
Infallibility.</p>
            <p>The ſame method is obſervable among the Miſſionaries here in <hi>England,</hi> who
after having tried us firſt with general ſchemes of the diſputable points, and then
endeavoured to eſtabliſh ſome of them particularly, to little or no purpoſe; do now
at laſt take ſanctuary in the Churches Deſpotick power, and begin to ſeem ſenſible,
that either this or nothing muſt ſtand them in any ſtead. The debate upon this
Head firſt began to grow warm upon occaſion of the Royal Papers, which (becauſe
bad money is not priviledged to paſs unqueſtioned, tho it have the King's ſtamp upon
it) were conſidered with a Judgment and Modeſty becoming both a ſincere zeal for
Truth, and a dutiful honour for the Perſon whoſe Royal Name they bore. The
ſeveral Anſwers, Vindications, and Replies upon this Subject, have ſince been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s account of his Conference, as ſuiting very well the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
then in hand: And when once the World had ſeen That, it was ſo reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſhould be heard what he could ſay for himſelf, that I ſhould not
think this Tranſlation needed any Apology, or Introduction, were it not for ſome
Objections which I foreſee it may be liable to. Theſe therefore I am concerned to
remove, that ſo the Book may be read without prejudice, and not expoſe men to
miſtaken notions of things, for want of a ſhort, but neceſſary Advertiſement.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I deſire the Reader to take notice, that it is not to be expected
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſhould in every circumſtance expreſs himſelf, as the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
would do at this day. The neceſſity of reforming from the Corruptions of
<hi>Rome,</hi> was eaſily diſcerned in ſeveral Countries, and each National Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="xxiii" facs="tcp:98207:13"/>
ſufficient power to reform it ſelf, was juſt and wiſe in aſſerting that rightful
Authority upon ſo emergent an occaſion. But tho all did the thing, yet, all not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
together, they did it not by the ſame methods, nor with like moderation and
prudence. It was enough that they all agreed in the main points, and for the leſs
material ones, that they maintained ſuch a Charity, as not magiſterially to cenſure
or exclude one another for theſe little differences. This was the very way, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Communion is ſtill preſerved inviolable among the Proteſtant Churches in all
Nations, and is a mighty argument, that they retain the true ſpirit of Meekneſs
and Chriſtian Candor. Therefore in the writings of Forreigners, we muſt always
make allowances for the Genius of that particular Church, whereof they are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and not be extremely nice and critical, except where we find a diſagreement
in ſome very ſubſtantial point. The Reformed <hi>Gallican</hi> Church and we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
of one Judgment in all the moſt conſiderable parts of this diſpute, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Authority of the Church. As, That ſhe hath no right at all to require an
abſolute and implicit obedience to her determinations; That the Scriptures are the
only aud perfect Rule of Faith; That every Man is concerned and obliged to
examine by this Rule whatever is impoſed upon him as an Article of Faith; and
if he finds the Doctrine conformable thereto, readily and heartily to embrace, and
adhere to it; but if evidently repugnant, by all means to reject it: That no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
even the moſt General, are to be received any further than they proceed in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
with this Diving Word; That they may, and actually have erred in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating
from it, and conſequently their Decrees ought to undergo ſome Examination
before a Man complies with them; But that, notwithſtanding this poſſibility of
failing, we ought to entertain very reverend and charitable preſumptions in favour
of ſuch Aſſemblies; and, as not to caſt them off without the cleareſt evidence of
their having perverted the Truth; ſo, where no ſuch evidence appears, to ſubmit
with the moſt reſpectful humility imaginable; looking upon them as excellent
means for the preſervation of the Chriſtain Faith in its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and genuine Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>After ſo punctual an agreement in matters of the greateſt conſequence, what can
it ſignify, if in ſome few others of leſs conſideration, and more remote from the
main buſineſs, there ſeem a ſmall diſparity? Mens Judgments muſt have ſome
room left to exerciſe freely in, and diverſity of Opinions in Circumſtantials, like
Diviſions in Muſick, may very well be admitted, without breaking the main Cords,
or doing the harmony any prejudice at all. 'Tis confeſt, the Divines abroad have
taken up ſome notions diſtinct from ours, and particularly concerning the Church,
its Viſibility, Miniſtry, Conſtitution and Diſcipline; and it might well ſeene
ſtrange, if Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſhould ſo far forget his Education and Country, as not
to ſcatter ſome of theſe in his Writings. But I hope Engliſhmen may enjoy the
benefit of his Diſcourſes, without being obliged to ſubſcribe every ſentence, or
eſpouſe every punctilio contained in them. Whether the Gentlemen of the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
               <pb n="xxiv" facs="tcp:98207:14"/>
perſwaſion relying upon the Authority of <hi>M. de Meaux</hi> his name, called in ſo
potent an Auxiliary from beyond the Seas, out of a juſt diffidence of their own
ſtrength here, They beſt can tell: This I am ſure of, that it was but Juſtice to
Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> and the Cauſe he aſſerts, that he ſhould be turned into the field too:
And to let the World ſee, that after all <hi>M. de Meaux</hi>'s vain-glorious boaſts of
a victory, and bold defiance of all the Doctors in Chriſtendom, neither the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
nor the Cauſe, however vilified by him, are yet ſo feeble, that they need
fear to encounter this Goliah. As many as underſtand the difference between us
and the Reformed Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> are ſenſible, that we ſtand upon the
fairer ground by much for an engagement againſt the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> But I
was willing cur Country-men ſhould have the ſatisfaction of ſeeing, that it is
<hi>M. de Meaux</hi>'s misfortune to be reduced to ſtreights, not only by a Church of
<hi>England</hi> Pen, but by a Miniſter of his own Nation, who lay under ſome diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
which we do not; and that for all his Triumphant Preface before the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi>
That could no more eſcape a reply at home, than his Expoſition has
done abroad.</p>
            <p>Another Objection againſt this Tranſlation may be, That the Conference hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in our Language already. I will not ſay it was in ſuch a dreſs, as was by
no means after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mode, and unworthy of ſo good an Original, for fear
of provoking a ſeverer cenſure upon the habit I have now clothed it in, to which I
I have reaſon to fear it is but too obnoxious. But ſetting aſide all Reflections upon
the defects of thoſe who have gone before me, this ſingle conſideration is enough to
juſtifie and recommend the preſent attempt, that the Relation which was then Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
alone, is a very ſmall part of the work. And when <hi>M. de Meaux</hi>'s Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
had appeared in ſuch pomp, introduced by a long diſcourſe upon the Church,
and backt with ſo many ſmart Reflexions, <hi>M. Claude</hi>'s memory might have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
extreamly, by concealing his abilities. And particularly, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the ſtrain of confidence viſible through all the Diſputant's Writings of the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion, he could and did retort to as good purpoſe, and with as much
advantage as Modeſty and Reaſon uſually have over Vanity. This may amuſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking
people, who are apt to meaſure the weight of an Argument by the bigneſs
of the words, and aſſurance of the Arguer; but the other only can prevail upon
the Judicious and unprejudiced, and will force a conqueſt by its own ſtrength.</p>
            <p>One thing I have augmented this Edition with, which neither the former, nor
indeed <hi>Monſieur Claude</hi>'s own Original have taken care of, but 'tis what I
though highly neceſſary at this particular juncture. The unſincerity we have ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
diſcovered in the late Advocates for Popery, makes us wiſh to take as little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
truſt as may be. And therefore ſince our repeated complaints have been ſo inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
I reſolved to try if example would perſwade them to any thing like Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
For this reaſon all the Quotations from Authors have been carefully conſulted,
and at large tranſcribed by me in the Margent; where you will alſo find, if the
<pb n="xxv" facs="tcp:98207:14"/>
Preſs do me right, the Edition of each Book, and if two have been conſulted, the
difference of Chapters in each, as particularly in St. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> ſo that any man
may now ſee at the expence of a very little trouble, whether he be impoſed upon or no.
The ſame exactneſs may be taken notice of in many of our late Learned Writers;
but ſtill there are a ſort of men that will never ſuffer themſelves to be run down for
want of Recrimination, and therefore tax us with negligence in this particular
alſo. Whether party better deſerve this accuſation, the Author of <hi>Pax Vobis,</hi>
if they pleaſe, ſhall be the Teſt, who hath the impudence to repeat over and over ſo

            <p>I muſt own I have been a little bold in making this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book to differ from
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s <hi>French</hi> one in the method: For he, after his Introductory Diſcourſe
upon the Church, hath ſubjoyned an Anſwer to <hi>M. de Meaux</hi>'s five laſt Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
ſo diſpatching that Subject entirely, and at once: And likewiſe to the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Conference, annexed a Reply to the other eight, which concern That:
But I deſigning chiefly the benefit of thoſe, who either did not underſtand, or could
not procure the <hi>French,</hi> and intending it for a direct anſwer to <hi>M. de Meaux</hi> in
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> did rather incline to follow the method of that Tranſlation; conſulting
herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Readers eaſe, when he ſhall think fit to compare them both together.
And becauſe ſome time hath paſt ſince <hi>M. de Meaux</hi> appeared here, I choſe rather
to divide This, than ſuffer ſo long a delay as the finiſhing of the whole muſt needs

            <p>I Have a long time deſired a ſight of what you have now ſent me.
It was told me on all hands, That there was a Writing of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Condom</hi>'s abroad, containing a relation of what paſt, in
the Conference I had the honour to have with him at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs
of <hi>Roye's;</hi> and ſome perſons did even aſſure me, they had
heard it read: But ſtill I could meet with no body, capable of
giving me the ſatisfaction I lately received by your means. This lays
upon me a double engagement, both to return you my thanks for it, and
at the ſame time, to gratify the curioſity you have to ſee what I wrote
upon the ſame ſubject, the next day after our Interview. M. <hi>de Condom</hi>
having profeſt it was not his deſire, that what paſt between him and me
ſhould be publickly talked of, I thought my ſelf under an obligation to
confine what I had written, to my own Study; And this hath been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
very punctually obſerved by me. But now, ſince he hath thought
fit to give out Copies of his, I have reaſon to believe, that in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
he leaves me perfectly to my liberty, and is well ſatisfied I ſhould
do the ſame thing with mine. I have too great an opinion of M. <hi>de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>'s
Wiſdom, not to follow his Example in this particular, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
my ſelf from his Equity, that he will not find fault with me, for
treading in his ſteps.</p>
            <p>But becauſe he hath been pleaſed to impart to us that Diſcourſe alſo,
which he had with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>as</hi> in private, the day before our
Conference, you will think it convenient, that before I tranſcribe my
Relation, I ſhould firſt make ſome reflections upon That. Were this a
diſcourſe of ſuch a nature, as common occaſions or accidents are uſed
to produce, where a man ſpeaks without preparation or deſign, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
himſelf with all the freedom imaginable, I confeſs it were unjuſt to
examine it ſtrictly, and by rule. But ſeeing this was compoſed by M. <hi>de
Condom,</hi> with a proſpect of obliging <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> to change her
Religion, and which ſeems a ſtudied piece; a Diſcourſe, which he hath
joyned to the account of our Conference, as a conſiderable part of what
paſt in this matter: Laſtly, a Diſcourſe, committed to Writing, upon
ſuppoſal that it may be uſeful to others, and, for that purpoſe made in
ſome meaſure publick; I cannot forbear looking upon it as a work of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98207:16"/>
premeditation, and returning ſome anſwer to it accordingly. Beſides,
that you and I are concerned, as to what <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> hath done,
to deſire to know whether ſhe had ſufficient reaſons to forſake your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and embrace the <hi>Romiſh;</hi> and the examination of this Diſcourſe
will be a very proper means of clearing that point to us.</p>
            <p>Now it may be reduced to two principal Parts: In the firſt, <hi>M. de
Condom</hi> makes it his buſineſs to ſhew, that the Catholick or Univerſal
Church, which we profeſs to believe in the Creed, is a Church thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined:<note place="margin">Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> Page 2, 3.</note>
               <hi>A Society making profeſſion to believe the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and
govern it ſelf by his word:</hi> Whence he infers, That it is a viſible Society.
He pretends alſo to make it appear, that to this Church, thus defin'd,
belong all the promiſes found in Scripture. In the Second, He labours to
anſwer an Objection, drawn from what happened to the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
heretofore, in which we often ſee the true Worſhip of God to have been
changed and corrupted, and both the People and their Guides to have
fallen into Idolatry.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Parts, <hi>Sir,</hi> we will proſecute in order, and by applying our
ſelves to what is moſt material in them, will endeavour, by the aſſiſtance
of God's Grace, to make the Truth ſo evident, as ſhall remove all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The firſt Part of M. de Condom's diſcourſe examin'd.</head>
               <q>
                  <p>Inſtead of granting the Miniſters (ſays <hi>M. de Condom)</hi> to believe all
the Fundamentals of the Faith,<note place="margin">Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, p. 2.</note> we ſhew that there is one Article of the
Creed they believe not, which is that of the Univerſal Church. 'Tis
true, they ſay with the mouth, <hi>I believe the Catholick</hi> or Univerſal
<hi>Church,</hi> as the <hi>Arrians, Macedonians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> ſay with the mouth,
<hi>I believe, in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> But as there is reaſon
to accuſe them of not believing theſe Articles, becauſe they believe
them not as they ought, nor according to their true ſenſe; ſo if we
ſhew the Pretended Reformed, that they believe not as they ought, the
Article of the Catholick Church; we may truly ſay, that in effect they
reject ſo important an Article of the Creed.</p>
                  <p>You muſt know then, what is meant by this expreſſion, The Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
or Univerſal Church; and upon this I lay for my ground, That
in the Creed, which was only a bare declaration of Faith, this Term
muſt be taken in its moſt proper and moſt natural ſignification, and ſuch
as is moſt uſed among Chriſtians.<note place="margin">Conf. p. 3.</note> Now all Chriſtians by the name of
the Church, underſtand a Society, making profeſſion to believe the
Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and govern it ſelf by his Word. If this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98207:16"/>
makes this Profeſſion, 'tis conſequently viſible, That this is the
proper and genuine ſignification of the word <hi>Church,</hi> ſuch as is known
by every one, and uſed in common diſcourſe; I deſire no other witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
than the Pretended Reformed themſelves.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The ſequel will declare, whether the ſcandal of dealing with that Article
of the Univerſal Church, as the <hi>Arrians, Macedonians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> do,
would not better agree with the Character of ſuch as follow <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s
Opinion, than the Reformed Miniſters. This we ſhall preſently be able
to judge of; and to that purpoſe four Queſtions muſt be examined.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is, Whether the ſenſe of that Article in our Creed ought to
be reſtrained (according to M. <hi>de Condom)</hi> to the Church here on Earth,
or extended farther?</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Whether this be a good and ſufficient definition of the Church
upon Earth;</hi> A Society making profeſſion to believe the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt,
and govern it ſelf by his word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether this Church upon Earth be viſible, or inviſible? or
whether it be both, conſidered in a different ſenſe, and different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To what Church the Promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt do belong;
whether to that defined by <hi>M. de Condom,</hi> or to that which we are about
to define? Theſe four Queſtions will include, not only all the plauſible
things <hi>M. de Condom</hi> hath ſaid in this firſt part of his Diſcourſe; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
all the other ſophiſtical Objections that are uſually put to us upon
this ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Whether the ſenſe of that Article in our Creed ought to be reſtrained,
(according to <hi>M. de Condom)</hi> to the Church here on Earth, or extended far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               <p>In order to reſolving the firſt Queſtion, you will pleaſe, <hi>Sir,</hi> to give me
leave, to explain briefly that Article of our Creed, concerning the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
or Univerſal Church, and how we underſtand it, that ſo you may be
able to judge, whether <hi>M. de Condom</hi> had reaſon to accuſe us of not taking
it in its true ſenſe: And this I ſhall immediately enter upon.</p>
               <p>We think then (this being ſuch a profeſſion of Faith, as ought to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
its object entire, and in the utmoſt extent, and not in any one part
only) that by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church</hi> muſt be underſtood, not barely the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
body, or company of the Faithful at preſent upon Earth, but that
body or company of all the Faithful, which have been, are, or at any
time ſhall be, from the beginning to the end of the World. Thus the
Univerſal Church is, That which is already triumphant in Heaven, that
which is now militant on Earth, and that which is not yet in the world,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98207:17"/>
but ſhall be in ſucceeding Ages. All theſe three Churches do really make
but one, becauſe united together in the eternal purpoſe of God, appointed
to know one and the ſame Word, to partake of one and the ſame Spirit, and
to inherit one and the ſame Glory. They are but one Family, for they have
the ſame Father, the ſame Rights and Priviledges, the ſame Hopes, and
are called to the ſame Duties. They are but one body, under the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Guidance of Jeſus Chriſt, their only Head, who is, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
ſays,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever.</hi> And this is our ſenſe of
the Church, called in the Creed, Catholick, or Univerſal.</p>
               <p>The Latitude we here take the Church in, hath diſpleaſed <hi>M. de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi>
he ſays we put a wrong ſenſe upon the Article; and to underſtand
it thus, is in effect to reject it. He is of opinion it ſhould be confined to this
part upon Earth, which he defines, <hi>A Society making profeſſion to believe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But in the firſt place</hi> M. de Condom <hi>muſt allow us to tell him, that Saint</hi>
Auguſtine <hi>however hath taught us to explain the Church in our Creed after
this manner. That Father indeed went farther than we do, for he hath
not ſcrupled to include in this notion, the Angels confirmed in Grace.</hi>

               <p>M. de Condom <hi>muſt likewiſe allow us to tell him, that the Catechiſm of
the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>hath given this ſenſe of the Church in our Creed.</hi>

two parts, one of which is called Triumphant, the other Militant. The Triumphant
is that illuſtrious aſſembly of the Bleſſed, and all thoſe who have vanquiſhed and
triumph'd over the World, the Fleſh and the Devil, and who being now delivered
from the miſeries of this life, enjoy everlaſting reſt and felicity. The Church Militant
is the company of all the Faithful yet alive upon earth, which is therefore called Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant,
becauſe they are engaged in a perpetual war with theſe moſt deadly enemies,
Satan, the World, and the Fleſh. Yet muſt we not from hence imagine that they are
two diſtinct Churches, but as was ſaid, two parts of one and the ſame Church, one
of which is gone before, and already poſſeſt of its Heavenly Country. The other daily
following after, till at length, being united with our Saviour, it ſhall reſt above in
Eternal happineſs.</p>
               <p>Again, We muſt deſire <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s leave to ſay, that the very Title of
<hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> uſed in the Creed, does lead us to this extended no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Church. This to me ſeems evident for two reaſons. Firſt, that
this Title is given the Church to diſtinguiſh it from all falſe Churches,
which do neither exiſt always, nor every where, but ſpring up and die
away in ſome particular places, and at ſome certain times, as having no
ſound nor laſting principle. Secondly, that this Title was to diſtinguiſh it
from particular Churches, which are but members of this great Body
collected by Chriſt, and ſeparated from the world, that he might ſanctifie
it to himſelf. Whence it follows, that when we ſay the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> or <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
Church, by this is plainly meant the Church intire, and at large, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception, or limitation, either as to time or place.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>M. de Condom</hi> muſt allow us to tell him, that we are brought to
this notion by what follows in the Creed, <hi>The Communion of Saints,</hi> which
terms explain this of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> For the Saints are not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
now living upon Earth; but thoſe alſo that reign in Heaven, and thoſe
which ſhall be to the worlds end; and 'tis with all theſe that we are in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
If the Communion of Saints were to be underſtood of ſuch only,
as <hi>make profeſſion to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and govern themſelves by his word;</hi> This
could be no other than an external Communion by living under the ſame
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98207:18"/>
Miniſtry, and partaking of the ſame Sacraments, which good and bad men
enjoy equally. And certainly this would fall far ſhort of ſo great, ſo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick
an expreſſion, and conſequently could not deſerve a room in our
Creed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſays <hi>M. de Condom) in the Creed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>Pag.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>which was only a bare declaration of
faith, this term muſt be taken in its moſt proper and moſt natural ſignification, and
ſuch as is moſt uſed among Chriſtians.</hi> I own it muſt be taken in its moſt proper
and moſt natural ſenſe, but even this ſupplies us with a freſh argument
againſt him; it being certain, that the moſt proper and moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſenſe is to take the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church</hi> for the company of all thoſe that
are truly the faithful, ſeparated from the world by the Word and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, according to the purpoſe of his Election from the beginning
to the end of all things. I acknowledg the word <hi>Church</hi> when uſed in a
Civil ſenſe, as for inſtance when ſpoken of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> does moſt
properly ſignifie an external and viſible company, and ſo far I am of <hi>M. de
Condom</hi>'s mind, both as to what he urges out of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and from the
<hi>Septuagint</hi> Tranſlation. But ſtill I aſſert, that this word when applied to a
Chriſtian Society, does not properly denote a viſible Congregation, or an
outward profeſſion of the Faith, and no more; but chiefly an inward
calling, a ſpiritual communion, and ſuch as that outward is only a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of, and does depend upon. A man muſt be utterly ignorant of
Chriſtianity to deny this truth. The <hi>Church</hi> then is a name for ſomething
within, and not barely to ſignifie what paſſes without; ſo that implying
an inward communion, when the Title of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal</hi> is put to it, it muſt needs
mean the whole body of true and faithful Chriſtians. By the ſame reaſon
I affirm this to be its moſt natural ſignification. When we ſay in plain
terms <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,</hi> nothing can be more natural than to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the whole company of Gods children, as oppoſed to the men of the
world, and <hi>children of this generation.</hi> Nothing more natural to Faith, and
eſpecially a Confeſſion of Faith, than to interpret a term expreſſing the
object of Faith, not in a reſtrained ſenſe, which gives only a partial Idea
of the thing; nor in an ambiguous ſenſe, which gives a confuſed and
doubtful one; but in a ſenſe that ſhall be perſpicuous and full.</p>
               <p>As to the common uſe of the word, <hi>M. de Condom</hi> muſt pardon me, if I
ſay there is a fallacy in his argument. For ſuppoſing it true (which really
it is not) that all Chriſtians of this and ſome ages laſt paſt had confined the
term <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,</hi> to the Church at preſent upon Earth; ſuppoſe the
pretended Reformed (to uſe <hi>M. de Condom's</hi> own expreſſion) did commonly
underſtand this term ſo, yet ſtill 'tis a trick to attempt to adjuſt the ſenſe
of the Creed, by that which ſome latter ages have fixt upon it. 'Tis juſt
as if I ſhould go about to explain the terms of our language by what will
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98207:18"/>
be in vogue two or three hundred years hence. For who does not ſee that
the acceptation alters, and words are mightily removed from their firſt
and genuine ſignification?</p>
               <p>What I have alledged from St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and the <hi>Trent</hi>-Catechiſm, plainly
convict <hi>M. de Condom</hi> of a miſtake either in matter of fact, or point of
right. If the matter of fact depoſited before be true, <hi>That all Chriſtians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
by the Church, a Society making profeſſion,</hi> &amp;c. He is out in point of
right, for St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and the <hi>Trent-Catechiſm</hi> ſhew, that <hi>the Church</hi> in our
Creed is to be otherwiſe underſtood. But if this Rule hold, that the word
in the Creed muſt be taken in ſuch a ſence, as is moſt in uſe among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
he errs in matter of fact, for St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and the Catechiſm, taking it
as we ſee, 'tis manifeſt the Chriſtians of their times did not underſtand it
as <hi>M. de Condom</hi> does, of a <hi>Society making profeſſion to believe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>It is queſtionleſs more reaſonable to ſay, that the term <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church</hi>
in our Creed, ſhould be interpreted in a way moſt agreeable to Scripture
ſtile, but this very thing quite overthrows <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s pretenſions. For
the Scripture when ſpeaking of the Church, as the Creed does, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
to its Univerſality, does always mean the whole body of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and not one part only. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taken it in that excellent
paſſage,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 22. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>God hath given Jeſus Chriſt to be the Head of the Church, which is his
body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all.</hi> In the fifth Chapter of that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,<note place="margin">Chap. 5.</note>
he repeats it no leſs than ſix times in the ſame ſenſe:<note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>The husband is
the head of the wife,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>even as Chriſt is the head of the Church: The Church is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to Chriſt as the wife is to her husband.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt loved the Church, and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or

                  <note place="margin">Ver. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt nouriſheth and cheriſheth the Church. This is a great myſtery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Chriſt and the Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 32.</note> Thus again <hi>Col.</hi> 1. <hi>Chriſt is the head of the body
the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>who is the beginning, the firſt-born from the dead.</hi> So laſtly <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.

to an innumerable company of Angels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>to the general aſſembly and Church of the firſt-born,
which are written in Heaven.</hi> For the Apoſtle does not mean the Church
Triumphant only, as <hi>M. de Condom</hi> would perſwade us, but the whole body
of thoſe whom God hath enrolled in the Book of his Predeſtination, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
already taken up to Glory, or ſuch as are already juſtify'd and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
upon Earth, but not yet glorify'd, or thoſe whom he will call effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
hereafter, and juſtifie, in order to their Glorification.</p>
               <p>I conclude this Queſtion with one obſervation, which ought not to give
<hi>M. de Condom</hi> any offence, becauſe the greateſt demonſtration of reſpect to
an adverſary, is the removing every little objection made by him. I obſerve
then that his Argument (which contains all this part of his Diſcourſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

regularly. All this while <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s proof all through the ſequel of
his diſcourſe runs not upon the term in his Propoſition, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal
Church;</hi> but on that ſingle term <hi>the Church,</hi> between which there is a wide
difference; for <hi>the Church</hi> may well be taken in a ſenſe, that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal

<hi>and of this I deſire no other witneſſes than the Pretended Reformed themſelves,</hi> we

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Whether <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s be a good and ſufficient definition of the
Church upon Earth, A Society making profeſſion to believe the Doctrine of Jeſus
Chriſt, and govern it ſelf by his Word.</p>
               <p>By this deciſion of our firſt queſtion, I think, Sir, it appears that <hi>M. de
Condom</hi> had no ground for accuſing us of taking that Article of our Creed
concerning <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,</hi> in a wrong ſenſe. Let us now proceed to
the ſecond Enquiry, whether <hi>M. de Condom</hi> have given a good and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98207:19"/>
Grounds of them examined, but ſuppoſe they will be found ſtrong and
impregnable. How comes it to paſs then that <hi>M. de Condom</hi> was pleaſed
to paſs by ſo fundamental a Queſtion? And how could be ſatisfy himſelf
with barely propounding his definition, and ſaying only, that This was
what all Chriſtians underſtand by the name of a Church.</p>
               <p>However I ſhall be bold to ſay, that this is neither all, nor indeed the
main part of what Chriſtians do, or ought to underſtand by it; and that
his definition is defective by at leaſt one half; to which therefore I ſhall
oppoſe another, which I aſſert to be what all Chriſtians ought to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
by the name of Church, <hi>viz. A Society of ſuch perſons, as making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
to believe the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, do truly and effectually believe it;
and making profeſſion to govern themſelves by his word, do really and effectually
govern themſelves by it.</hi> Our buſineſs now is to know which of theſe two
is a good and lawful definition; whether that given us by <hi>M. de Condom</hi>
in agreement with the Doctors of his Communion, or this of mine, in
agreement with all Proteſtants? That is to ſay, we are concerned to
know, whether the nature and eſſence of the Church conſiſt barely in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals
and appearances; or whether ſomething of reality be not required?
whether Hypocriſy, and ſuperficial Cheats can make men true members
of the Church? or whether ſomething of truth be not neceſſary alſo, to
know whether wicked men, worldlings, and reprobates, provided they
make an outward profeſſion, and can but diſſemble handſomely, are real
members of Chriſt's myſtical body, or whether this priviledge do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to thoſe that are truly the Faithful? Here lies the pinch of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
which in my opinion would have reſolved it ſelf, had but <hi>M. de
Condom</hi> propounded it fairly: For methinks 'tis very hard to acquieſce ſo
far in his definition. But not to inſiſt on this firſt prejudice, let us exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the matter throughly.</p>
               <p>I. The Scripture repreſents the Church to us, as the product and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution
of God's eternal decree of Predeſtination, or Election; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
it teaches us, that God in electing and predeſtinating men, does it
not to a mere outward profeſſion of Faith and Holineſs, but to an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
Faith, and true Holineſs: And conſequently, effectual Faith and
Holineſs are of the nature and eſſence of the Church, and not an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
profeſſion only. The conſequence is manifeſt; For the beſt way to
diſcover the nature and eſſence of any thing, is to take it according to its
own Author's firſt Idea and deſign; ſuppoſing that he does not (as we
are all agreed God does not) ſwerve at all from his deſign in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it. The Church then being God's own work, the ſureſt means
to diſcern what that is, will be to inform our ſelves of God's deſign, if
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98207:20"/>
we can but find out that.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 3, 4.</note> Now this we find in the Election, <hi>Bleſſed be
the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the name of the
whole Church) <hi>who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings, in heavenly
places in Chriſt; According as he hath choſen us in Him, before the foundation of
the world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Verſ. 10, 11.</note> And a little after, <hi>He gathers together in one all things in Chriſt,
both which are in heaven, and which are in earth, even in him; In whom we have
obtain'd an inheritance, being predeſtinated according to the purpoſe of him,</hi> &amp;c.
To this relates that ſaying of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>I pray not for the world, but for them
which thou haſt given me, for they are thine.</hi> Where by oppoſing <hi>the world,</hi>
for which he does not pray, <hi>to thoſe whom his father had given him,</hi> 'tis plain
he underſtands the Church; and his meaning is, that the Father hath
given them to Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe it was his by his purpoſe of Election.
This appears further,<note place="margin">Ver. 10.</note> from the words that immediately follow, <hi>And all mine
are thine, and thine are mine;</hi> for this mutual reciprocation of Good between
his Father and Him (if I may ſo term it) is capable of no other ſenſe
but this, in the ſequel of his diſcourſe. My Church are thine Elect, and
thy Elect are my Church; they who are mine, as my people, are thine,
as thy Elect; my Communion, and thy Election, have the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
the ſame extent, and do both comprehend the ſame perſons: So
that the Election is nothing elſe but God's deſign and project of the
Church; and the <hi>conſtituting of a Church,</hi> is the putting that deſign of
Election in Execution.<note place="margin">Pſal. 65. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed</hi> (ſays <hi>David) is the man whom thou chuſeſt,
and cauſeſt to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts.</hi> Theſe Courts
are the Church of God, and men enter into them only by vertue of God's
Election.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>God hath ſaved us</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>and called us with an
holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and
grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began.</hi> We muſt
therefore come to the knowledg of the Church by his Eternal purpoſe,
and to know that,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 4, 5, 6.</note> we muſt conſult his Holy Word. <hi>He hath choſen us</hi>
(ſays St. <hi>Paul) that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love.
Having predeſtinated us to the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf;</hi>
and, that we ſhould be <hi>to the praiſe of the glory of his grace.</hi> He does not
ſay a bare profeſſion of Holineſs, but a real Holineſs; he does not ſay an
appearance of adoption, but a true adoption; he does not ſay an external
converſion, but an internal; That is, ſuch as may illuſtrate the glory of
God. God hath predeſtinated us to a true Faith, and not an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Faith; to a ſincere and ſubſtantial Regeneration, not to a ſhadow
or colour of it. 'Tis paſt a doubt then, that a mere outward profeſſion
cannot give us a full definition of the Church; but true Faith and
Regeneration are neceſſary parts of the Idea we have of it.</p>

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98207:20"/>
II. The Scripture, when ſpeaking of the Church with reference to
God, gives it ſuch appellations as can by no means be reſtrain'd to a
more profeſſion, or allow us to think it can be compoſed of wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.

anſwered, by being reduced to a bare external profeſſion?
Would God have ſent us a new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a new <hi>Sion,</hi> a new City from
above, and make this up of Righteous and Wicked, Hypocrites and true
Believers indifferently? Does not the Apoſtle underſtand it ſo, when he
ſays, that<note n="o" place="margin">Gal. 4. 26, 31. 30. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>Jeruſalem is free, that her children are not in bondage; i. e.</hi> thoſe
who are the <hi>Children by promiſe,</hi> that they ſhall not be caſt out like <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

between this and the other <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that was between the two
Wives of <hi>Abraham, Sarah</hi> and <hi>Agar?</hi> Would God make him a new Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
a new Houſe, a new Temple, and build it of holy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
materials indifferently? St. <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> did not intend it ſo, <hi>You</hi> (ſays he)
<hi>as lively ſtones are built up a ſpiritual houſe.</hi> Would God ſeparate to himſelf
a new people, a new <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a new Nation, from all other Nations, and
require from it no more than an outward profeſſion, which alone works
no regeneration at all? To ſhew that God himſelf never intended this,
obſerve how himſelf ſpeaks,<note n="q" place="margin">Jer. 31. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>This ſhall be the covenant that I will make with
the houſe of Iſrael, After thoſe days (ſaith the Lord) I will put my law in
their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they
ſhall be my people.</hi> We muſt take notice, that all theſe names above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
are derived from the old figures of the Moſaical diſpenſation;
this the very reading of them plainly teſtifies. Now this very thing makes
directly againſt <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s definition: For as it is eſſential to a figure,
to conſiſt of ſomething External and Corporeal, ſo is it equally eſſential
to the thing figured, to conſiſt of ſomething Internal and Spiritual. The
Church therefore is no longer a <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> an <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a people linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by outward bands only; this would correſpond well enough with
the figures of the old Law; but it is a people, an <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
united and compacted by the inward hands of the ſame Faith, and the
ſame Sanctification. This very term <hi>[the Church]</hi> is of it ſelf ſufficient to
confirm this truth; <hi>M. de Condom</hi> acknowledges the Chriſtians had it from
the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Conf. p. 5.</note> which is true. He ſays the <hi>Jews made uſe of it to ſignify the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98207:21"/>
viſible Society of God's people, the Aſſembly which makes profeſſion to ſerve him.</hi>
I agree with him in that too. He adds, <hi>That the Chriſtians have kept it in
the ſame ſenſe.</hi> I am not of that opinion. This word, when applied to
the figure, can ſignify no more than a viſible outward Aſſembly; but
when to the thing figured, it muſt of neceſſity imply ſomething more,
it muſt denote an inward community, a company, not of Bodies only,
but Souls too;<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 10.</note> for it is not enough <hi>that a confeſſion be made with the mouth,
men muſt alſo believe with the heart unto Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. <hi>This will be yet more evident, if you reflect on ſome other apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
given to the Church, with relation to Jeſus Chriſt. For it is
called,</hi> His flock, his ſheep, his ſpouſe, his ſiſter, his dove, his well-beloved,
his body, a Body whereof He is the head, a Body that is his fleſh and his bones,
a houſe built upon him, as upon a Corner-ſtone, the ſanctified in Jeſus Chriſt, the
Children which God hath given him, <hi>and other expreſſions like theſe. Now
who can ever imagine theſe glorious Titles ſhould import no more than
an outward profeſſion? or that profane perſons and reprobates can have
any ſhare in them?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 12. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>It is</hi> his flock, <hi>but what flock?</hi> Fear not little flock,
for it is your Father's good pleaſure to give you the kingdom. <hi>They are</hi> his
ſheep,<note place="margin">Joh. 10. 27, 28.</note> 
                  <hi>but how,</hi> My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
And I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any
man pluck them out of my hand. <hi>It is his</hi> Spouſe, and his Siſter, <hi>but in what
reſpect?</hi>

                  <hi>It is</hi> his Dove, <hi>but why his Dove?</hi> My dove, my undefiled is but
one, the daughters, ſaw her, and bleſſed her. <hi>She is</hi> his well-beloved, <hi>but
Wherefore his Well-beloved?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 2. 2.</note> As the lilly among therns, ſo is my beloved
among the daughters.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 12, 13.</note> It is his Body, <hi>but how his body?</hi> The edifying of the
body of Chriſt; till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of
the ſon of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs
of Chriſt.<note place="margin">Ibid. v. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>He is</hi> its Head, <hi>but what ſort of Head?</hi> From him the whole
body fitly joyned together, and compacted by that which every joint ſupplieth, maketh
increaſe of the body, to the edifying of it ſelf in love. <hi>It is</hi> his fleſh and his bones,
<hi>but how theſe?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 29.</note> No man ever hateth his own fleſh, but nouriſheth, and cheriſheth
it, even as the Lord the Church. <hi>It is</hi> a ſtructure <hi>built upon him, but how?</hi>
In him all the building fitly framed together,<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 21.</note> groweth into an holy temple in the
Lord. <hi>They are the</hi> ſanctified in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>but how ſanctſied? They are
<hi>ſuch</hi> as in every place call upon the name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 2.</note> They are the</hi>
Epiſtle of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>but in what regard the Epiſtle?</hi> Written not with Ink,
but with the ſpirit of the living God; not in tables of ſtone, but in fleſhy tables
of the heart. <hi>It is</hi> his People, <hi>but what kind of people?</hi> Thy people ſhall be
willing in the day of thy power,<note place="margin">Pſ. 110. 3.</note> in the beauties of holineſs. <hi>They are</hi> the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98207:21"/>
which God hath given him; <hi>But wherefore were they given him? To

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>ſaying,</hi> Behold I, and the children which thou haſt
given me.<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 2.</note> Thou haſt given me power over all fleſh, that I ſhould give eternal life
to as many as thou haſt given me. <hi>Can any man after all this grant, that the
Church ſhould be defined,</hi> A Society making profeſſion to believe, <hi>&amp;c. or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that Hypocrites belong to this myſtical Divine Body?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>IV. If we ſearch the Scripture yet further, we ſhall find other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in confirmation of this Truth. Among theſe I reckon the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning the Church of Chriſt, to be met with in the Prophets.
Thus it is deſcribed by Moſes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 30. 6.</note> The Lord thy God will circumciſe thy heart, and

V. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> endeavours to make us
apprehend the Church aright,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 12, 13:</note> by reſembling it to a man's body. <hi>As the
body</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that
one body, being many are one body, ſo alſo is Chriſt. For by one ſpirit are we all
haptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
free, and have all been made to drink into one ſpirit.</hi> I need not here obſerve,
that by <hi>Chriſt</hi> he means the Myſtical body of Chriſt, That is, his Church;
this is manifeſt of it ſelf,<note place="margin">Verſe 27.</note> and he explains himſelf ſo afterwards: <hi>You</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular.</hi> All we have
to do, is to enquire, what he makes to be the principle and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and of this
unity here attributed to the Church, and with reſpect to which he likens
it to the body of a Man. And this is eaſily underſtood; for in his opinion
it is the ſpirit, and conſequently not a bare profeſſion. But ſtill it may be
doubtful what Spirit this is: Is it a ſpirit of direction only, that attends
upon the Clergy, and prevents their giving erroneous determinations, and
publickly profeſſing any ſuch, how wicked ſover the perſons exerciſing
this Authority be? By no means. It is the ſpirit which the faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and whereof Baptiſm is a ſign: <hi>For</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>we are all
haptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or
free, and have all been made to drink into one ſpirit.</hi> Thus you ſee the band
and principle of the Churches Unity. The evident conſequence whereof
is, that inward regeneration is eſſential to it, and that as many as <hi>have
not been waſhed by, nor made to drink into</hi> this heavenly ſpirit, cannot be parts
of this body.</p>
               <p>VI. But the Apoſtle carries on his Argument yet further; for he takes
notice, that although God had put a difference between the members, as
there is likewiſe in thoſe of the Church; yet he had ſo qualified this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<hi>That there ſhould be</hi> (ſays he) <hi>no ſchiſm,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>or diviſion in the body, but
that the members ſhould have the ſame care one of another; ſo that whether one
member ſuffers, all the members ſuffer with it; or one member be honoured, all
the members rejoyce with it.</hi> From hence it is plain, that according to St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> there is as real an agreement between the members of the body of
the Church, as there is between thoſe of a humane body, without any
contrariety or diſcord, and that this good correſpondence is founded on that
Unity which makes each part to have one and the ſame common inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.
Now what true agreement, or common concern can there ever be,
between the members of Chriſt, and members of the Devil? Or in St.
<hi>Paul's</hi> own phraſe, <hi>What fellowſhip between light and darkneſs?</hi> What conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
enmity on the contrary muſt there needs lurk under the Covert of
ſuch an untoward ſeeming Peace, as a bare outward profeſſion may make?
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98207:22"/>
Every one aims at advancing his own Maſter's honour, ſo that the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
deſigns, and methods of the Servants muſt of neceſſity carry as
great oppoſition as there is between the Maſters they ſerve.</p>
               <p>VII. In his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> he gives us another deſcription of the
Church very like this:<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 27, 28,</note> 
                  <hi>As many</hi> (ſays he) <hi>as have been baptizeed into Chriſt,
have put on Chriſt. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free,
there is neither male nor female, for ye are all one in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Thus far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
Communion with the ſame Chriſt, which is the very thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes
the Unity of the Church, and is the eſſential form of it; ſo that
perſons out of this Communion are not of the Church, becauſe they have
no part in the Churches Unity. If you would now Know what kind of
Communion this is,<note place="margin">V. 29.</note> attend to what follows. <hi>If ye be Chriſt's, Ye are Abraham's
ſeed, and heirs according to promiſe.</hi> So that St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not treat of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munnion
conſiſting in a bare outward profeſſion, but ſuch a one as makes
men Myſtical Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heirs of God.</p>
               <p>VIII. In his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 1.</note> he thought it not enough to ſay,
<hi>They that are in Chriſt Jeſus, walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit,</hi> which
yet is intimation ſufficient,<note place="margin">V. 9.</note> what nature that Communion is of, that makes
this Myſtical Body of Chriſt the Church; but he goes further, and is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
afterwards, <hi>If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi> Words
of ſuch ſtrength as will not allow us to acknowledg wicked men belong
to the Church unleſs we ſhould make a Church that is not Chriſt's. If the
Church formally, and as ſuch, be Chriſt's, this muſt be true of all that are
of the Church, and participate of that which conſtitutes it ſuch. Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>M. de Condom's</hi> definition, wicked men and reprobates may be
of the Church; therefore in his opinion they may be Chriſt's. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
St. <hi>Paul</hi> avers, that <hi>they that are Chriſt's, live not according to the fleſh;
and that as many as have not Chriſt's ſpirit, are none of his;</hi> ſo that he is of a
judgement different from <hi>M. de Condom's.</hi> If an outward profeſſion alone be
the common band, and that which conſtitutes the Church, we are driven
to maintain one of theſe three things: Either that ſuch a profeſſion does
confer the ſpirit of Chriſt; Or, without Chriſt's ſpirit one may ſtill be his;
Or, that the things which make it to be a Church, do not yet make it to be
Chriſt's. The firſt of theſe would be abſurd. For what more ſo, than to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,' That a bare profeſſion of Chriſtianity confers the Spirit of Chriſt? At
this rate every Hypocrite is a partaker of that Holy Spirit. The ſecond,
That one without Chriſt's Spirit may ſtill be his, directly contradicts Saint
<hi>Paul's</hi> aſſertion, which poſitively declares, That he who hath not Chriſt's
Spirit, is not his. And for the third, That the things which make it to be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98207:23"/>
a Church, do not yet make it to be Chriſt's; it may be <hi>M. de Condom</hi> may
not like this himſelf. I for my part look upon it as a very ſtrange poſition.
For can one ſay, that what preciſely conſtitutes the Church, does not make
it Chriſt's? This is as much as to ſay, that the Church is not his Body, nor
his Spouſe, nor his well-beloved, nor any of all thoſe things the Scripture
calls it. In a word, 'tis to ſay, that it is not conſidered in this quality any
part of his concern. If <hi>M. de Condom</hi> frame to himſelf ſuch a Church as this,
let him at leaſt give us leave to enquire why he does afterwards appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the promiſes to it. For what right can the Church have to theſe, if, as
ſuch, it be not Chriſt's, nor hath Communion with him? Theſe two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
are evidently deſtructive of one another. If the Church as ſuch be
not Chriſt's, it has no ſhare in his promiſes; if it hath, then it is his, as a
Church. Let him chuſe which he pleaſe; if the firſt, our Controverſie is
at an end, for to what purpoſe ſhould we diſſpute of a Church, which he
ſays, is Jeſus Chriſt's; and yet is not his, nor hath any title to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes?
If the ſecond, let him not talk any more of a Church conſidered
as ſuch, being conſtituted by a bare outward profeſſion: For this not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
Chriſt's Spirit, cannot make the Church his; or if it can, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
does not ſay true, when he tells us expreſly, <hi>That if any man have not the
Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. The ſundry paſſages of Scripture concerning Hypocrites, who cloak
themſelves with ſuch an outward profeſſion, abundantly prove them not
to be of Chriſt's Church.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>He that ſaith, he is in the light, and hateth his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 10.</note> And a little after, <hi>In this the children of God are manifeſt,
and the children of the Devil, whoſover doth not righteouſneſs is not God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he that loveth not his brother.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 8.</note> Again afterwards, <hi>He that loveth not, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jud. v. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>for God is love.</hi> St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaking of theſe Hypocrites, calls
them, <hi>Spots in our feaſts of charity, clouds without water, trees without fruit,
twice dead,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>plucked up by the Roots.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſays, <hi>In the laſt day
he will profeſs unto them, he never knew them.</hi> What colour then have we for
making ſuch members of the Church, which is Chriſt's Body? But that
place of St. <hi>John</hi> removes all the difficulty,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>They went out from us, but they
were of us: for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued
with us, but that they might be made manifeſt, that they were not all of us.</hi> What
a plain difference is here made between <hi>being among us,</hi> and <hi>being of us;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
among us, is proper for Hypocrites, that are mixed with the Faithful,
and joyn in the ſame profeſſion: Being with us, is ſincerely and truly to be
of the Church; for which ſomething more than an outward profeſſion is
requiſite.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:98207:23"/>
X. We read in Scripture of a twofold Call, one by the meer Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word, commonly termed an outward Call; the other by the
Preaching of the Word, and the Holy Spirit both, ſtiled an inward Call.
Of the firſt our Saviour ſpeaks,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 14.</note> when he ſays, <hi>Many are called, but few cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.</hi>
Of the ſecond St. <hi>Paul, Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo caſed, and
whom he called,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>them he alſo juſtified.</hi> Now the Church, whoſe very name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
a Call, muſt needs have been the effect of one of theſe two juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.
But if defined by <hi>a bare profeſſion,</hi> it cannot refer to one or other of
theſe, nor can it anſwer the deſign of either. It does not fulfil the end of
the firſt, for the Preaching of the Goſpel does not call men to a meer Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of believing Jeſus Chriſt's Doctrine. A Hypocrite is ſo far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
with this Call, that he rejects and mocks at it. It does not refer to
the ſecond Call, becauſe the Spirit which calls with the Word, is a Spirit
of Regeneration, and not bare profeſſion. What Call ſhall we refer it to
then? I know not any third, the Scripture mentions not any, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the thing will not admit of any. We can conſider God in ſuch a
caſe but according to two different capacities, either as a Law-giver, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding,
exhorting, promiſing and threating, or as an abſolute diſpoſer
of Events, and ſo bringing to paſs in us the thing he commands us.</p>
               <p>But whether commanding us, or whether working in to, he never ſtops
at a bare profeſſion; he goes on to the truth of Holineſs and Faith, his
Word enjoyns it, his Spirit produces it. So that whether ſoever of theſe
two Calls you ſuppoſe the Church to obey, it muſt either proceed to a true
Converſion, or be no Church, for the proper and natural ſignification of
the word is a <hi>Called Society,</hi> but no one ever called it to an outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
and no more.</p>
               <p>XI. I ſuppoſe it is a maxim among all Chriſtians, That Jeſus Chriſt hath
no more Churches than one, and that this on Earth, together with that in
Heaven, make but that one; thus much we learn from the <hi>Trent</hi>-Catcchiſin
it ſelf. A ſure method then of diſcovering the true nature and eſſence of
the Church upon Earth, would be to ſearch into that in Heaven; for it is
plain, were theſe of different natures, they would be no longer one, but
two Churches of a ſeveral <hi>ſpecies.</hi> Thus much, I think, muſt be granted,
and ſo likewiſe muſt the Concluſion I deduce from it, <hi>viz.</hi> That either the
nature of the Church Triumphant, muſt exiſt in a bare profeſſion, or that
of the Church Militant cannot. If the Churches Unity here below, be a
Unity of Profeſſion, an external Unity only, and the internal one be but
accidental, then the Unity of the Church above muſt be External too, and
no more, and that Internal one reſulting from the agreement of hearts and
wills, no more eſſential to it, than to this below. Otherwiſe (as was ſaid
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98207:24"/>
before) they muſt be two different Churches. Let them be ſo kind then to
clear this Point, Whether we muſt believe that a true Piety, true Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and true Holineſs, are not really eſſeential parts of the Church in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
for to this hour I never heard any ſuch thing maintained.</p>
               <p>XII. Thoſe who deſire to be informed what the Church, and its Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is,<note place="margin">Joh. 17. 20, 21, 22.</note> need only conſider what Jeſus Chriſt ſays in that admirable Prayer
related by St. <hi>John, Neither pray I for theſe alone</hi> (his Apoſtles) <hi>but for them
alſo which ſhall believe on me through their word. That they may be one, as thou
Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us. The Glory which
thou gaveſt me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one.</hi> The
Churches Unity is formed after the pattern of that between the Father
and the Son. This is a kind of reſemblance, a draught of that which hath
ſome of the ſtrokes, though not all the livelineſs and perfection. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Real Internal Unity, a Unity not of outward Profeſſion only, but
in ſome ſort of nature and eſſence,
a Unity of Regeneration, a Unity of the ſame Faith, and the ſame Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;
and to reſtrain this to a meer External Union, ſuch as is common
to both good and bad men, would not only weaken, but utterly eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate
the force of Jeſus Chriſt's expreſſion.</p>
               <p>

does never depart from him; and ſuch as continue in the Houſe of God are
his Church. Such as want the ſubſtance and ſolidity of good corn, and are ſcattered

planting. With relation to whom it is, that St. <hi>John</hi> in his Epiſtle ſays, They

were not of us. All Hereticks and Schiſmaticks go out from us; That is, depart from the
Church; but were they truly any of outs, they would not have departed. They were not
therefore out members even before they went out, and if ſo, then there are many
within, who, tho they have not yet gone out, are Antichriſts. May we dare to
eſſert this? Yes, why not? Let every man conſult his own Conſcience, to know if he
be not Anticriſt. The meaning of Anticriſt is, contrary to Chriſt. Whence it is clear,
that none but Antichriſts can go out; for ſuch as are not contrary to Chriſt, will by
no means do ſo, for they continue in the body, and are reckoned among the members
of Chriſt. The Members are never contrary to one another; The intire compoſition
of a body conſuis in having all its members; and you know what the Apoſtle ſays
upon this matual agreement of the Members, <hi>If one member ſuffer, all the
members ſuffer with it; and if one be honoured, all ſhall rejoyce with it.</hi>
Now if all the Members ſuffer in the grief of one, and rejoyce at the honour done
to one, there is nothing that ſavours of Antichriſt in this mutual agreement. Thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98207:25"/>
that are within, are the body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. For this body is ſtill in a ſtate
of healing, and will never enjoy perfect health and ſandneſs, till the reſurrection
of the dead. Theſe Antichriſts are in the body of Chriſt like ill humours, the
voiding of which eaſes the body: Thus when the wicked go out, the Church finds
refreſhment; and when the body throws them out, ſhe ſays, theſe noxious humours
are gone out of me, but they were no part of me; that is, they were not cut away
from my fleſh or ſubſtance, but oppreſt my ſtomach while they lay there. They are
gone from us then, but be not troubled at it, they were not ours. But how do you
prove this?<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 19.</note> St. <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>If they had been of us, they would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

none. When that ariſes they are carried away, as with a ſtrong wind, becauſe
they are not the true ſolid Corn. <hi>Nothing can be more expreſs. Evil men,
tho within the pale of the Church; That is, making an outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
yet are not of his Body, nor ought to be reckoned among his

is the head of the Church, which is his body, and appointed to eternal glory with
him. As therefore in the firſt Rule, entituled, Of the Lord and his body, when the
Scripture ſpeaks of one and the ſame perſon, we muſt diſtinguiſh carefully, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the Head, and what to the Body; ſo as to this laſt Rule, we ſhall find
things ſpoken of the Devil, which do not ſo much belong to Him and his Body. Now
that Body of his is compoſed not only of ſuch as are viſibly without, but thoſe alſo
who though in truth they belong to him, yet continue for a time mixed with the
Church.</p>
               <p>I make no doubt but ſo many paſſages of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> together with
thoſe other proofs I inſtanced in before, for the reſolving this queſtion,
may make <hi>M. de Condom</hi> a little uneaſie, though he think never ſo well of
his own principle. But in ſhort, it concerns not only this Biſhop, but all
others that take this diſpute into conſideration, to know once for all,
what mighty difficulties they muſt overcome, before they can eſtabliſh the
pretended Authority of their Church. That is to ſay in one word, it is fit
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98207:30"/>
they know that in order to compaſs this deſign, they muſt triumph over
Scripture, triumph over Reaſon, triumph over the Fathers, but above all
they muſt declare open war with St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> particularly. The Throne of

together, conſidered in a different ſenſe, and under different reſpects.</p>
               <p>Thus much I think, Sir, may ſuffice to give a reſolution of the ſecond
queſtion, which was, whether the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi>'s definition of the
Church upon Earth was a good and ſufficient definition, <hi>viz. A Society
making profeſſion to believe the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and govern it ſelf by his
word;</hi> or whether it was defective, and required ſomething elſe to be add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to it. You ſee the neceſſity of handling this ſubject with ſome exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
for it being our buſineſs to know what Society we muſt be of, to
obtain Salvation, and both ſides agreeing that it is the true Church;
being it concerns us to know to what Society the Promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt
are to be applied, and both ſides agreeing that it is the true Church: The
firſt thing in reaſon to be done, is to form an abſtracted Idea of the true
Church, before it be applied to any particular ſubject, that ſo this may
ſerve for a Rule, and direct us to know at leaſt what that true Church is,
which we enquire after. We know in general that there is one true Church;
we know alſo, that this Church is a Religious Society; but when we come
to define it particularly, every one knows his own method of doing it.
This therefore is the firſt thing to be determined, not only to avoid equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
but to prevent a continual deviation, which may otherwiſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
through the whole diſpute, by means of a miſtake in the beginning;
and this having given occaſion to the ſecond queſtion, the diſpatching that
already will mightily facilitate our enquiry into the third. The thing then
to be examined is, whether the Society of true believers, who only are
the Church, be viſible or inviſible, or whether both in ſome ſenſes and
reſpects.</p>
               <p>For the reſolution of this Query, I ſhall not ſay that this true Church
being a Society of men, and ſo a body that hath its external order, as all
other Societies have, hath likewiſe conſequent to that a viſibility common
to it with all other bodies. Thus much is neceſſarily ſuppoſed, for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are not Angels, nor inviſible Spirits, but in this reſpect like the reſt
of mankind. But this viſibility being ſuppoſed, we muſt further enquire,
Whether there be not yet another, which gives it the Character of Jeſus
Chriſt's true Church; ſo that a man may ſay, That the body we ſee, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98207:31"/>
which is the object of our ſenſes, as the true Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In this there would not be the leaſt difficulty, had not God's deſign, as to
his Church, been diſturbed by the enemy of our Salvation. For ſince God
calls true Believers only, and ſince, as we have already ſhewn, ſuch alone
conſtitute the Church; were it not for what happens from ſome other
thing, there would not be among the outward Profeſſors of Chriſtianity,
either Hypocrites, or Hereticks, or Superſtitious, or worldly, or profane
perſons And thus none but ſuch as are truly the faithful being to be found
among them, this outward profeſſion would be a ſure means, and an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal
Character to know the true Faith and Regeneration by, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
to know the true Church of Jeſus Chriſt as ſuch. So that we need
ſay only thus much, That although the Church were not immediately vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
by its inward and cſſential form, becauſe none can immediately ſee
mens hearts but God only; yet it would be viſible by its external form,
as by a ſure diſtinguiſhing Character. For it might be ſeen by its Miniſtery
and profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt, and known to ſuch a degree that a man
might infallibly and poſitively ſay, <hi>That is the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we all know, that is Jeſus Chriſt ſowed his good ſeed in the field
of the world,<note place="margin">Matt. 13</note> ſo to uſe the expreſſions in the Parable, the enemy hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſown Tares. That is, that with the true Believers are intermixt vaſt
numbers of men, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> no more than the appearance and outſide of
Chriſtianity, and ſo make the outward profeſſion to be a note ſubject to
mighty uncertainties and equivocation. This God hath permitted for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
known to his own wiſdom, and hence have riſen on one ſide falſe
Churches, and on the other falſe members of the true, I mean whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities
who have wrongfully aſſumed to themſelves the title of a Church;
and ſingle perſons who wrongfully aſſumed the title of the Faithful. So
that the Church now, like all other things liable to hypocriſy and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,
cannot be truly known without much difficulty. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
according to the nature of the thing, the Churches viſibility and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibility ought to lye here, that its eſſential and internal from cannot be
ſeen immediately, and of it ſelf, but may by the mediation of its external
form; inſtead of this, they do now conſiſt further, in a diſcerning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
true and falſe, a diſtinguiſhing betwixt that which is real and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
and that which is counterfeit.</p>
               <p>We muſt therefore examine, how this diſtinction is to be made, becauſe
in it conſiſts the viſibility or inviſibility of the true Church. Whether we
muſt make it between ſeveral external bodies, differing from one another,
or between ſeveral perſons externally incorporated into the ſame Body.
I b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gin with the former, and affirm, that the diſcerning between ſeveral
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98207:31"/>
bodies, depends upon ſome certain marks, or characters, whereby that
body on whoſe ſide the true Church is, may be diſtinguiſhed from another
where it is not. I ſhall not now ſhew what thoſe Characters are, for this
is another diſpute between the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and us, which we need
not here engage our ſelves in.</p>
               <p>It is enough we are all agreed, that ſuch marks there are, and that by
them this diſtinction muſt be made. That which moſt concerns us to take
notice of, and which I deſire you would obſerve with a very particular
attention, is, that after we have found this Body, or external Society on
whoſe ſide the true Church is, we may, and in reality do form to our
ſelves two notions of it, one proceeding from a mere Judgment <hi>of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
the other from a Judgment <hi>of Reflection.</hi> By the Judgment of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
we look upon all within the Body to be true Believers, indifferently;
For the ſearching of hearts being not in our power, but peculiar to God,
Charity makes no diſtinctions, but ſuppoſes that things are in truth what
they ſhould be; and upon this ſuppoſition, we call all that ſociety <hi>the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church,</hi> ſpeaking ſimply, and abſolutely. By the Judgment of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,
having conſulted the Rules of Scripture, and the light of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
we come to know that there are Tares mixed with the Wheat, and
that it is paſt a doubt, that among theſe outward Profeſſours, are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of hypocritical, ſuperſtitious, ambitious, and prophane people.
Hence we correct our firſt notion, and term this Society, <hi>a viſible mixt
Church.</hi> Thus in the ſame external body, we diſtinguiſh two different
Bodies, one of true Believers, which we look upon as the true Church
of Jeſus Chriſt; the other of hypocrites and worldlings, who have only
the ſhadow, and ſhell of Faith and Regeneration, and conſequently do
not belong to Jeſus Chriſt's true Church.</p>
               <p>This is the original of all that ambiguity betwixt the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and us.
<hi>M. de Condom,</hi> according to the principles of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Perron,</hi>
and moſt of the Doctors of his Communion, does in this Diſpute judge of
the true viſible Church, by that notion of <hi>Charity,</hi> which without making
any difference, includes bad and good, true and falſe Believers. And we
judge of the true viſible Church, by that other, termed the notion of
<hi>Reflection,</hi> which excludes hypocrites and worldlings, and confines it ſelf
to true Believers only. He ſuppoſes without offering any proof for it, that
there is no other viſible Church, than this whole Body of Profeſſors, and
that That of the true Believers is inviſible; which we deny. He proves
that the true Church of Chriſt, to whom the promiſes belong, is a viſible
Church, which we grant. We muſt take leave therefore to tell him,
that he ſuppoſes, what he ſhould prove, and proves what he ought to
ſuppoſe; which muſt needs entangle the matter in diſpute, and render it
mighty intricate and obſcure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:98207:32"/>
But what great matter is it (you'l ſay) as to this Diſpute, whether a
man judges of the true viſible Church by the notion of <hi>Charity,</hi> or that of
<hi>Reflection?</hi> I anſwer, if the matter had concerned only the Duties incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on the Church, or exhorting and inſtructing men in thoſe Duties, it
would ſignify very little which of theſe two notions we followed. For the
duties incumbent on beth good and had, are much the ſame, they all
hear the ſame Word, partake of the ſame Sacraments, and are all under
the ſame Obligations. But the preſent controverſy does not concern the
duties and exhortations to them, but the inveſting the Church in ſome
particular rights and priviledges allowed her, and applying to her the
promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt: So that it highly concerns us in this caſe, not
to follow a notion which may lead us into miſtakes, and give away theſe
priviledges and promiſes to men that have no manner of right to them.
It nearly concerns us not to follow a notion, which may occaſion our fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into errour, under pretence of that name, <hi>the Church.</hi> There is an
abſolute neceſſity of clearing an ambiguity, which if not cleared, may
prejudice our Conſcience, and put our Salvation upon a hazard.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> let us ſee I beſeech you, whether of theſe two notions is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be received in this diſpute? And this will eaſily appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider;
That the notion followed by <hi>M. de Condom</hi> is groſly falſe in one of
its parts, as taking for true Believers, perſons who really are not ſo, and
can pretend to truth no further, than as it is conformable to this ſecond
notion. That it is not grounded upon an exact knowledg of its object,
but merely upon a charitable ſuppoſition, which if niecly look'd into, is
not true it ſelf: And ſo there can be no robable argument for allowing
evil men and hypocrites a part in Chriſt's Promiſes, <hi>Thoſe falſe plants,
which our heavenly father hath not planted,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matt. 15.</note>

concerned in that Idea of the true Church which Scripture gives us, and
conſequently not of it. In a word, this will eaſily appear, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we follow is the moſt exact, the moſt certain, the moſt agreeable to
the Idea's given in Scripture, and the only one that can bear any propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the Promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt, and the dignity of the true Church.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſaid, Was not <hi>M. de Condom</hi> in the right, to ſay, there
was not actually any viſible Church, but that which he def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es, <hi>A Society
making profeſſion to believe the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, and govern it ſelf by his
word?</hi> And ſo no other than that which comprehends good and bad, true
Believers and Hypocrites? And was it not fair then to make uſe of this
notion in the Controverſy? I anſwer, the true Church conſiſting of true
Believers only, is not indeed viſible, by any certain and diſtinct ſight we
can have of it, ſo as to affirm poſitively and perſonally, ſuch or ſuch are
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98207:32"/>
of the true Church. When we would carry on this diſtinction to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
men, diſguiſe and hypocriſie put a ſtop to it, ſo that in this ſence
the true Church will always continue inviſible, till Jeſus Chriſt come to
make a full and perfect ſeparation betwixt his own Corn and the Enemies
Tares, which ſhall not be done till the end of the World. Thus it is not
viſible, not only immediately by its internal form in mens hearts, but
even by theſe external Characters, as to certain and diſtinct viſibility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
diſſimulation and deceit often makes theſe marks to be doubtful.
All this I grant.</p>
               <p>But for all this, we may and muſt ſay, that the true Church is viſible,
truly viſible, in other ſenſes and reſpects. For firſt of all; it cannot be
denied that it is viſible at leaſt materially, as they ſay, becauſe the true
Believers that appear viſibly in publick Aſſemblies, partake of the ſame

Beſides, It is plain, that tho the true Church be mixt with wicked men
in the ſame profeſſion,<note place="margin">Matt. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> yet is it viſible in this very mixture, as <hi>the wheat
is viſible, tho in the ſame field with the tares, and the good fiſh in the ſame net with
the bad,</hi> according to the parables in the Goſpel; or as true Friends are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
tho mixt with diſſemblers and flatterers. This mixture indeed
hinders us from an exact diſtinction of perſons, but ſtill we may with
great certainty diſtinguiſh and diſcern two ſorts of perſons. We are not
ſure which particular men are true Believers, and which Hypocrites, but
we are ſure that there are true Belivers as well as Hypocrites; and this is
enough to prove the Church viſible, according to the Scriptures, and t.
<hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Hypotheſis. Nay, I will go further yet; for 'tis true that upon
ſome occaſions Hypocrites do plainly diſtinguiſh themſelves from true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and upon ſome other occaſions true Believers do plainly make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
diſtinction of themſelves from Hypocrites. For inſtance, when we
ſee men drowned in vices inconſiſtent with true Faith, when we ſee them
throw themſelves into Superſtitions and Errors, that are contrary to the
true Doctrine and Worſhip of God, tho they abide ſtill in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations with others, and communicate in the ſame Sacraments; yet
this makes a negative diſtinction, ſo as we may ſay, theſe are not the true
Believers, that is, not of the true Church. On the other ſide, when we
ſee men undergo long ſharp tryals, without being removed, either from
the profeſſion of the true Doctrine and Worſhip, or from that of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Holineſs, in this reſpect here is made a poſitive diſtinction, and
ſuch as makes us acknowledg, that theſe perſons are of the true Church of
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98207:33"/>
Jeſus Chriſt. I confeſs theſe diſtinctions are not always, either ſo certain
as never to admit of miſtakes, nor ſo univerſal as not to confound one
with another. For a man may judg raſhly of both ſorts, either for want
of knowing mens particular circumſtances, and the motives they went
upon; or ſome other way; and it is never ſeen, that all Hypocrites diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
themſelves at once. But however, there is great uſe to be made of
this diſtinction, and ſuch a viſibility of the true Church reſults from it, as
is in ſome ſort perſonal, according to our Hypotheſis.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Sir,</hi> you ſee, whether <hi>M. de Condom</hi> was in the right to take it
for granted, as if it were a certain truth, that there was no viſible Church,
but ſuch a one as he defined, that comprehends good and bad, true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and Worldlings, contrary to the Scriptures, and St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s ſenſe.
You ſee too whether he was in the right, to maintain in this firſt part of
his diſcourſe,<note place="margin">Confer. page 10.</note> that we deny the Churches viſibility. <hi>The Pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd</hi>

Jeſus Chriſt's Body. Which is then that Body where God hath eſtabliſhed ſome

                  <hi>the Grace of Miniſtry, the Grace of Teaching, the Grace of
Exhortation and Conſolation, the Grace of Ruling? Which, I ſay, is that Body,
if it be not the viſible Church?</hi> We never denied the viſible Church upon
Earth to be Chriſt's Body; not the whole Body indeed, for there is one
part of it collected in Heaven, and another not yet in being, but ſtill that
part upon Earth is Jeſus Chriſt's Body, ſo the Scripture calls it, and we
are ſo far from thinking as he ſaies, that quite contrary, we prove Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites

I ſhould now conclude my Third Enquiry, did I not think my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
an obligation to remove ſome difficulties, which may be ſtarted upon
it. For it may be ſaid, the Miniſtry is common to good and bad, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it makes a Church compoſed of good men and bad. I anſwer,
that the Miniſtry and the uſe of it is common both to good and bad, comes
to paſs only by accident, and from the treachery of the Enemy. Of right
it belongs to true Believers only, and its genuine deſign was for them. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt gave it for the <hi>aſſembling of the Saints,</hi> and inſtituted it to increaſe
and cultivate his good Corn. If the Tares uſe it, or to ſpeak more truly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
it, this is contrary to his intention. For his <hi>hand never ſowed theſe,</hi> but
<hi>the enemy's, who roſe by night for that purpoſe.</hi> It is ſure then that the Miniſtry
of it ſelf does not make up a Church compoſed of good and bad men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſuch only as it was intended to gather, are to be reckoned of his viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church. Now the Miniſtry is deſigned to gather the true Believers, and
truly Righteous, not the worldlings and hypocrites in the leaſt. If they
thruſt themſelves into the Aſſemblies, it is not the Miniſtry that calls them,
but the ſpirit of the world that ſends them thither. An invincible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that there is no other viſible Church, but what conſiſts of true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
becauſe they are the only perſons call'd to Religious Aſſemblies;
and it is not Jeſus Chriſt, but Jeſus Chriſt's enemy that thruſts others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them.</p>
               <p>To give you yet further ſatisfaction as to this Point, permit me, <hi>Sir,</hi> to

only; I reconcile theſe two by inferring, That the Church of true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
only is a Church made viſible by the Exerciſe of the Miniſtry. <hi>M. de
Condom</hi> tells me St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of a Church viſible by the uſe of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,<note place="margin">Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, pag. 5, 6.</note>
when he ſays, <hi>Chriſt loved it, and cleanſed it, with the waſhing of

                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.</note> St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> tells me, The Church of true Believers only
is ſpoken of in this paſſage; I can reconcile theſe two no other way, than
by concluding, that then the Church of true Believers only, is a Church
viſible by the uſe of the Miniſtry.<note place="margin">Confer. p. 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>M. de Condom</hi> teaches me, that in this
paſſage, <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will I build my Church,</hi> Jeſus
Chriſt denotes a Church viſible, by the Exerciſe of an External Miniſtry;
St. <hi>Augustin</hi> inſtructs me, that it denotes the Church of true Believers;
How ſhall theſe two be made agree, but by concluding, that the Church
of true Believers then is a viſible Church, exerciſing an external Miniſtry?
If you ſtill deſire an Argument of more ſtrongth, remember that the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98207:34"/>
attributed to the Church in Scripture, cannot poſſibly be any other
than that we aſſign it. For as on the one hand we are taught there, that
the true Church conſiſts of true Believers only; ſo do we learn there alſo,
that true Believers are mixt with wicked men and hypocrites: It is there
we find the ſimilitudes, of Chaff amongſt the good Corn, of bad
Fiſhes jumbled together with the good, of Tares ſown among the good
Wheat. Now whatever we deliver concerning the Churches viſibility and
inviſibility, is grounded entirely upon theſe two principles.</p>
               <p>The ſecond difficulty that may be ſiarted is, whether the viſibility we
aſſign to the Church, be ſufficient to maintain Chriſtian Fellowſhip, to
comfort the Faithful, and bring them to Salvation. I anſwer, that this
would not be ſufficient indeed to eſtabli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
ſuch as abſolute authority over mens Conſciences, Infallibility of
Councils, a blind obedience to their Determinations, and this very inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
as to that ſhews us the injuſtice of ſuch pretenſions. But I ſay, that
in its kind this viſibility is ſufficient, either for the maintenance of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Communion, or for the joy and conſolation of the Faithful, and the
bringing them to Salvation. In order to that, we need only know our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelves
to be in Communion with the truly Faithful. For tho we know
that there is a mixture of ill men among theſe, yet ſhall we ſtill continue
in the external Communion with them, out of reſpect to God's Elect:
We ſhall ſtill bear the diſorders and offences given by others patiently; we
ſhall ſtill receive the ſame Sacraments, and partake of other fruits of the
Miniſtry with comfort, as knowing that the efficacy of theſe acts does
not depend upon the wicked, but are bleſſings that belong to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
And our not being able to make certain and perſonal diſtinctions
of men, will add to our caution, that we ſuffer not our ſelves to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
into any ſuperſtitions and errors, that would inſinuate themſelves
under the plauſible title of the Church. And thus the viſibility we allow
the Church is abundantly ſufficient.</p>
               <p>It might further be demanded, whether it can ſo happen, that the
Church may at any time loſe the viſibility of its Aſſemblies, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
in this reſpect perfectly inviſible? I anſwer, that although we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
Almighty God can, whenever he pleaſes, utterly diſperſe the
perſons of the Faithful, and ſtill keep them in this wretched condition by
the methods of his own Providence; yet we do not think this ever did ſo
happen. The Chriſtian Church hath lain under great perſecutions, but
tho they were never ſo great, ſhe hath conſtantly had ſome where or other
ſome Aſſemblies, and ſome exerciſe of the Miniſtry, publick or private;
and however her Martyrs and Confeſſors have all along made her viſible,
ſo that ſhe cannot be ſaid abſolutely, ever to have diſappeared quite from
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98207:35"/>
the ſight of men; Yet we muſt own, that in this reſpect there have
been ſeveral degrees of her viſibility, that is, the Church hath been more
or leſs viſible, as her Aſſemblies have been held, and her Miniſtry exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with more or leſs freedom. We muſt own too, that not any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church upon Earth can promiſe it ſelf a perpetual viſibility, no nor
ſo much as a perpetual ſubſiſtence. God removes his Candleſtick from
the midſt of a people at his pleaſure, and he does it then, when he hath
no more Elect to call there. There have been many inſtances of this in
the World, particularly in the Churches of <hi>Africa,</hi> once ſo beautiful and
flouriſhing; but theſe are only the puttings out of ſome particular light,
and do not at all prejudice either the ſubſiſtence, or viſibility of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church in general.</p>
               <p>The laſt difficulty to be urged is, whether the Church can at any time
loſe the viſibility of its Characters, (I mean that viſibility) whereby
without deſcending to perſonal diſtinctions, we are enabled to conclude
that there are true Believers in this mixed Society; ſo far as that we can
not judge whether ſuch be there or no? I anſwer, It not only may, but
often hath happened, that the Characters by which we ſhould in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
come to know the true Church, have been ſo mightily obſcured,
that a man could not without much trouble and difficulty affirm, that <hi>In this particular body it was, that God nouriſhed and ſuſtained his true Believers;</hi>
and we ſhall find hereafter that <hi>M. de Condom</hi> himſelf owns enough to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the truth of this aſſertion. But ſtill, tho this be unconteſtable, as
proved to be plain matter of fact, we do notwithſtanding acknowledg,
that the Church did never abſolutely and entirely loſe their viſibility in
this reſpect; becauſe, as was ſaid in anſwer to the Prejudices, we do not
think that ever ſo total an Eclipſe happen'd, that it could not in ſome
meaſure be ſaid, <hi>This is the Society wherein God preſerves ſome true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I cannot but complain of what <hi>M. de Condom</hi> does afterwards
in his Diſcourſe accuſe us of,<note place="margin">Confer. pag. 10. Pag. 12.</note> ſaying, that the viſible Church ſometimes
ceaſes to be. <hi>They are conſtrained</hi> (ſays he) <hi>to ſay, that the viſible Church
ſometimes ceaſes to be upon Earth.</hi> And in another place, <hi>This is the Church,
which your Miniſters know not: They teach you that this viſible and exteriour
Church may ceaſe to be upon Earth.</hi> But this is urging his charge againſt us
too far: So far are we from believing, the viſible Church ceaſes to be,
that we do not ſo much as ſay, it ever abſolutely ceaſes to be viſible: And
yet there would be a mighty difference, between ſaying ſhe ceaſes to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
and that ſhe ceaſes to be at all. The Sun, the moſt viſible thing in
the World, is often not viſible to our eyes, but yet he ceaſes not to be.
In the point of Real preſence, <hi>M. de Condom</hi> will own, that the Body of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98207:35"/>
Jeſus Chriſt ceaſes to be viſible; but he would not be well-pleaſed for
that reaſon to be taxed with ſaying, he ceaſes to be there at all. But
however, let <hi>M. de Condom</hi> put what ſenſe he pleaſe upon our words, it is
certain we acknowledg the Church to be perpetually viſible, in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I explain'd juſt now: And <hi>M. de Condom</hi> could never have ſpent his
time to leſs purpoſe, than in taking ſuch pains to confute an opinion

of a Church, whoſe eſſence conſiſts in true Faith and Regeneration, What
is there in this that is not all Divine? <hi>M. de Condom</hi> ſees the duration of a

God nouriſhes and breeds up his true Believers, we ſhew at the ſame time
thoſe true Believers, which are his Church built on the Rock, tho mixt
with ſuch as build on the Sand. When we ſhew the held where Jeſus
Chriſt ſowed his good Seed, we ſhew the Wheat, tho there be Tares
among it. But let <hi>M. de Condom</hi> tell us, if he think fit, how he can ſhew
us a Church built on the Rock, making, as he does, the eſſence of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98207:36"/>
Church to conſiſt entirely in an outward profeſſion. If he call this a
Church upon the Rock, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf will reply for that ſuch
only are built upon a Rock, <hi>who hear this word, and do it;</hi> whereas all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
are built upon the Sand. <hi>To ſave Chriſt's Word</hi> (continues he) <hi>they
are obliged to have recourſe to a Church of the Predeſtinate.</hi> Does <hi>M. de Condom</hi>
blame us for ſeeking the accompliſhment of Jeſus Chriſt's Promiſes, in the
body of his Elect, and true Believers? Pray where ſhould we look for it
elſe? In a croud of Hypocrites and Reprobates, that have no Faith, no
Holineſs, no Piety, but in outward appearance only? Such as God never
call'd, and Jeſus Chriſt ſhall one day tell, he never knew them? Is not
this of Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi>'s, <hi>Perron</hi>'s, and <hi>M. de Condom</hi>s, a curious
Church, to the conſtituting whereof no inward virtue is neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
but merely an outward profeſſion of Faith, and communicating in
the Sacraments? A Church, whoſe Unity, the formal eſſence of it, is
<hi>that of an external Vocation, not that of Predeſtination, nor internal Faith, nor a
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Souls by the works of Love:</hi> In a word, a Church defined, not by
believing, and governing it ſelf by God's word, but <hi>by making profeſſion to
believe and govern it ſelf by God's VVord?</hi> Is not this putting a mighty
value upon Jeſus Chriſt's Promiſes, to apply them not only to profane and
worldly men, as well as the Saints and regenerate; but to ſuch a Church
as would remain entire, tho there were no true believers, nor righteous
men in it; and not ceaſe to be the true Church of Chriſt, tho it were
compoſed of Hypocrites, and none elſe?</p>
               <p>Thus far, <hi>Sir,</hi> there is no great perſpicacity required, to diſcern, that
the queſtion in hand reſolves it ſelf, there being little probability that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt was ſo laviſh of his Promiſes. But however let us examine the
matter a little more cloſely. The firſt paſſage <hi>M. de Condom</hi> preſents us
with,<note place="margin">Confer. p. 5, 6.</note> is that of St. <hi>Paul, Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it,
that he might cleanſe it with the waſhing of Water by the Word, that he
might make it a glorious Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 5. 25, 26, 27. 29, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>having neither ſpot, nor wrinkle, nor any
ſuch thing, but that it might be holy and without blemiſh.</hi> And a little after,
<hi>No man hateth his own fleſh, but nouriſheth and cheriſheth it, even as the Lord the
Church; For we are members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones.</hi> We
ſee in theſe words, the obligation Jeſus Chriſt put himſelf under, to
ſanctify his Church, to make it a glorious Church, without ſpot or wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle,
holy and without blemiſh, to nouriſh and cheriſh it, as his own fleſh
and bones. Our buſineſs is to know, whether this obligation can upon
any pretence whatever reſpect Hypocrites and wicked men; And who
will be perſwaded it does?<note place="margin">Confer. p. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>This Church, M. do Condom</hi> ſays, <hi>is glorious, becauſe
ſhe glorifies God, becauſe ſhe declares to all the Earth the Glory of Jeſus Chriſt's
Goſpel and Croſs.</hi> Now as to the wicked, of whom we are here treating,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98207:36"/>
there need but this one word be added, That they glorify God and the
Goſpel in hypocriſy and diſſimulation, but in their hearts deny it. Then
ſee what God himſelf hath ſpoken as to this matter.<note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the ungodly ſaid
God, why doſt thou preach my laws, and takeſt my Covenant in thy mouth?
This Church</hi> (M. de Condom tells us) <hi>is holy,</hi>

but deny the power thereof, from ſuch turn away. This Church</hi> (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>M. de Condom) hath neither ſpot nor wrinkle, becauſe ſhe hath neither any
evil Error, nor any evil Maxim, and becauſe ſhe inſtructs, and contains in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
the Elect of God.</hi> Add, But as for ſinners, They follow Truth and
Right only in pretence.<note place="margin">Matt. 7. 22.</note> Then ſee what Jeſus Chriſt ſays of ſuch, <hi>Many
will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, have not we propheſied in thy name, and in
thy name have caſt out Devils, and in thy name have done many wonderful works?
Then will I ſay unto them, I never knew you, depart from me ye workers of iniquity.</hi>
And can any man after all this allow them a propriety in the Promiſes of
Chriſt?</p>
               <p>The ſecond paſſage <hi>M. de Condom</hi> makes uſe of,<note place="margin">Matt. 18. 17, 18, 19, 20.</note> is that of Jeſus Chriſt,
which I will here ſet down at length. <hi>Tell the Church; but if he neglect to
hear the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man, and a Publican; verily I
ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven. Again I ſay unto you, that
if two of you ſhall agree on earth, as touching any thing that they ſhall ask, it ſhall
be done for them, of my father which is in heaven; For where two or three are
gathered together in my name, there am I in the midſt of them. Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
M. de Condom ſays,<note place="margin">Conf. p. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>uſed the word Church to ſignify this viſible Society.</hi> I
agree with him, that the Church there ſignifies a viſible Church; I ſay
further, that it ſignifies a Church repreſented by the Paſtors, by whom it
binds and looſes, by whom it asks the Father; I am ſtill of opinion, that
thoſe excellent Promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt, that God will ratify what they
have bound and looſed, that he will grant what they ask, and that the
Lord himſelf will be in the midſt of them, are all made to the Church
taken in this ſenſe. But then I ſay withal, that this viſible Church is
that of the true Believers only, and that Hypocrites have no ſhare at all
in it. It is to the true Believers alone, that this Miniſtry belongs, they
are the perſons repreſented by the Paſtors, they the only people that ask
and obtain, that are gathered together in Chriſt's name, and in the
midſt of whem he is. And yet it often happens, that the Miniſters
of this Church, tho they be in this function, and do the buſineſs of it,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98207:37"/>
are not yet true Members of it themſelves.<note n="*" place="margin">Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quando <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>It often falls out,</hi> ſays St.
<hi>Auguſtin, by reaſon of this mixture here upon Earth, that people really belonging
to</hi> Babylon, <hi>adminiſter the things belonging to</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>All they, of whom
it is ſaid, whatſoever they bid you obſerve, obeſereveand do,</hi> Matt. 23. 3. <hi>but do

and do? Again, if they were true Citizens of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>who ſhould reign with
Chriſt for ever, What occaſion was there for adding, But do not ye after their works?</hi>
It is not then to the Miniſters that the Promiſes belong, but to the Body
they repreſent, and whoſe Offices they diſcharge. Now this body is the
<hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> which ſhall reign with Chriſt for ever; That is, the true
Believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. de Cendom</hi>'s third paſſage is this,<note place="margin">Confer. p. 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou art Peter, and upon this rock will
I build my Church, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it. Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
(ſays he) <hi>would ſhew ſomething illuſtrious and clear, when he ſaid, that his
Church, maugre the oppoſition of Hell, ſhould be always invincible: he would, I
ſay, ſhew ſomething clear and reſplendent, which might ſerve in all Ages, for a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
and palpable aſſurance of the immutable certainty of his Promiſes.</hi> He adds,
<hi>The Church of which Chriſt ſpeaks, is then a confeſſing Church, a Church that
publiſhes the Faith, and conſequently an exteriour and viſible Church.</hi> He ſays
further, <hi>That it is a Church, to which an exteriour Miniſtry is given; for 'tis
added, I will give unto thee the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, and whatſoever
thou ſhalt bind on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatſoever thou ſhalt looſe
on Earth ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi> I anſwer, The Church ſpoken of in this
paſſage is really a Confeſſing Church, a Church that publiſhes the Faith,
a Church to whom Chriſt hath given an exteriour Miniſtry; a Church
that uſes the Miniſtry of the Keys, that binds and looſes, and by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
an exteriour and viſible Church. The Queſtion is, whether wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
men, let them diſſemble never ſo well, and carry never ſo fair an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
do truly belong to this Church, or whether it conſiſt of ſincere Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
only. 'Tis a Church <hi>exteriour and viſible,</hi> I acknowledg it, but it is
alſo a Church <hi>interiour, and real;</hi> otherwiſe it would differ nothing from a
Phantome, a cheating apparition. 'Tis a <hi>Confeſſing Church,</hi> and <hi>publiſhes</hi>
the Faith, but it is likewiſe a Church <hi>believing</hi> in what it <hi>confeſſes</hi> and <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes.</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:98207:37"/>
'Tis a Church, to which not only St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Confeſſion</hi> muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed,

                  <hi>Bleſſed art
thou Simon Bar-jona, for fleſh and blood hath net revealed this unto thee, but my
Father which is in Heaven:</hi> And therefore whoſe Confeſſion proceeds not
from Fleſh and Blood, but from Grace and Divine Illumination. 'Tis a
Church <hi>built upon a Rock,</hi> and not upon the Sand, therefore not a Church
that Hypocrites are of. 'Tis a Church <hi>built by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> a Church
therefore of true Believers only, becauſe ſuch only are built by Chriſt.
'Tis a Church to which this Promiſe <hi>of the Gates of Hell never prevailing
againſt it,</hi> belongs; And can we with any pretence to modeſty ſay, that the
Gates of Hell do not prevail againſt the wicked ingulfed in v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce? Can we
ſay thoſe admirable words carry no ſtronger importance, than the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of a mere exteriour profeſſion? But <hi>this is a Chruch which hath, and
exerciſeth ſuch a Miniſtry.</hi> Who queſtions it? But does this Miniſtry belong
to the wicked and hypocrites? No. It belongs only to true Behevers,
the reſt have no part in it; only as they ſometimes exerciſe the external
Offices, without any true right to them; or receive them unworthily,
under the covering of hypocriſy, and being intermixt with good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
But <hi>M. de Condom</hi> ſays further, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt promiſed ſomething illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and clear, which might ſerve in all Ages for a ſenſible and palpable aſſurance
of the immutable certainty of his Promiſes.</hi> Theſe words want a little unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
If they underſtand hereby a temporal proſperity, a perpetual viſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
promiſed to the Church, in pomp and luſtre, I deny that Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
any ſuch thing. If they underſtand an Earthly Dominion, a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Greatneſs under the title of Hierarchy, I deny ſtill that Chriſt ever
promiſed any ſuch thing. If they underſtand a conſtant unblemiſht purity
in the Miniſtry, in the Matters of Doctrine and Worſhip, of moral Rules,
and orderly Government, This again I deny that Chriſt ever promiſed.
If they underſtand Believers perſeverance in Faith and Holineſs, ſo far
forth as is neceſſary to Salvation, in deſpight of all temptations to the
contrary, from Hell, the World, and their own Infirmities, This I own
our Lord hath promiſed. Now this in my opinion is a thing ſufficently
illuſtrious and clear, to ſerve for a ſenſible and palpable aſſurance, of the
immutable certainty of his Promiſes. For when we ſee our Brethren dye,
and do our ſelves dye in the boſom of Truth and Piety, this denotes Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt's Grace ſenſibly enough. If they underſtand over and above
this, a perpetual ſubſiſtence of the Miniſtry, in ſuch a condition as is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for the Salvation of God's Elect, mangre all the oppoſitions of
Hell, or the diſorders of the Miniſters themſelves, this I do likewiſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
to be promiſed by Jeſus Chriſt, and herein we have a ſenſible
and palpable aſſurance of the immutable certainty of his Promiſes. For
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98207:38"/>
in the midſt of ſo many infirmities as the Faithful are liable to, in the
midſt of ſo many Thorns as encompaſs and incumber the Lilies of the Son
of God; in the midſt of ſo many ſuperſtitious, profane, heretical, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning,
worldly-minded, lukewarm and indifferent people, that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
Profeſſors, and often Officers in the Church; that God ſhould ſtill
preſerve the Miniſtry, ſo far as is neceſſary for nouriſhing and cheriſhing
his Elect, and true Believers, and to bring them ſafe to Heaven; is a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
indication of the ſtrength of our Saviours Words, <hi>That the Gates of
Hell ſhould not prevail againſt it.</hi> He does not ſay, the Gates of Hell ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fight againſt it, nor that they ſhall never get any advantages over it;
He ſuppoſes that they ſhall encounter it, that they ſhall very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damage
it, that they ſhall ſometimes reduce it to great extremities; But
he aſſures us, <hi>they ſhall not prevail.</hi> In this the Aſſiſtance and perpetual
Providence of Chriſt is the more gloriouſly illuſtrated, that the Church can
ſay of her ſelf,<note place="margin">Pſ. 129. 2. Matt. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Many a time have they vexed me from my youth up, but they have

all nations, baptizing them in the name of the father, and of the ſon, and of the
holy ghoſt: Teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you;
And to I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</hi> Upon which
Text <hi>M. de Condom</hi> puts this Comment. <hi>Teaching with you, Baptizing with
you, Inſtructing with you my Faithful, to obſerve all things whatſoever I have
commanded, conſequently exerciſing with you in my Church and exteriour Miniſtry.
'Tis with you, 'tis with thoſe who ſhall ſucceed you, 'tis with the Society aſſembled
under their Conduct, that I ſhall be from this preſent, even to the conſummation of
the World, alway, without interruption; For there ſhall not be any one moment in
which I will leave you, but tho abſent in Body, I will be always preſent by my holy
Spirit.</hi> I own that Chriſt ſpeaks there to his Church, that he orders it to
Baptize, to Teach, and conſequently gives it a Miniſtry, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
to be exerciſed therein. I acknowledg moreover, that he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to be with it, to Teach with it till the conſummation of the World,
without interruption; but this is not the point in controverſy. All our
buſineſs is to know, what Church this is; <hi>M. de Condom</hi> will have it all
that Society <hi>that makes profeſſion to believe,</hi> &amp;c. we think it to be that, which
making profeſſion to believe, does ſo really and ſincerely. He ſuppoſes his
Propoſition without offering Arguments for it; but we prove ours. For
no man can ſay, that Chriſt is with wicked men and hypocrites, by the
preſence of his Holy Spirit, always, without interruption; that there is
never any moment when he leaves them, even to the Conſummation of
the World. This can be affirmed of none but the Society of true Believrs:
Such a Society there will always be, and Jeſus Chriſt always in the midſt
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98207:38"/>
of them, baptizing, and inſtructing with them; For tho the mouth and
hand of his enemies may often exerciſe the outward acts of the Miniſtry,
and often with abundance of impurity and diſorder; yet Jeſus Chriſt does
for ever preſerve his faithful under the Miniſtry which is rightfully theirs,
he does ever baptize, and teach them even by wicked Miniſters, ſo as by
his wonderful Providence, never to ſuffer ſo fatal a corruption in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
as ſhould render it inſufficient to cheriſh the Faith of his Elect,
even to the concluſion of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To the ſame purpoſe it is manifeſt St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeaks of the deſign and dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Evangelical Miniſtry.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> Jeſus Chriſt hath given ſome Apoſtles, and
ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtours and Teachers, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body
of Chriſt. Till we all come in the unity of the Faith, and of the knowledg of the
Son of God,<note place="margin">Confer. p. 9, 10.</note> unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fullneſs of
Chriſt. That is, ſays <hi>M. de Condom,</hi> the Eccleſiaſtical Miniſtry ſhall laſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any diſcontinuance till the general Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>I ſay once again; this is not the Point in Controverſy. The Miniſtry
ſhall laſt to the end of the World, and in ſuch a degree and condition too,
as may ſuffice for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt, for the conducting
all his Elect, and true Believers to that perfection St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of. Our
concern is to know two things, The firſt, whether This ſhall be conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preſerved from corruption and impurity, and continue in the ſtate
wherein Chriſt and his Apoſtles left it us; or whether the Tares ſown by
the Enemy in the Lord's Field by night, ſhall not vitiate it? The ſecond,
whether its uninterrupted continuance muſt wholly conſiſt in being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
tranſmitted from one Miniſter to another, in the way we call ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
or perſonal ſucceſſion; or whether it may not happen, that the
Church ſhould ſometime take away her Miniſtry from them, who have
palpably abuſed it; and commit it to others, who ſhe may hope will uſe
it better? Each of theſe two are the matters in diſpute, and not that
which <hi>M. de Condom</hi> was pleaſed to determine from that place of St.
<hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Give me leave,</hi> Sir, <hi>to run over theſe wonderful Promiſes of Jeſus
Chriſt to his Church, and ſome others of the ſame nature once more.</hi>
The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt her.<note place="margin">Matt. 16.</note> He will preſent her without ſpot or
wrinkle,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.</note> holy and without blemiſh. He will love and cheriſh her as his own fleſh
and bones.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> He will bring her in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledg of
the Son of God,<note place="margin">Matt. 18.</note> to the meaſure of a perfect man. He will be in the midſt of her
at ſolemn Aſſemblies.<note place="margin">Matt. 28.</note> He will continue with her to the end of the World. He
will give his ſpirit to abide with her for ever.<note place="margin">Joh. 14.</note> He will redeem her from all iniquity,
and purify her,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. Epheſ. 2.</note> that ſhe may be a peculiar people zealous of good works. He will
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98207:39"/>
build her upon himſelf, to be an holy Temple, an habitation of God through the
ſpirit.<note place="margin">Jev. 31.</note> He will wrde his laws in their hearts, and engrave them in their minds.
He will take away the heart of ſtone,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.</note> and give them an heart of fleſh, a new heart,
and a new ſpirit.</p>
               <p>How is it poſſible, that nothing of all this ſhould ſurpriſe the Doctors
of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion, nor ſtagger their confidence, of finding theſe
Promiſes fulfilled, as well in the bad as the good, the juſt as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt?
For in ſhort, if wicked men, who have no more than external
profeſſion, become by virtue of that profeſſion, really and truly Members
of the Church; the Promiſes concern them, and they have a right to
them in common with others; for certainly they concern as many as
make up the Body of Chriſt. Now ſhall we ſay, that notwithſtanding
theſe are drowned in vice, <hi>Yet the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt them,</hi>
provided they can but counterfeit dexterouſly? Shall we ſay, that tho
gangrened and putrified from the crown of the head to the ſole of the
foot, it matters not; <hi>They ſhall be without ſpot or wrinkle, holy and without
blemiſh,</hi> ſo they do but continue in an external profeſſion? Shall we ſay,
that tho they have no Faith, no Juſtice, no Piety, they need not trouble
themſelves, Jeſus Chriſt <hi>will be with them alway</hi> by the preſence of his Holy
Spirit, provided they can but maintain a fair outſide? Shall we ſay,
that although they proſtitute themſelves to all wickedneſs and villany,
they need not be ſo much concerned, Jeſus Chriſt will not fail <hi>to redeem
them from all iniquity,</hi> and to make of them <hi>a peculiar people, zealous of good
works,</hi> provided they be not wanting in diſſimulation? Here is no invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
aggravation in all this. The Promiſes of Chriſt are plain matters of
fact, delivered expreſly in Scripture in favour of the Church. The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Church by a bare external profeſſion, is another plain matter of
fact, to be ſeen through all the Writers of that Communion, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
this diſcourſe of <hi>M. de Condom.</hi> The applying theſe Promiſes to the
Church thus defined, is what <hi>M. de Condom.</hi> ſtitly contends for, and makes
it an inducement to peoples converſion. So that I do not in the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerate,
nor do I ſee what reply they can make. To talk of two true
Churches even in Chriſt's ſight, one to which the Promiſes belong as ſuch,
<hi>viz.</hi> That of True Believers; and another to which they do not belong as
ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> That, whoſe eſſence conſiſts in the external profeſſion; beſides
that it would be advancing a notion contrary to Scripture and Reaſon,
which inform us but of one true Church; would be to argue to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for wherefore ſhould we argue about a Church to which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of Jeſus Chriſt have no relation? Why ſhould we inveſt with ſuch
glorious and divine priviledges, a Church to which Chriſt hath promiſed
nothing at all? Or what reaſon have we with a blind obedience to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98207:39"/>
to a Church, where it may happen, that wicked men, and Enemies
of God, may get the upper hand, and the Spirit of Chriſt bear no Rule
in it?</p>
               <p>To ſay we ought to diſtinguiſh between two kinds of Promiſes, one ſuch
as reſpect inward Sanctification, and Salvation, the other reſpecting the
perpetual Viſibility of the Miniſtry, and its Infallibility in the external pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the Truth; and that the firſt ſort are peculiar to the Elect and
true Believers in the Church, but the other belong to the whole Body of
that Society making Profeſſion; beſides that this would be to ſtart a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
of the Promiſes, which the Scripture divided not, for all made
there, are made to one and the ſame Body, to one and the ſame Church,
without diſtinction: beſides, that this would be to frame Promiſes that
never were given, ſuch as a perpetual Infallibility of the Miniſtry in the
external Profeſſion of the Truth, as we lately ſaw: Beſides this, I ſay,
it is plainly to ſuppoſe that the Church, as a Church, hath no promiſes
made her of Sanctification, and Salvation, and ſo conſequently, 'tis to
oppoſe Scripture, which makes them to her formally under the name
and title of a Church.<note place="margin">Matt. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>The Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt my Church,</hi>
ſays Chriſt.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt loved the Church,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, and gave himſelf for it,
that he might ſanctifie it, and preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, having
neither ſpot, nor wrinkle, nor any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and
without blemiſh. The Lord</hi> (ſays the Apoſtle) <hi>nouriſhes and cheriſhes the
Church;</hi> all theſe Promiſes imply Sanctification and Salvation. What
can we then with reaſon ſay to this matter? except what was ſaid upon
the foregoing Queſtion, to wit, That we ſometimes form an Idea of
the Church, by a Judgment of <hi>Charity,</hi> ſo looking upon all external
Profeſſors in general to be true Believers, and by this Judgment we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
in our Notion abundance of People who really and indeed are
not of the Church, and conſequently have no title to the Promiſes of
Jeſus Chriſt. But this Notion is rectified by a Judgment of <hi>Reflection,</hi>
Exactneſs, and Truths formed from the Idea's which Scripture and
right Reaſon give us of the true Church, reſtraining it to true Believers
only; and that the Promiſes of Scripture muſt be applyed to it in this
laſt, true, exact Notion only. Add to this, that this true Church being
intermixt with the counterfeit, is not indeed ſo diſtinctly viſible, that we
can ſay with certainly, this or that particular man is a true Believer; for
this is proper to God alone; but that it is however viſible, in a ſure, though
indiſtinct manner, which will go ſo far as to affirm, That there are
true Pelievers in ſuch an external Profeſſion: Add further, that this
Church thus viſible, becomes more or leſs ſo, according as Corruptions
and Diſorders are more or leſs predominant in their exteriour Society;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98207:40"/>
and that ſometimes it is mightily celipſed, partly through the prevalence
of worldly, ſuperſtitious, and ſuch like Perſons; partly through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of moſt true Believers; but ſtill that it never was abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible:
Add once more, that this Church now upon Earth, together
with that in Heaven, and that which ſhall ſpring up in ſucceeding Ages,
are all three that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,</hi> we profeſs to believe in our Creed:
Add, I ſay, theſe three laſt Propoſitions to the two foregoing, and ſo
you will compriſe all I have advanced hitherto; you will be furniſhed
with certain unconteſtable Principles grounded upon Scripture, upon
Reaſon, upon the Fathers, and upon experience; by the help of which
you will be able with great eaſe to throw off all thoſe difficulties uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſtarted by the Romaniſts upon this Subject. This will be further
evidenced by what I am in the next place about to ſay.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Natural and neceſſary Conſequences of the
foregoing Principles.</head>
               <p>THE firſt Conſequence, Sir, to be drawn from what I ſaid, is,
that <hi>M. de Condom</hi> hath been very unjuſt, in upbraiding us, as if
we dealt with that Article of our Creed concerning the Univerſal Church,
as the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians</hi> do with thoſe that relate to Jeſus Chriſt
and the Holy Ghoſt; which is to confeſs them with the mouth, but in
effect to reject them, by not believing them as we ought. Thoſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
evacuate the Articles concerning Jeſus Chriſt, and the Holy Ghoſt,
becauſe they allow them a Divinity, which is but a ſeeming, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
one only; and thus they rob Jeſus Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt of
their Real Eſſence. Can any man ſay we do thus by the Church? we
make it eſſentially to conſiſt in true and ſolid Faith, and Regeneration.
Is not this to make it real? what may be ſaid of ſuch as make it eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
to conſiſt in a bare outward Profeſſion? Is not this to make it no
better than a Phantome, a Shadow? Is not this to confeſs with the
mouth, but in effect to reject it? Does not this make all thoſe great and
noble Ideas given of it in Scripture dwindle into nothing? Judge you,
Sir, if you pleaſe, to which of theſe two Parties <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s reproach
is moſt applicable.</p>
               <p>II. By all I have ſaid concerning the Viſibility or Inviſibility of the
Church, you may know what an unjuſt accuſation they load us with daily,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98207:40"/>
of making the Church utterly inviſible, upon pretence that we place it
in true Believers only; for if this accuſation were true, it would fall not
upon us, but upon Scripture, upon the Fathers, and particularly upon
St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> whoſe Principles we follow intirely. But as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thought of making a Church perfectly inviſible,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note> though he ſaid,
<hi>The foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, the Lord knoweth them
that are his; and let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;</hi>
ſo neither do we pretend to ſpoil her of her Viſibility, when we ſay
the ſame thing he did. As St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> hath not made her inviſible,
though he ſaid all that was related out of him; the ſame thing muſt be
ſaid for us. But what can we think of this method of diſputing, which
ſuppoſing the charge upon tryal, to be a granted confeſt thing, falls
ſtrongly upon proving the Church's Viſibility; and ſo Proſelytes men
upon this falſe ſuppoſition, and thoſe uſeleſs Arguments? Do not you
look upon this, as a very fair way of proceeding?</p>
               <p>III. Hence likewiſe you may perceive, how unjuſtly they put that
queſtion to us, Where our Church was before the Reformation? For if
the Church conſiſt of true Believers alone, as we have ſhown, ours was
then juſt where it is now, <hi>i. e.</hi> in the common Field, where Jeſus Chriſt
hath ſown his Wheat, and the Enemy by Night his Tares. There is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a twofold difference obſervable. One, that before the Reformation,
that part of the Field where the Corn was ſown, was wider, whereas
now it is contracted into leſs room, becauſe in many places the Tares
have driven away the Wheat, and remain alone; another, that then in
the places where Wheat and Tares grew together, the Wheat was thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and got leſs nouriſhment, and the Tares quite contrary; whereas
now the Wheat is thicker, and better cultivated.</p>
               <p>The Field is the World (as Chriſt ſays) the good Corn are true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
the Tares are the Children of this World. Before the Reformation,
the true Believers were mixt with the reſt in the ſame exteriour Profeſſion,
as they are ſtill; but they were, if I may ſo ſay, ſtifled as it were with
the great number of the other ſort, and the ſpiritual life they led had
much of uneaſineſs, by reaſon of the Corruptions in the Miniſtry, which
ſtinted them in their neceſſary Food, and beſides mixt many ſuch things
with it, as were not only incapable of ſuſtaining life, but even prejudicial
to it: Whereas, ſince the Reformation theſe ſame Believers being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from the reſt, are by this means much disburdened of that which
oppreſt them; they are more at liberty, the Miniſtry allows them the
Food of heavenly life in a much larger proportion, and gives it them
more pure, and free from ſtrange mixtures; and though they ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98207:41"/>
among worldly men, yet now they do not find near ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
from them.</p>
               <p>IV. Another Inſtance of this nature is commonly given us, and how
injurious it is, you may diſcern by the Principles laid down before. They
bid us ſhew them theſe true Believers before the Reformation, ſingle
them out, ſay they, tell us their names, were they viſible or inviſible?
If even at this time, when things are not near ſo confuſed, none but God
only can know diſtinctly and infallibly, what particular men are the
true Believers; If their viſibility conſiſt only in ones being able to ſay
with certainty, there are true Believers, and not in ſaying ſuch or ſuch
are the men; is it not a very unjuſt demand to examine us of paſt Ages,
when things were ſo ſtrangely in the dark? Would not any man of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
think it enough, that we can ſhew how far ſoever the Miniſtry was
corrupted, that ſtill the true Believers might ſubſiſt under it? and is not
this very thing a viſible indication of the Churches perpetual Viſibility,
that God hath not forſaken us?</p>
               <p>V. Another neceſſary Conſequence of the Principles now eſtabliſht, is,
that in an exteriour Society carrying the name of a Church, it may ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
according to the Notion we frame of it, from a Judgment of Charity,
that the Miniſtry, Eccleſiaſtical Dignities, and Chairs, as they are term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
may come to be filled by Hypocrites, Superſtitious, Worldly, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
Perſons, and that there ſhall be a great many more ſuch as theſe
in Office, than good men. For ſeeing God only can have a diſtinct and
perſonal knowledge of true Believers, and ſince he does not beſtow theſe
Offices immediately, and by his own hand; it may without queſtion
come to paſs, that both thoſe that confer, and thoſe that take upon them
theſe Offices, may be the Tares ſown in the Lord's Field. A man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have any abſolute certainty, that this ſhall not be ſo; becauſe there
is not any promiſe to the contrary; and becauſe on the other hand, there
are inſtances that it hath been ſo already. To pretend this cannot be,
becauſe it would hinder the Churches ſubſiſting for ever, is no Argument
at all; for if the Church conſiſt properly of true Believers, as hath been
undeniably proved, the perpetual ſubſiſtence of true Believers, does not
depend on the faithfulneſs of the Miniſters, nor the untainted purity of
the Miniſtry; except we ſuppoſe the Principle of a blind Obedience to
the Miniſters, which is a falſe Principle, and deſtructive of Religion, as
hath been made appear in the defence of the Reformation.<note place="margin">Part. 1. ch. 7, 8.</note> Indeed this
ground being laid, when once the Miniſtry is corrupted, it muſt needs
follow, that the faithful are corrupted too, becauſe bound to receive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98207:41"/>
whatever is delivered to them by their Miniſtry. But reject this
principle, and there is no reaſon why the Faithful may not ſeparate the
good from the bad, and why they may not ſubſiſt under ſuch a Miniſtry,
by the help of that diſtinction which the Grace of God enables them to
make. And here, <hi>Sir,</hi> allow me to wonder a little at the pleaſant double
which the Doctors of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion make when they diſpute.
Our firſt and main queſtion is, whether we ought to acquieſce in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Trent</hi>'s Determinations? Yes, ſay they, you muſt yield an implicit
obedience to the Decrees of the Prelates aſſembled in a Body. But why
an Implicit Obedience? Becauſe (ſay they) the Church cannot ſubſiſt
without it. But why cannot it ſubſiſt without it? Cannot it ſubſiſt by
reſuming the Miniſtry out of ſuch hands, and putting it into better?
Cannot it, without going ſo far, ſubſiſt by ſeparating between good and
bad food? No; they tell you, it cannot, becauſe it is obliged to receive
implicitely whatever the Prelates in a Body ſhall deliver. What way of
diſputing call you this, if it be not quite to ſwerve from good ſenſe and
reaſon, and to be loſt in an impertinent maze? For is not this a perfect
round, firſt to prove an Implicite Obedience, becauſe the Church cannot
otherwiſe ſubſiſt; and then to prove the Church cannot otherwiſe ſubſiſt
without this Obedience, becauſe men ought to obey implicitely?</p>
               <p>VI. But let us proceed in drawing our Conſequences. And being we
hit upon the point of the Implicit Obedience they exact to the deciſions
of Biſhops, and that Sovereign and Abſolute Authority wherewith they
would inveſt them, let us try, if this can agree with the Principles we
have eſtabliſh'd. I meddle not now with thoſe other reaſons that might
be made uſe of; you will find them in part in the Book I quoted juſt now.
All I ſhall ſay is, that ſince no man can have a diſtinct knowledg of the
True Believers, and that the True Church conſiſts of ſuch alone; no
man conſequently can be ſecure, that this Body of Prelates, whether
conſidered ſingle, or whether as convened in a Council, are the true
Church. Yes, but ſays one, they repreſent the true Church. I agree with
you; ſo far as the True Believers are ſtill under their Miniſtry: But repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the True Church does not preſently endue them with its Opinions and
Affections. The true Church in conferring her Miniſtry upon men, does
not confer upon them withal, either true Faith, or true Regeneration,
much leſs perfect Infallibility. Hence, whatever determinations they give,
are ſtill ſubject to an examination. If theſe prove confermable to God's
Word, it is our duty, not only to embrace them, but further to reſpect
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Body of Miniſters, as the true Church Repreſentative; becauſe they
have expreſt her ſenſe; and Charity will carry us ſtill further, and incline
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98207:42"/>
us to eſteem them true Believers, becauſe they have acted as ſuch. But
when their diviſions are found to diſagree with God's Word, we are to
look upon them as men that have abuſed their miniſtry. If this happen in
things not plainly intereſting the Conſcience, their miniſtry muſt be born
with, and the liberty of ſeparating the clean from the unclean, natural
to every Believer, made uſe of: If they do intereſt the Conſcience,
we groan under their miniſtry, we pray to God, we implore ſuccors
from above, ſtill uſing the Liberty of Conſcience to refuſe the Evil, and
retain the Good. But if this Body of Prelates-proceed to violent taking
away this neceſſary and indiſpenſable Liberty of Conſcience, and reduce
the faithful to this hard ſtreight, either to be damned for falſe Doctrine,
in ſlaviſhly following their Miniſters errors, or damn'd for diſſimulation in
pretending to follow them; Then the true Believers ought to look upon
them as men that have ſtript themſelves of the right of the Miniſtry, to
oppoſe them, to take it from them, and repoſe the truſt in other hands.
It is evident then, the ſupreme Authority we contend about, cannot take
place, becauſe it is continually in danger of being inveſted in worldly
men, to whom it cannot in any caſe belong. And ſo we ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
in danger of miſtaking That for the Church Repreſentative,
which neither is really, nor can poſſibly be ſo.</p>
               <p>VII. The ſeventh Uſe to be made of what we have advanced, is the
right apprehending of ſome expreſſions uſed by us, <hi>viz. That the Church is
corrupted,</hi> that the <hi>ſtate of the</hi> Church <hi>hath been interrupted,</hi> and the like, ſo
as to reconcile theſe with Jeſus Chriſt's Promiſes: which import not only
the perpetual exiſtence, but alſo the perpetual holineſs and incorruption
of the Church. Now for that corruption attributed by us to the Church,
I ſay, that whereas the Promiſes of Chriſt concern the true Church, that
is, True Believers only; our expreſſion on the contrary reſpects the
Church, according to that <hi>Idea of Charity</hi> we form of it, including all
external Profeſſors, which are ordinarily call'd the Viſible Church. 'Tis
of the Church taken in this laſt notion, that we ſay, ſhe is corrupted; for
the whole Body being made up, as we have ſeen, of good and bad man,
it hath come to paſs, that the wicked are mightily increaſed, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the World, which is a ſpirit of error and ſuperſtition, ſhewed it
ſelf in an eminent manner. But we do not underſtand true Believers to be
corrupted, only ſo far forth as they may poſſibly have contracted ſome
tincture of infirmity, by converſing with the others. And for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption
of the ſtate of the Church, mentioned in our Confeſſion of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98207:42"/>
Faith, where we ſay,<note n="*" place="margin">Art 31. <hi>In the</hi> 31. <hi>Article of the Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Miniſtry in times of neceſſity, theſe words are inſerted.</hi> Quoniam interdum, ut noſtris etiam tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupto Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu, neceſſe ſuit, non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nullos eſſe qui Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae collap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae ruinas inſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</note> 
                  <hi>That the ſtate of the Church being interrupted, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
it ſhould be raiſed up again out of its ruines and deſolation:</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thoſe expreſſions is, not what <hi>M. de Condom</hi> pretends, that the true
Church ceaſes to exiſt, or that its Miniſtry was quite extinct in thoſe
times which we call times of deſolation and ruine, for we make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
between the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>ſtate of the Church.</hi> The Church is
the true Believers making profeſſion of Truth, and Chriſtian Piety, and
a real Holineſs, under a Miniſtry, which diſpenſes all nouriſhment neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for ſpiritual life, without keeping back any; Its natural and proper
ſtate is to be freed, as much as its militant condition can admit, from the
impure mixture of prophane worldly men; not to be covered over, and
as it were ſwallowed up with this Chaff and Tares; to have a pure Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
not incumbred with errors, with falſe worſhip, ſuperſtitious cuſtoms;
a Miniſtry in the hands of good men, who are in poſſeſſion of it by honeſt
methods, and ſet a good example to others. This State is what we think
hath been interrupted, having ſeen ſtrange opinions brought into Religion,
Superſtitious propagated, the Miniſtry invaded by men neither deſerving,
nor capable of it, and that were advanced by ſcandalous and unlawful
methods; having ſeen vices openly predominant among Churchmen, the
Pulpits more zealous for Tales and Legends, than the Word of God; The
Schools buſying themſelves with ridiculous Queſtions and Curioſities, the
Sacraments burdened with ſtrange Ceremonies, the inſtruction and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of mens Souls wretchedly neglected; and in a word, the Goſpel
liberty changed into a temporal ſlavery. This is what we mean by the
ſtate of the Church being interrupted; this the ruine and deſolation we
bewail. The Church hath not ceaſed to exiſt, nor did ſhe perfectly loſe
her viſibility, or her Miniſtry, God forbid: But both ſhe and her Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
have ſeen the natural ſtate they ought to continue in, changed and
interrupted.</p>
               <p>VIII. Apply theſe principles now to our Reformation, and then, <hi>Sir,</hi>
you will diſcern, that granting this ſuppoſition to be true, that the Body
of the Prelates inveſted in the miniſtry of the Church in our Fathers days,
and aſſembled in the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, ſuppoſing, I ſay, that they delivered
ſuch determinations in points of Faith, as are incompatible with Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
Granting it to be true, that they took away Chriſtian Liberty by
Anathematizing all who ſhould refuſe to believe, and ſubmit to thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
as they did; and by adding to all this violence and compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
our Fathers had reaſon to look upon them as Miniſters that had juſtly
deprived themſelves of all right to exerciſe their Miniſtry over them by
ſuch ill conduct, and to give that power of the Miniſtry to others. They
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98207:43"/>
had reaſon to look upon the party that adhered to theſe Prelates with ſuch
obſtinate ſtiffneſs as a Body or Society of which a man could not poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay, <hi>That is the particular Body wherein God nouriſhes and cheriſhes his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IX. Hence likewiſe it follows, that our Fathers are wrongfully charged
with making a Schiſm, and ſeparating from the Church. For it being
ſure, that the Church conſiſts of the Faithful only; and beſides, that we
are of opinion, the <hi>Trent</hi> Biſhops themſelves broke the band of external
Communion with ſound Believers, and brought things to ſuch a paſs,
that our Anceſtors could not poſſibly joyn with them in the ſame Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;
it is evident, They were the Beginners of the Schiſm, the Authors
and makers of this lamentable diviſion.</p>
               <p>X. It ſignifies nothing to alledg, that they were poſſeſt of the Miniſtry by
an exterior and ordinary ſucceſſion; for the Miniſtry is not ſuch a thing, as
men when once poſſeſt of, can never forfeit their right to, tho they abuſe it
never ſo much. They enjoyed it by an external ſucceſſion, 'tis confeſt; but
this ſucceſſion with reſpect to mens perſons continues no longer than we
can ſay, <hi>The faithful</hi> are under their Miniſtry. When we cannot be ſure
of that any more, from thenceforth the Prelates have loſt their right; and
ſuch a ſucceſſion afterwards, would be but as the ſucceſſion of death to a
diſeaſe, or of night to twilight. I do not ſay the Miniſtry it ſelf is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
God forbid; but I ſay in ſuch a caſe it devolves of right to that
other part of the Society where the Faithful are. The reaſon of which
Truth is this: That the Miniſters are naturally the Church Repreſentative;
And all their Authority is derived from the Body of the Faithful; When
therefore it happens that they break the band of external communion
which joyns them to thoſe Faithful, it is plain they repreſent them no
longer; and the holding their Authority over them afterwards, is a force
and uſurpation.</p>
               <p>XI. Laſtly, From the Principles we have eſtabliſhed, it appears, how
vain and ungrounded a ſcandal it is, which the Controvertiſts of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi>
Communion are continually upbraiding us with, of ſetting up a new
Church. For being the Church, according to Scripture, ſound ſenſe,
and the opinions of the Fathers, is nothing elſe but the Society of true
Believers: To have ſet up a new Church, we muſt have brought in a new
Faith, different from what Jeſus Chriſt delivered to the World. If they
can convict us of being guilty in this point, we are heartily content they
ſhould not only ſay we have formed a new Church, but that we have
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98207:43"/>
formed a falſe, perverſe, naughty Society, and draw all the conſequences
againſt us, that can be naturally drawn from that Conceſſion. But if we
on the contrary have only rejected new Doctrines, a worſhip that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion never was acquainted with; and Errors brought into the
Church ſince it was firſt eſtabliſhed; if we have only refined the Miniſtry,
and reſtored the Goſpel to its natural luſtre, they ought to be juſt in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment,
that God hath made uſe of us, for the preſervation of
his true, Ancient, Primitive Church, and the reſcuing it from oppreſſion.
If it be true, that the <hi>Trent</hi> Council have made Articles of Faith of ſuch
Doctrines and Practices as were never revealed to us by Chriſt, may we
not ſay that That hath ſet up a new Religion, and conſequently a new
Church? Let us judge of one another by this Rule of right reaſon, and
conſcientiouſly examine the truth of what hath been done on both ſides;
for upon ſuch an examination the juſtice or injuſtice of taxing us with No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty,
will depend.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Confer. p. 16.</note> They made me <hi>(ſays he)</hi> ſome Objections concerning
the frequent revolts of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had ſo often forſaken
God, the Kings, and all the people, as the Holy Scripture ſpeaks; during which,
the publick worſhip was ſo extinct, that <hi>Elijah</hi> thought himſelf the only ſervant of
God, till he learnt from God himſelf, that he had reſerved to himſelf ſeven thouſand
men which had not bowed the knee unto <hi>Baal.</hi> To this I anſwer'd <hi>(proceeds he)</hi>
that for what regarded <hi>Elijah,</hi> there was no difficulty, ſince 'twas apparent from
the very words, that it concern'd only <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where <hi>Elijah</hi> propheſied; and that
the Divine Worſhip was ſo far from being at that time extinct in <hi>Judah,</hi> that 'twas
there under the reign of <hi>Joſaphat</hi> in the greateſt luſtre it had been ſince <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s
time.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not ſay here, that the Divine Worſhip under the reign of <hi>Joſaphat,</hi>
was not in ſuch great luſtre neither, but that the Scripture informs us,
<hi>The high places were not taken away;</hi>

                  <hi>for the people offered ſtill, and burnt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
in the high places,</hi> which was a worſhip forbidden by God. But not
to inſiſt upon this, I ſay in the firſt place, This inſtance is a very good
proof, that the greateſt part of this exteriour Society, profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be the people of God, that is, ten tribes out of twelve, were
corrupted to that degree, that <hi>Elijah</hi> complain'd he only was left. Which
ſhews, that we muſt not always conclude Truth and Purity to be of that
ſide where the number is moſt; nor ſuppoſe it impoſſible, for what we
call <hi>the Viſible Church,</hi> to be corrupted, at leaſt as to the greateſt part of
Profeſſors. Secondly, I could heartily have wiſht, that <hi>M. de Condom</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:98207:45"/>
would have reflected a little upon the uſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> made of this inſtance of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s time; becauſe it is exactly the ſame with what the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Miniſters make of it now. It was objected to the Apoſtle, that from
his Principles it would follow, that God had caſt away his people, in as
much as the whole Body of that people had crucified Jeſus Chriſt, and
walked contrary to his new Religion; if therefore he would undertake to
maintain his new Religion was the Right, he muſt at the ſame time own,
that God had forſaken his Church.<note place="margin">Rom 11. 2, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>No,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>God hath not caſt away
his people, for there is a remnant through the election of Grace;</hi> and hereupon he
alledges what happened to <hi>Iſrael</hi> heretofore in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s time, when God
reſerved to himſelf Seven thouſand men in ſecret, that had not bowed the
knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> What can be more exactly parallel than the uſe he makes of
this paſſage, and that the Proteſtants make? 'Tis objected to us, that
from our Principles it follows, God hath caſt away his Church, becauſe
the whole Body of that Church condemns our Reformation, and walks
contrary to our new Religion.<note place="margin">Confer. Page 12.</note> 
                  <hi>They teach that this viſible exterior Church
may ceaſe to be upon Earth,</hi> ſays <hi>M. de Condom.</hi> No ſuch matter, ſay we,
God hath not deſerted his Church, there is a remnant according to the
Election of Grace, and in proof of this we urge the inſtance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
in <hi>Elijah</hi>'s time. If to charge the Proteſtants with unſincerity for
alledging this, were at the ſame time to charge St. <hi>Paul.</hi> If the exception
of <hi>Judah,</hi> where the worſhip in <hi>Elias</hi> his time was in great luſtre, were
good, and to be admitted againſt us, the ſame was alſo good and to be
admitted againſt the Apoſtle. For what do we more than he did? or
what do we ſay, but what we have learnt from Him ought to be ſaid in
this Caſe? Let St. <hi>Paul</hi> then acquit himſelf, and he ſhall in doing ſo, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
us. Now this is done without any difficulty, for he need only An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
that the exception does not make at all againſt him. The buſineſs
is to know, which is the true people of God, his true Church which he
never forſakes. Now it is plain by God's anſwer to <hi>Elijah,</hi> that this is
not the Croud, the vaſt Number, not the party of greateſt ſtrength, or
which makes moſt noiſe in the World, but ſome perſons reſerved, <hi>a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
according to the election of Grace,</hi> theſe are his true people, and his true
Church. Tho <hi>Judah</hi> had ſtill maintain'd the Divine Worſhip in its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
luſtre, yet does not this detract from the truth of God's declaration
made to <hi>Elias, viz.</hi> that his true people, his true Church conſiſts of this
<hi>Remnant,</hi> or theſe Perſons reſerved. This is all St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſires; this is
likewiſe all the Proteſtants deſire to make of it. <hi>Lord,</hi> ſays <hi>Elijah, they
have broken down thine Altars,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Kings 19. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſlain thy Prophets with the ſword, and I only
am left.</hi> Had God made his Church to conſiſt in an exterior Body of
men, who ſhould preſerve his worſhip in a conſtant uninterrupted purity,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98207:45"/>
what could have been more natural than to return this anſwer, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doſt thou complain, have I not ſtill my Church in <hi>Judah?</hi> The
Cardinal <hi>du Perron</hi> would have replied exactly thus, and from him it is
that <hi>M. de Condom</hi> hath borrowed this ſhift. Yet God anſwers in a very
different manner, he fixes his true Church, not in the exterior Body,
but in the Perſons he <hi>had reſerved.</hi> The Apoſtle takes the advantage of
an Argument againſt what the Jews in his time objected, and we in
like manner take the ſame advantage againſt what is objected to us
now.</p>
               <p>Afterward <hi>M. de Condom</hi> frames to himſelf an Objection drawn from
the Diſorders and horrible Corruptions predominant in <hi>Judah</hi> during
the Reign of <hi>Ahaz,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 16. and Ch. 21.</note> who ſhut up the Temple of God, and cauſed <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>
the Prieſt to ſacrifice unto Idols; and afterward under <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> whoſe
Impieties tranſcended thoſe of <hi>Ahaz.</hi> To which he anſwers, firſt, <hi>That</hi>
Iſaiah,<note place="margin">Confer. Page 16.</note> 
                  <hi>who lived during all the Reign of</hi> Ahaz, <hi>for all theſe abominations of the
King, of the Prieſt</hi> Urijah, <hi>and almoſt all the People, never ſeparated from the
Communion of</hi> Judah; <hi>which ſhews, that there is always a People of God,
from whoſe Communion 'tis never lawful to ſeparate.</hi> Laying aſide, for one
minute the buſineſs of Separation, we muſt in the mean time of neceſſity
grant, that this exterior Society, called the People of God, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly
corrupted in matters of Faith and Worſhip, that their Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was publick and general, diffuſed, not among ſome private Perſons
only, but through the whole Body of the ordinary Miniſtry. So that
the true Church, that to which the Promiſes of God belong, that which
muſt not be interrupted, nor totally fail, muſt be acknowledged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
not in the whole Body of this exterior Society, but merely in the
Body of true Believers, who it is poſſible may ſometimes be reduced to
a very inconſiderable number of this Society, and ſcarce make any Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
at all in it. We muſt likewiſe acknowledge it poſſible, for ſuch an
univerſal Corruption to happen in this Society, that there ſhall be no
longer any thing perfectly ſound and entire in it, that is, nothing in the
publick Worſhip without ſome tincture of impurity. For at the ſame
time that <hi>Ahaz</hi> Reigned in <hi>Judah,</hi> and the Corruption was general there,
<hi>Pekah</hi> was King in <hi>Iſreal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 15. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>who</hi> (ſays the Scripture) <hi>did evil in the ſight of
the Lord, and departed not from the ſins of</hi> Jeroboam <hi>who made</hi> Iſrael <hi>to ſin.</hi>
So that the publick Worſhip was then corrupted every where, as well in
<hi>Iſrael</hi> as <hi>Judah.</hi> What then became of <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s exterior Church,
which he ſays can never err in her Determinations? Where was then
that Church, <hi>which does not only maintain ſome truth, but teaches and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
all truth?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Confer. Page 16.</note> Well, but ſtill <hi>M. de Condom</hi> tells us, <hi>Iſaiah never ſeparated
from the Communion of this People, no more than did the reſt of the Prophets.</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:98207:46"/>
Now this very thing ſtrengthens our Argument, and renders it impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable;
becauſe, from hence it neceſſarily follows, that there was not in
any place of the World beſides, any publick Worſhip, nor any Exterior
Body at all, little or great, that ſerved God in perfect Purity. So
that we muſt inevitably allow one of theſe two things; Either that
the Church was at that time utterly extinct, or that it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in this Remnant, which we ſee God ſpoke of to <hi>Elijah.</hi>
The firſt of theſe deſtroys the Promiſes of God; the ſecond eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhes
our Opinion, and quite overthrows that of the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now examine how <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and the other Prophets, not ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from the Body of the People, is to be underſtood. Can we ſuppoſe
them to have been partakers of the Wickedneſſes that then prevailed in
the publick Worſhip?<note place="margin">Confer. Page 17.</note> By no means. <hi>Theſe Prophets,</hi> M. de Condom ſays,
<hi>reprehended and deteſted the impieties of the People, but ſeparated not from the
Communion.</hi> The meaning of which is, that they ſeparated negatively,
tho not poſitively; they refuſed to partake of the Impieties in the publick
Worſhip; but they did not ſet up another ſort of publick Worſhip diſtinct
by themſelves: I grant it. But then we muſt alſo grant, that when the
Worſhip is corrupted, the Church may ſubſiſt by means of ſuch a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Separation, and that this is ſufficient for its preſervation. Now this
is exactly what we are of Opinion was done, during the Corruptions of the
<hi>Latin</hi> Miniſtry all along before the Reformation. But ſtill it may be ſaid,
Theſe Prophets never proceeded ſo far as a <hi>poſitive</hi> Separation, and you
have. I anſwer, The Reaſon they never ſeparated poſitively, was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
to themſelves, as <hi>M. de Condom</hi> himſelf acknowledges, to wit, that
over and above the real and ſpiritual Covenant, God had entred into
with ſuch as were true Believers among that People; there was beſides
another Exterior and Temporal one, in which the whole Nation were
concern'd, founded upon their being the Blood and Progeny of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
and all bearing about them the Mark of this Covenant (to wit, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion)
in their Fleſh; ſo that the true Believers were obliged upon this
account to continue in Communion with the People, and could not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from them poſitively, by reaſon of that common Covenant which
they might not break. But the caſe is otherwiſe with the Chriſtian
Church, which hath but one Covenant with God, and that a real and
ſpiritual one, of true Faith, and ſincere Regeneration; when, therefore
we can no longer maintain this Covenant, by living amongſt a People,
and under a Miniſtry which is become contrary thereto, there lies a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
upon us of ſeparating by a <hi>poſitive</hi> Separation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:98207:46"/>
                  <hi>And yet</hi> M. de Condom <hi>pretends to make ſome advantage of this very
thing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Confer. Page 17.</note> 
                  <hi>He ſays,</hi> The Succeſſion of that Ancient People was kept up by carnal
Generation,—and ſo, tho the Prieſts, and almoſt all the People ſhould have preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricated,
the State of Gods People ſubſiſted always in an exterior Form, whether
they would or no.—But 'tis not ſo with the new People, whoſe exterior Form con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in nothing but the Profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt's Doctrine: So that if the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the true Faith ſhould be extinct for one only moment, the Church, which has
no Succeſſion but by the Continuance of this Profeſſion, would be wholly extinct,
without any poſſibility of ever riſing again, either in its People or Paſtors, but by a
new Miſſion.</p>
               <p>I confeſs, That carnal Generation was in that Ancient People, enough
to keep up their Succeſſion in Quality of Gods People, with Relation to
that temporal Covenant common to them all. Tho it be true too, that
this Quality was but very imperfectly diſcerned in times of general Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rications;
becauſe, if they were then Gods <hi>temporal</hi> People, they were a
vicious and prevaricating People. But, I ſay, that carnal Generation was
not enough to maintain among them a Succeſſion, with reſpect to the
ſpiritual Covenant; becauſe the Succeſſion here, could be preſerved no
other way, but by a Participation of the ſame Faith, and the ſame Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Now the Covenant in which the new People live, is not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
a carnal one, but purely and ſolely Spiritual; and conſequently, the
Succeſſion in it, can only conſiſt in this perpetual Participation of one
and the ſame Faith, and one and the ſame Charity. In this particular,
the Condition of both old and new People are alike. As therefore in that
Ancient People, there did ſtill continue a Succeſſion of Faith and Charity,
tho the publick Worſhip and ordinary Miniſtry were full of ſtrange Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions;
in like manner hath ſuch a Succeſſion always continued in the
new, even in the midſt of all Corruptions. God had then his methods
of teaching <hi>the reſerved,</hi> and keeping them from partaking in the publick
Prevarications; the ſame he hath ſtill, and uſeth to the ſame purpoſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho
the Miniſtry and publick Worſhip have not preſerved their Purity. I
confeſs, ſhould a full and perfect deſertion of Chriſtianity ever have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
throughout all the Chriſtian World, and not one true Believer be
left upon the face of the Earth, a man might ſay, the Church had been
utterly extinct. But bleſſed be God, it never came to that. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
that God hath all along preſerved his Remnant, according to the
Election of Grace. We acknowledg too, that the publick Miniſtry was
never ſo totally corrupted, but ſtill all that was neceſſary for the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of Believers, was ſo far kept up, that the ſpiritual Succeſſion was
always preſerved intire, by receiving from the Miniſters hands nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſufficient unto ſpiritual Life on the one hand, and caſting away all
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98207:47"/>
the evil and impure Mixtures of the Miniſtry on the other hand; and
this is that negative Separation we ſpoke of before. The exterior Form
of Jeſus Chriſts true Church, does not ſo abſolutely conſiſt in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries
making profeſſion of Faith pure, and void of Error, that it cannot
otherwiſe ſubſiſt any longer. I confeſs, when this is done, the Church is
in a happy Condition, and (if I may ſo ſay) a Condition of Health. But
when this is not done, the exterior Form does not preſently periſh upon
that account, becauſe this conſiſts in our being able to ſay, <hi>That is the
Body where God nouriſhes and cheriſhes his true Believers,</hi> as I have already
ſhewn when treating of my ſecond queſtion. Could we no longer ſay
thus, the Church would have loſt its external Form, and its Succeſſion
have ceaſed to be viſible. But this might at all times be ſaid, even when
the Miniſtry and publick Worſhip was moſt corrupted, and ſo the Churches
viſible Succeſſion was never quite loſt. It hath indeed been mightily leſſened
and obſcured, in Proportion to the Errors that prevailed in the Miniſtry;
and this was the Churches Condition of Miſery, it's ſick and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Condition, which nevertheleſs went not ſo far, as to hinder this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
               <p>M.<note place="margin">Confer. Page 17.</note> de Condom <hi>goes on.</hi> I will not ſay the true Faith, and true Worſhip
of God, could be wholly aboliſht in the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo as that God had no
more any true Servants on Earth. But I find on the contrary, 'tis clear, that
maugre the Corruption, God ſtill reſerved to himſelf a ſufficient number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
who participated not in the Idolarty. <hi>Herein we agree; for neither do
we ſay, That the true Faith, and true Worſhip could ever have been
wholly aboliſht among Chriſtians; but on the contrary, that maugre
the Corruption, God hath always reſerved to himſelf a ſufficient number
of Servants, who have not participated in the Prevarications of the reſt. So
far the caſe is the ſame.</hi> 'Tis not to be imagined, <hi>proceeds he,</hi> that Gods
Servants, and the true Faith, were preſerved only in ſecret; but that in all the
Succeſſion of the Ancient People,<note place="margin">Confer. Page 17, 18.</note> the true Doctrine always ſhone forth. For there
was a continual Succeſſion of Prophets, who inſtead of adhering to the Peoples
Errors, or diſſembling them, roſe up againſt them with force; and this Succeſſion
was ſo conſtant,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 15.</note> that the Holy Ghoſt fears not to ſay, That God roſe up
Night and Morning,<note place="margin">Jer. 11. 7. xxv. 3, 4.</note> and daily admoniſht the People by the Mouth of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. de Condom</hi> muſt give us leave to make ſome Obſervations upon this
Paſſage. The firſt of which is, that in the Corruptions of <hi>Iſrael</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when the publick Worſhip, and ordinary Miniſtry, ſuffered ſuch
Depravation, there was not any where in the World another publick
Worſhip, or another Miniſtry, that was preſerved in Purity and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
So that if men muſt needs have lookt for the Church in the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98207:47"/>
Body of the Peoples living under their ordinary Paſtors, and in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
worſhip (as he is of opinion we now muſt under the Goſpel) there
could not have been any longer a Church upon Earth; becauſe his own
Principle maintains that,<note place="margin">Confer. Page 12.</note> 
                  <hi>if this viſible and exteriour Church compoſed of Paſtors
and People, do not keep and teach all truth,</hi> (that is, if She teach any thing that
is falſe) <hi>She is not the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I obſerve, ſecondly, That in the very ſame place, where God is ſaid to
riſe up Night and Morning, and daily admoniſh the People by the Mouth
of his Prophets; it is alſo ſaid, That <hi>all the chief of the Prieſts, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
treſpaſſed wonderfully,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 14, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>according to all the Abominations of the Heathen, and
polluted the Houſe of the Lord, which he had ſanctified in</hi> Jeruſalem. It is ſaid
further too, <hi>That they mocked the Meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his Words,
and miſuſed his Prophets.</hi> Which ſhews that both People and Prieſts were
generally corrupted, and the Church reduced to a Remnant. I confeſs,
ſome certain Perſons of this Remnant did not keep ſilence; but inſtead
of adhering to, or diſſembling the Peoples Errors, oppoſed them ſtrongly.
But beſides, that a great many more, no queſtion, ſighed in ſecret
for theſe things; it is manifeſt, that this Remnant did not make a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Body by themſelves, nor exerciſe any publick Worſhip different from
the reſt. And conſequently the Churches viſibility, tho not wholly extinct,
yet was mightily darkned and diminiſhed, and that is all we would infer
from hence.</p>
               <p>My third Obſervation is, That there was indeed, in that Ancient Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
a continued Succeſſion of Prophets; and as <hi>M. de Condom</hi> ſays, a
<hi>Prophetical Miniſtry ordinary with the People,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Confer. Page 19.</note> 
                  <hi>where the Prophets made an Order
always ſubſiſting, whence God continually drew Divine Men, by whoſe Mouth he
ſpake loudly and publickly to all his People.</hi> But then we muſt ſay withal,
that the Body of this Order of Prophets were every whit as corrupt, as
the Prieſts and People. This cannot be denied, for the Scripture affirms
it expreſly.<note place="margin">Jer. 2. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The Prieſts ſaid not, where is the Lord; and they that ſhould Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
the Law knew me not; the Paſtors alſo offended againſt me, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
propheſied in</hi> Baal.<note place="margin">Jer. 5. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The Prophets proheſie lies, and the Prieſts bear rule by
their means, and my People love to have it ſo. I have heard what the Prophets
ſaid,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 23. 25, 26, 27.</note> 
                  <hi>that Propheſie lies in my Name, ſaying, I have dreamed. How long ſhall
this be in the hearts of the Prophets, that Propheſie lies? Yea, they are Prophets
of the deceit of their own heart. Which think to cauſe my People to forget my
Name by their Dreams, which they tell every Man to his Neighbour, as their
Fathers have forgotten my Name for</hi> Baal. And a vaſt number of Paſſages
to the like purpoſe. So that we cannot ſay, there was at that time any
viſible Body that oppoſed the Corruptions, or maintained the Worſhip
of God in its genuine Purity. The Prophets, by whom God ſpoke ſo
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98207:48"/>
loudly and publickly, were only lookt upon as private Perſons, of an
Opinion different from the generality of the Society. And therefore,
how loudly and publickly ſoever they ſpoke, if in order to the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting
a Viſible Church, it be neceſſary to find a Body or Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Men, making Profeſſion of pure Doctrine, <hi>M. de Condom</hi> muſt
acknowledg, that there was not then any Viſible Church in the World.</p>
               <p>And now, <hi>Sir,</hi> give me leave, I beſeech you, to ask, with what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to Reaſon men can ſtill cavil at this inſtance of the Corruptions
in <hi>Iſrael</hi> heretofore, and not own it for a ſenſible Proof, that confirms
moſt of the Truths eſtabliſhed in the former part of this Letter. In it
you ſee the ſeveral Bodies that made up the ordinary Miniſtry, all of them
enſnared in Idolatry, and falſe Worſhip. In it you ſee the whole Body of
the People blindly following the exorbitancies of their Guides. In it you
ſee the true Church of God ſubſiſting, not in an exterior Society, enjoying
its Miniſters, Aſſemblies, and publick Worſhip peculiar to its ſelf; but in
ſome <hi>reſerved</hi> Perſons, that ſtill maintained their Integrity in the midſt of all
theſe Confuſions. In it you ſee God himſelf, and after him, St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
making his true People to conſiſt in theſe Perſons ſo <hi>reſerved.</hi> All this
proves, and proclaims to the World, That the true Church conſiſts of
true Believers only; That this Church is not otherwiſe viſible, but as
mixt with wicked Men and Reprobates; That this mixture does ſometimes
ſo obſcure it, that it is very difficult to come to a knowledg of it; That it
does nevertheleſs ſtill ſubſiſt even in that ſtate of obſcurity; And, that in
theſe true Believers, and <hi>Perſons whom God has reſerved,</hi> he does fulfil the
Promiſes of Perpetuity made to the Church.</p>
               <p>I cloſe this Letter with ſincere Proteſtations, That it is much to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction, that I find my ſelf obliged to put Pen to paper, in a Diſpute
againſt <hi>M. de Condom.</hi> I have all along had, and ever ſhall have, not only
all the Reſpect for him, which is due to his Quality and Station; but more
eſpecially, I eſteem his Virtue ſo univerſally acknowedged, and admire
his Perfections, and the excellent Gifts God hath imparted to him, as they
really deſerve. In our Conference, I obſerved in him, a Wit lively and
piercing, a clear Apprehenſion, a proper and eaſy way of Expreſſion; and
eſpecially, an extraordinary Candour and Civility of Behaviour. He
maintain'd his Principles with all the ſtrength and advantage imaginable,
made them look as fair and ſpecious, as it was poſſible for any man, and
managed them with abundance of Skill and Addreſs. In a word, I was
ſtrangely taken with the Accompliſhments of his Perſon, and did often feel
ſuch kind Inclinations and Wiſhes, as Men ſhould do upon ſuch Occaſions.
My Sentiments of Honour and Reſpect for him are ſincere, but the more
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98207:48"/>
they are ſo, the more frequent I muſt complain of one thing, inſerted by
him in his Diſcourſe with <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Confer. Page 15.</note> and that is, <hi>That in our
Religion we believe, there is a point of time when a Chriſtian is obliged to doubt
whether the Scripture was inſpired by God, whether the Goſpel is a Truth, or
a Fable; whether Jeſus Chriſt was a Deceiver, or a Teacher of the Truth.</hi>
This Diſcourſe, I confeſs, was by no means agreeable to the Character
of his Temper; and I was amazed to find that a Prelate, who deſires
to be thought a man of Equity towards us, could entertain ſuch an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of us. In which of our Books hath he met with ſuch an abominable
Doctrine? I know indeed, this is a conſequence he pretends to deduce
from our Principles; but I ſhall venture to ſay, His conſequence can never
be made out with ſuch evidence, as may allow him peremtorily to affirm,
without any other warrant for it, <hi>That in our Religion we believe there is a
point of time when a Chriſtian is obliged to doubt whether the Scripture was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
by God; whether the Goſpel is a Truth, or a Fable; whether Jeſus Chriſt
was a Deceiver, or a Teacher of the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he ſhall think fit to conſult us upon this Point, we ſhall declare
to him with one Conſent, that we do not only not believe this Propoſition,
but that we have a perfect Abhorrence of it; and whenever he ſhall pleaſe
to let us know how he underſtands this to be deduced from our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
we ſhall make it appear to him, that he is under a great miſtake, and
that the quite contrary muſt be inferred from them.</p>

ANSWER
TO
M. de MEA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>X's BOOK.
ENTITULED,
A Conference with Mr. CLAUDE.</head>
            <head type="sub">A Relation of what paſt in the Conference held by the Biſhop of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Preceptor to the Dauphin; and Monſieur Claude, the firſt of
March, 1678. At the Counteſs of Roye's Houſe, the Counteſſes of
Lorge, and Roye, Mademoiſelle de Duras, the Marqueſs of Mire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,
Mademoiſelle de Roucy, and Mr. Cotton, being there
preſent.</head>
            <p>SOME Days before this Conference, Mademoiſelle de <hi>Duras</hi>
going to viſit Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> let him know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhe was under
ſome ſcruples upon the account of her Religion, and took out
of her pocket a Paper lately put into her hands, in which
were contained ſome Paſſages out of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> concerning
the Euchariſt: To which Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> replyed, and then by other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of the ſame Father, demonſtrated to her, that his opinion as to
this particular, was directly the ſame that is taught at <hi>Charenton:</hi>
And thereupon ſhe ſeemed to be well ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>The next Day after Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſeeing her at the Counteſs of <hi>Roye</hi>'s,
ſhe after a long Diſcourſe told him, that ſhe was mighty deſirous he
would admit of a Conference with ſome Doctor of the Romiſh Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98207:50"/>
at a time when ſhe might be by. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> returned, that this
was not uſual; that ſuch Conferences might be of very ill conſequence,
and that ſhe could not but be ſenſible that the preſent Circumſtances
of the Reformed in <hi>France,</hi> and eſpecially at <hi>Paris,</hi> required they
ſhould behave themſelves with much prudence and caution. But (ſays
ſhe) how would you behave your ſelf if you ſhould light upon one of
theſe Gentlemen accidentally, and be put upon matters of Religion?
You would not deſert your Cauſe? I would in ſuch a caſe, ſays
Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> decline entering into Diſputes as much as I could; but if
I were conſtrained to it, I would give an account of my Faith; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch ſudden occaſions we are not uſed to run away. But Madam
(proceeded he) what reaſon is there for asking me this? We are not
going about any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>Two Days after the Counteſs of <hi>Roye</hi> told Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
there were ſome pains taken to procure a meeting that ſhould
ſeem accidental between him and <hi>M. de Condom,</hi> and ſhe thought it
convenient to give him this notice. Were I deſirous to meet any man
(ſaid he) I had rather it ſhould be <hi>M. de Condom</hi> than another, becauſe
he is a Perſon of Wiſdom, Honour, and Judgment, and one for
whom I have a particular Reſpect and Eſteem; but in regard of the
Publick Capacity I am in, methinks this buſineſs deſerves ſome Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.
A little while after he imparted it to two of his Friends,
and all three together paying a Viſit to a Perſon of Quality of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Merit and great Prudence, it was generally agreed, that
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s beſt way was to decline this meeting with <hi>M. de Condom.</hi>
The Reaſons alledged were theſe, That it was already known Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoiſelle
de <hi>Duras</hi> was perfectly diſpoſed to alter her Religion; that
in all probability ſhe deſired a Conference only for the greater Pomp
and formality of the thing, and to make uſe of this as a pretence;
that let the iſſue be what it would, ſhe would moſt certainly go over,
and pretend it had not given her ſatisfaction, and that this would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be a piece of the next publick News.</p>
            <p>The Perſon of Quality whoſe advice was asked, undertook to Viſit
the Counteſs of <hi>Roye,</hi> and make her ſenſible of theſe Reaſons. She
indeed ſhewed her ſelf apprehenſive of them, and eaſily ſaw their
ſtrength and drift. But all that could be done was too weak to bring
Mademoiſelle de <hi>Duras</hi> off from her firſt Deſign. The Lady com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
extremely of her being deſerted, and that this was the very
thing ſhe had often been upbraided with, that the Reformed Miniſters
durſt not ſhew their heads before the Catholick Doctors. By this, and the
addition of Tears too, ſhe endeavoured all manner of ways to move
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98207:50"/>
her Siſter, ſolemnly proteſting, that, did but People know what a
world of good this would do her, they could not certainly deny her
ſo great an act of Charity.</p>
            <p>This engaged the Counteſs of <hi>Roye</hi> to concern her ſelf for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about a meeting between <hi>Monſieur de Condom</hi> and Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> and
ſhe did it ſo very well, that Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> found himſelf under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of conſenting to it, that ſo he might not expoſe himſelf to the
inſolence of thoſe of a different perſwaſion. She aſſured him <hi>M. de
Condom</hi> deſired this meeting ſhould ſeem merely by chance, that the
World ſhould not be acquainted with it, and that they ſhould not
make it their buſineſs to talk of it on one ſide nor other.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the firſt day of <hi>March,</hi> about two in the Afternoon,
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> went all alone to the Counteſs of <hi>Roye</hi>'s, and a little after
came in the Mareſchall de <hi>Lorge,</hi> Mademoiſelle de <hi>Duras,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
of <hi>Miremont,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton.</hi> About a quarter of an hour after,
came in <hi>M. de Condom</hi> by himſelf.</p>
            <p>When the firſt Complements were paid, and the Company had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
their Seats, <hi>M. de Condom</hi> directed himſelf to Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> and told
him, That he had for ſome time longed to ſee him to offer ſome things
which were practiſed by men of his Religion, but ſuch as he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
to be directly contrary to their Principles. That theſe conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
firſt in an Article of their Diſcipline, which injoyns, that in caſe any
difference ariſe in points of Doctrine, the Queſtion ſhall be decided in
the Conſiſtory, and by the Word of God: If they do not aquieſce in
the Judgment of this Court, it ſhall be referred to a Provincial Synod,
and from thence to a National Synod, <hi>where a full and final reſolution
of the caſe ſhall be given by the Word of God; and ſuch as refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to this, ſhall be excommunicated.</hi> Secondly, he produced a formu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary
of a Letter Miſſive to the National Synods, framed in the Synod of
<hi>Vitre,</hi> and which was to be a pattern for all the Provinces to follow
for the future, by which they promiſe <hi>ſubmiſſion to all the reſolutions
of that holy Aſſembly, to obey and execute every particular of them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perſwaded</hi> (ſays the Formulary) <hi>that God will preſide there, and
lead you into all truth and equity by his Holy Spirit, and by the Rule of his
Word,</hi> Beſides that, he produced an Act of the National Synod held
at <hi>Charenton</hi> in the Year 1644. where the Independents opinion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
who will not allow that particular Congregations ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the Authority of Colloquies and Synods, but that every
one ſhould be governed by Laws within it ſelf. Now this Act expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declares, that that Sect <hi>opens a door to all manner of irregularities
and extravagances, that it deprives men of all means of remedying diſorders,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98207:51"/>
and would, if admitted, make as many ſeveral Religions, as Pariſhes.</hi>
Laſtly, he produced an Act of the National Synod at <hi>Sainte-foy,</hi> by
which, upon occaſion of ſome overtures for a re-union with thoſe of
the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confeſſion, the Synod aſſigns Deputies to go and confer
with them; to whom full power is granted, to agree upon, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
whatever points ſhould be debated, whether in matters of
Doctrine, or any other thing that might concern the Good and Peace
of all the Churches, even ſo far as to conſent, that their Deciſions
ſhould be inſerted in their Confeſſions of Faith. From all which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
That even thoſe of Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s Religion, did acknowledg a
neceſſity, that in order to the preſervation of Unity in the Church, men
ſhould ſubmit their Judgments, and pay an entire and abſolute obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies, without leaving themſelves at liberty
to examine their determinations, or judg whether they were agreeable
to the Word of God or no; and that upon refuſal of this Obedience, it
was juſt to proceed to Excommunication. That this was exactly what
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have, and that ſhe deſired no more; But
that we nevertheleſs in our diſputes with her, advance a quite contrary
Principle. He therefore entreated from Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> a diſtinct anſwer to
this Point, and would quietly hear what he could ſay to it. Adding
moreover, that Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ought to be the more ready to reply upon
this ſubject, becauſe no new thing was propoſed to him, the ſame Acts,
and the ſame conſequences that he now deduced from them, being to
be found in his Expoſition of the Catholick Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> firſt of all replied, That although his coming thither was
not with intentions to hold a Conference ſtrictly, and by rule, yet he
was extreamly glad that he had now an opportunity given him, of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying
to <hi>M. de Condom</hi> how much he eſteemed his perſon; and that
having no particular worth of his own, he thought it a great honour,
that a Prelate of <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s Character ſhould ſingle him out, to
engage in Controverſy with him. That he would endeavour to give
him ſatisfaction in each of the points now propounded to him; and
that, if in the following part of the Diſcourſe any expreſſion ſhould
eſcape from him which might be offenſive to <hi>M. de Condom,</hi> he proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before-hand, that it ſhould be much againſt his will and deſign.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>M. de Condom</hi> replied in very civil and obliging terms; and
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> then reſuming the diſcourſe, told him; That in general,
whatever he had alledged juſt before, did by no means infer ſuch a
blind and entire ſubmiſſion to the determinations of Eccleſiaſtical Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to impoſe; That we muſt
diſtinguiſh between two ſorts of Authorities, the one ſupream and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98207:51"/>
the other limited and depending; to the former we owe a full
and perfect obedience; to the other a conditional one only. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>M. de Condom</hi> was ſenſible, is by the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> attributed to God
alone, ſpeaking to us in the Holy Scriptures; and that the ſecond was
it they allowed the Paſtors of the Church, conſidered either ſingle and
by themſelves, or met together in a Synod or Council. That their
Authority, being only Miniſterial, is reſtrained two ways; one is,
That they muſt frame their deciſions, not of their own heads, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their own fancies, but according to the Word of God; the other,
That they muſt always allow the perſons under their Juriſdiction the
priviledg of examining thoſe deciſions, that ſo they may know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be really agreeable to God's Word: Whence it follows, that
the obedience due to them ever goes upon this condition, that they
have not ſwerved from the Word of God; That the Authority of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
and Aſſemblies compoſed of ſuch, cannot extend further, than
that of our Parliaments in the State of <hi>France,</hi> who are not empowered
to alter old Laws, and enact new ones; and whom we are priviledged,
nay, obliged to diſobey, ſo oft as their Injunctions are prejudicial to
the King's Service, and the Allegiance we owe him: That the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Church-Aſſembles can at moſt be, but as that of Fathers over
Children, becauſe both God and Nature have inveſted Fathers with it;
The Fathers have a right to Act in their Childrens names, becauſe they
have a right of Educating and Commanding them; and the Scripture
frequently enjoyns to Children, a readineſs to learn, and obedience to
their Fathers; yet does it not follow from hence, that Children are not
priviledged and obliged to examine their Fathers Inſtructions and
Commands, whether they be true or falſe, juſt or unjuſt, and what
ſhall appear to be falſe and unjuſt, that to reject. That nevertheleſs
the Authority of Paſtors and their Aſſemblies, is really very great, as is
likewiſe that of Parliaments and Fathers, notwithſtanding their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
are under ſome limitations. That the Paſtors are as publick
Truſtees for the keeping God's Word, appointed to ſtudy, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
upon it continually, thence to deduce neceſſary truths for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
improvement, and to ſave private men a labour, which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
always attend to, becauſe diverted and perplexed by the buſineſs
of the World. That ſo long as the Paſtors diſcharged this Duty well,
the people were obliged to obey and ſubmit to their words; but when
they deviated from it, they were to be looked upon as falſe and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous
perſons.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he came particularly to thoſe Acts <hi>M. de Condom</hi> had
urged, and told him; That the Clauſe of Submiſſion contain'd in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98207:52"/>
Letters Miſſive to National Synods, muſt be underſtood according to
this Principle, and under theſe Limitations, becauſe grounded upon
this Suppoſal, That all things would be managed there according to
God's Word. For thoſe expreſſions, <hi>Being perſwaded, that God will
preſide among you, and lead you into all Truth by his Holy Spirit, and by the
rule of his Word,</hi> do imply a perſwaſion of Charity and Equity; for
we ought always to preſume the beſt of ſuch Aſſemblies, and hope that
God will preſide over them, and that they will acquit themſelves of
their duty, till experience ſhews the contrary: But all this does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
ſo entire a ſubmiſſion, as for a Man to deprive himſelf of all right to
examine their Reſolutions. As to that Act which condemns the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents,
it is (ſaid he) extreamly Juſt. For tho Aſſemblies do not
arrive at an Infallibility, yet are not they preſently to be utterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.
'Tis a human Order indeed, but yet ſuch an Order as God
himſelf hath ſettled for the preſervation of his Church, and to deſert it
therefore is criminal. And yet we do not think it follows from hence,
that the determinations of the Aſſemblies exact a blind and implicit
Obedience; nor that the Synod of <hi>Charenton</hi> intended any ſuch thing.
And then for the Synod at <hi>Saintefoy</hi>'s deputing four perſons to confer
with thoſe of the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confeſſion, and the full power given them,
you can make no advantage of it. For thoſe Deputies were in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Ambaſſadors, who are ſent by the King with full Commiſſion to
offer Propoſals, hold Treaties, and agree upon Concluſions; or as
Plenipotentiaries ſent to negotiate a Peace. Let their power be never
ſo full, or call them Plenipotentiaries as long as you pleaſe, ſtill this
condition is conſtantly and naturally underſtood, that they do nothing
againſt the intereſt of the perſons that commiſſioned them, and to theſe
their Acts muſt of neceſſity return, for the obtaining their approbation
and ratification, without which their Treatings would ſignify nothing at
all. And this was the meaning of that full power conferr'd by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
upon their Deputies, to hear thoſe of the Confeſſion of <hi>Ausburg,</hi>
to hearken to their Propoſals, their Complaints, their Offers, and in
return to make others to them; to receive from them Explications of
difficulties in Controverſy, and to give them back theirs; nay, to
come to an agreement with them if they could, yet not ſo, as either to
become abſolute Maſters of their Faith, or blindly receive whatever
they ſhould agree upon. For in all affairs of this kind, there is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
implied, a Clauſe of recurring to the Judgment of the perſons
Commiſſioning, and a neceſſity of their ratifying them. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>
added beſides, this Conſideration. Suppoſe the true ſenſe of an Act of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> were called in Queſtion, (a Canon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98207:52"/>
of <hi>Trent</hi> for inſtance) <hi>M. de Condom</hi> would think it more reaſonable,
that the ſence ſhould be taken from him than Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> becauſe the
Queſtion is put concerning the ſenſe of a Church that <hi>M. de Condom</hi> is a
Member of, and therefore in all probability he muſt underſtand it
better than one of another Church. Therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, I expect
the ſame Juſtice from you, in taking the ſenſe of theſe Acts now in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
from me, provided the ſenſe I put upon them do not diſagree with
the Doctors of my Communion, or be not manifeſtly falſe, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
to the reſt of our Principles. Now if the ſenſe I put upon theſe
Acts be not any of theſe, you have not, in my opinion, any right to
refuſe it, or to frame to your ſelf any other different from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. de Condom</hi> replied, ſaying, that he would begin where Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>
left off, becauſe that what he had urged juſt before, carried ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Truth, and made a quick impreſſion upon the mind, but
had not really any thing of ſolid Argument in it. That, were the
matter in hand any Explication of their particular Rites and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
in Preaching the Word, and Adminiſtring the Sacraments, what
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſaid might be allowed for Truth, and in that point he
would believe him, as a perſon better acquainted with the matter; Nay,
that he did not go about to debar him the liberty of explaining the ſenſe
of thoſe that compiled the Diſcipline and the forementioned Acts after
his own way; That he was ſenſible they denied an entire ſubmiſſion to
the Church, and ſuch as precludes all Examination; But this he would
ſay, that the very men who denied this abſolute ſubmiſſion in Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
were forced to own and eſtabliſh it in their practice. That ſo
they contradicted themſelves, and that this was the thing he pretended
to prove, and in which he was by no means bound to believe Mr. <hi>Claude.</hi>
For if the matter in hand now, were to demonſtrate any Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the opinions of the Catholick Church, he would not deſire that
His Explications might be thought of Authority ſufficient, nor deny
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> the freedom of making what inferences he thought fit from
the Council's own words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. de Condom</hi> ſtopping there, Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> replied, That, ſince it was
evident, that the perſons who made thoſe Acts, denied any ſubmiſſion
was due to the determinations of Church-Aſſemblies, without any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
at all, the advantage was thus far at leaſt on his ſide, that
<hi>M. de Condom</hi> himſelf had acknowledged, His Explanation of thoſe Acts
was agreeable with the Principles of the Proteſtants which made them,
ſo that there was more reaſon for his accepting that ſenſe, than for the
framing to himſelf another, and ſuch a one as contradicted theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
That, ſuppoſing the buſineſs in Controverſy to be an Act of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98207:53"/>
               <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, he ſhould not ſcruple to admit <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
provided the words of the Act did not oppoſe it, and in that
caſe he might be allowed to infer a Contradiction. That if <hi>M. de
Condom</hi> would proceed thus, as to the Acts before urged, he ſhould be
glad to ſee what grounds he had for this pretended Contradiction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. de Condom</hi> ſaid, this would eaſily be made appear. That he
would ſhow this Contradiction with relation to their Diſcipline, which
on one ſide ordains, That differences in Doctrine ſhould be decided in
the Conſiſtory by the Word of God; that it was alſo her meaning, that
this deciſion was made by the Word of God in the Provincial Synod, as
well as the National; and yet on the other ſide, if men do not acquieſce
in the determination of a Conſiſtory, or a Provincial Synod, it orders,
things ſhould continue as they were till a National one be convened; <hi>in
which it ſays, a full and final reſolution ſhall be given by the Word of God,
and if they ſubmit not to this, they ſhall be cut off from the Church.</hi> Whence
it is evident, that the ſubmiſſion required to a National Synod, was
not founded on the Word of God, conſidered abſtractedly as ſuch,
becauſe both Conſiſtory and Provincial Synod were ſuppoſed to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
by the Word of God, and yet an Appeal from them was allow'd;
But that it was founded on the Word of God, ſo far forth, as That was
explained and interpreted by the laſt judgment of the Church; that is,
becauſe this is the laſt and final reſolution; and conſequently upon the
Authority of the Aſſembly, conſidered by it ſelf. Now this, ſaid he,
evidently contradicts that Principle, which denies there is an abſolute
ſubmiſſion due to the ſentence of the Church. Of this the Diſcipline it
ſelf was a confirmation, in that it appointed no Excommunication for
ſuch as ſtood out againſt the determinations of a Conſiſtory and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Synod, and yet did, for ſuch as refuſed to ſubmit to the decrees
of a National one.</p>
            <p>The ſame (proceeded he) is plain from that Letter Miſſive to the
National Synod. For how can men promiſe and ſwear ſubmiſſion to
whatever ſhould be agreed upon, and yet not ſuppoſe a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Submiſſion owing to the Church? To urge, this Submiſſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
from a perſwaſion, that God will preſide in it by his Spirit, and
his Word; and to ſwear upon this account, is to urge, that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
is grounded upon God's expreſs Promiſe, to direct his Church
in her laſt determination, by his Holy Spirit, and after an Infallible
manner. This very thing, ſaid he, is plain from the National Synod
of <hi>Charenton</hi>'s Act againſt the Independents. The Reaſon they make

to the deciſions of Synods; ſince allowing private perſons to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the laſt determinations, there might ſpring not only as many
ſeveral Religions as Pariſhes, but as many as there are perſons, and
conſequently no means would be left for preſerving the unity either of
the Faith, or of the Church.</p>
            <p>For what relates to the Deputies nominated by the Synod of <hi>Sainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foy,</hi>
to go and confer with thoſe of the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confeſſion; he ſaid, he
did ſincerely acknowledg, that the Synod, tho it gave them never ſo
large a commiſſion, did not however intend it ſhould ever be in their
power to ſubvert all, and if I may ſo ſay, to turn things topſy turvy;
That he believed the Synods meaning was really, that whatever was
done by the Deputies ſhould be referred to them, and that there is a
neceſſity all things of this nature ſhould be ratified. But ſtill it was
very amazing, and a thing which Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> had not anſwered to, that
they ſhould proffer to inſert their Deputies concluſions with the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi>
in their publick Confeſſions of Faith. For this argued them
doubting as to their Confeſſion of Faith, which yet, they tell us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
nothing but the pure Word of God, and in that there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that requires a change, &amp;c. Do you think Sir ſaid he, that the
Articles of your Confeſſion of Faith may be changed?</p>
            <p>When <hi>M. de Condom</hi> had left off ſpeaking, Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſaid, he would
anſwer to each particular of his diſcourſe, and intreated he would
pleaſe to hear him quietly. And firſt of all he ſaid, That <hi>M. de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
put a wrong conſtruction upon that Article of the Diſcipline, which
declares, that if men do not acquieſce in the deciſions of a Conſiſtory,
nor thoſe of a Provincial Synod, <hi>Things ſhall continue in the ſame poſture,
till a National one be convened, in which a full and final reſolution ſhall be
given by the Word of God; and they who refuſe to acquieſce in This, ſhall be
cut off from the Church.</hi> For the reaſon of This, ſaid he, is not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that there ought not to be the ſame care taken, that the Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
or Provincial Synods determinations ſhould be made by the word
of God, as well as thoſe of the National; nor that this Word hath not
as much Authority at one time as another, whether declared in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory,
or Provincial Synod, or a National one; nor that a full and
perfect obedience is not due to this only, preciſely conſidered as ſuch:
But this method of proceeding (added he) was conſtituted for two
reaſons, very different from what you pretend. Firſt, becauſe it is
highly probable, that the ſearch made into Gods Word concerning the
matter in controverſy, may be leſs exact and ſagacious in a Conſiſtory,
than it would in a Synod compoſed of all the Miniſters in a whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
and ſo again by the ſame reaſon, leſs exact and ſagacious in a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98207:54"/>
Provincial Synod, than in a National, which is uſually made up of all
the moſt ingenious and learned men in the Kingdom. The other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, That men may poſſibly be prepoſſeſt againſt a Conſiſtory, ſo as
not to hearken to it ſo readily and impartially as they ſhould; which is
not ſo likely in reſpect of a Provincial Synod, which will be thought leſs
apt to be ſway'd by intereſt, paſſions or perſonal prejudices, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
they will be more quietly heard; Laſtly, theſe kind of paſſions
and private Intereſts being ſtill leſs likely to happen in a National Synod,
conſiſting of perſons living remote from one another, and coming from
all quarters of the Kingdom, 'tis very probable men will not be prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
againſt them, and conſequently, that they will receive the Word of
God at their mouths, that they will be more ready to learn, and better
diſpoſed to obey them. He ſaid therefore, that this method was taken
for the avoiding as much as was poſſible two inconveniences; one was to
prevent the laſt determinations being given lightly, inconſiderately, or
with any mixture of humane paſſion and Intereſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The other, that the
parties concerned might not be hindred by any perſonal prejudices,
from hearing and receiving the Word of God, with that obedience and
faithful ſubmiſſion which is owing to it. But it could by no means be
infer'd from hence, that, according to the meaning and intention of
the Diſcipline, it was not always God's Word, as ſuch, but the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Aſſembly, to which that Obedience muſt be paid. And
moreover, that the deciſion of a National Synod, was for this reaſon
called, <hi>the laſt and final deciſion,</hi> becauſe according to humane methods,
and the preſent courſe of things, there is nothing beyond it, to which
we can have recourſe.</p>
            <p>As for the Letter of Miſſion to the National Synods, he replied, that
did not infer an abſolute ſubmiſſion, any more than the Act of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
did, becauſe there was in it the expreſs condition of Judging ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Word of God, in theſe words, <hi>Being perſwaded, as we
are, that God will pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſide over you, by his Holy Spirit, and his Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Reaſon which the Synod of <hi>Charenton</hi> urged againſt the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents,</hi>
this, he ſaid, did not at all imply a blind and implicit obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
That the dependence which particular Churches have upon
Colloquies and Synods was an external Order, which, tho it had not
any ſure and infallible means of preſerving the Church in the unity of
the Faith, was however of mighty convenience and uſe towards the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it: And we ought always to take it for granted, that God's Bleſſing
will go along with it, as being an order conſtituted by himſelf. That
the <hi>Independents</hi> by throwing off this Order, do deprive themſelves of
theſe means, and wilfully expoſe themſelves to the great inconvenience
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98207:54"/>
of having as many ſeveral Religions as Pariſhes; ſo that the Synod had
good grounds for upbraiding them with it, as they did. That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
principles were not liable to the ſame objection, who though
they diſown a blind obedience, and entire ſubmiſſion, do yet retain ſuch
external means as are moſt proper and expedient, for preſerving the
unity of the Faith. And whereas <hi>M. de Condom</hi> pretended, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
entire obedience, it was poſſible, that as many ſeveral Religions
might ſtart up as there are Pariſhes; 'tis confeſt, this may come to paſs,
if we ſpeak with reſpect to men only, notwithſtanding the Order and
Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies be kept up, becauſe the mind of man is of its
ſelf ſubject to infinite Errors. But in reſpect of God, this cannot fall out
ſo, for he, by his bleſſing on this external Order, and the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of one and the ſame ſpirit to his true Believers and Elect, does
by this ſure and infallible means preſerve them in the unity of the ſame
Faith, and conſequently of the ſame Church. That Faith being not
an humane, but a Divine thing, none but God alone can either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce,
or preſerve it in mens hearts. And this he infallibly does in the
hearts of his Elect, by his Spirit, and ſuch external means of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
as himſelf hath appointed;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 36.</note> 
               <hi>For Paul planteth, and Apollo watereth,
but God giveth the increaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next he came to ſpeak of the Deputies nominated by the Synod of
<hi>Sainte-foy,</hi> to confer with the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> and ſaid, That he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
pleaſed, with what M. <hi>de Condom</hi> had confeſt even now, <hi>That
they never intended to give them a power of turning all things topſy turvey,</hi>
as he had ingeniouſly expreſt it; but that recourſe muſt be had to the
perſons commiſſioning, and their ratification obtained. That he very
humbly thankt him for this ſincere acknowledgment, which, as to this
particular, reſolved the whole Queſtion, ſo that this Act could not now
be alledged any more, for the blind obedience pretended to be infer'd
from it. That beſides this, his accuſation againſt the Synod, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
to change their Confeſſion of Faith, if taken in M. <hi>de Condom</hi>'s
ſenſe, vaniſhed into nothing: For there ought a diſtinction to be made,
between what is eſſential in it, and what is not. The eſſential part of the
Confeſſion conſiſts in the things themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> called Articles, or points of
Faith; and that which is not eſſential conſiſts in the terms and modes of
expreſſion. That the Synod had Authority to conſent, that the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in the Confeſſion ſhould be altered, that other things might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
which might illuſtrate and explain it, if this appeared to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
for the reducing men that had deviated from it: But the Synod
never took upon them to alter any eſſential part of the Confeſſion, for it
continues in this reſpect unalterable, ſo far forth as it is agreable to the
Word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:98207:55"/>
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> concluding his diſcourſe, <hi>M. de Condom</hi> replied in the firſt
place, that, notwithſtanding what Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſaid a little before, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Order obſerved by the Diſcipline, it did however enjoyn, that
ſuch as refuſed to acquieſce in the deciſions of a National Synod, ſhould
be cut off from the Church; and that the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> had actually
cut off the <hi>Arminians;</hi> he deſired therefore to know of Mr <hi>Claude</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were juſtly and lawfully cut off. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> anſwered, that
in his opinion the Synod of <hi>Dorts</hi> proceedings were very juſt. <hi>M. de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
told him. This was all the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> deſired; that ſhe alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
her ſelf under an Obligation to judg according to the word
of God, but this was not the matter in diſpute. The main buſineſs
was about the Senſe and Explanation of that word, and that it was
the Churches Province to give this Explanation, and private men's to reſt
ſatified with it; and if they did not, the Church dealt juſtly in excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating
them. That it was thus the Proteſtants had been excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
in the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As concerning the Letter of Miſſion to the National Synods, is it not
(ſaid he) a plain trick to ſwear Submiſſion to them upon ſuppoſal or
condition, that their Determinations ſhall be agreeable to Gods word?
This is all mere trifling. What ſay you to it, Sir? Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſaid, there
was no trick at all, and he could diſcover nothing that was irregular in
it. If I have a right notion of your Doctrine, replied <hi>M. de Condom,</hi>
you hold, that a private Perſons may doubt of the Judgment of the
Church, even when given in its laſt and higheſt Court of Juriſdiction.
We do hold, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> that no man can have an abſolute certainty
of Faith, that an Eccleſiaſtical Aſſembly ſhall give right Determinations,
and upon this account that men may be allow'd to doubt. But withal,
that men ſhould notwithſtanding, preſume in favour of ſuch an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and in this reſpect we cannot properly call it doubting, as hoping,
and believing that it will judg a right. For Jeſus Chriſt hath promiſed,
all that ſeek ſhall find,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.</note> and we ought to take it for granted, that they
will diſcharge their duty in ſeeking aright, till Experience ſhews the
contrary. There is therefore, an aſſurance of Charity and Equity,
that in ſome Senſe excludes doubt. But when we ſee Aſſemblies go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by Factions, Cabals, and temporal Intereſts, then ſure we have
a great deal of reaſon to doubt; as ſeeing men that have forſaken their
Duty, and conſequently are ſuch, as cannot hope for any advantage
from the bleſſing of God upon them. Let me beg of you Sir, ſaid <hi>M.
de Condom</hi> then, That we may let alone what is good for nothing, but
to caſt duſt in our Eyes. What you ſaid juſt now of Cabals and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and private Intereſts, is of no uſe in the World, and only
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98207:55"/>
ſerves to perplex the matter. I would know of you, put the caſe there
appeared nothing at all of Factions, Cabals, nor Intereſt in an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
but that all their proceedings were orderly, and regular; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
its Deciſions ought to be received without examining them? No
Sir, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude.</hi> Why then Sir, ſaid he, I was in the right,
to tell you that all your talk of Factions and Cabals ſignifies
nothing. That does not follow neither (repli'd Mr. <hi>Claude)</hi> for
notwithſtanding there appear not any thing to weaken a mans Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions,
that the Aſſembly will diſcharge their duty faithfully; and
that for ought we can diſcover to the contrary, all things are carried
regularly; yet, ſtill this is no more than a humane Preſumption, not
able to give any certainty of belief, and conſequently not precluding
our Examination. But when we ſee Diſorder and Corruption manifeſtly
prevail in an Aſſembly, we can no longer preſume in favour of ſuch a
one, and inſtead of hoping the beſt, we muſt fear the worſt that can
come from it. So that it is not without ground, that I ſpoke of Cabals
and Factions. Here <hi>M. de Condom</hi> reſuming the former method of his
Diſcourſe, ſaid, It was falſe that the Independents did abſolutely
throw off all Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies; for they themſelves held one,
he ſaid, at <hi>London</hi> in the year 1653. ſo that the Synod of <hi>Charenton</hi>
could not condemn them upon that account; but merely for refuſing
to acknowledg that an entire Dependence and Submiſſion was owing to
Synods.</p>
            <p>As for the Synod of <hi>Sainte-foy,</hi> proceeded he, if all the buſineſs had
been no more than illuſtrating and explaining their Articles, as
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> would have it, what need theſe have been inſerted in the
Confeſſion of Faith? Could not this be done by an Act of a Synod
without altering the Confeſſion? It is ſure their deſign was to expreſs
that Article concerning the Lord's Supper in ſuch ambiguous terms as
both ſides had agreed upon, and each might interpret to his own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
which hath been an expedient often attempted, but to no
purpoſe. Now this is in reality, not barely to explain and illuſtrate the
Confeſſion of Faith, and by that means ſettle a mutual Toleration, but
down right to alter it. And now (added he) all that men have to
do is but to conſider with themſelves what opinion they ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
of a Confeſſion of Faith, which a whole National Synod con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to alter. That the matter between Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> and him, was
at laſt come to ſuch a paſs, that the truth muſt preſently appear on
one ſide or other. That the Principle aſſerted by Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> was a
Principle of Pride and intolerable Preſumption. For is not this the
very extremity of Pride, that mere ſingle private Perſons ſhould fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98207:56"/>
themſelves wiſer and better able to underſtand the Scripture than
a whole Eccleſiaſtical Aſſembly, a whole Council put together? And
yet this was the unavoidable conſequence of his opinion, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
private Perſons a Priviledge and Freedom to examine the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Councils. That an entire ſubmiſſion to the Church's judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a full and implicite Obedience to that, was much more
reaſonable, and argued more of Chriſtian Humility, than mens
taking upon them to amend its Deciſions.</p>
            <p>It being now Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s turn to ſpeak, he told them, That their
Diſcipline did indeed order ſuch as refuſed ſubmiſſion, to be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
after the laſt and final reſolution had been given according
to the Word of God in a National Synod Aſſembled: But it was no
part of the Diſcipline's meaning that this ſubmiſſion was due to the
Authority of that Aſſembly abſtractedly and as ſuch; but, as he had
before obſerved, to the Authority of Gods Word, according to which
the Aſſemblies deciſion was to be formed, and this ever implies an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.
The Excommunication therefore was juſt only upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
that the Word of God had been followed, and never elſe. That
the Excommunications pronounced by Councils had not really any
thing of Juſtice or Efficacy, except when their determinations were
founded on God's Word; and when they were not ſo, their ſentences
of Excommunication were unjuſt, and returned directly upon the
head of thoſe that thundered them out, according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime,
<hi>If we,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>or an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you
than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed.</hi> That,
if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretended to no more than this, our diſpute
with her would be at an end; becauſe then every man would ſtill be
priviledged, nay, obliged to examine whether the Deciſions be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to God's Word or no; and conſequently whether the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications
upon them be juſt or unjuſt. That it was with this temper of
mind that the Synod of <hi>Dort</hi> had condemned, not the men whoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
they never anathematiz'd at all, but their Errors, by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
they were contrary to expreſs Texts of Scripture. That for his
own part, he lookt upon that as a very juſt Excommunication, but
the reaſon why he did ſo, was, that he ſaw it was founded upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and not upon the Authority of the Aſſembly themſelves.</p>
            <p>That it was true the Independents had once an extraordinary Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
in the Year 1653. for the adjuſting their Confeſſion of Faith;
but however they did commonly diſavow the uſe of Colloquies and
Synods; and for this very reaſon the Synod of <hi>Charenton</hi> condemned
them, and not for refuſing a blind and abſolute Obedience to what
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98207:56"/>
the Aſſemblies ſhould decree in matters of Faith, as by the Act it ſelf
is abundantly evident.</p>
            <p>For the Synod of <hi>Sainte-Foy,</hi> I cannot imagine (ſaid he) why you
will needs have it to intend an alteration in the Confeſſion of Faith,
I mean as to any eſſential part of it; for National Synods are not at
all impowered to do this, and if that at <hi>Sainte-Foy</hi> had ever attempted
it, all the Proteſtants in the Kingdom would have diſclaimed the thing.
I own they had power to put illuſtrations and explanations into an
Act, and you muſt own too, that they had the ſame power to put
them into the Confeſſion; and when the ſame thing is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done different ways, men are free to make choice of that which
they eſteem the moſt fitting and convenient. Here <hi>M. de Condom</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting
Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> told him, it was certain that Synod had thoughts
of couching the Article of the Lord's Supper in ambiguous expreſſions,
and this was the deſign of the Mediators. That there was mentioned a
power to decide all points of Doctrine, which had a manifeſt relation
to the Real Preſence, as held by the <hi>Lutherans.</hi> Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> replyed,
that to tax the Synod with a deſign of agreeing upon ambiguous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
was a mere conjecture of <hi>M. de Condom,</hi> for which he offered
not the leaſt proof; and that he for his part gueſſed the quite contrary;
that he did not at all queſtion but the Synod intended to do all that could
be done for reducing the <hi>Lutherans</hi> to a full knowledge of the truth;
and this was the meaning of that power given them to decide all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinal
Points with them, that is, to do it by the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Then reſuming the method of his Diſcourſe, he made anſwer to
what <hi>M. de Condom</hi> alledged, that it was intolerable Pride for mere
ſingle private Perſons to fancy themſelves wiſer and better able to
underſtand Scripture than a whole Eccleſiaſtical Aſſembly together.
He told him then, that ſingle and private Perſons ought by no means to
think ſo highly of themſelves, as to fancy they were wiſer and better
able to underſtand Scripture than a whole Aſſembly together. That
on the contrary, they ſhould preſume favourably of an Aſſembly,
and retain a diſpoſition to be taught by it. But ſtill this was no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that they ſhould not continually have their Eyes open to
diſcern whether an Aſſembly had really diſcharged their duty: imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating

               </gap> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Judgment of Charity and Humility, we muſt think
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98207:57"/>
the beſt of an Aſſembly, nay even of a private Doctor; but in as much as
both Aſſemblies, and private perſons, are liable to miſtakes, a man muſt not
carry on this Judgment of Charity and Humility ſo far as that he ſhould
ſuffer himſelf to be blinded by it; and when an Aſſembly or Doctor
have really erred, not to ſee it; for this would be to ſtretch things
beyond their due bounds. For inſtance, ſaid he, in the capacity I am
in over my Flock, it is mens duty to preſume favourably of me, that
I underſtand the meaning of Scripture better than plain private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
but for all that, they are by no means bound to think me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
nor fancy it impoſſible I ſhould ever be miſtaken in a point of
Doctrine; and in ſuch a caſe a plain private Perſon is priviledged to
think he could underſtand the Scripture better than I. Private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
ſays <hi>Al de Condom,</hi> are not at all concerned in our Diſpute, all
the World knows private Doctors may err, and conſequently they can
have no title to an abſolute obedience. The Controverſie is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole Body of an Eccleſiaſtical Aſſembly, and I expect from
you a clear diſtinct anſwer to this particular; whether you believe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
private men can underſtand the meaning of Scripture better than
the whole Body of the Church convened in a Council.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> replied, That he only mentioned private Doctors as an
Argument that Chriſtian Humility ſhould not be abuſed, nor made a
pretence for men to deny themſelves the benefit of their own Eyes,
that ſo they might avoid Pride and Preſumption. For, if by <hi>M. de
Condom</hi>'s own Confeſſion, private Doctors have no right to an abſolute
Obedience, it is neither a proud, nor preſumptuous Imagination, that it
may poſſibly happen, we ſhould underſtand Scripture ſometimes better
than they; tho for the main we are bound to preſume in favour of them,
and that in probability it will be otherwiſe. The caſe is the ſame with
Aſſemblies; for even theſe, being not Infallible, ought not to challenge
an abſolute Submiſſion, and ſuch as God alone hath a juſt right to. That
no leſs a Perſon than St.<hi>Paul</hi> hath declared,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 24.</note> 
               <hi>That he had no Dominion
over the</hi> Corinthians <hi>Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. de Condom</hi> ſaid, that quotation was impertinent, and deſired to
know of Mr <hi>Claude,</hi> whether he was not of opinion, that an abſolute
obedience was due to St. <hi>Paul.</hi> The abſolute obedience (replied Mr.
<hi>Claude)</hi> which was due to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> was ſo to his Divine Doctrines, and
not his perſon. No more, ſaid <hi>M de Condom,</hi> do we pretend, that men
ought to pay this obedience to the perſons of men whereof the
Councils conſiſt, but to the Holy Ghoſt, by which they are guided, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

of Councils, as he did in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine, and that of
the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Council, then ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> this Obedience muſt be
paid, never elſe. And this appearance of the Holy Ghoſt conſiſteth in
the Councils deciſions, being framed according to the Word of God.
Still <hi>M. de Condom</hi> urged. that the diſpute was not concerning the
Word of God, but the true meaning of that Word. That diſtinction,
ſays Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> ſignifies nothing at all, becauſe the true meaning
of the Word of God, and the Word it ſelf, are but one and the ſame
thing.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>M. de Condom</hi> returned to the buſineſs of the <hi>Independents,</hi> and
urged, that according to Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s principle, there was no remedy
for the avoiding <hi>Independency,</hi> nor any prevention, that there ſhould
not be as many different Religions as Pariſhes, nay, as many as there
be ſingle perſons. That the <hi>Independents</hi> did not caſt off Aſſemblies,
ſo far as concerned inſtruction, only they did not allow them in any
Authoritative deciſions, and that in this the Pretended Reformed
agreed with them. He beat upon this over and over again for a long
time together, to all which Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> return'd the ſame anſwer he had
done before, <hi>viz.</hi> That there was not indeed any humane means of
Certainty and Infallibility, which could prevent the exorbitant errors
of mens minds; but there was a certain and infallible Divine one, even
the Holy Spirit of God, imparted to his True Believers; That Synods
and other Aſſemblies, were means of mighty uſe, and very proper for
this purpoſe, and the <hi>Independents</hi> condemnation was for rejecting theſe
laſt, and not for refuſing to Aſſemblies a full and Abſoute Power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
matters in Controverſy. That although the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did
not allow ſuch Aſſemblies a ſupreme and unbounded Authority, yet
they did allow them as much, as the Miniſters and Diſpenſers of God's
Word are capable of.</p>
            <p>At this rate, ſaid <hi>M. de Condom</hi> then, we ſhall never have done diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
I ask you therefore once more, <hi>Sir,</hi> whether you believe that
ſingle and private perſons can underſtand the meaning of God's Word,
better than the whole Church convened in Council? Mr <hi>Claude</hi> told
him, he had anſwered that Queſtion already, to wit, that it does not
uſually fall out ſo; and that further, 'tis our duty to hope the beſt of
an Eccleſiaſtical Aſſembly; but ſtill it might come to paſs, that through
the prevalency of mens paſſions, and worldly Intereſts, the deciſions
of ſuch Aſſemblies might be contrary to Truth. You muſt not run
back thus to Intereſts and Paſſions, ſaid <hi>M. de Condom,</hi> but anſwer my
queſtion in one word, by ſaying either Yes, or No. Mens Paſſions,
and worldly Intereſts, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> are premiſed here with a great
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98207:58"/>
deal of Reaſon, becauſe theſe are the main things that occaſion errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
determinations; but ſince you are not willing to hear of them,
my anſwer muſt be with this diſtinction, That God does not ſuffer it
commonly ſo to be, but abſolutely ſpeaking, it is poſſible it ſhould be ſo,
<hi>M. de Condom</hi> ſaid, that was as much as he deſired, and that
it was the moſt abſurd thing in the World, to believe it ſo much as
<hi>poſſible,</hi> for a ſingle Man, and a private perſon, to underſtand the
meaning of Scripture better than the whole Church met together in
Council.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> replied, that he was amazed to hear <hi>M. de Condom</hi> cry
out upon That as ſuch a mighty abſurdity, which reſulted merely
from the freedom uſed by God in diſpenſing his Grace. That ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Controverſy to concern ſuch means of knowledg as are purely
humane. it would indeed be abſurd to ſay, that a ſingle and private
perſon ſhould be wiſer than a whole Aſſembly, and that this would be
then a principle of pride and preſumption. But the matter now treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of is,<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 8.</note> the illumination of the Holy Spirit, which <hi>bloweth where it
liſteth,</hi> and God can give it to a private ſingle perſon, and yet not give
it to a whole Aſſembly. That of this there was an eminent inſtance
in our Saviours time,<note place="margin">Matt. 11. 215.</note> as he himſelf ſaid, <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord
of Heaven and Earth, for that thou haſt bid theſe things from the wiſe and
prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes.</hi> That the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Church had in their Aſſemblies declared Jeſus Chriſt a Deceiver. That
nevertheleſs this was not only a Church, but the one ſole Church in
the World at that time, inveſted with the Authority of God, who had
founded, nouriſht, and brought it up till that time. That God had
taught it by his Prophets, and depeſited his Holy Oracles there. That
this Church laid a juſt claim to a ſucceſſion of Two thouſand years
continuance, and valued her ſelf upon it. That ſhe held formal ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Aſſemblies, and ſuch as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf acknowledged. <hi>They
ſit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matt. 23. 2, 3.</note> ſays he, <hi>in Meſes ſeat, All therefore whatſoever they bid you obſerve,
that obſerve and do.</hi> And yet this very Church determin'd the greateſt
and moſt heinous Error that ever could be in the World, even that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt was to be rejected as a wicked man and a Deceiver. That
we cannot avoid affirming that at that time ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gle and private perſons
might underſtand the Scripture better than the whole Body of the
Church met together; and that in allowing <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s Principle
to be true, <hi>viz.</hi> That men ought to yield an abſolute obedience to the
deciſions of Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies, without taking upon them a right
to examine what is ſo decided; we do condemn Jeſus Chriſt, and as
many as then believed in him. For according to this principle, Jeſus
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98207:58"/>
Chriſt ought not any more to have taught the people publickly, after
the Church had paſt ſuch deciſions againſt him, nor ought the people
to have given him their attention any more, becauſe they were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to examine thoſe deciſions. And yet, proceeded he, Jeſus Chriſt
did not forbear Preaching to the people, and converting many of them;
nor did they withdraw their attention, not withſtanding all the deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
given againſt him. This principle then of a blind and implicit
obedience, is conſequently falſe, and contrary to the conduct of Jeſus
Chriſt and his Diſciples.</p>
            <p>To preclude this Argument, by urging that Jeſus Chriſt wrought
ſuch miracles as did evidence his Authority to be Divine, is here of
no ſignificancy at all.<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2</note> For there are two ſorts of Miracles, the one
true, the other falſe; the one, that <hi>men may believe a lye,</hi> the other
to convince them of the truth. This diſtinction was made by God
himſelf in the 13th Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> where he tells the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
That if a Prophet give them a ſign or a wonder, and would perſwade
them to go after other Gods. They muſt not hearken unto him, for the Lord
their God proveth them.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt alſo hath himſelf owned the truth
of this diſtinction. Now, ſaid he, if <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s principle had
taken place, the people had nothing to do to make this diſtinction, after
once the Church had determined that Jeſus Chriſt wrought his Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
by the help of <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and not by the Power of God. They
muſt not any more, according to <hi>M. de Condom,</hi> ſo much as open
their eyes to ſee theſe Miracles, or ſuffer the leaſt impreſſion to be
made upon themſelves by them. And by conſequence this principle
is falſe, and deſtructive of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>Hereupon <hi>M. de Condom</hi> interrupted Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> telling him, that
this Inſtance of the Jewiſh Church ought not to have been produced
in the preſent caſe. For, ſaid he, the Synagogue was to fall, thus
the Prophets had foretold, and therefore the people ought not then
to pay ſuch an obedience to their Guides, as is now owing to the
Church of Chriſt, which muſt never fail: To which Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd,
That ſeeing the Synagogue was to fall, it might conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſo fall out, that ſingle and private perſons ſhould underſtand the
meaning of Scripture better than the whole body of a Church met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in its ſolemn Aſſemblies, which was the very point in debate;
and from hence it follows clearly, that it was neither pride, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
for private people, either to believe it poſſible for them at
ſome time to underſtand Scripture better than the whole Body of an
Aſſembly; nor upon this principle to take their deciſions into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.
And that this was all he deſired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:98207:59"/>
Beſides, ſaid he, This Reaſon could have no manner of influence
upon the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe the Synagogue were not only not agreed
upon it, but quite contrary, aſſerting that it ſhould never fail, they
produced in their own behalf ſeveral promiſes, which, at firſt bluſh,
ſeemed to have a great deal of ſtrength. 'Tis but loſt labour to urge
in defence of this, the Prophets who foretold its fall; for the meaning
of thoſe Propheſies was the thing then in queſtion, and the Synagogue
having explained theſe in a ſenſe that made for them, according to
<hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s principle, it was the people's duty to ſtick cloſe to that
explanation, without examining it at all. In a word (ſaid he) this
fall of the Synagogue, does not make their Aſſemblies differ at all
from thoſe of the Chriſtian Church, with relation to the matter now
in diſpute between us. For what Promiſes ſoever the Church of Jeſus
Chriſt may have, that ſhe ſhall ſubſiſt for ever, there is not any thing
in Scripture gives us aſſurance, that the Aſſemblies of Councils ſhall
never fail.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>M. de Condom</hi> took up the Diſcourſe, and ſaid, That Mr. <hi>Claude</hi>'s
Argument concerning the time of the Synagogues fall, was the moſt
impertinent thing in the World. For at that time it could not be
ſaid that there was any viſible Authority upon Earth, to which men
were neceſſarily obliged to ſubmit; becauſe Jeſus Chriſt himſelf was
there, that is, the very Truth appearing viſibly among men, to whom
God had given teſtimony from Heaven, and who wrought Miracles.
Do but you, proceeded he, bring again Jeſus Chriſt Teaching,
Preaching, doing Miracles among us, and we ſhall have no further
occaſion for the Churches Authority. My Argument, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi>
was not only the moſt pertinent to our preſent purpoſe, but the cleareſt
and moſt concluding Argument in the World; and I hope you your
ſelf will grant it to be ſo, after I have entreated you to conſider, that
the viſible Authority of the Son of God was the very point in diſpute
between the Synagogue and Jeſus Chriſt, and that this very point the
Synagogue had determined in the negative; That the main buſineſs
was to know, whether Jeſus Chriſt were a Deceiver or not, whether
his Miracles proceeded from God or Beelzebub. That Jeſus Chriſt's
viſible Authority could not decide that queſtion in the peoples minds;
for no Authority can decide a doubt till it be firſt received; and
Jeſus Chriſt's Authority was not as yet received, for the main contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
then depending was, whether it ſhould be received, or reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
So that there remained only the Authority of the Church, and
this had determined againſt him. According then to <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s
Principles, private perſons ought conſequently to have ſtuck to that,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98207:59"/>
and rejected Jeſus Chriſt. M. <hi>de Condom</hi> called this Argument of Mr.
<hi>Claude's</hi> a Jewiſh Argument. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> returned, that this ought
not to be called a Jewiſh Argument, becauſe it concluded in favour
of Chriſtianity; but the contrary principle rather deſerved this
name, becauſe it favoured the Cauſe and proceedings of the
Jews.</p>
            <p>Afterwards Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſaid, That if he would have recourſe to
Hiſtory, it will be no difficult matter to demonſtrate, that many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
have fallen into Error, and been miſtaken in their Determinations.
Particularly among others, the Council of <hi>Arimini,</hi> which condemned
the Conſubſtantiality of the Son, that is, his Eternal Divinity. <hi>M. de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
cried out, Whether are you carrying us now, Sir? To the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Arimini?</hi> When ſhall we have done, if all thoſe Hiſtories muſt
be diſcuſt? Do not you know that the Council of <hi>Arimini</hi> was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
packt Aſſembly? You urge my very argument for me, ſaid Mr.
<hi>Claude,</hi> which is, that a General Council may be packt. Here is an
inſtance of one, conſiſting of four hundred B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſhops that was ſo. <hi>M de
Condom</hi> anſwered, That thoſe Biſhops were compelled by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
Authority, who had ſent Soldiers among them; but afterwards,
when they were every one returned home, they diſclaimed what had
been done, and expreſt their remorſe for it. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> replied, That
many of them, it was true, did acknowledg they had done amiſs; but
that very acknowledgment of, and repentance for a Fault, which <hi>M.
de Condom</hi> affirms they ſhewed, is a Confirmation of their committing
it; and 'tis of no great moment to know, upon what motives they
committed it, ſince it is plain, that it was really committed. And
further, every particular man's returning from his Error, is a plain
Indication, that each of them thought himſelf under no Obligation of
acquieſcing in what had been determined, when they were all met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in Council.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. de Condom</hi> cried out, That there was no neceſſity of medling
with all theſe Hiſtorical Points, and that it would divert them too
much from the main buſineſs. There is, ſays he, an eaſier way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding
the matter. The Subject of our Controverſy, is the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Faith in particular Perſons. This in your Opinion is the Holy
Scripture; in ours, the Churches Authority. Put the caſe in a young
Child, who hath been baptized, but hath not yet read the Scripture;
I would know by what Principle this Child believes the Scripture to
be Divine; Particularly the Book of <hi>Canticles</hi> for inſtance, which hath
not a word of God in it. Now this Child who is a Chriſtian, who
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98207:60"/>
hath received the Holy Ghoſt, and Faith conveyed into him by
Baptiſm, and who is a member of the Church, does either doubt
of the Scriptures Divine Authority, or he does not; If he does
not doubt, then he believes it Divine upon the Churches Authority,
which is the firſt Authority he lives under. If he does doubt, then
a man may be a Chriſtian, and yet doubt whether the Scripture be
true.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> returned, That he could ſay ſomething to that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
of <hi>M. de Condom,</hi> That every baptized Child receives the Holy
Ghoſt; but was unwilling to ſtay upon a thing by the by, or deviate
from the main matter in diſpute. He would therefore ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
with making a few Reflections upon what <hi>M. de Condom</hi> urged
laſt. The firſt ſaid he, is, That the firſt knowledg of the Catholick
Church given by the Holy Spirit to this Child, is in all probability
given by his Creed, where he finds <hi>I believe the Holy Catholick Church.</hi>
And yet in the Creed, that Article is placed after ſeveral other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Doctrine. For it begins with <hi>God the Father Almighty,</hi> goes
on with the <hi>Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and after theſe
comes in the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Now this is a manifeſt proof, that
the belief of Doctrines is not wholly derived from the Churches Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
for elſe the Creed ought to be put together after another
method, and the firſt thing ſaid, ſhould be, <hi>I believe the Catholick
Church,</hi> and <hi>by the Catholick Church, I believe in God the Father,</hi> and ſo
on.</p>
            <p>My ſecond Reflection, ſaid he, is, That you ought not to take it
for granted, as you do, that the firſt Authority a Child begins to live
under, is that of the Catholick Church. It being manifeſt, That the
firſt Authority a Child lives under, is his Father or Mother, or if you
pleaſe his Nurſes; and that the Churches cannot take place till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
but does in ſome meaſure depend upon the other. The
Conſequence whereof is, That the firſt Authority, which is the
Paternal, can as well lead the Child to Scripture, as it can to the
Church.</p>
            <p>Then, Thirdly, ſaid he, It is the eaſieſt thing in the World to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort
your own Argument back upon your ſelf, thus; The baptized
Child either doubts of the Churches Authority, or he does not; if he
does not, then he believes it upon the Authority of Scripture, for
there is no other way for him to believe it with a Divine Faith: And
conſequently, it is not the Church that induces men to believe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but Scripture that induces the belief of the Church, which is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98207:60"/>
the thing we contend for. If he does doubt, then there is a Chriſtian
that hath received the Holy Spirit, and Faith conveyed to him by
Baptiſm, and is a Member of the Church, and yet is in a ſtate of doubt
which is that firſt Authority whereupon all the reſt of his Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.
Now that the Child cannot with a Divine Faith believe the
Churches Authority any other way, but by the Authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
I prove thus. If it be not by Scripture that he believes the
Church and its Authority; then 'tis either by way of immediate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,
and Enthuſiaſm, or by his Fathers, or Mothers, or Nurſes
Authority, or by Argument taken from the very nature of the Church.
This could not be by Enthuſiaſm, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt does not
proceed in ſuch a method. Nor by his Fathers, or Mothers or Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
Authority, for you diſcern the inconveniences of advancing ſuch
kinds of Authority for the firſt Principle of Faith. Nor can it be by
proper Proofs and Arguments taken from the nature of the Church;
becauſe as you in your Argument ſuppoſe the Child not yet to have
read the Scripture; ſo do I likewiſe in mine, ſuppoſe him not to have
conſidered the nature of the Catholick Church, and to know no more
of it, than barely the Name. It remains therefore, that the Child
either believes the Catholick Church by the Scripture, which you
will not grant; or that he does not believe it at all, but doubts
of it; and ſo you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>all into the ſame inconvenience as to the
Church, which you labour to reduce me to, with relation to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid very truly, That upon this Pinch a man might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s Wit was not in the condition it uſed to be, and that
his natnral freedom of Argument and Repartee, plainly ſlagg'd. He
put himſelf upon maintaining that the firſt Authority the Child lived
under, was that of the Church, and not his Fathers or Mothers.
Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> returned, That this was a thing too evident to be denied,
that the Fathers and Mothers, and thoſe who take the firſt pains about
educating the Child. is the firſt Authority with reſpect to Religion,
and that he muſt at firſt of all learn from them, that there is ſuch
a thing as a Catholick Church, into which he muſt enter himſelf, or
ſuch a thing as the Scripture, which was from God and to which he
muſt yield Obedience. That being upon enquiry by what mean the
Child can come to believe the Catholick Churches Authority, there
is a neceſſity for fixing, either upon Inſpiration, or the Paternal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
or the Scriptures, which informed him concerning it. <hi>M. de
Condom</hi> anſwered, That the Childs Faith in the Churches Authority
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98207:61"/>
was a Divine Faith, becauſe it was the Holy Ghoſt that wrought it in
him. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> replied, That the queſtion was not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the efficient Cauſe, which produced this Faith in the Child,
but concerning the Motive or Argument, by which it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
If <hi>M. de Condom</hi>'s meaning were, that the Holy Ghoſt
wrought Faith in this Child, without any Argument or Motive at
all, this were a ſort of Enthuſiaſm, and the Holy Ghoſt does not
Influence People at that rate. <hi>M. de Condom</hi> ſaid, there were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Motives of Credibility. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> returned hereupon, That
if he would allow the Child ſo much time, as to examine thoſe
Motives of Credibility for the Authority of the Church, and perceive
their ſtrength, He himſelf would in like manner allow the ſame Child
time to examine the Motives of Credibility for the Authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and perceive the ſtrength of them; but in this caſe he muſt forego
his Argument, which proceeds upon a Suppoſition, that the Child ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet read the Scripture.</p>
            <p>But, is not this true, ſaid <hi>M. de Condom,</hi> That in theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
the Child either does or does not doubt of the Scriptures
being Divine? And is it not as true, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> That in theſe
Circumſtances, the Child either does, or does not doubt of the
Churches Authority? For if you take the Child before he have read
the Scripture, I will look upon him too, before he knows what
Motives of Credebility there are for the Churches Authority. It
is your part to anſwer my Argument, and the very ſame anſwer
you give, will ſerve me againſt yours. But do you, as you think
fit; I however will not ſcruple to give a direct anſwer to your
way of reaſoning. The Child then may be lookt upon with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
as to three ſeveral times; either, before his Father have
ever ſhewed him the Bible, and informed him that this Book
came from God, or after his Father have told him thus much, but
before he himſelf have read it; or laſtly, after that he hath read the
Book himſelf. As to the firſt of theſe times, which is that your
Argument looks upon him in, it cannot well be ſaid, that then he
either does or does not doubt, for neither the one, nor the other is
ſtrictly true, according to your meaning. Not to doubt of any thing,
ſignifies to be well aſſured of it. Now, before a man can be ſaid, to
doubt, or to be well aſſured that any thing is ſo, or ſo; he muſt
firſt have ſome knowledge of the thing it ſelf. I can neither doubt
nor be aſſured, that ſuch a Perſon is King of <hi>Spain,</hi> unleſs I firſt have
ſome knowledg of the Perſon. So that your reaſoning is by no
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98207:61"/>
means good, that a Child either does, or does not doubt of the
Scripture's being Divine: For there is a medium between theſe two, to
wit, ſuch as conſiſts in a ſtate called, <hi>An Ignorance of pure negation.</hi> He
knows not as yet what the Scripture is, nor hath ever heard talk of it.
To doubt, or not doubt whether Scripture be Divine, a Man muſt have
ſome knowledg, and form ſome Idea of the thing: But the Child can
never form any Idea of a Book he never heard once mentioned. At
the ſecond point of time, when his Father hath ſhowed him the <hi>Bible,</hi>
and told him, that Book is the Word of God, but the Child hath not
yet read it himſelf; he believes it to be the Word of God, but this he
does, not by a Divine, but humane Faith, becauſe his Father hath told
him ſo: And this is the caſe of a <hi>Catechumen.</hi> At the third point of
time, when he is ſuppoſed to have read the Book himſelf, and felt the
virtue and efficacy of it, he believes it to be God's World, but this he
does not now by a humane Faith, becauſe his Father told him ſo, but
by a Divine Faith, becauſe he hath found the Divinity and Efficacy of it
upon himſelf; and this is the condition of a Believer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. de Condom</hi> laid hold of the word <hi>Catechumen,</hi> and ſaid, that
this was a Chriſtian, one already Baptized, and actually admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Covenant with God. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> anſwered, that by the word <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumen</hi>
he meant nothing elſe but a Child after Baptiſm, at the time
of his being inſtructed in the firſt Rudiments of Religion. <hi>M. de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
beat again upon almoſt the ſame things that had been ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
conſtantly affirming it to be the Churches Authority, that the
Child received the Scriptures as Divine; and that having received
them as ſuch from the Church, he did afterwards receive the meaning
and interpretation of them from thence alſo.</p>
            <p>Pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> tell me, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> then, when a Child learns at
firſt of all, that there is a Catholick Church, Is it barely a general Idea,
which conſiſts in knowing only that there is ſuch a thing as a Catholick
Church, without knowing where, or which it is? or does it determine
him to that Church whoſe publick Aſſemblies he ſees? For if it be the
former of theſe, this, as you would make it, is a mighty wild and
inſignificant principle of Faith. I know that there is a Catholick
Church to whoſe Authority it is my duty to ſubmit, but I cannot tell
where that Church is, nor which is ſhe; this would be but an odd
principle of Faith. The Child, ſaid <hi>M. de Condom,</hi> does certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
this Idea to the particular Church, whoſe Aſſemblies he ſees,
and in which he himſelf bears a part, and does believe that to be the
Catholick Church, and not barely that there is ſuch a Church. Let
us imagine then, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> a Child born within a Church that

is Heretical, or Schiſmatical, the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Church ſuppoſe, the firſt
principle of Faith in this Child will be from the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Church,
looking upon that as the Catholick. From this Church then, and
from her Authority, according to your Tenet, he will receive the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as Divine; from her likewiſe he will receive the meaning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of Scripture; and he muſt never afterwards believe himſelf
priviledged to examine the determinations of his <hi>Aethiopick</hi> Church,
for fear of falling into the inconvenience and abſurdity of fancying it
impoſſible for him, a private ſingle perſon, to underſtand the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Scripture better than the whole body of the Church. Tell me
now, <hi>Sir,</hi> whether according to this principle, this Child be not obliged
always to abide within that Heretical, or Schiſmatical Church? Tell me
what means you will contrive for him to get out of it? It is evident then,
that your principle would ſerve as well to continue a <hi>Jew</hi> in his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſm,
a Pagan in his Heatheniſm, and a Heretick in his Hereſy, as an
Orthodox Chriſtian in the true Church.</p>
            <p>To this <hi>M. de Condom</hi> replied, that in the perſwaſion of that <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi>
Child, we muſt make a difference between that part which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
from the Holy Spirit, and that which is the effect of prejudice
and humane prepoſſeſſion. That the Holy Spirit's dictate was in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
that there was a Catholick Church ſomewhere or other; but his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
that the Church in which he was born was that Catholick Church,
proceeded from humane prepoſſeſſion. It is true, he did from this
Church receive the Scriptures, and belived them to be Divine, for no
other reaſon but upon its Authority: But afterwards, as he was reading
the Scriptures, the Holy Ghoſt raiſed in him ſome ſcruples about the
Church he was born in, and by this means he came off from the Hereſy
and Schiſm he found himſelf inſnared in.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> returned, that <hi>M. de Condom</hi> muſt of neceſſity either retract
his principle, or confeſs what he now alledged to be utterly impoſſible.
Becauſe this <hi>Aethiopian</hi> neither can, nor muſt be allowed to underſtand
the Scriptures any otherwiſe than in the ſenſe and interpretation of his
own Church, by whoſe Authority it is that he believes them to be Divine,
and from whoſe hands he receives their meaning; ſo that when he reads
Scripture, there can never ſtart up any ſcruples in his mind againſt the
truth of his own Church, becauſe he never expounds any Text of
Scripture but in agreement with the ſenſe of that Church about it.
Now if on the other ſide your meaning be, that this perſon expounds
Scripture of his own head, and according to his own judgment, ſo
taking it in a ſenſe different from that of the Church, you at the ſame
time make him forego the principle that you have all this while been
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98207:62"/>
contending for; and it is not you only that make him forego it, but
you do beſides maintain, that the Holy Ghoſt himſelf makes him fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
it, and all thoſe mighty inconveniences you exclaimed againſt, vaniſh
into nothing. He added moreover, that what <hi>M. de Condom</hi> ſaid laſt,
juſtified the meaſures the Proteſtants had taken in relation to the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> for altho that had been believed to be the Catholick Church
in the time of our Infancy, tho we had received the Scriptures from
her, and believed them to be of Divine Authority; yet muſt we not be
blamed for making a difference between that part of this belief which
proceeded from the Holy Ghoſt, and that which was the effect of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Prepoſſeſſion and Prejudice: We cannot be found fault with, for
having admitted ſome Scruples againſt the Truth of this Church, as we
read the Scriptures, and for having upon this accout withdrawn our ſelves
from her Communion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. de Condom</hi> ſaid, the Caſes did ſtill differ in this circumſtance,
That the <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> when he left his own, would betake himſelf
to the Catholick Church, whereas the Pretended Reformed have not
put themſelves into any other Communion at all. You courted indeed
<hi>Jeremy</hi>'s the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but he would have nothing
to do with you. The ſeparation was not from our ſelves, ſaid Mr.
<hi>Claude,</hi> and that is enough to ſhew that we have not ſeparated from
the true Church. If <hi>Jeremy</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> would
have nothing to do with us, as you ſay, that was to his own loſs, and
he did not do as he ſhould have done in it.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Company roſe, and the Conference which laſted ſome
time longer, grew a great deal more confuſed; ſeveral things were
then ſpoken of. <hi>M. de Condom</hi> exaggerated much, and pretended to
draw a parallel between the ſeparation of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and that of
the old Hereticks, particularly the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians,</hi> that ſet
up new Churches by themſelves. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> compared the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi>
behaviour, to that of Chriſt's Apoſtles, when they ſeparated
from the <hi>Jews;</hi> that, as the Apoſtles relied on Scripture againſt the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who relied upon Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies and their Authority,
the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> did the ſame againſt the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> He ſaid,
the <hi>Arrians</hi> maintained, that the Conſubſtantiality of the Son of God
determined by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, was a Novel Doctrine, and that
many other perſons had in truth expreſt themſelves very unadviſedly
concerning the Divinity of the Son; among others he inſtanced in
<hi>Origea, Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Antioch.</hi> As for <hi>Origen,
M. de Condom</hi> ſaid he was a ſuſpected Author, and the Council of
<hi>Antioch</hi> ſaid he, was an <hi>Arrian</hi> Council; to which Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> replied,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98207:63"/>
that he was much miſtaken; for that Council was held before <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
his time, and yet rejected the Term <hi>Conſubſtantial.</hi> As to <hi>Juſtin
Martyr,</hi> How, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid he, a Martyr ſpeak amiſs of the Divinity of
the Son of God! I will never believe a word on't. You may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what you think ſit, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude;</hi> but for all that, the
thing is even ſo.</p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>M. de Condom</hi> put himſelf upon the Invocation of Saints,
and Prayers for the Dead: For the firſt of theſe, he told them Mr.
<hi>Daille</hi> had allowed it to be Thirteen hundred years old; and Mr.
<hi>Blondell</hi> acknowledged the ſecond to be of great Antiquity. Mr.
<hi>Claude</hi> replied, it was no great wonder, if the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
which had collected, and Cononized the Errors and Superſtitions of
former Ages, had picked up ſome that were of a good old ſtanding.
But he ought to have ſaid withal, that Mr. <hi>Daille</hi> had made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that for Three hundred years together there was not to be
found the leaſt footſteps of Invocation of Saints, and eſpecially, that
there was not any manner of ground for it in Scripture. That he
acknowledged Prayer for the Dead to be one of the oldeſt ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
but there was a mighty difference between the practice of the
Primitive Chriſtians, and the modern devotions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.
And after all, it was an Error contrary to the principles of Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. de Condom</hi> betook himſelf again to the Compariſon between the
<hi>Proteſtants</hi> and Hereticks of old; inferring from thence, that they and
their Church was new and upſtart. Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> ſhewed him, that this
prejudice was extremely unjuſt, and of very pernicious conſequence.
Unjuſt, becauſe on one hand it placed the advantage on the ſtrongeſt
ſide, and thoſe that have moſt of their party; whereas the Scripture
teaches us quite contrary,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.</note> That <hi>we muſt not follow a multitude to do
evil:</hi> For the ſtrongeſt ſide are continually taxing others with making
a new Body, and a new Church. Unjuſt, ſecondly, becauſe a falſe
Antiquity may be miſtaken for a true, an Antiquity of ſome Ages ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
which is really no better than a Novelty, for an Antiquity of all
Ages of the Church; which in the buſineſs of Religion is the higheſt
injuſtice imaginable. He added moreover, that this prejudice was of
very pernicious conſequence; becauſe at this rate, when once Errors
and Superſtitions had by inſenſible degrees crept into Religion, and
Cuſtom, or the Schools had given them countenance, there would no
poſſible means be left of expoſing or extirpating them: For the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
of them will be continually objecting againſt thoſe that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
it, that they ſet up a new Church, and a new Religion. Thus
it was,<note place="margin">Matt. 15.</note> that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> accuſed Jeſus Chriſt for an Innovator, upon
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98207:63"/>
pretence that his Diſciples kept not the Traditions of the Elders, which
were indeed but Innovations themſelves. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> taxed St. <hi>Paul</hi>
for a <hi>Mover of Sedition among them through the whole world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 21.</note> 
               <hi>and being a
Ringleader of the Sect of the</hi> Nazarenes, which they lookt upon as a
new Sect. Thus all the Apoſtles were charged by the Heathens, for
being diſturbers of the publick peace, and bringers up of New things,
becauſe they endeavoured to root out the old Errors out of mens hearts,
and bring them to the worſhip of the one only true God, maker of
Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>M. de Condom</hi> replied, That Jeſus Chriſt was new, that the <hi>Jews</hi>
expected the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> that <hi>John Baptiſt, Anna</hi> the Propheteſs, <hi>Simeon,</hi>
and the wiſe men had owned him. True, ſaid Mr. <hi>Claude,</hi> he was not
really new, for <hi>he is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 188.</note> But he
was new to that whole Nation which expected a temporal <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and
did not ſee in him any ſign of what they expected. He was new in
their opinion, in that he condemned the old Traditions. His Church
was new to them, becauſe it ſeparated from the Body of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
made a diſtinct body which they had never ſeen before. And as for
<hi>John Baptiſt, Anna</hi> the Propheteſs, <hi>Simeon,</hi> and the wiſe men, what
were theſe ſingle private perſons, if compared to the whole body of
Prieſt; Phariſees and Lawyers, and the whole Body of all the <hi>Jews</hi>
in general, which never owned him, but lookt for an earthly <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
It is plain then, that this prejudice of Novelty, forbidding men to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
things to the bottom, and not diſtinguiſhing between a true and
a counterfeit Antiquity, accounting that old which was practiſed ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday,
and every thing new that is contrary to what was in vogue
yeſterday, is a very ill and dangerous prejudice. It fortifies <hi>Jews</hi> and
Heathens againſt the Chriſtian Religion, and indeed, was continually
made uſe of by <hi>Celſus,</hi> and the reſt of them that oppoſed Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>I own, ſaid <hi>M. de Condom,</hi> that the Heathens did upbraid the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
with their Novelty, but the Chriſtians demonſtrated to them,
that the <hi>Jews</hi> always believed in the ſame God they worſhipped, and
did expect the ſame <hi>Meſſias</hi> they pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſt. What you ſay, anſwer'd Mr.
<hi>Claude,</hi> is a further confirmation of my opinion, to wit, that you ought
not out of prejudice conclude for what appears to be new, but ſearch
things throughly, to know certainly whether what appears to be new,
be ſo in truth. The Heathens accuſation proceeded from your preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
and the Chriſtians defence of themſelves is according to my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
For it was by an exact examination of things, that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
demonſtrated they were not new, tho the World looked upon them
ſo, and that what they oppoſed in the Heathen ſuperſtitions, was really
new, tho taken to be old.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:98207:64"/>
The Conference having laſted a very great while, near upon five
hours, and being carried on with abundance of earneſtneſs in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants
on both ſides, and of attention from the ſtanders by, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
now began to interpoſe, and ſo the diſpute broke off. After
which Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> applied himſelf to <hi>M. de Condom,</hi> with a great deal of
civility and reſpect, and intreated him, that the difference between
their Religions and Opinions, might not incline him to think leſs kindly
of him. That he for his part ſhould ever retain a very high value and
eſteem for ſo deſerving a perſon. <hi>M. de Condom</hi> returned him this very
obliging anſwer, That he had ſome knowledg of him before by his
Writings, but was exceeding glad to know his perſon now by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
in the management whereof, he had done all that could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
by done for the vindication of his Cauſe; and that whenever any
opportunity of ſerving him offered it ſelf, he would very willingly and
heartily lay hold on it.</p>
            <p>Preſently after <hi>M. de Condom</hi> went away; and Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> having firſt
returned thanks to the Company, particularly to the Lady <hi>Mareſchalleſs
de Lorge,</hi> for their patience and attention, took his leave of <hi>Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle
de Duras</hi> in words to this purpoſe, That he had vindicated the
Truth before her; and all that was now left for him to do, was only to
beſeech Almighty God in her behalf; and to exhort her, that ſhe would
improve what ſhe had now heard, to the ſettling her more firmly in
that Religion which God had called her to, and not ſuffer her ſelf to be
ſhaken by any temptation: And theſe things he would not fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of God for her. <hi>Mademoiſelle de Duras</hi> thank'd him very kindly
for the trouble he had been at, and very paſſionately begged his
Prayers: Which Mr. <hi>Claude</hi> having promiſed, preſently withdrew.</p>
