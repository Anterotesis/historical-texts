            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

concerning the fortunate procéeings which paſſed betwéene
them aſwell the proweſſe of the one, as valure of the other: I
muſt needes ſay it was ſuch, and of ſo great authoritie, as it bare
the title of perfect magnanimitie. But returne we to our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>The Princeſſe <hi>Flerida</hi> perceuing the courteous care, and
diligent endeuour, that her royall ſpouſe <hi>Don Edward</hi> vſed
for her greater delight, ſo louingly labouring to auoyde that
motion, that either might ſéeme to her perſon diſpleaſant, or
by any ſiniſter meanes to make ſhew of her diſprofit, deſtred
him to appoint ſuch prouiſion for her, that there ſhe emight
diſcharge her heauy burthen, and not to depart before ſhe ſawe
the fruits of her labours. To which reaſonable requeſt, the
Prince right courteouſly conſented, being right glad to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
that occaſion, that might be to her content, and for that
cauſe as yet he refuſed the gouerning of the kingdome, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the whole affaires thereof, to the wiſe diſcretion of King
<hi>Fredericke</hi> his father, vntill ſuch time as he ſaw the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
in better eſtate of her health. And in this order ſought he
ech vnfrequented place of paſſage, and eche ſolitary habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to remooue his Tents when pleaſed the Princes, dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
thoſe places to his better content, then the youthfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of the King his Fathers Court. But as the fayreſt
colours ſooneſt fadeth, the freſheſt flowre, ſooneſt withereth,
and the cleereſt day quickly cloudy, euen ſo the man to whom
<hi>Fortune</hi> dooth anouch moſt fréendlineſſe, is ſooneſt intrapped
by he diſſembling falſhood: and when leaſt he thinketh of any
ſecret doubt, he is deceiued by ſudden daunger. So this
valiant and renowned Prince, whom <hi>Fortune</hi> had encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by his admirable conqueſts, and aduaunced his name in
reſpect of his Nobleneſſe, new reclaiming her former and
woonted courteſie, cauſeth him to taſte her preſent crueltie,
and where before ſhe helde his Honor as beſt woorthie her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
now in a chollericke humor breaketh of her fréendſhip,
cauſing him to knowe, though ſhe had holpen him long,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhe was now minded to hurle him downe at laſt. The time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come of her appointed treacherie, and the meane deuiſed
to accompliſh her crueltie, ſhée cauſed <hi>Don Edward</hi> to leaue
the company of the Princes <hi>Flerida,</hi> and all other his Lords
and Ladies who were there preſent with her, and walketh
to the Sea ſide, which was not farre diſtant. Returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaiue.
hée cauſed the tents to be pitched foure miles from the
Forreſt, on a pleaſant gréene platte, by a little running riuer,
which delighted the minde of the Princeſſe, the place was ſo
fine and fitly choſen out. On a ſudden there was heard a great
tumult, in a thicket of trees neare adioyning, to ſée what it
might be, the Prince mounted on Horſebacke, and rode to the
place, where caſting his eyes aſide, hee eſpied a wilde and
mighty Bore, which ſight the Prince was not a little glad of,
but with diuers of his noble Lords, made preſent purſuite af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<hi>Don Edward</hi> ſtill rid after the game, that the other had
quite loſt the ſight of him, which they ſought againe to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
but all was in vaine, for the day being cleane ſpent, and
waxing ſomewhat darke, cauſed them to retyre againe to the
Princeſſe. Who ſéeing her Lord <hi>Don Edward</hi> not returne
with them, fell into great diſmaying, and doubting of his ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which ſhe had iuſt cauſe to doe, for that this his ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
was greatly lamented through the Realme of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and all kingdomes in Chriſtendome, before they had his
preſence againe.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrayed Prince, being thus allured by <hi>Fortune,</hi> affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his game with ſuch great delight, that he neuer minded
the Princeſſe diſtreſſe, but gaue himſelfe wholly to his preſent
paſtime, not fearing for foreſéeing what might be the perill. His
Stéede with tediouſneſſe of trauaile, waxeth ſtract in his
limines, which cauſed the Prince to ſtay and alight, for the
darkeſomnes of the night had loſt his game, and the fayning
of his Horſe, required to haue reſt. <hi>Don Edward</hi> reſting him
at the foote of a Trée, beganne at laſt to call to minde, the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
eſtate of the Princeſſe <hi>Flerida,</hi> and the griefe his Lords
would conceiue for want of his company. Faine he would
haue
<pb facs="tcp:13179:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſlept, but could not, for ſtill the doubts that aſſailed his mind,
one while for the Princeſſe, another while for his Péeres,
firſt to thinke how his abſence, would cauſe her to iudge ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of his vnkinde dealing, then how his Lords would
ſtand in feare of his danger: theſe, and a thouſand more triſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
terrors, with held him from receiuing that ſwéet reſt, he
gladly looked for. Alas (thought he) how hard is his hap to
whom <hi>Fortune</hi> is aduerſe? how contrary his good lucke that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waiteth
her liberality? the one is a thing euer to be doubted,
and the other ought at no time to be deſired. The night is ſpent
in theſe and ſuch like cogitations, and at the appearence of the
day, his eyes began to waxe heauy, as commonly it happeneth
vnto thoſe, whom conceiued ſorrow denieth the required reſt,
at laſt very griefe of it ſelfe conſtraineth them to ſlumber. This
carefull Prince, hauing obtained ſuch quietneſſe, as the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
of his paine would permit him, ſtretching forth his
armes, calleth againe into queſtion, the retchleſſe regard he
had of himſelfe, ſo lighly to leaue his Lady, and ſo vngently
to forſake his company, which although it happened againſt
his will, he iudged they would not accept it ſo in worth. Then
mounting vpon Horſebacke, rode on to finde his company, ſo
vnaduiſedly loſt, but <hi>Fortune</hi> ſtill denying his pretended pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
by how much he eſtéemed himſelfe néere to his comfort,
by ſo much the farder of ſhe ſet him to the contrary, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
on in hope, at laſt he arriued in a great Groue of Trées,
the thickneſſe and height whereof, cauſed him to fall into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
with himſelfe. Through this graue ran a faire and
cleare Riuer, wherein he perceiued the reſemblance of a
Gallant and curious Caſtle, as ſtrongly fortified, as rarely
edified, the ſight whereof, ſomewhat aſſwadged the egernes of
his gréefe, likewiſe, the pleaſant ratling of the gréene leaues,
with the mellodious harmony of the pretty chirping Birds,
exiled the former heauines of his heart, and cauſed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the gladſome time, wherein he ſpent his labour, to
gaine his beſt beloued, during the warres of the Emperour
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> where firſt he named himſelf <hi>Iulian.</hi> In theſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
<pb facs="tcp:13179:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conceits, hee rid along by the Riuer ſide, ſo rauiſhed
with his inwarde delight, that he little ſuſpected the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
daunger, for vnto that place did he chéefeſt frame his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
which <hi>Fortune</hi> had appointed to worke his diſtreſſe. <hi>Don
Edward</hi> beholding the braue ſcituation of this Caſtle, ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in workemanſhip, and coſtly in outward reſemblaunce,
the Bridge at entring whereof was ſo large, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> foure knights
might eaſily haue Combatted thereon, no leſſe inſued at his
ſudde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> arriual, then he meruailed at this his ſtrange aduenture.
The Porter of the Caſtell, with double diligence, more then
deſerued thankes, ſet open the gate to allure him in, which the
Prince perceiuing, misdoubted no daunger, or any ſecret guile
in his gallant proſpect, becauſe he neither ſawe any to reſiſt
his entrye, and the Porter being vnarmed made him doubt the
leſſe. It laſt, more on a youthfull courage, then an aduiſed care,
he aduanced himſelfe to the Gate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Caſtle, deſiring to know
the name of ſo pleaſant a place, &amp; who protected a thing of ſuch
force. The Porter not to learne his leſſon, but ſmoothely co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring
his ſecret craft, to the good lyking of the Prince, and
furtheraunce of his Ladies pleaſure, cunningly coyned this
gentle reply. Sir (quoth he) my ſelfe am a ſeruaunt, to her
who likewiſe to your perſon oweth ſeruice, and if you pleaſe
to enter the Manſion of your Vaſſaile, what wanteth in coſt,
ſhall excéede in curteſie, and your ſelfe ſatiſfied to your farder
content. The Prince regarding the circumſtaunce of his
woords, and not reſpecting the colluſion of his wyles, aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and preſently entred the Caſtle, where with humble duty
he was conducted to the great Hall, and ſerued with humility
in euery reſpect. The Lady of the Caſtell, who was chéefe in
this deuiſe, hauing woone the man, whome moſt ſhe made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
of, to cauſe him as yet to dread no doubt, or elſe to feare
any enſuing daunger, came and welcommed the Prince with
ſuch large proteſtations, as his thoughts were quite abſent
in thinking of any perill. The Prince well noting the curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
of the Lady, (whoſe comely countenaunce and gallant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour,
not onely gaue a ſhew of ſinguler modeſtie, but alſo
bare the face of apparant honeſtly) perſwaded himſelfe, that all
<pb facs="tcp:13179:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the commendations in the world, were not of ſufficiencie, to
requite her great gentleneſſe. For being ſo brauely ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ded with
gallant gentlewomen, and euery one at becke and call with
dutifull humilitie, hee rather déemed her a ſecond <hi>Lucrecia,</hi>
then doubted her to be a diſſembling <hi>Lais,</hi> rather one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
fidelitie, then in ſuch ſort to intrap him by flattery. But
as the ſweeteſt Roſe is not without his ſharpe prickell, or the
fineſt Veluet but hath his bracke, ſo vnder the ſmootheſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
is ſooneſt found deceite, and in the fayreſt talke, to bée
the fouleſt treaſon. And there was a truſtie <hi>Damon,</hi> ſo was

there was a flattering <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> happy may he be that findeth
a friend, which preferreth the honor of his faith, before the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
of falſhood, more accounting of the welfare of his friend, then
any thing elſe in his wordly affaires. But to returne to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prince
who made great account, of his ſo gentle entertainment, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
wel her friendſhip that ſhe handled with ſuch dexterity,
which to gratifie with thankes, he entred into this diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>Lady, if this ſudden motion doe ſtrike me into a maze, &amp; your
ſacred manners, inforce me to muſe, impute the one to the rare
perfection of your beauty, and iudge the other, as the raſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of my boldnes. Firſt, your famous manſion did not a
litle daunt me, &amp; now the faire miſtreſſe doth no leſſe delight me
the one excelling all in brauery, the other ſurpaſſing euery one
in beauty. Wherefore good lady, if it ſhall like you to report, and
licence me to requeſt, let me vnderſtand your name, and who is
gouernour of this place. The Lady as one currant in her coy,
conceytes, and not to learne how to vſe Courtier, quickely
ſounded the depth of his deſire, and as a ſkitfull pilot ſtrooke
Sayles againſt a ſtorme, then taking <hi>Don Edward</hi> by the
hand, ſhe walked to the window, and ſhaped him this anſwere.
Worthy ſir, the great fame of your nobleneſſe doth wel deſerue
that title, &amp; the ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy of your preſent behauior doth vrge me

                        </gap>ike, for that the authority of
your name, doth beare you out in the one. &amp; the effects of nature
doth braue you in the other. I would my beauty were ſo ample
<pb facs="tcp:13179:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as might content ſuch a Gallant, or my bounty ſufficient to
entertaine ſuch a Gueſt. Letting that paſſe, I would the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
which hath liked you to praiſe, were anſwerable in
perfection or able to pleaſe. Touching your requeſt, both this
Caſtle and Gouernour thereof, reſteth at your commaund to
what you ſhall deſire, and if it ſhall like you to accept of one
nights lodging here, not for the good chéere you ſhall finde,
but for your good company which we fancy, you ſhall be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in euery doubt, and to morrowe or when pleaſe you, you
may depart. <hi>Don Edward</hi> perceiuing her courteous prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
thought it ſtood with his honour to accept it, and againſt
his honeſtie to refuſe it, and while they were vſing the time
in theſe and ſuch like familiar ſpéeches, the Tables wre co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
and euery thing prouided to a braue and ſumptuous
banquet, which in coſt excéeded, and in delicate fare ſurpaſſed,
that in the King his father Court, he could not be more gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
ſerued.</p>
                     <p>There Banquet finiſhed, and the Tables withdrawen,
courteſie on all ſides artificially offered, he was conducted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a notable faire Chamber, the ſumptuouſneſſe whereof ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed,
where preparing him to Bedward, he conuayed his
good Sword vnder his Pillowe, which Sword was of ſuch
great vertue, that while it was about him, no enchantment
could preuaile, or by any meanes annoy him. Bearing in Bed,
he called to minde the great diſtance of place, and diuerſitie
of paſſage, betwéene his beloued <hi>Flerida,</hi> and his ſorrowfull
ſelfe, which with many a grieuous ſigh he often bemoned, but
at length conuinced with heauineſſe of ſléepe, for that the night
before he enioyed no reſt, turned him to the wall, to receiue the
charge which was toward him. The Lady of the Caſtle being
maruellous ſéen in Magicke, and knowing by her Arte, that
the Prince was ſound aſleepe, ſent a Damoſell to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to ſteale away his Sword, which while he had, ſhe could
not accompliſh her deſire.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſell in all reſpects fulfilled her Ladies minde,
and hauing brought it to her, ſhe commaunded her to goe vnto
<pb facs="tcp:13179:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
her Couzin <hi>Dramuſiand,</hi> and deſire him with all ſpéede to haſte
him thither, for now he might take ſecure reuengement on the
Prince <hi>Don Edoard,</hi> for the death of his father, who was ſlain
by one of the linage of this noble young Prince. The Damoſel
went ſpéedily and did her meſſage, returning with the young
Giant whom the Lady ſent for, and hauing vnderſtood the full
minde of his Aunt, entred the chamber of <hi>Don Edoard,</hi> where
taking the ſword of the Prince in his hand, brake foorth into
theſe or the like ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes thou didſt remain in the ſeruice of a man no loſſe

then when thy Lord <hi>Don Edoard</hi> did gird thée about him
ſo putting it vp againe into the ſheath, he approched vnto the

                     <p>The Prince being vanquiſhed with a ſudden feare, to heare

Serpent, and in the calmeſt waters the deepeſt whirlepoole: ſo
in thoſe places where aman thinketh himſelfe fartheſt of all

of her Father, for that the effect of this miſfortune, might bee
well compared to his before paſſed. The other, for becauſe they

The Ceremonies accompliſhed, which were required in

the harde miſfortune of her Lord, and neuer ceaſing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
the miſeries of her life, eſteeming the one to excel all in hard
happe, and the other to be aboue all in vnlooked for miſchaunce.
But as commonly it hapneth, no pleaſure is without his paine
adioyned, nor no quiet calme, but by ſome accident or other, is
conuerted into a rough tempeſt: euen ſo this careful Princeſſe,
whoſe extreame griefe and miſhappe, added a perſwaſion of
minde, that Fortune had done her worſt, and executed her vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt
ſpight: ſo that what wanted to accompliſh her quiet, as
concerning the abſence of her louing <hi>Don Edoard,</hi> ſhe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a reſolute opinion, (albeit farre incomparable to her loſſe,
yet as Nature willed her, by a forced content) to aſſwage her
vrgent Paſſions, on the preſence of the two young Princes: by
whom in time ſhe had good hope to end her griefe, and on whom
as preſent occaſion did ſerue, ſhe was ſomewhat ſatiſfied. But
marke how vnkindely it happened.</p>
                     <p>In this Forreſt of long time remained a <hi>Sauadge man,</hi> who
not vſing the companie of reaſonable Creatures, became vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable

and Beaſtly, his diet on the Hearbs and Rootes of the ground,
his Apparell framed of the ſkinnes of wilde Beaſtes, ſhewed
that he was a man in name, but not in nature. This <hi>Sauadge
man,</hi> walking as was his woont, along the Forreſt, leading
in his hand a couple of Lyons, whome he vſed ſometime to kill
the Game, that would ſerue for his nouriſhment: vnhappily eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed
the Princeſſe and her Traine, which mooued him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
himſelfe into a thicket of Trées néere adioyning: where
at pleaſure he behold the Ceremonies, vſed at the Baptizing of
the Children.</p>
                     <p>Nowe had Fortune determined the ſecond miſhappe of the
Princeſſe: for that ſhee vrged the <hi>Sauadge man,</hi> to goe take
the two Infants, who were ſweetely ſléeping on the Mothers
lap, and giue them for food vnto his Lyons, that all that day had
receyued no ſuſtenaunce. Foorth from among the Trées hee
<pb facs="tcp:13179:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
coms, too the no little aſtoniſhment of the Princeſſe (whoſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful

diſmaying of her Courtly attendants: who at this preſence of
ſo grim a ſire, betooke themſelues to flight, not one receyuing the
courage of hart to abide by the Princeſſe, but the Lady <hi>Attaida,</hi>
who neuor ſhrunke one foote from her, but would haue aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
the death in the Princeſſe defence, had her might bene an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
to her good ſtomacke. When the Princeſſe ſaw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſubiect to ſo hard a miſchance, that the old Duke of <hi>Galles,</hi>
and all the other being vnarmed, were gladde to flie, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede
was their beſt help: ſhee wiſhed for Sir <hi>Pridos,</hi> but hee
was departed to <hi>London,</hi> to fetch a Charriot to bring her to the
Court, which vrged her thus to content her ſelfe: Let it ſuffice
thée poore <hi>Flerida,</hi> that thou art the only ſhe, borne vnto all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.
Then approched to her the <hi>Sauadge man,</hi> and tooke
from her the two young Princes, neyther vſing any words, or
offering any harme to her, but departed preſently to his Caue,
leauing the Princeſſe ouercome with a traunce, whereout, the

<pb facs="tcp:13179:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Madame, the honour of a noble minde, is tried in aduerſitie,
when as the extremitie of griefe, is conquered by patience of the
minde. But the minde being impatient, and not kept within
the lymittes of a moderate gouernment: the leaſt Croſſe that
happeneth, is too waightie in paine, when the ſence is farre too
weake in reaſon. It pleaſed the Almightie to giue vs a Sonne,
in whom wee receiued no little comfort, and by whome, our
Fame hath béene Knightly aduanced. And now to trie how we
can brooke a moitie of his diſpleaſure, he hath cauſed ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

Children, who till we enioy the fight of the Father againe,

beare an equall ſhare of aduerſitie, and be partners alſo in good
Fortune, if any chaunce to happen.</p>
                     <p>Thus the King and the Queene remained, one while in a

the force of their griefe: whoſe Paſſions I referre to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                     <p>When ſhe came to the Court, &amp; perceiued the great chaunge,

<pb facs="tcp:13179:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all the nobility, who likewiſe vnderſtanding the miſhap of the

in double extremity, the Lords and Ladies, both in

                     <p>The Princeſſe <hi>Flerida</hi> became very féeble of perſon, inſomuch

<hi>Theſſaly,</hi> Sonne to <hi>Friſol,</hi> the King of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> accompanied

honoured the beautie of faire <hi>Bazilia,</hi> youngeſt daughter to the
Emperour <hi>Palmerin,</hi> to whom he was newly maried, and ſtood
in doubt how to proceed, leaſt Fortune ſhould not be ſo fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

and the other linked to an effeminate fancie, hee determined to
follow his Companions, driuing into obliuion the pleaſaunt
conceyts, that hee often eſtéemed in his beſt beloued, vſing this
perſwaſion with himſelfe, That hee which vanquiſhed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with the vanitie of Fancy, and yéeldeth the libertie of his
will to fond affection, is more méete to handle a Lute, then a
Lance, and better to court a Lady, then deſerue the braue name
of a Captaine. In this perſwaſion hee departed, intending ſo
knightly an opinion in his minde, that the honour of his name
ſhould expreſſe his noblenes, and valure of his bounty, be eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

wanting the noble knights which were thence departed, which
cauſed the Emperour to viſite the chiefeſt places in the Citie, to

fayle in the one, let friendſhip yet forget the other. Let ſuffice,
that I am one whom Fortune hath iniuryed euery way by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happe,

for the eſtimation of my life, the ioy is ſo ſmall, and the griefe
ſo well acquainted, that I am rather deſperate to ende it, then
deſirous to endure it. And now I make my returne vnto my

I am ſure if you haue trauelled Countreys, you are not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,

vntill ſuch time as by the valiancie of the famous Prince

This Prince afterward remaining with my Brother in <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonia,</hi>
ſo long as him pleaſed, where were ſuch Tryumphes

<pb facs="tcp:13179:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(the more vnfortunate I) conceiued ſo good opinion of his vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant

of my Loue, eſtéeming all other but baſe in reſpect of him,
and hee to be as farre beyond them all, as I was deceyued farre
from my hope. But my Cake was dowe, and my labour ſpent
to loſſe: for that long before he had vowed his ſeruice to the faire
Damoſell <hi>Flerida,</hi> to whom he was Eſpowſed, when he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
foorth of this Kingdome. Thus was my Loue deſpiſed, my

loued too ſoone, and loſt too late: which cauſeth mee refraine all

in diſtance of place, but farther off in good will of heart. Yet of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

her cheerfull countenance, &amp; cloare <hi>Phoebus</hi> haſtened to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,
to run his courſe about the earth. Through this valley ran
a blacke and vgly Riuer, beſet with high Trées round about,
which made it very obſcure and vnpleaſant to the beholders. In
the midſt of this Riuer was an Ile, wherin was placed an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Manſion, couered ouer al with black: which declared ſmal
pleaſure to thoſe who remained there, &amp; great occaſion of ſadnes
to any that ſhould come there. The chamber of his ſolitarie

whereat he let ſlie an Arrow with ſuch force, that it paſſed
cleane through the body of the beaſt. The Hart féeling himſelfe
wounded, proſently tooke flight: which he perceiuing, let ſlip

And <hi>Florian</hi> ſtrayed ſo farre, that he had loſt the ſight of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

which cauſed him to wander in heauineſſe, till the darke Night
ouerſhadowed him, when he eſpyed two Shepheards making a
little Fire of ſtickes to warme them, becauſe the Night was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding
colde. <hi>Florian</hi> being there arriued, hee ſate him downe
by a Riuers ſide, in the very ſame place that his Mother brought
him into the World: where ſitting a pretty while, he eſpyed a
Knight come ryding, attyred in blacke Armor, ſpotted with red,
bearing in his Shielde, the figure of a Gryffon, with a certaine
Poeſie, which was vnknown to any, his Lady and himſelfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
This Knight was named Sir <hi>Pridos,</hi> who ſtill aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

his heart beganne ſomewhat to conceiue a maruellous inward

broken by ſome rough encounter that he had béene in. And in

Iſet and earneſt thus anſwered. Sir, I muy be offended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <p>Syr (quoth the Knight of the <hi>Serpent)</hi> this excuſe is farre too
ſimple, in denying both your Hearing and Sight: for though
ſtatelyneſſe would not ſuffer you to ſée me, yet the leawdneſſe of

large language of the Knight, which might quickly mooue him

ſhortly replyed. Syr Knight, you haue better licence to depart,

I deſire rather (quoth <hi>Vernar)</hi> mine owne ruine, then I ſhould

your concealed thoughtes may be eſtéemed wiſedome, and that
your Eſtate ſtandeth in a more ſharpe hazarde, then your mute
conceyts are of force to yéeld you any ſure helpe: which I hope
ſhall ſhew you the difference, betweene a careleſſe Groome, and
a Courtly Gentleman.</p>
                     <p>Syr (aunſwered the Prince <hi>Vernan)</hi> your opinion is as yet
farre beyond my purpoſe: for that you are as wide from your
hope, as you are ſcant wiſe to put your intent to hap. Perſwade
your ſelfe thus, that the courage I haue to your foyle, and ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
I eſtéem of mine owne faith, ſhall ere long, giue an abſolute
anſwere, whether I ſhal periſh in my determination, or thy ſelfe
preuaile in what thou demandeſt: which ſhall craue no longer
forbearance, then my Sword hath taught you manners, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my will would teach me your kinde of modeſtie. Then
fell they to a freſh Combate, which was more dangerous then
their firſt Aſſault: when being wearied with Swords, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured
by wraſtling to ſuppreſſe the ſtrength of eache, but the
equal behauiour of their force was ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the loſſe of their blood
was great: yet their valorous hearts would conceiue no faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
The Knight of the <hi>Serpent</hi> had ſuch a deſire to knowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom he fought, that once more he began to vſe fair ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to him. I perceiue Sir, you more eſtéeme your earneſt opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then you ſtand in feare of the loſſe of your life: which were
more honour for you to deliuer vnto knowledge, then ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
chaunce, ſhould happen vnto either of vs: yet is my minde
ſo affected, that I will know both your ſecret and your ſelfe, or it
ſhall value my life. As for my life (qd. <hi>Vernar)</hi> I am ſo much the
more willing to looſe it, by how much I perceyue you zealous to
know what you ſhall not. Wherevppon they beganne againe
the third time, albeit, more faintly then before paſſed: which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
their Eſquyres ſtanding by, to enter into many heauy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes,
eſpecially the Eſquire of the Prince <hi>Vernar,</hi> who as
thus framed his mone. Oh infortunate Emperor, who is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that Fortune at this time will depriue him of his ioy.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of the <hi>Serpent</hi> noting theſe words, preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectured
that it was the Prince <hi>Vernar,</hi> ſonne to the Emperour
of <hi>Allemaigne,</hi> againſt whom he entred Combat, and how grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
the Emperor <hi>Palmerin</hi> would take the matter, if he heard
of the loſſe of either of them both. Beſide, himſelf would be loth,
any way to diſpleaſe the Gentle Prince <hi>Vernar,</hi> wherefore for
more aſſurance of him, he beheld his broken Shield, wherein he
perceiued the deuiſe of his Lady <hi>Bazilia,</hi> coloured all in Purple,
with the halfe burning Heart in the midſt: and on the Armor of
the Prince, was her Portraite curiouſly drawne: which gaue
him perſwaſion that was hée, to whom hee thus vſed his ſpéech.
Syr. <hi>Vernar,</hi> my minde conſtraineth me to giue ouer the fight,
being right ſorrie that I haue continued it ſo long: for that the
Princeſſe <hi>Bazilia</hi> is cauſe of your ſorrow, which you feared to
vtter, and now by my ſelfe declared. Pardon your friende <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car,</hi>
who is ſo hartily ſorry, that he rather deſireth the death, then
to ſée you in any diſtreſſe. The Prince <hi>Vernar,</hi> perceiuing that it
was his friend <hi>Belcar,</hi> ran to him, embracing him in his armes,
giuing him a thouſand thanks, that he had ſo found the meane,
to cut off their quarrell. Then taking their Helme to to theyr
Eſquires, who did their beſt to binde vp their wounds, they rode
to the Citie of <hi>Brique,</hi> which was not far from the Forreſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
to each other, what had happened them in their ſearch
of the Prince <hi>Don Edoard.</hi>

the Noble Prince <hi>Don Edoard</hi> came foorth vppon the bridge,
very valiantly mounted, his armour all blacke, whereon was
a reſemblaunce of little flames of fire, tormenting a Louers
heart, which was engrauen in the middeſt of his breaſt. His

happy, or elſe ſo hardy, to enter this Caſtle, without offering you
Combate, as well to ſatiſfie mine owne deſire, as loath to offer
you any rude demean: deſiring you, if my requeſt ſtand not with

                        <hi>Don Edoard</hi> perceiuing the comely behauiour of <hi>Primaleon,</hi>
of whome hee was as ignorant, as the other was from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

Sir Knight, the hard entertainment, and vnfriendly vſage, of all
Knights whatſoeuer that enter this Caſtle, you would be loath
to ſpend ſpéech in ſuch a fond requeſt; but rather vſe ſpéed in a ſafe
retire: For as in other places you may increaſe your Fame, ſo in
this place you may ſtay to ſorrow for your Follie. If theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions

runne into a continuall trouble: knowe this, you muſt firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

of a Captaine: but heereof aſſure your ſelfe, that neither your
perſwaſion of daunger, nor the doubt it ſelfe that is to come, can
cauſe me feare at a ſhow, or ſhall make me fainte at a ſhadowe.
For this eſtimation I alwayes beare with mee, that the more
harde the Aduenture is, the brauer will be the victorie. So that

                     <p>Thus concluding their ſpéeches, they couched their Speares,

ſo brauely, that they who ſtood in the Caſtle, beholding them, did
no leſſe commend theyr Valour, then the good intent eache othar
ſhewed in hope of victorie. At laſt, ſo fiercely they met togither,
that they were both vnhorſed, which very much diſpleaſed <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon,</hi>

beeing neuer in all his life caſt foorth of his Saddle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
then drawing his ſword, he thus approched to the Prince
<hi>Don Edoard.</hi> Sir Knight, I will trye, if your ſtrength in vſing
your Sword, be equall with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> force. I haue felt at your Speare:
which hauing made mee impatient, beeing neuer before ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen,
doth increſe my courage, to know him that hath done
that at this inſtant, which in many Attempts before could not
be done by any. <hi>Don Edoard,</hi> no leſſe offended at this miſhap,
then amazed at the courage he perceiued in his Aduerſarie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſuſpect, that the Knight againſt whom he endeuored him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
was his Brother and friend <hi>Primaleon,</hi> the cauſe that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
him to think ſo, was the equall ſtate of their ſtrength, which
in time paſt he had often prooued: of which doubt to reſolue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
he thus began. Syr <hi>Primaleon,</hi> as it may rather be tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Preſumption, then politique foreſight, in him that would
ſtriue to be your matche, who are aboue all in Manhoode: ſo in
mée might it be accounted rather a Fooliſh hardineſſe, then any
friendly héede, to doe that in a Brauery, which ſhould excéede the
limites of Bountie, and to ſtriue with my Friend, whom in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
I ought moſt to honour. <hi>Primaleon</hi> hearing theſe friendly
ſpéeches: preſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tly knewe that, it was his Brother <hi>Don Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>
when caſting his Sword to the ground hee embraced the
Prince with theſe louing ſalutations. If my heart were able to
thinke, my tongue to ſpeake, or my ſelfe to make manifeſt by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
meane, not only the inward ioy I conceiue, but the high good
fortune I doo eſtéem of my trauells, then ſhould my deare friend
and brother perceyue, my health is his happines, and <hi>Primaleon</hi>
liueth no longer, then <hi>Don Edoard</hi> reioyceth. Long haue I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
this happie day, and long haue I ſought this good lucke with
daunger: albeit neuer ſo proſperous as to heare of you, yet now
the moſt fortunate of all men, to come where I ſée you. <hi>Don
Edoard</hi> would haue anſwered againe, but the Giant <hi>Pandare</hi>
brought word from <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> to breake off theyr talke, and
come to him, whoſe commandement the Prince obeying, entred
the Caſtle. <hi>Primaleon</hi> offering to goe in with him, but <hi>Pandare</hi>
beeing Armed, with a great yron Mace in his hand, and a very
ſtrong Shielde, thruſt him backe with theſe churliſh wordes.
<pb facs="tcp:13179:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Stay Sir Knight, I meane to ſée what thou canſt do, to deliuer
thée out of my hands, as alſo how thou can warrant thine own
life. <hi>Primaleon</hi> beholding the great pride of <hi>Pandare,</hi> with the
diſhonor he offred him in words, as alſo the diſdaine he tooke to
be thus controled, gaue him this anſwer. It is more difficult for
me to anſwere thée, as thy wordes require, then dangerous to
correct the boldneſſe of ſuch a proud Riuall: and I ſcorne to vſe
words with ſuch a Peaſant, whoſe maners are ſo far from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie,
as the Maiſter can neuer come in knowledge thereof:
whoſe Plumes I may pull with ſuch a due reward, as he ſhall
thinke my warrant better then his own wiſdome, &amp; that I can
eſcape his brags, when his owne brauerie may hap to lie in the
lurtch. <hi>Pandare</hi> vexed with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> reply of <hi>Primaleon,</hi> not knowing
whether he were beſt to anſwere him with words or déeds, at
laſt ſent him ſuch a blow with his yron Mace, that <hi>Primaleons</hi>
ſhield ſhiuered all in pieces, which grieued him, ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in ſome
néed, &amp; made his foe triumph, who hoped for his death. But hée
eſpying a part of the body of <hi>Pandare</hi> vnarmed, reacheth him
ſuch a blow in reuenge of his Shield, that he began to ſtagger,
hardly withholding himſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falling to the earth, &amp; <hi>Dramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiande</hi>
leaning with <hi>Don Edoard,</hi> foorth of a windowe in the
Caſtell, and perceiuing the courage of <hi>Primaleon</hi> in this daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Combate: deſired to know his name, and of whence he
was which <hi>Don Edoard</hi> anſwered, according as he deſired, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
him further to vnderſtand, that not onely in this, but in
many other aduentures, hee had put his life in hazard, onely for
his ſake. Which when <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> knewe, hee determined
<hi>Primaleon</hi> for apartner with <hi>Don Edoard,</hi> and to kéepe them
twaine in captiuitie, till Fortune ſent more cuſtomers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pandare</hi> ſéeing his blowes beſtowed to ſmal purpoſe, &amp; that
<hi>Primaleon</hi> returned him many ſhrewde gréetings, flung down
his Sworde and Target, in a great furie, pretending the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of <hi>Primaleon,</hi> with his yron Mace. And after many
ſore ſtrokes, paſſed on either part, <hi>Primaleon</hi> followed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
ſo well, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he had ſtroken off <hi>Pandares</hi> fowre fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
wherewith his Mace fell to the ground, which he ſtooping
to recouer, <hi>Primaleon</hi> had gotten ſuch good aduantage, that hee

had ſtroken off his head, had not the ougly Giant <hi>Alligan</hi> of the
<hi>Obſcure Caue,</hi> bene his Reſcue, who ſtepping betwéene them,
thus ſaluted <hi>Primaleon.</hi> Syr Knight, thou haſt a freſh labour
to beginne: wherefore withdrawe thy hands from him that is
conqnered, and come deale with me, who hopes to conquer thée:
and therewithall <hi>Primaleon,</hi> being not fully prouided, receiued
ſuch a cruell blowe on the head, that it put him in ſome danger.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſéeing ſuch a fearefull Enemie, and what mighty
blowes he ſtill charged him withall, he bethought him on his
Friende <hi>Don Edoard,</hi> whoſe helpe in this fierce aſſault might
doe him no ſmall pleaſure. Yet hee conſidered with himſelfe,
that doubtleſſe he was in ſome néede, or ſo kept vnder, that hee
might not aſſiſt him, elſe hee perſwaded himſelfe, he would be
as requiſite to helpe him, as hée ready to wiſh for him. Then
hee taking vp the Shielde of <hi>Pandare,</hi> betwéene <hi>Alligan</hi> and
himſelfe began a hotteſkirmiſh, as the place where they fought,
altered in colour with theyr blood, made manifeſt. Yet <hi>Alligan</hi>
for all his rough behauiour, had little hope of any good ſucceſſe,
becauſe the hardineſſe of <hi>Primaleon,</hi> hadde both martyred his
Shield and Armour in pieces, ſo that he had no defence to beare
off the blowes., but by the freſh and eager Aſſaults of the Noble
hearted Prince, he brought him vnto ſuch a lowe eſtate, that he
ſuppoſed he had quight ſlaine him. Which mooued him to ſitte
downe to reſt him, for that faintneſſe with loſſe of his blood, and
wearyneſſe in ſo long continuing Battell, made him both glad
and deſirous of a little eaſe,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> perceyuing the harde euent of this Combat,
and ſtanding in doubt that Fortune by ſome ſiniſter meanes or
other, would ſéeke his ouerthrowe, and ſo depriue him of that
he looked for, and what his Aunte laboured for, Armed himſelfe
preſently, and came foorth to <hi>Primaleon,</hi> aſſailing him firſt with
theſe wordes. Syr Knight, my Friend if you pleaſe, my foe, if
you dare: in the one you may finde comfort in your diſtreſſe, in

                        </gap> it were more honour for you to
yéelde, with no blemiſh to your Knighthoode, then to endure a
freſh Aſſault, which will be to your great hazarde. So, if you

eſtéeme of my courteous offer, I will ſée your wounds cured at
mine owne charge, and your weake eſtate comforted, as beſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

of a ſhrewde meaning, made him this anſwere.</p>
                     <p>If ſir, by the paine I haue beſtowed, &amp; ſharpe encounters I
haue eudured, I might purchaſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> deliuery of my deareſt friend

that hautie enterpriſe, which if intreatie will not ſerue, ſhall be
gayned perforce, and where courteſſe is not eſtéemed, compulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

doeth diſcharge my heart of feare, and the hope I haue of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
bids me rather die, then be vanquiſhed, ſo ſhall I award the
reproch of the world, and be true to my friend, whoſe ſafetie I

                     <p>
                        <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> at this pauſe, tooke occaſion to reply in this
manner: Sir Knight, for two cauſes I account it honour, to vſe
thée courteouſly. The firſt is, that I greatly pittie the harme,
which may enſue to an vnuiſed heade, which doth that in a
brauerie for a faſhion, he is glad with bitter teares, to bemoane
in folly. The ſecond cauſe is, that to conquer thée, would rather
diſcredite me, then any honour were to be gotten by the victory,
conſidering thy vnfortunate and miſerable eſtate, with the
Knightly puiſſance I ſhall beſtowe on thee. Neuertheleſſe, to

Vpon theſe words he laid fiercely at <hi>Primaleon,</hi> (whoſe
debility rather required quietneſſe, then ſuch extreame ſtrokes

                     <p>So aduancing him to one of theſe ſtrange knights, who was

my miſfortune denies it ſhould be fo: for that I haue ſafely tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled

there, too ſoone I fell into extreame daunger: which I muſt ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

as deny to helpe faire Ladies, in ſo great a hazard. For the
Shield I had in charge to deliuer your Maieſtie, &amp; the reward
of that knight, whoſe deſert is méeteſt, is taken from me, by a
Knight in gréene Armor, who bearing in his Shield, a <hi>Sauage

For this cauſe did I ſo circumſpectly behold your Knights, to

is ſir knight, neither for gaine or glory, but for friendly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
I beare you, to bind vp your wounds, which are as grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous

thus ſhortly anſwered. Sir, if the apparance of my griefe,
take ſuch deſire in you to do me good, you may do as you ſhal find
occaſion, &amp; I remaine the more déepe in your debt. But I iudge
you are either ouerfond, or elſe forgetfull of your ſelfe, to offer
ſuch friendſhip to a ſtranger, who doth neither deſire it, nor can
any way deſerue it, you being as I ſuppoſe, rather come to ſtay
me, then ſalue me. Sir (quoth <hi>Palmerin)</hi> the eſtate I ſée you in,
doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand me to vſe this ſpéech, &amp; conſtraine me (if I might)
to be your ſuccour, neither fearing what you can doe, or falling
one iote from that I ſhould doe. But to tell you why I come, is
to deſire you by intreaty, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pel you by force, to reſtore a ſhield
againe, which you haue diſloyally taken from a trauelling La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Conſidering you might diminiſh your honour if you ſhould
deale with her ſo vngratefully, &amp; ſéeme an enemy to knighthood,
in not regarding to helpe the wrong of any iniured Lady. The
knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> beholding the great courteſie of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin,</hi>
&amp; eſtéeming his words to be ſpoken for his aduantage:
both conquered by his braue behauiour, as alſo the inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
that did naturally moue him, gaue him this anſwere. I
haue often heard (Sir knight) that wordes can more déepely
wound, then weapons, &amp; that courteſie can compell, where cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
may neuer conquer. Such hath bin your high good fortune
at this time, &amp; ſuch is the knightly demeanor that I haue ſéene,
as your gentle language hath entred, where your lance cannot,
and your friendſhip woon more, then either feare or force may
conſtraine. And ſéeing you haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the paines to find me out,
and haue done more at this inſtant, then before could any, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
you the ſhield, as beſt worthy to weare it, both for the gifts
of Nature, which floriſh in you abundantly, &amp; gratious Nature
which doeth adore you nobly. With theſe words, he imbracing
the P. <hi>Palmerin,</hi> preſently mounted on horſebacke, &amp; departed.
Then returned the Prince accompanied with his knights, who
were greatly delighted in beholding the Shield: In the midſt

                     <p>This <hi>Aliart,</hi> reputed of no leſſe fame then learning, was not
inferiour to any, but bare the eſtimation aboue all, ſo that none

ſingular in his practiſed Arte. And then hee vnderſtood his

at <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who by the ſkill of his Aunt <hi>Eutropa,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured
to haue all the flower of Chiualrie in like captiuitie.
But albeit the impriſonment of theſe Princes, was vnknown
<pb facs="tcp:13179:38"/>
to all the Knightes, that laboured continually in their ſearch:
yet this <hi>Aliart</hi> was ſo well acquainted with the matter, as they
that kept it moſt ſecrete, for that his Arte gaue him the power
to knowe, what was done in all Countreyes in the world. For
when the <hi>Grecian</hi> knights, whoſe affection to theſe two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
cauſed them to leaue their natiue Countrey, and were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
into the vnfortunate forreſt of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> which
was brauely repleniſhed with many couragious hearts, as alſo
ſundry gallant Ladies, preparing many hard aduentures,
there were very fewe eſcaped, but for the moſt part, were all

was <hi>Recined</hi> Prince of <hi>Spaine, Arnedes</hi> King of <hi>France, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iortes,</hi>

left their kingdomes and ſignories, and vnhappily were taken

whoſe force he little or nothing eſtéemed, but bare a great
deſire to his aduenture, which could no way be finiſhed, but by
his meanes onely.</p>
                     <p>In this mind he departed to the <hi>Valley of Perdition,</hi> which
was named ſo, becauſe all the noble Knights were there loſt:
and there he determined to make his habitation, to follow his
ſtudie, and prouide remedies againſt diuerſe miſchanches that
were like to happen. And becauſe his nature deſired to be ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
in that his bringing vp was forth of all company, he buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him a little Fortreſſe betwéene two great high mountaines,
which kept the light of the Sunne away by day, and the Moone
in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> night ſeaſon. This dwelling he called the <hi>Obſcure Valley,</hi>
but others tearmed it, the <hi>Valley aboce the Clowdes:</hi> the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance

Giant <hi>Trabollant,</hi> to know to his coſt, with his ſon alſo, who
was Lord of a faire Caſtell in a Velley néere adioyning, which
<hi>Aliart</hi> had newly erected, &amp; garniſhed within, with many faire
Bookes, where ſpending his time very long in ſtudie, at laſt,
he got the meane to be called <hi>Sage.</hi> Thus liued the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi>
in this <hi>Obſcure Volley,</hi> often vſing to the Caſtle of <hi>Dramuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ande,</hi>
bemoning the miſfortune of the Knights, which he could
no way remedy, till the appointed time. The often repayring of
the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi> cauſed both <hi>Eutropa</hi> to doubt ſomething, and
<hi>Dramuſiande</hi> to ſtand in great feare: yet could they no way
hinder him, when it was his pleaſure, to viſite the captiue prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
And as he ſate one day very penſiue in his ſtudy, he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by his Art of the triumpes at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when the
Emperour would try the yong Knights, that he had nouriſhed
in his Court. Againſt which time he framed a ſhield, which hee
ſent by a Damoſell, to <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> to beare it with
him in all aduentures that he ſhould vndertake: but by the way
it was taken from her by the knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> (whom

the deliuery of the Princes, who concealed their griefes, and
ſpent their time in ſilent opinions, as both their miſerie would
ſuffer them, and their litle reſt inferre occaſion. Yet neuer fallig

he hath obſerued his dutie in the Field. Wherevpon <hi>Don

which remained a whileſome what doubtfull, for that they had
battered one an others Armour very much, till at laſt, <hi>Polendos</hi>

                     <p>Then came foorth the Giant <hi>Pandare,</hi> commaunding <hi>Don-Edward</hi>
to goein againe: to whoſe commaund he obeyed, very
ſorie that he might not ſpeake to the knight he laſt ranne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
So entring into the Caſtle, the Prince <hi>Vernar</hi> thruſt in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

will hath ledde you beyond your witte, for that in this place you
ſhall abide more diſtreſſe then in all your life time: you cannot
fall into like danger, but he that is deſperate of himſelfe, would
little eſtéeme his Friends life. <hi>Vernar</hi> hearing theſe words, and
not knowing who he was, and halfe angry at his ill lucke, made
him this anſwere. Syr, I eſtéeme your witte, as litle as my

any troth to your words: And this vnderſtand, that neither year,
nor any ſhall withdraw my deſire, although I buy it with mine

Mace, ſo that betweene them twaine, was a fierce ſkirmiſh, and
<hi>Primaleon</hi> leaning in his Chamber windowe, tooke great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

that his Father <hi>Trincus</hi> was alſo the cauſer of the death of his

                     <p>Then was the Gate held open, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that way, till miſhap brought them to this cruell Caſtle, where

                     <p>Vppon theſe words, <hi>Recinde</hi> couched his Speare, but the
Knight of the <hi>Dogge</hi> offered him this ſtay. Syr, it ſéemes you
neither regard ciuilitie, nor Knightly courteſie, to offer mee this
great wrong: who both came before you, and was prepared
before you, and therefore of right ought to beginne before you.
<hi>Recinde,</hi> ſomwhat mooued at theſe wordes, ſhaped him this
replie. Syr, if in a brauery you ſéeke to goe beyond mée, or in
peremptory wordes, to beare the Prize away, you are farre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued:
for that words cannot cutface me, nor your weapons
feare me, for I was firſt prouided, and therefore will not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented.
<hi>Don Edward</hi> perceyuing theſe queſtions were like to

would gladly diſcouer his earneſt minde, but that hee feared to
procure the ill will of his Miſtreſſe. It chanced on a night, the

came and ſate downe by her, both of them ouercome with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                     <p>Theſe are the Paſſions of a Louer, which entreth through
Idleneſſe, is kindled by Deſire, ſet on fire by affection, and if
Perſeuerance helpe not, is vtterly waſted by Deſperation.
After <hi>Palmerin</hi> had ſitten a good while, and his Lady ſtil ſilent,
he gaue her occaſion to ſpeake by theſe ſpéeches. Faire Miſtres,
if I might as fréely ſpeake with your blame, as my thoughts
are farre from any ſpot to bounty, I ſhould then eſtéeme my ſelf

may cut his fancie by your pardon, and on no preſumption, I

                     <p>It is ſo, that feeling in my ſelfe the deſire of honour, which I
can no way attaine, but by ſome hautie enterpriſe, I haue
thought good to venter among the Pikes of miſchaunces, either
to encreaſe my renowne, or ende my life in an infamous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch.
For many wil ſend at large their ſpéeches of defame, and
on a priuate ſpight ſeeke to worke me diſcredite: as lo, there is
the Knight that crept into his Fetherbed, when Fame doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure

                     <p>The Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda</hi> perceiuing his intent, &amp; her gentle

                     <p>Ladie (quoth <hi>Palmerin)</hi> though the cauſe be in you, yet is it no

honour: that I can no way recouer you ſuch duetie as I ought,
albeit I trauailed for your ſake, through my whole life. And
to ſée ſuch a gratious perſon vnrequited, my ſelfe being now of
yéeres, to put recompence in proofe, I might rightly deſerue to
be reproched of all men, much more to be refuſed of ſo ſwéete a
Saint. The Princeſſe ariſing in a maruellous choller, highly
offended at his paſſed talke, ſhe gaue him this cooling, to quaile
his hot attempt. I haue often truſted, and béene rewarded with
treaſon, and where I placed ſtedfaſt affection, I haue bin ſooneſt
beguiled: which now I repent, when it is too late, and bridle
my fancy, when I ſée mine owne folly. Wherefore, ſéeing my

company, I giue you this command, in your poaſting voyage,
that as you wil thinke to honour me, ſéeme not to preſume into
my preſence, which I both bind you by my duty, and ſtraightly
command you to obſerue. So turning her back, ſhe flung away
in a fume: leauing <hi>Palmerin</hi> in ſuch an alteration, as one could
hardly iudge, if he had any life left in him. But as happe was,
no body was preſent to deſcrie his heauy complaintes, for that
euery body had conducted his Lady to her Chamber: ſauing the
Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi> who ſtayed not to be intreated, but went
flinging through the Gallerie, as greatly vexed, as ſhe had left

                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> departing to his lodging, toſſing and tumbling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

diſcurteſie, hee fell into an agonie as bitter as the death, not
ſuffering ſléepe to enter into his head, but ſtill bewayled the

his Ladies commaund, albeit to his great paine, in graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
conſent. Then getting on his Armour, which bare the
colour of a Harte in the Forreſt, very thickly ſet with little
golden ſhrubbes, and bearing in his Shield <hi>Fortune,</hi> holding
her tottering and vnſteady whéele, and naming himſelfe the
Knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi> hee very ſecretly departed, accompanied

becauſe they were nouriſhed together, and hee bare the
Shield of the <hi>Palme Tree,</hi> that was ſent him from the <hi>Sage A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liart,</hi>
neither taking leaue of the Emperor, nor of any, but in the
vehemency of his griefe, mounted on horſebacke, &amp; ſo rode both
away. All the way as they rode, <hi>Siluian</hi> endeuored himſelfe by
perſwaſion, to driue away his heauineſſe, but he was as farre
from his purpoſe, as the Prince himſelfe was deuoide of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
who rode on, vſing no words, he was ouercome with ſuch
an extreame melancholy. Yet was his affection ſo earneſtly
grounded on his Lady, as he vowed in her behalf, to aduenture

In which time, <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſeeing no body néer, and remembring
the great vnkindneſſe of his Ladie, entred into theſe heauie
mournings. O <hi>Palmerin,</hi> ſon to a poore <hi>Sauage man,</hi> and borne
in the vnfortunate forreſt of great <hi>Britaine,</hi> too ſoone preferred
to honor, and too late thrown down into hatred. What regard

what eſtimation hadſt thou of modeſtie, to mooue ſo great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
in thy gracious Miſtreſſe, whoſe loue was the only ſtate

Ah ſweet Ladie, on your courteous pitie, let paſſe my preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and what hath been more then dutie, impute to may rude
behauiour, which your clemencie may both puniſh and pardon.
And yet my good Ladie, if you reſpect my truſty ſeruice, with the
conſtant loyaltie I haue alway borne to your Soueraigntie,
my fault committed raſhly, deſerueth no ſuch repulſe, in that
this ingratitude is too much for you to ſhew, and more then I

my words to bee for your honour, and not worthie any

And yet am I contented to abide your hard doome, and
according to your pleaſure, waſt my daies in diſtreſſe, till either
you will mooue you to recant, or my ſpotleſſe loyaltie to relieue
my miſhap, which the longer you deſerre, the more is my dolor,
and you remaining obſtinate, my paines are helpeleſſe: but that
your gentlenes giueth me hope your diſpleaſure ſhall end with

                     <p>Thus hauing finiſhed his complaintes, he drew neare to the
Caſtle, where by good hap he heard the ſound of Muſicke, which
gaue him occaſion to enter further. And comming to a great
Hall, he eſpyed in one of the corners, one ſitting all in blacke,
with a fair long Beard, and a very graue countenance, ſhewing
by his ſad complexion, that he had more minde to moane, then to
any myrth. <hi>Palmerin</hi> would not as yet enter any further, leaſt
he ſhould break off his quiet exerciſe, which was, in ſinging ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſadde Dittyes to his Lute, that himſelfe had framed, in the

he gaue his Ladie, as that none might compare with her
for beautie and brauerie: was very much offended, in that hee
eſteemed all Ladyes, as counterfeite to his fayre <hi>Polynarda,</hi>
wherefore hee brake off the Knightes Sonnet, with this kinde
of Salutation. Me thinkes Syr, you either want manners, or

they fell ſtraite to fight, eache of them behauing themſelus very
valiantly: but the Knight of <hi>Death</hi> was at length throwne to

<hi>Palmerins</hi> lucke was ſo fortunate, that he ouercame his enemy,

none but you: I will in my aduentures, ſo blaze your memorie,

As he rode on in this <hi>Valley,</hi> he eſpyed a great trée, whereon

was a Caue or Den, at the etrance whereof lay Trunchions

ſomewhat abaſhed, yet very well pleaſed with the ciuill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor
he perceiued in him. Then kneeling downe to kiſſe his
Maieſties hand, he was not ſuffered as he would, but was kept
backe, which he abiding very patiently, began to fire his eyes
vppon the Empreſſe, and her Courtly Ladyes, to ſee if he could
finde the Ladie, that might for beauty, compare with his <hi>Altea,</hi>
and after a good whiles pauſe, in this order he began to render
his ſpéeches. Moſt puiſſant Emperour, let not my boldneſſe be
admitted to any ill intent, or my rude behauiour, to merite your
gracious diſliking, to whome I not onely vowe, my heart and
hand, but my vnfained ſeruice, to the houre of my death.</p>
                     <p>I am that vnhappy Knight, whoſe miſfortunes can not bee
recounted, for that all my life hitherto, hath bin nothing but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie,
and am threatned to ſpende all my life in infinite calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which hath drawne my minde into ſuch a debilitie, that I
can neither honour your Grace as I ſhould, nor behaue my ſelfe
as gladly I would.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, when I had appointed my minde to a quiet eſtate,
which I thought no miſhappe could alter, or any extreamitie
chaunge, but reſolued my ſelfe on an infallible ioye, Aye me, one
fling of Fortune ouerturned all, and the Heauen of my happines
became a hateful Hell. When my youthfull yéeres allured me
to Loue, and fancie made choyce to mine owne good lyking, I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
my ſelf the happieſt of any man aliue, though my chance
were more hatefull, then my griefe can vnfolde.</p>
                     <p>For ſpight, not onely berefte of my Ladie, but allotted my
poore ſelfe to exreame ill lucke, when I forſooke all Courtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
onely determining to waſte my tune in a ſolitary kinde
of life, which I ſpent in remembrance of her, who moſt regarded
me, and ſtill lauding her Beautie (which I eſtéemed aboue all)
there I remayned (mee thought) a merrie, though indéede a
<pb facs="tcp:13179:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mournfull time. Yet was not Fortune ſatiſfied, but rubbeth
a freſh gréefe vpon the gréene wound, in ſending a knight to
breake off my ſilent deuotions, who repining that I ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll
my Lady, aboue his Saint that was vnknowne to me, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the fight, which returned to my foile, he bare away the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie,
and I was vanquiſhed. Thus haue I bene euer indama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
euery way diſtreſſed (and may ſay, that no knight can ſay)
I am the onely man for miſhap. And becauſe I will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
ſo ingratefull to my Lady, that one repulſe ſhall make me
forſake her ſwéete ſhrine, I haue vowed in all Princes courts,
to extoll her beautie, to whom (referring compariſons) I can
eſtéeme none her equall. And theſe Knights who honour their
Ladies, and dare contend with my <hi>Altea,</hi> either for beautie, or
bountie, I am ready to giue Combate to all, for that I will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the ſuperioritie to none. As concerning the order appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this fight, which I would all to obey, and none to break:
thus vnder your gratious leaue, it is requeſted. That thoſe
knights, who eſteeme their quarrell ſo good, as to enter the field
for the beautie of their Ladyes, ſhall bring with them her Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait,
for whoſe ſake they aduenture, which wil be to their own
honour, and fame of their Ladies. Beſide, if my hap be ſo good as
to gaine the victorie, they muſt enter my tent, to render their
Armour, and their names to be regiſtred in my booke, which I
haue tearmed the <hi>Sepulchre of Louers.</hi> But if my enemy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
contrary to my expectation, he ſhall be Lord of the riches
which remaineth in my tent, beſide, my ſelfe as his vaſſaile, to
ſtand at his pleaſure. And this fauour I muſt requeſt of your
Grace, that none ſhall not enter Combat, with the ſword, with
out he be able, to mate me in the Iuſt. This is the cauſe of my
coming, procured through the knight y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gaue me the ouerthrow,
who proteſted himſelfe to be of your Court, for which cauſe, I
deſire that I may here begin my knightly enterpriſe, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to my tent, to expect the comming, of him that dare firſt
preſume. Thus with taking leaue, he departed to his tent, the
Emperour remaining deſirous to know of whence he was:
which was declared to him by ſome of his Court, that he was
<pb facs="tcp:13179:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Floraman,</hi> Sonne to ancient King of <hi>Sardignia,</hi> at which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
the Emperour was very ſorry, that he had not entertained
him, according to his vallor and Nobilitie of birth. On the next
day, the knights prepared themſelues before the Tent of the
Knight of <hi>Death,</hi> and the Emperour, with the Ladies of the
Court, ſtanding ready to behold the Combate, which was firſt
enterpriſed the y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince <hi>Gracian,</hi> for the loue of <hi>Claritia,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the king <hi>Polendos,</hi> being gallantly mounted, all in gylt

ſpéeches. Faire Miſtres, I deſire you to continue your woonted

The Emperour commanded the Tournament ſhould end for

ſo vexed <hi>Polynard,</hi> that he became ſo troubleſome to them
both in talke and behauiour, that he would neither yéelde his
Armour, nor obey the orders that were appointed in the field,
which cauſed the Emperor to giue him a great check, wherupon
he departed, giuing great offence to the knight of <hi>Death,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
that which was his right and tytle to haue.</p>
                     <p>Then dealt he with fiue knights more, and vanquiſhed them
all, ſending them into his Tent, to the <hi>Sepulchre of Louers,</hi> by

the Ladies withdrew themſelues, and euery one departed, till

was endes, the Emperour went to the ſtent to ſée the knight
of <hi>Death,</hi> to whom he gaue no ſmall commendations for the

the fauour, which was my accuſtomed reward, he denyed me at
this time, for that your beautie maketh me enter the field,
which I will maintaine to my deſire, or ſuſtaine thd death. So
deliuering the table to the Regardants, who were appointed
to receiue it, they ſet the Spurres to the horſes, and met with
ſuch puiſſance together, that they were both throwne to the
earth, when drawing their Swords, they charged one another
ſo brauely, that this combate bare the commendation, aboue
all that had béene ſéene at that Tournament.</p>
                     <p>Great deſire had the Emperour, to know the knight of the
<hi>Speere,</hi> but their fierce encountring, would not ſuffer any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to be made. Retiring a little to take breath, the knight
of <hi>Death</hi> beheld his Armour, all flaſht and broken, on the faire
face of <hi>Altea,</hi> which cauſed him to fall into theſe complaints.</p>
                     <p>Ah my ſwéete <hi>Altea,</hi> how can I deſire your fauour, or make
account to enioy your loue, ſuffering your blameleſſe face to

the honour of all good Fortune.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, the Knight of the <hi>Shpere</hi> complayned to
his Lady, ſaying: How happy might I eſtéeme my ſelf, my (good
Lady) if for the price of my wounds, I might enforce my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
to ſay, you are the onely Goddeſſe of beauty, which either I
will do, or die, ere I depart out of the field. But if you with
draw your fauour, then ſhall mine enemie be conqueror, and I
conſtrained to liue in eternall detriment of my life. By this
time it waxed very darke, &amp; becauſe they would not giue ouer,
the Emperour cauſed Torches to be lighted, which gaue great
cauſe of courage to them both, to ſée the good will of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and would not depart the field till one were conquerour.
At laſt ioyning themſelues together, through extreame faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and wearineſſe, they fel both to the ground, but the knight
of the <hi>Sphere</hi> was vnderneath, the Ragardaunts giuing the
victorie to the knight of <hi>Death.</hi> Then leading the knight into
the Tent, where he rendred his Armour, and his name to the
<hi>Sepulchre of Louers,</hi> they knew him to be <hi>Berolde</hi> the prince
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which when the Emperour heard, he ſent for him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Pallace, where he was carefully tended, vntill his health
was perfectly reſtored, yet he was maruellouſly offended with
himſelfe, that his Lady paſt without the honour of the day.</p>
                     <p>The knight of <hi>Death</hi> could beare no Armour a great while
after, for that he had found the puiſſance of the Prince <hi>Berol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi>
of no leſſe force, then worthy commendations. But when
he had gained hs good eſtate of helth, he ſtil maintained his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
againſt many ſtrangue knights, of whom by his good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
he had alwaies the victorie, repleniſhing his <hi>Sepulchre of

gaue him ſuch honour, in the time he endured his aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that he was double encoured, to maintaine the beauty

in this manner to vſe his intreatie. Syr Knight, the

(anſwered the Gréene knight) as concerning the knight of the

pace, and vſing a heauy clamor all the way as he rode, to whom
they aduanced themſelues, deſirous to knowe the cauſe of his
complaints. To whome the Gentleman declared, that thrée
knights had taken a Lady from him, deſiring greatly to abuſe
her honour: wherefore he requeſted them, as they tendered the
eſtate of Ladies, ſo they would helpe to defend her from iniury.</p>
                     <p>This heauy tale, vrged them to ride with the Gentleman,
till by Fortune they met with the Damoſel, in the Forreſt of

                     <p>The Knight of <hi>Death</hi> was ſomewhat offended, to ſée eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

perceyued his faire <hi>Polynarda,</hi> whoſe preſence made him (as it

you are now in place where you muſt vſe your ſtrength, and not
your ſtudie: be mindfull of your Ladie, but not to the detriment
of your owne life. Theſe wordes awaked him, when hee thus
talked to to himſelfe. My déere Miſtreſſe, I would thinke my

that I feare mine enimie, but that it would giue me the greater

him the Picture of his Ladie, as it was the cuſtome: to which
he thus anſwered. I am loath to ſhew my Ladies fauour, for

becauſe they could not reach the port of <hi>Moricque.</hi> The knight

perſwaded him to the contrary, with theſe words. I deſire you
Sir, to take good reſpect in what you enterpriſe, for well you

vſe a good foreſight, ſo may you the better preuent any
<pb facs="tcp:13179:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For on yonder Mountaine, dwelleth a Giant of no leſſe vgly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of perſon, then renowned in his puiſſance, hee hath to
name <hi>Calfurnien,</hi> whoſe crueltie is ſuch, that if any chance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

be ruled by your friend, who would be loath you ſhould fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſo great folly. Syr (quoth the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi>
I giue you as great thankes, as I perceiue your counſell ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to my welfare: But it he be ſo cruell as you ſpeake of, it
were good to teach him ſome courteſie, if he can conceiue none
of himſelfe. And ſo much truſt do I repoſe in Fortune, that
ſhee will ſuffer me to deale with him, albeit not to conquer him
which if it returne the loſſe of my life, I eſtéeme it the leſſe, in
ſo much as he ſhall perceiue courage and courteſie, in one that
would wiſh as much in himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The maiſter ſeeing no perſwaſion might auaile, ſent him
with his Eſquire <hi>Artifer</hi> on land in the little Cocke, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him to the reward of all good Fortune. The knight of the
<hi>Sauage man,</hi> accompanyed with his Eſquire, trauelled vp the
Mountaine, which was very thicke beſet with Trées, till at
laſt he came to a little Pauilion, before which lay a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Trunchions of Speares and broken Armour, belonging to
ſuch knights, as were there foyled, in ſeeking the Caſtle.
Walking on farder in a litlle path, which he ſaw traced with
very freſh blood, he was lead by the droppes thereof, to the
ſight of the Caſtle gate, which was placed on ſuch an vnmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable
height, that he was faine to alight, and walk vpon foot,
his armour being very troubleſome vnto him, and walking
thorow ſuch a narrow paſſage, that hee was very wearie.
When he had attained the top of the hill, hee ſaw the Giant,
being ſuch a man, as the Maſter of the Ship reported, before
him ſtoode ſeuen well appointed men at Armes, holding fowre
knights on their knées before the Giant. Thrée Ladies looking
foorth at the Caſtle window, which the Gianteſſe kept there (as
Priſoners perforce) ſéeing the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> and
ſorrowing any good knight, ſhould come to ſuch a Tyrant, they
all began a grieuous and ſorrowfull lamentation. The Giant
eſpying the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> ſent thrée of his knights
<pb facs="tcp:13179:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to take him, and bring him to his preſence, who ſtood leaning
vpon his Sword, for that he was very wearie with comming
vp the high hill: then they came to him, commaunding him
to yéeld, or elſe they would ſlay him. The knight of the <hi>Sauage
man,</hi> hearing their rough wordes, ſtoode not waiting for nice
tearmes, but made this anſwere. I rather chuſe to abide the
danger, in denying your command, then to truſt to your cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie,
in yéelding my ſelfe, for as I little eſtéeme your friendſhip,

                        </gap> I make leſſe account of your furie. With theſe wordes
he ſaluted one of them ſo friendly vpon the head, that hee fell

                        </gap>: as for the other twaine, he dealt with
them ſo reaſonably, that hee paid them their debt in the ſame

                     <p>Then aduancing himſelfe to the Caſtell gate, <hi>Calfurnien</hi>
who had knowledge of this miſhap, came foorth very ſtronglie
armed with a mightie ſhield, and a great Mace of Iron, hauing
the head very thicke beſet with Azure nailes, that no ſhield nor
armour, but it would enter into: and in this manner he ſpake
to the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man.</hi> Alas, poore knight, Fortune
was not ouermuch thy friend, when ſhe conducted thee hither,
but rather thought her ſelfe much cumbred with thée, and that
I ſhould ſacrifice thée to her for mine owne honour. The abuſe

ſo ſharpe for thée, as thou wilt wiſh thy boldneſſe had béen bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
gouerned. The courteous knight, who had neuer ſéene any
Giant before, and maruelling at his mightie ſtature, would
not vſe any perſwaſion to himſelfe of proſperous ſucceſſe, but
in this manner gaue him his anſwere.</p>
                     <p>Me thinks ſir, it were more commendation for you, and
greater honour euery way, to diſburden your heart of cruell at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
and embrace a courteous and ciuill kinde of life. For
as God hath made you more mighty then other men, ſo to thoſe
that are your inferiours, you ſhould vſe a gentle demeanour,
which would better agrée with Knighthood, then with ſauage
qualities. <hi>Calfurnien</hi> was in ſuch a rage at theſe wordes, that
he preſently returned him this anſwere. I would there were
before me, tenne of the ſtrongeſt Knightes on the earth, that I
<pb facs="tcp:13179:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might reuenge theſe taunting wordes on them, becauſe thy
death can not ſatiſfie my furie, and then ſhouldeſt thou per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
what it were to me with impatience. God Syr (quoth
the knight of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi> diſdaine not weake men, though
your owne ſtrength be monſtrous: but if it ſhall like you, to
Combate in the Court within your Caſtell, I may hap to ſaue
mine Knights a labour, becauſe a tenth is here, who though hee
be not ſo big as ten, will doe as much one. Then <hi>Calfurnien</hi>
willed the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> to goe with him into the
Caſtell, and at length they came into a faire Court, where ſtood
a faire Fountaine, the water iſſuing foorth of the mouthes of

the King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein he would often recreate himſelfe,
when he rode on hunting: but the father of this Giant, named
<hi>Rauiaſſor,</hi> tooke it from the King perforce, and liued therein,
with all his progenie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Calfurnien</hi> and the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

that the victorie ſtood very doubtfull, eſpecially in the knight
of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> who had his Shield all broken in péeces
by <hi>Calfurnien</hi> his Mace of Iron, beſide, the ſore blowes he had
vpon his body, put him in great danger of his life. Yet did he
ſo well apply himſelfe to <hi>Calfurnien,</hi> that he had mangled his
bodie, armes and legs, in diuerſe places, which mooued him to
ſuch anger, that he threw downe his Shield, taking his Mace
in both handes, intending the preſent death of the hardie
knight. But he eſcaping the ſtroke, and taking vp his Shield,
which was ſomewhat too heauy for him: held him play, till he
was glad to draw his Fauchion, wherwith he ſent ſuch a blow
vpon his owne Shield, that he could not recouer his Fauchion
out againe, which the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> perceiuing,

And ſince your Maieſtie hath quickened mine idle Nature, and

do not a little diſpleaſe me, in that it was my deſire to contend

The good opinion you hold of him (anſwered the Knight)
maketh me the more affectionate to ſéeke him, and the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
his deeds is, the greatter eſtimation ſhall I conceyue to
deale with ſuch a one. For if Fortune ſtand my friend, and I
conquere him, that is ſo well liked of all, I doubt not, but the
reputation I ſhall gaine, will conſtraine you to thinke as well
of me, as now you repoſe a good affiance in him. <hi>Tremoran,</hi>
the ſonne to the Duke <hi>Leceſia,</hi> and Nephew to the Emperour
<hi>Trineus,</hi> hearing the proud wordes of the Knight, aduanced
himſelfe towards him, with this greeting. Imagine that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
hath been greatly your friend, to ſend you hither when he
is gone, leaſt by miſaduenture, you ſhould chaunce to méete
him, who wold ſo ſettle your armor to your ſhoulders, that you
would curſe your Lady, to abide his Canuazado. Neuertheles,
albeit he is not here, yet he hath ſuch friends here, as would bee
ſorrie you ſhould depart without ſome recompence for your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.
And vnder the Emperours correction, I will be the man
that ſhall bring you acquainted with the Knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi> ſo
that ere you depart, you ſhall know he hath left ſuch friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him, as will giue liberall entertainement to thoſe that ſeek
him in this manner.</p>
                     <p>The Knight was halfe offended at the words of <hi>Tremoran,</hi>
which made him preſently to giue this reply. I thinke ſir, the
good will you beare to the Knight, maketh you ſo fooliſh hardy
in that which appertaineth not vnto you, yet becauſe you dare
aduenture ſo much in his behalfe, and will welcome Knights in
ſuch a brauery, arme your ſelfe preſently, becauſe I would bee
loath a cold calme ſhould come ouer this hotte matter. The
Emperour (though vnwilling) accepted their gages, and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them licence to Combate. When in ſhort time <hi>Tremoran</hi>
came into the fielde, gallantly mounted, wearing blacke Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
as the ſigne of his heauineſſe, for the departure of the

at the ſound of the Trumpets, they couched their Speares,

that the Trunchions of their Speares flew vp into the
Ayre, and were faine at laſt to ende their Combate with their

Swords. In fine, what with expence of Blood, griefe of theyr

not to vſe wordes, but ſtrooke at the Prince very vehemently,

which was greatly pittied by the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi>
who ſaw a knight came haſtily riding after her, whereupon ſhe
began to this gentle knight, in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Good Sir, as you regard the honor of knighthood, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
<pb facs="tcp:13179:72" rendition="simple:additions"/>
eſtate of a poore Damoſell, ſo at this time helpe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
me from him that ſeekes to diſhonour me, of that which
maketh me eſteemed amongſt all vertuous perſons. Theſe
words pierced ſo déepe into his noble minde, that he ſtaied the
knights coming, who was very well armed, and brauely
mounted, to whom he began in theſe words. I perceiue both
knighthood, and that armor is ill beſtowed vpon you, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
your ſelfe in the perſecution of a faire Damoſel, when you
are both bound by dutie, and by law of armes to defend her.</p>
                     <p>Sir (anſwered the ſtrange knight) I deſire you, let not the
fained teares, and vniuſt complauit of this Strumpet, inueigle
your minde, for it is not troth that ſhe reporteth, neither am I
ſo baſe minded, to purſue her cauſleſſe. The knight of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
man,</hi> was ſo perſwaded by the Damoſell, that he would
not credite what he ſaid, bnt anſwered him thus. Sir, you ſhall
rather diſaduantage me then diſhonour her, and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
for your ſelfe. The ſtrange knight ſeeing him ſo egerly
bent, ſaid, I am content, ſince you will enforce me to it, and
not rule your deſire by reaſon. Whereupon touching their
Speares, they met together couragiouſly, ſo that the ſtrange
knight was caſt, and the knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> faine to
leape off from his horſe, and drawing their Swordes, they
layde at each other very cruelly, to the great hurt of them
both.</p>
                     <p>In the meane time they were in figh, the Damoſell had left
them, and returned accompanied with two knights more, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
them the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> and ſaide. Behold
Sir knights, the man that hath ſlaine my Father, and now
would gladly worke the death of this my Brother (pointing to
the knight that before had purſued her) wherefore I deſire you
to take reuengement on him. At theſe words, one of the
knights alighted, and perceiued the knight that the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
named her brother, to be very ſore wounded, ſtepped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, ſaying to the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> Come
Traytour deale with me, and not with him, whoſe loſſe of
blood and wearineſſe beſide, deſireth rather to take reſt, then
the Combate.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> was greatly offended at
theſe wordes, wherefore he left the other, and went to him ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
I will make thée either recant thy wordes, or elſe I will
leaue my life in this place. So charging one another very pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſantly,
the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> laide him at laſt along
on the earth, which the other knight ſéeing, and alſo the Armor
of the gentle knight, to be greatly broken in many places, began
as followeth, I ſée Syr Knight, you are brought into ſuch debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
both with the great expence of your blood, as alſo weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
with long enduring the fight, that I thinke it great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to giue you a freſh aſſault, and ſmall manhood in mee, to
vrge you to ſuch extremitie. The knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> ſtill
incenſed with furie, for the vnkind wordes hee had receiued of
them, returned him preſently this anſwere.</p>
                     <p>As I haue little cauſe to eſtéeme of your friendſhip, ſo haue I
leſſe opportunity to craue your fauour, and though my wounds
be yrkeſome in your ſight, yet can I endure the vttermoſt that
you can charge me withall, wherefore ſet apart theſe words,
and execute the extremitie of thy diſloyall will. Thus breaking
off their talke, they beganne to aſſault one another very rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly,
ſo that the knight ſitting on Horſe-back, conceiued great
maruaile at the hauty courage of the knight of the <hi>Sauage man.</hi>
While he occupied his eies in beholding this noble exploit, ſuch
féebleneſſe entred the minde of his fellow, that he could ſcarcely
hold his Sword, or kéepe himſelfe from falling to the ground,
and fearing he could not eſcape the death, being in ſuch great
diſaduantage, he alighted from his Horſe, and to the Knight of
the <hi>Sauage man</hi> began in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Me thinkes Syr knight, it were for your better aſſurance of
health, as alſo great gentlenes you might offer to theſe knights,
to ſatiſfie your deſire vpon this victory, then to hope on a farder
of me likewiſe, &amp; ſo be depriued of that you might hardly ſpare,
which might yéeld you greater diſaduantage, then the conqueſt
you haue gotten, will enlarge your renowne.</p>
                     <p>Syr (quoth the K. of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi> except he recant the
ſhrewde wordes he gaue me, or confeſſe himſelfe vanquiſhed,
and to reſt at my commaund, I will finiſh his boldneſſe, by
<pb facs="tcp:13179:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>
honour of my Sworde, ſay you what you can, and hee what he
dare. Truſt me Sir (anſwered the knight) if you will not grant
to ſuch a ſmall requeſt, as ſhall both extoll your Fame, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
your friendſhip, I ſhall be enforced to enter Combate
with you, which I am very loath to doo, conſidering your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
eſtate, in ſo much as I would not be hée that ſhould depriue
you of your life.</p>
                     <p>Good Syr (quoth the knight of the <hi>Sauadge man)</hi> this care in
you is more then I haue deſerued, or deſire you ſhould vſe vnto
me: wherefore hereupon aſſure your ſelfe, I am as able to deale
with you, as they haue found me indifferent to conquere them.
At theſe words, the knight (whom this noble Victor held in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection)
fell along on the ground, through faintneſſe of much blood
that had iſſued from him, as alſo the grieuous wounds, hee had
ſo vnhappily ſuſtained. Which made this other knight to aſſaile
the knight of the <hi>Sauadge man</hi> very rigorouſly, in hope to haue
reuenged his friends hurt, with the detriment of his noble Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
life, but he found the knight of the <hi>Sauadge man</hi> ſo great
of ſtrength, and ſo greatly affected to a farther Victorie, that hee
partly repented himſelfe for entring ſuch hazard. Yet did he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
himſelfe with greater courage then the other knightes,
which made him endure Combat a longer time.</p>
                     <p>It chaunced the King of <hi>England,</hi> to come on Hunting into
this Forreſt, where eſpying theſe two knights ſo eager at their
fight, and commending both their expertnes, and braue behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
he entred betwéene them, vſing great intreatie to leaue off
their Combate, which they preſently did, for that they would not
diſobey the kings requeſt, whom they knew, and were very glad
to ſée. The knight of the <hi>Sauadge man,</hi> lifting vp his Beuer,
came and preſented himſelf to the King, who perceiuing him to
be the knight, was nouriſhed in his Court, as alſo the man hee
had greateſt delight in, receyued him very graciouſly, in ſigne
whtreof, he ſuffered him to kiſſe his hand.</p>
                     <p>When the King had knowledge, that the other Knight was
<hi>Gracian,</hi> ſonne to the noble <hi>Arnedes</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> he aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from his Horſe, imbracing the Prince very louingly, and
deſiring him to ſhewe the occaſion of their diſcord, as alſo what
<pb facs="tcp:13179:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the other Knights were, that lay on the ground. The Prince
<hi>Gracian,</hi> after he had done his dutie to the King, and to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
companie, that then were there preſent beganne as thus.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhall like your Maieſty, the knight that lieth hithermoſt,
and is neareſt to your Grace, is named <hi>Francian,</hi> Sonne to the
famous <hi>Polendos,</hi> king of <hi>Theſſaly,</hi> In whoſe company, to mine
owne honour, and eyther of our contents, I trauelled from the
Citie of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> through many places where we haue
approoued our Knighthoode, and made manifeſt ſuch déedes of
Armes, as our yeares and ſkill would ſuffer vs,</p>
                     <p>To this place wee were conducted by a Damoſel, who repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her ſelfe to bee Syſter to the other Knight that lyeth on the
ground: the gaue vs to vnderſtand, that this knight (meaning
the knight of the <hi>Sauadge man)</hi> had cruelly ſlaine her Father,
and did his endeuour to kill her Brother likewiſe: wherefore
ſhe deſired vs to ſtande her Reſcue, and to deliuer her foorth of
ſuch griefe, as ſhee might conceiue by his death. <hi>Francian</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing
her Brother in ſuch eſtate, as hee could not awarde the
heauie blowes this Knight charged him withall, entred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
them: and in like manner was brought to as lowe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
himſelfe. Yea, and I perſwade my ſelfe, had not your
Grace come to ende the ſtrife, my ſelfe had bene partner of their
hard miſhap.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Sauadge man,</hi> hearing what the Prince
<hi>Gracian</hi> had ſaide, began in this order to diſcourſe how it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.
My grations Soueraigne, the Damoſell of whom this
Knight hath ſpoken, came Ryding towardes mee, her haire diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearſed
on her ſhoulders, her Face all blubbered with teares,
her Garmentes torne, and very much polluted: all the way as
ſhe came, crying how that this knight (whome ſhe after named
to be her Brother) did ſéeke to diſhonour her, and therefore deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
mee to defend her in ſo great extremitie. When I had ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Combat with the Knight, ſoone after ſhe came againe, and
brought theſe two knight, reporting to them, as hee hath infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
your Maieſtie: ſo leaning vs in this ſtrife, ſhe departed, we
know not whither. The King well noting the deceyte of the
Damoſell, which was onely to ſéeke the ruine of thoſe Noble
<pb facs="tcp:13179:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knights, cauſed the Helmet of <hi>Francian,</hi> and of the other knight,
to be taken off, when féeling the ayre, they came to themſelues
againe, ſauing that their wounds made them very féeble. Then
was the other Knight known to be <hi>Polinard,</hi> ſon to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
<hi>Trineus:</hi> when preſently the King cauſed <hi>Francian</hi> and
<hi>Polinard,</hi> to bée conueyed in a Chariot to the Citie of <hi>London.</hi>
And by the way, the King queſtioned with <hi>Polinard,</hi> for what
cauſe be purſued the Domoſel, when this noble knight tooke in
hand to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d her? By your gracious leaue (anſwered <hi>Polinard)</hi>
I thinke ſhée was the moſt wicked, and deceitfulleſt Damoſell
on the earth, for through her perſwaſion, <hi>Oniſtalde</hi> and <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſian</hi>
my friends, were brought into ſuch ignorance, and ſuch
credite of her, that they entred Combat, and had almoſt ſlaine
one another, had not I arriued at their fight, when they were
hardly to be iudged, if there were any recouery for their health.
At my requeſt they ended their ſtrife, and rode together I know
not well which way, nor if they be aliue as yet: but I followed
the Damoſel, to know the occaſion why my brethren were fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
to ſo great debate, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this knight came and preuented me
as your Grace hath heard.</p>
                     <p>The King was greatly diſpleaſed at this miſaduenture,
and ſent preſently about, to heare tydings of <hi>Oniſtalde &amp; Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſian,</hi>
that if their bodies were found dead, they might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred
according to the nobilitie of their birth. But they were
found liuing, and by the king ſent to the <hi>Monaſterie of Cleare
Victory:</hi> where they were carefully cheriſhed, by the brethren
of that Religion, which was firſt found by <hi>Amadis de Gaule,</hi>
néere vnto <hi>Fenriſſe,</hi> &amp; thither were his bones carried after his
death, from the great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> to witneſſe the victory hee had
got of the Kings in that place.</p>
                     <p>The king cauſed a great many of knights to purſue after the
Damoſell, but their labour was in vaine, for her Miſtreſſe <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropa</hi>
who ſent her, kept her ſafe enough from them.</p>
                     <p>When the King was come to the Court, hée cauſed the
Princes to bée ſo prouided for, as they recouered againe their
health in ſhort time: and the knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> lying
in his accuſtomed Chamber, was diligently looked vnto by
<pb facs="tcp:13179:75" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Princeſſe <hi>Flerida,</hi> and the King would often viſite him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his minde did ſtil vſe perſwaſion with him, that he ſhould

he would intreate the Princeſſe, and he himſelfe would often

or of whence he iudged himſelfe to deſcend: but he would neuer
by any meanes ſatiſfie their requeſt, becauſe indéed, he could not

what your preſent eſtate, &amp; my earneſt affection hat conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
me to doe, deſiring you to make eſtimation of theſe giftes,
according as you ſhall finde them in proofe. Giuing her grrat
thanks, the eſquires armed them all preſently, their armor not
differing from one another in colour and richneſſe, foure ſhields
were like wiſe deliuered them, the deuiſs where you ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand

horſebacke, the Damoſell ſhewed them, that they muſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
her thrée or foure dayes, in which time (through their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance)
ſhe ſhould enter her lamentable ſorrows, and gréeuous
miſhaps, giuing them likewiſe thoſe foure Eſquires to ſerue in
ſtead of them which were departed.</p>
                     <p>They not denying what the Damoſell had requeſted, rode on
with her, where at this time we will leaue them, and return to
the knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi> who paſſing the time away with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

to take his leaue of the <hi>Sage Magitian,</hi> who would
not let him vnderſtand his birth and Parentage, for the reaſon
which you ſhall heare hereafter. But commending vnto him
the aduentures of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> as alſo what neceſſitie the
good Knights ſtood in for want of his helpe: and arming <hi>Siliuian</hi>
with an armour, much like that which his Maiſter had alwais
worn, they imbraced to together very curtuouſly, and ſo depart
the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> promiſing him to be in all places where he

                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So rode the knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi> towards the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and famous
Cittie of <hi>London,</hi> deſirous to ſée the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Courte, the Fame
whereof was blazed through the whole world. After thrée dayes
trauell, he arriued at the houſe of an ancient Gentleman, which
was not farre from <hi>London,</hi> and there he repoſed for that night,
conceyuing great pleaſure to conferre with his Hoaſt (who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to entertaine all wandring knights) about the eſtate of that
Countrey, with the noble aduentures in olde time paſſed, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
at that preſent in great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> After Supper, they came
and ſate in the Porch of the Houſe, where at laſt they ſawe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the gate, a Damoſell accompanied with a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:
who requeſted of the Gentleman of that place, to haue a
Lodging there for that night. The Gentleman, whoſe cuſtome
was to entertaine Straungers, commanded her a Chamber,
with ſuch prouiſion as ſhe ſhould ſtand in néede of. Shée giuing
thanks to her friendly Hoſt, for his ſo great courteſie, came and
ſate down by the Gentleman of the Houſe, which the knight
of <hi>Fortune</hi> perceiuing, remooued his ſtoole, and ſat down by her:
and among other talke, requeſted of her, for what occaſion ſhee
was ſo penſiue and heauie, which was great griefe to him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde,
as for her to abyde.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſell taking occaſion to behold him, and eſpying the
ſhield of <hi>Fortune,</hi> ſo much eſteemed and famed through all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes,
caſt her ſelfe downe at his feete, and in teares began this
ſorrowfull diſcourſe. I perceiue the anger of Fortune, ſatiſfied
with the former iniuries, that ſhee hath executed on my poore
ſelfe, will at this inſtaunt chaunge her rigour, and fauour her
that hath bene altogether infortunate, in that I haue found the
Knight, who not onely can, but (as I hope) will ende my miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
by his knightly Valour. So it is (worthy Syr) that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
I had a Sonne, ingenious in euery exerciſe, but chiefely
well nurtured in Martiall affaires: and had his fortune agréed
with his towardly behauiour, then had I bin a Matrone of ioy,
where now I am the Mother of Miſfortune. It ſo chaunced,
this my Sonne to growe amorous of a young Beautifull Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell,
who had retained in fauour an other Knight, before my
Sonne was admitted her Seruant: but ſuch was her affection
<pb facs="tcp:13179:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
toward my Sonne, that her loue to the firſt Suter died with
cold, and ſhe eſtéemed him as worthy of her good will.</p>
                     <p>This perceiued in the ſight of all, was not his from the
Knight, who began greatly to ſtomacke it, and finding oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
fit for his purpoſe, aſſayled violently my Sonne, who
(notwithſtanding the danger on both ſides) brought his enemy
into hazard of his life, and himſelfe the better into his Ladies li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
When time had admitted this conquerer into better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
that his wounds were healed, and his ſtrength conquered
(not forgetting the repulſe he ſuſtained by my Sonne, as alſo
the earneſt loue he bare to the Damoſell,) hee returned with a
knight attyred in gréene Armour, bearing in his ſhield the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait
of a <hi>Sauage man,</hi> leading in his hand a couple of Lions,
who ſéeking reuenge on the other knights behalfe, my Sonne
tooke the courage to enter Combate with him. But ſuch was
the ſpite of Fortune, and ſo great her malice againſt mee, that
my Sonne was brought in ſubiection to this ſtrange Knight,
who not contented with the victory, cruelly cut off his head, and
gaue it to his mortall enemy. Thus conſidering the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury
that the Knight had wrought mée, and that none will doe
me that fauour to reuenge my vntimely loſſe, I determined not
to leaue my trauaile, till I had found you, who bearing the
name of the Knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi> (renowned in all Countreyes,
that hath either ſéene or heard of you) can compell my enemy to
confeſſe his fault, and giue him the reward that belongeth to ſo
great diſcourteſie.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore moſt worthy Syr, at which words he ſtaied her
thus. Faire Lady, the extreame griefe of your inward thoughts
witneſſed by the aboundance of teares the bedewe your roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chéekes,
conſtraineth me to belieue what you haue ſaide, and to
beare a part with you of accuſtomed heauineſſe. Wherefore,
conſidering your wrong, and the great vngentleneſſe of the
Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> if my Fortune may bee ſo good to
méet him, I will reuenge your iniury with his death, or leaue
my own life for a pawne with him. And the rather am I vrged
to deale with this Knight, for that there remaineth a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie
betwéene him and mée, as yet vnfiniſhed, and now your
<pb facs="tcp:13179:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
miſhap ſhall giue me good occaſion, to recompence him for both
together, if I knew certaine in what place to finde him. Truly
ſir (quoth the Damoſell) I left him at the cittie of <hi>London,</hi>
where his valour is held in ſuch eſtimation, as is more then I
can ſpeake, whereof I iudge him not a little proude.</p>
                     <p>The knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi> perceiuing the earneſt deſire of the
Damoſell, to be reuenged on him, whom he would as gladly
finde, promiſed her to ſens him defiance on the next morning
by his Eſquire, and that he would be as diligent on her behalfe
as ſhe was deſirous to haue it diſpatched: to which words the
Damoſell replyed. I can now ſufficiently iuſtifie what I haue
often heard, that your care hath bene ſo great to the welfare of
Ladies, as that Fortune hath the better proſpered all your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
and in ſo much I can iudge it the more to others, by how
much I finde ſuch great curteſie my ſelfe, which if I die before
I deſerue, let yet your gentle nature afford me a good opinion,
for that all my life time, ſhall be ſpent in the honour of your
name.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Gentleman, vnderſtanding that his gueſt was
the Noble knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi> eſteemed his good luck more then
he could any way diſcloſe: wherefore he deſired pardon, that he
had not vſed him according as his famous report deſerued: and
that his ignorance might ſerue to excuſe any fault committed.
And the rather he vſed the leſſe ſuſpition toward him, becauſe
he had entertained ſo many noble and valiant Gentlemen: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom (as he was well worthy) he gaue great commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

and partly had ſéene himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Which good report, incited, and greatly moued the knight of
<hi>Fortune,</hi> to vſe the more diligence in finding him: in which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,

paſſed the mind of the knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi>
while he was entred the famous citie of
<hi>London,</hi> as well for the vngentle dealing of
his Lady <hi>Polynarda,</hi> as alſo ſundry other
conceits that he had occaſion to thinke on.
At laſt, remembring he might not be licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
the combate till after Dinner, he withdrew himſelfe to an
Hermitage, where after he had heard ſeruice, he was deſirous
to ſée the ancient monuments that were in the Chappel, which
for the moſt part were ruinated, yet ſome of them remained in
good eſtate of their beautie. Among all the things that were
there to be ſéene, the knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> behld an ancient Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre,
which was cunningly framed in workmanſhip, albeit
long continuance of time, had both waſted and dimmed the
workes and figures thereof, ſo that one could hardly reade
what was engrauen about it, ſauing at the one end was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the name of <hi>Arbam</hi> of <hi>Norgalles,</hi> who was buried whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
King <hi>Liſuart</hi> ruled the the crowne of England. Vpon the ſight
of this ancient monument, he queſtioned with the hermit, if in
time paſt the ancient Sepulchre had not contained a much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
quantity, to which demand, the Hermite thus anſwered.
Good Sir, when firſt I came to inhabite this place, which by
computatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of time, I geſſe to be about 34. yéers ſince, I found
this ancient Sepulchre in the ſame eſtate you now behold it.
But as I haue heard of many, and therefore may be hold to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
it, when the Infidels did inuade this Land, they did rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and ſpoyle this Tombe aboue all the reſt. Not ſparing
theſe other by it, as you may perceiue, wherein are inferred
<hi>Don Grumedan,</hi> and <hi>Don Cuillan</hi> the <hi>Penſiue,</hi> beſide other
perſonages of no leſſe nobilitie then knightly behauiour.</p>
                     <p>The Hermits talke, vrged him to remember the diſcourſe of
the life of this noble <hi>Don Guillan,</hi> comparing his hapleſſe life,
with his heauy eſtate, which was in like manner procured,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as his Lady <hi>Polynarda,</hi> was the original of his ſorowful mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
At this remembrance, falling into a great agony of mind
he was conſtrained to leane on the irons that compaſſed this
auncient Sepulchre, vttering ſuch rufull complaints within
himſelfe, as the gréefe thereof cauſed the teares to run down his
chéekes.</p>
                     <p>Standing a great while as it were in amaze, the Hermite

ſtepped vnto him, declaring that it was his wont to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
incumbred with Melancholy, and therefore willed him to
vſe no more doubt in this matter. At length he hapned forth of
this mute ſtudy, turning his head to hide his extreame griefe,

                        </gap>ch thoughts, as would draw his eſtate into ſuch debility, as
might greatly hinder his former determination. With theſe
words he was ſomewhat diſpleaſed, ſaying: I more doubt of
that which my late ſtudying hath called into remembrance, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
either the feare or force my enemy can vſe to me. So taking
his leaue of the Hermit, he rode toward the Citty where he
met the Gentleman his Hoſt, and the Damoſell, on whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
he had enterpriſed the Combate, then becauſe he would
not enter the Citty as yet, he ſent <hi>Siluian</hi> to the Court, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
before the King his Maiſters challenge, and to vſe great
circumſpection, what anſwer the King returned.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Siluian</hi> well noting his Maiſters commandement departed
and in ſhort time arriued at the Pallace, where going vp into
the great Hall, he perceiued the King was newly riſen from
Diuner, walking with his knights, among whom was the
knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> being well and perfectly cured of
the wounds he had receiued, when he fought againſt <hi>Gracian,
Francian</hi> and <hi>Polynarda,</hi> who were there alſo in his company.
<hi>Siluian</hi> came into the preſence of the king, where on his knée,
with ſuch duty as is required in that reſpect, he began as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.
Moſt puiſſant Prince, the knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> my
noble Lord and Maſter, by me in humility of his owne perſon
yéeldeth the homage of his heart and knightly Sword, at your
<pb facs="tcp:13179:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Graces command. Such was his intent, as in your Courts he
bowed to make proofe of his ſeruice, but Fortune not ſo agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
in ſtead of aquiet entry (vnder your Graces leaue) he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to come by way of a challenge. For as he trauailed, he met
a Ladie, whoſe cauſe of miſfortune, ſhée doeth attribute to the
Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> and my Lord taking her diſtreſſed
caſe in hand, by me giueth challenge to him of Combat, to méet
him if he dare, ſo that your Grace will allowe my Lord a ſafe
entrance and returns, without the diſturbance of any to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his determination, the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
The king who had heard the fame of the knight of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi>
to be ſuch as was extolled in all Princes Courts, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſory that his arriuall ſhould moue ſuch a requeſt, and would
willingly haue denied the Combate, but that the Knight of the
<hi>Sauage man</hi> came before his Maieſtie, and vſed theſe words.
My gracious Soueraigne, the Knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> is of ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
as neither may your Grace denie his requeſt, nor my
ſelfe refuſe to enter Combate with him. And albeit his puiſſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
hath vrged him to a Challenge, and the aduantage gotten in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
countries, maketh him the more earneſt to haue his déedes
knowne here: yet can neither his gréeting diſmay my courage,
nor his preſence compell me to leaue the fielde. Wherefore, I
deſire your Grace to grant his requeſt, that he may haue liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Iuſt, according as hée ought: otherwiſe will I goe to
him, as well to ſatiſfie his deſire, as to compaſſe the affection I
haue of my ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The King ſéeing all excuſes would not ſerue to hinder this
matter, but that the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> would néedes
take on him the fight, returned <hi>Siluian</hi> with this anſwere. My
Friend, tell thy Lord, I am both pleaſed, and offended at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
yet ſéeing his demand ſtandeth with law of armes, which
I can no way iuſtly denie, I graunt him free leaue, without
contradiction of any. But better would I haue iudged of him,
had his challenge béene to any other Knight, where being as it
is, he will not ſo lightly eſcape, as perhaps hee maketh account
of.</p>
                     <p>With this meſſage <hi>Siluian</hi> returned to his Maiſter, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="tcp:13179:80" rendition="simple:additions"/>
heard the pleaſure of the king, came prnſently to the place
appointed for the combat, where the king with the Quéen, and
the Princeſſe <hi>Flerida,</hi> with all the nobility, were ready placed,
to behold this noble attempt. The Citizens likewiſe repaired
thither to ſee this combate, which was ſo ſuddenly noyſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade,
ſo that the place was filled with abundance of people.
The knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> entred, and made his obeyſance to the
king, and paſſed by, then came the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi>
accompanied with many knights &amp; noble gentlemen, among
which company was <hi>Argolant</hi> who brought him his ſpeare, &amp;
<hi>Don Roſiran de la Bronde</hi> deliuerd him his ſhéeld, ſo marching
on by the king they left him, vſing this talke with the knight
of <hi>Fortune.</hi> I know not ſir knight, what ſhould be the cauſe of
your ſo great challenge, without it be to iniurie him that neuer
offended you. Sir (anſwered the knight of <hi>Fortune)</hi> behold the
Ladie here preſent, to whom you haue offered no ſmall abuſe,
which I will ſée you recompence, or conſtraine you to abide the
doome of my mercy. Truſt me ſir (quoth the knight of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
man)</hi> the Lady is altogether vnknowne of me, neyther
haue I offended her, or any body beſide, that I ſhould deſerue to
be thus vngently accuſed: but I ſée the good opinion you haue
of your owne manhood, cauſeth you to be ſo earneſt in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which I will not denym, albeit I could, yet giue no ſpot to
my honour. So departing themſelues to fetch their caréere at
the ſound of the Trumpetst, hey met brauely together, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
halfe a dozen Staues a péece, yet neither able to ſtirre the
other. When they ſaw they could not diſmount one another,
they tooke their ſwords and charged each other with ſuch polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique
behauiour in their fight, that it was maruellous to heare,
what commendations were generally giuen.</p>
                     <p>When they had well wearied themſelues on Horſebacke,
they alighted, and endeuored to endanger each other with ſuch
rigorous blowes, that it was thought the Combat would not
long laſt, ere one of them were ſlaine. For their ſhéelds were
ſhiuered all in péeces, their Armour ſo broken, that the blood
trickled downe their ſides, then fell they to wraſtling one with
another, their gripes made the blood to iſſue foorth aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet neither had the aduantage of the other in ſtrength,
but both ſo equall, that it could not be iudged, who was likeſt
of victorie. The Princeſſe <hi>Flerida</hi> gréeuing at their great effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of blood, departed in ſuch heauineſſe, as if ſhe had known it
to be the blood of her ſonnes, that was ſo cruelly ſpilt. The
king with all his Courtly attendaunts was ſtroken into ſuch
a maze, when he ſaw them take their ſwords againe, that he
thought the flower of all Chiualrie was there preſent before
him, and was in great heauineſſo, for that they would not giue
ouer by no meanes.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> ſéeing himſelfe deſtitute of
Sword, ſheeld, and Armour, began ſomewhat to feare, that
his life would ſtand in great hazard, but yet he contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
that if as then his death were ordained, he ſhould ſuſtaine
the leſſe reproch, in that a knight of, ſuch honour had giuen him
the ouerthrow, wherefore at a pauſe, he thus began. Why
ſhould I diſcourage my ſelfe at the death, ſéeing I ſhall depart
in the flower and prime of mine age, and end my dayes at his
hande, who is onely eſtéemed for good Fortune? Yet the oath I
haue made to the Princeſſe <hi>Flerida,</hi> with the great duty I find
in my ſelfe, as her deſert, conſtrains mée to wiſh a longer time
if it might be, as well to exalt her honour, as to trie the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which hath endamaged ſo many good knights, whereto I
did euer bend mine affection, as the onely enterpriſe in all my
life to win me renowne. But ſéeing I am falne into ſo great
miſhap, as both Fortune doth deny me, and mine owne man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
faile me, I will yet ſo behaue my ſelfe vpon mine enemy,
as when he hath woon the vttermoſt, he ſhall not boaſt of his
Conqueſt, and ſuch a writ will I deliuer him to ſeale, as I
hope ſhall craue no other ſignet but his heart blood.</p>
                     <p>In like manner the knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> ſtood debating with
himſelfe, as well vpon his preſent danger, as alſo his paſſed
dollour, not forgetting his Ladie and Miſtreſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi> to
whom, as had ſhe bene preſent, he began this complaint. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
behold now the time wherein your anger doth kill me,
and your fauour reuiue me, which except you will beare the
cruell mind to worke my Tragedy, reſtore in wonted clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
<pb facs="tcp:13179:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the encouragement of my hapleſſe labours, which ſince it
lyeth in your handes, caſt a friendly looke on the man, that in all
extremities is none but yours onely. If you deny me this ſmall
requeſt, neither ſhall I aduenture the enterpriſes of great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi>
nor doe that honour to you, which my heart hath euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired,
ſo ſhall the flower of Chiualrie remaine in their great
miſfortune, and you through your obſtinacie accounted the loſſe
of them all. This knight hath put mee in more danger then
euer did any, yet neither of vs both enioyeth the Conqueſt: and
if the infortunate death returne to my ſhare, I ſhall thinke my
ſelfe honourably failed at his handes, but my poore heart cruelly
martyred through your hard dealing.</p>
                     <p>Then fell they to the Combate againe, not able to charge one
another ſo fiercely as at the firſt, yet labouring earneſtly to end
their ſtrife one way or other, which mooued the king to diſcend,
accompanied with his Knights, and fearing the loſſe of theyr
liues, ſought to ſet them at vnitie. But ſuch was their deſire
of victorie, and ſo couragious their mindes in middeſt of
moſt doubt, that the King was faine to returne, becauſe they
would giue no eare to his perſwaſion, Then went hee to the
Chamber of the Princeſſe <hi>Flerida,</hi> where in this manner he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to vſe his ſpéech. Fayre Daughter, if my noble Sonne
<hi>Don Edward</hi> your Lord be liuing, and that he may be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the valour of any earthly creature, I perſwade my ſelfe,
that one of theſe Knights ſhall be the meane to relieue his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe
eſtate. But if in this Combate, as I greatly feare, they
ſhall ende their liues vpon this hautie attempt, then farewell
all hope that I euer repoſed, for both you ſhall loſe him, and my
ſelfe ſhall euer lacke him, where, by them I might (aſſure my
ſelfe) both to heare of my Sonne, and enioy him in my Court,
in his woonted eſtate againe. Wherefore, if you beare ſuch loue
to him, as you haue alway proteſted, and fauour me in this my
earneſt deſire, vouchſafe the paines to walke vnto them, for
that one word of of your mouth wil enfore them leaue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
ſo ſhall you poſſeſſe what you haue long wiſhed, and I be
honoured in ſo great a courteſie. The Princeſſe, who ſince the
abſence of her Lord had ſeldome come abroad, but alway kept
<pb facs="tcp:13179:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
her Chamber in her wonted lamentations, at the requeſt of the
aged king came walking downe with him, and foure Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
attired all in blacke attending on her, her ſelfe apparrelled
in the ſame manner: ſauing that the vaile on her head ſhado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
all her face, ſo that none could haue full view to behold her
beautie.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe was entred the place of the Iuſt, to the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
of all that were preſent, ſhe came to the Knight of
<hi>Fortune,</hi> and tooke him by the arme, with theſe words. Sir
knight, if either you make account of the honour of Ladies, or
will manifeſt in your déedes that you owe them any duty, then
at my requeſt I intreate you to leaue off the Combate, as well
to auoyd the hazard of your liues, as to content this noble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
who are ſatiſfied with your famous exployts.</p>
                     <p>The knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> wel eying the Princeſſe, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
her to reſemble the countenance of his faire <hi>Polinarda,</hi> he
humbled himſelfe on his knée, with theſe words. Faire Lady,
my deſire hath bene greatly bent to end this Combate, and to
render this Knight the victory, as he hath well deſerued, but
ſéeing you haue charged me with ſuch a curteous command, I
rather deſire the death, then to yéeld any deny all.</p>
                     <p>Sir (quoth the knight of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi> if I ſhould report
the eſtimation I haue of your knighthood, with the forceable
charges I haue receiued at your hands, I might ſay that iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which you haue rightly deſerued, you are the onely knight to
whom I will grant my Conqueſt. But ſéeing you haue made
grant to her, whom in duty I muſt alway reuence, and that
her intreaty hath moued you to end our debate, if I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
what ſhe and you haue appointed, I might worthily be
reproched among all knights, much more diſped among faire
Ladyes.</p>
                     <p>The Princes was ſo well pleaſed with this good agréement,
that giuing each of them harty thanks, ſhe returned to her
Chamber, and the King not a little pleaſed at this good euent,
commanded the knights ſhould bée brought into his Pallace,
where ſuch reſpect ſhould be vſed to them, that in ſhort time
they might recouer their former good health. But the Knight
<pb facs="tcp:13179:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Fortune</hi> would not accept the knights offer at that time, but
departed with the Gentleman his Hoſt to his houſe againe,
whether being carefully brought in a Chariot, ſuch prouiſion
was ordained for him, that by the helpe of the Gentlemans
Daughter, who was maruailous expert in the Arte of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
his weake eſtate was relieued into indifferent good plight.
Then was the Damoſell ſought for, who was the cauſe of this
Combate, but anſwere was made, that ſo ſoone as they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the fight, ſhe ſecretly ſhrunke away thorow the preace, ſo
that they could gaine no knowledge of her.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> was conducted to his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where hée had ſuch great attendance in the curing of his
wounds, as by any meanes they could deuiſe, what might beſt
ſerue for remedy. For neuer were his hurts ſo dangerous, as
thoſe that he had receiued at this Combate, nor his life in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hazard, then it was at this preſent, which made the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
ſo diligent about him, that ſhe enterpriſed as much as the
ſimpleſt, that had any occaſion to trauaile for his health.</p>
                     <p>The King was greatly diſpleaſed, that the knight of <hi>Fortune</hi>
would not vouchſafe the lodging in his Pallace, where we will
leaue awhile the two vnknowen brothers, till they haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their health, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may haue more occaſion to ſpeake
of them. And loth were I to be forgetfull of the Knights of the
Court of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> who aſſembled themſelues in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naile
in the Forreſt of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> truſting to the tickle dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of fléering Fortune. Who if ſhe fauored them a day, frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
on them againe for a months ſpace after, and when they
thought themſelues in ſureſt eſtate of good, hap, then were they
néereſt to their owne deſtruction.</p>

One of theſe Damoſels was the occaſion of the Combate,
betwéene <hi>Polinarda</hi> and Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> the very
ſame Damoſell brought the Horſe and Armour, to the Prince

for the auaile of her Miſtreſſe, that ſhée was onely beloued and
eſtéemed with <hi>Eutropa,</hi> yea, ſhee referred the whole ſubſtance
of her practiſe, to the deceitfull reports of the Damoſell.</p>
                     <p>The Knights that were lately come from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi>
and remained a while for their pleaſure in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court,
were enforced by theſe craftie meanes to take their departure,

                     </p>
                     <p>So when the Combate was ended, betwéene the knight of
<hi>Fortune,</hi> and the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> they diſguiſed
their Armour, changed the deuiſes of theyr Shieldes, leaſt they
ſhould be knowen, and put themſelues in trauayle, which way
they were inforced, to finde the Caſtle of the Giant <hi>Dramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiande.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Eutropa</hi> had brought all the knights into the field where the
Caſtle ſtoode, ſeuering them in two companies, and a Riuer
running betwéene them, where their Tents were pitched, and
ſuch prouiſion appointed, as thogh they had determined to fight
a maine Battaile. On the one ſide was the Prince <hi>Gracian,
Oniſtalde, Dramain, Francian, Polinard, Tremoran, Claribal,</hi>
and <hi>Emeralde</hi> the <hi>Faire,</hi> on the other ſide was the Prince <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolde,
Dridan, Belizart, Guerin, Eſtrellant, Germaine</hi> of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance,
Platir, Floraman, Blandidon,</hi> and <hi>Criſpian,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
other. And both the ſides brought into ſuch eſtate, that they
neither could tell what the other were, nor by what meanes
they were brought into that place. At laſt foorth of the Caſtle
came two Damoſels, the one accompanied like a perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great
grauitie, the other hauing no body with her, but a yong Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that was her guide, who preſently went to the Pauillions
next the Caſtle, and the other to the Prince <hi>Gracian</hi> and his
company, that were on the further ſide of the Riuer.</p>
                     <p>After ſhe was come into the preſence of the Princes, &amp; very
<pb facs="tcp:13179:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
gently and courteouſly entertained, preparing her ſelfe to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull
courſe, and intermedling her talke with teares, ſhée
beganne in this manner. Sir knights, the crown of your noble
déedes, and continuall Fame of your well imployed Knight-héed,
is ſufficient to irritate your vſurping enemies, and to
confound all ſuch as ſwell againſt honourable duety, ſo that
their owne drifts ſhall prepare their iuſt deſtruction, and their
euill deuices runne into contempt of the whole world. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the preſumption I haue vſed in my raſh entry, with
the bold behauiour you may perceiue, to my reproch, I ſhall
deſire you, firſt to conſider the extremity of my griefe, and then
to pardon my enterpriſe, when you are priuy to my Paſſions
This auncient Caſtell which you may here behold, doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to me that haue liued in it, both a heauy and happy time,
in that in times paſt, I haue béene better acquainted with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
conceyts, then for a long time I could enioy the like tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility,
as they to whom my miſfortunes are very well knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
can witneſſe the great alteration of my former eſtate. For For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
among all the liberall benefits ſhe had beſtowed on me, as
wealth to maintaine me, and a quiet gouernment to protect me,
gaue me a Daughter, ſo perfect in beauty, ſo pure in modeſty, ſo
preciſe of her perſonage, and ſo exquiſite in her vſuall behauiour,
that many noble Gentlemen haue put their liues in hazard, to
deſerue her good liking, that was liked of all.</p>
                     <p>Great hath bin the intreaty of many Honorable perſonages,
to haue her in mariage, which I haue alwaies denied, till now,
making choyſe of one aboue all the other, I haue agréed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
his importunate deſire.</p>
                     <p>This being knowne to a knight, who had long time béene a
Suter, yet neuer ſo fortunate as to gaine his intent, now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth
vpon his ſtrength to take her from me perforce, &amp; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure
him that hath obtained my conſent to eſpouſe her. In ſigne
wherof (pointing to the Pauillions of the other knight, on the
farder ſide of the riuer) behold where he hath placed his Tents
to inuade my Caſtle, and through the helpe of his friends, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
to ruinate this mine ancient dwelling, &amp; to vſe violence
to her, who is betrothed to another. When I conſidered there
<pb facs="tcp:13179:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was no meane to remedy the neceſſity of my caſe, but eiter to
kéepe my Hold, and there be famiſhed, or yéeld me ſelfe to my
foes, and ſo be diſhonoured: I ſent one of my Damoſels to the
Engliſh Court, at whoſe requeſt you are here arriued in this
place, where you may behold my vſurping enemy, and the great
danger I ſtand in of the hard award of fortune. And once more
haue I ſent by way of intreaty, to will them breake vp their
ſiege, and not to trouble me for her whom they cannot haue,
though they vſe neuer ſuch violence. But ſuch is the great mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
of this knight, and his intent linked to ſuch an extreme pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that neither gentleneſſe may intreate him, nor faire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour
ſerue to perſwade him. Wherfore noble Gentlemen,
as you reſpect the honour of an oppreſſed Virgin, and the oath
that your knighthood hath auouched in this behalfe, ſtand now
her friend who is voyd of all defence, and maintaine her cauſe,
which is both for your renowne, and her good fame for euer.</p>
                     <p>She hauing thus ended her coined proteſtation, they ſtood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
with themſelues what anſwer they ought to make her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
laſt, the prince <hi>Gracian</hi> (they hauing referred all to his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition)
tooke the Damoſell by the hand, and thus ſhaped his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
Faire Lady, ſince this honorable company haue appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me (vn worthy) to anſwer on their behalfe, and that we are
perſwaded you would not informe vs of any miſreport: thus I
dare awareant for them all, that you ſhall finde them as ready
to defend you, as your enemy dare preſume any way to moleſt
you. The Damoſell hearing the anſwer of the Prince <hi>Gracian</hi>
to be ſuch as ſerued fit for her purpoſe, gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all hartg thanks
and calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her teares againe into remembraunce vrged the
knights to ſuch pittie, that they greatly deſired to enter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
with the other company. Then returned the Damoſell,
that had beene with the other knights (informing them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of ſuch a falſe report:) when being entred the Pauillion, to
the Damoſel (with curteſie) ſhe gaue forth theſe ſpéeches. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
enemy to your honour, and friend to his owne damage, wil
not be perſwaded, but will follow his enterpriſe: and in deriſion
ſcoffeth at this noble aſſembly reporting them to be ſo weake,
that they dare not ſhew themſelues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Theſe words vrged <hi>Oniſtalde</hi> vnto ſuch anger, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
brake forth into theſe ſpéeches: I beléeue, that had they
tryed thoſe whom they haue aduentured to dare, they ſhould
finde the chaſtiſement of their peremptory bragges, to be aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
in effect, as they haue iuſtly deſerued. Tuſh (quoth <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linarda)</hi>
it is eaſie for our enemy to talke his pleaſure, but when
he ſhall find his trechery, rewarded with due recompence, hee
will wiſh he had vſed himſelfe more fréendely to this Ladie,
whom he hath ſo greatly iniuryed. Then <hi>Francian</hi> was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to ſend them defiance, which the Damoſell would not
ſuffer, leſt her dealings ſhould be eſpyed, but to worke the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
in her deceite, ſhe ſent the other Damoſell once more, to
will them to depart preſently, whereto if they made denyall,
that ſhe ſhould ſummon them in armes, to prepare for the fight.
In maane while ſhe was gone on her meſſage, this other craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Gyrle, vſed ſuch familiaritie with the Prince <hi>Gracian</hi> and
the other Knights, that their heats were enflamed againſt
them beyond the Riuer. To whom the other Damoſell had
reported, that the Prince <hi>Gracian</hi> and his company, did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
themſelues to take the Caſtle from her Miſtreſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force,
whereupon ſhée requeſted them to defend her Miſtreſſe
right, and to cauſe them know they went about a diſloyall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.</p>
                     <p>The Prince <hi>Floraman</hi> hauing well pondered the words of
the Damoſell, returned her preſently this aunſwer. Albeit
out duettie is to defend any diſtreſſed perſon, and ſo gainſay the
miſhap of any iniuried Lady, yet reaſon willeth vs, ere we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
too haſtily, to be acquai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ted with the cauſe, and well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed
ere we begin ſuch a raſh attempt, elſe may our enemie
iudge, we come more vpon a brauerie, then Knighthood may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrant
our behauiour, and ſo runne into danger our ſelues, for
that the rightful cauſe hath alwaies the victory. Wherfore thus
reſolue your ſelfe, wee will firſt know if your reportes be of
trueth or no: leaſt we enter into ſuch defectes, as we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes
repent vs. With that the Demoſell began to rehearſe
their promiſe, at ſuch time as ſhe deliuered them Horſes and
Armour in their great neceſſitie, for which cauſe ſhe deſired
<pb facs="tcp:13179:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then to accompliſh their promiſe, threatning them, that their
Nobility might be defaced in denying their words. Truſt me
(anſwered <hi>Platir)</hi> I haue ſuch a good opinion in her dealings,
that ſhe would not vſe perſwaſion to vs of an vntroth. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
tell vs faire Lady, doth your enemy ſtill remaine reſolute
in his determination? albeit my Companions deny to ayd you
as they haue auouched, yet will I abide by you to the death, in
what I haue promiſed.</p>
                     <p>Then the Prince <hi>Berolde</hi> coming to the Damoſel, began as
thus. Can we (faire Lady) ſée you in ſuch great hazard, and not
Imploy our ſelues to giue you ſuccour? No, aſſure your ſelfe, for
mine owne part, and ſo I dare auouch for the reſt of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
that we will pawne the blood of our hearts, ere we will
ſée you remaine in ſuch a heauineſſe. The Damoſel, at theſe
words returned to the Prince <hi>Gracian,</hi> certifying them of
their willingneſſe to the fight, and not long ſhe ſtayd, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to them againe, her face all be ſprent with teares, which
was chéefe vaile to couer her treaſon, and thus ſhe ſpake.</p>
                     <p>Now Gentlemen, your quarrel is of more force then before,
for they ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing my Lady and Miſtres in their hold, haue vowed
not to let her depart, without ſhe will render to them her caſtle.
And moreouer, they ſend you word by way of defiance, that
they are ſo ready to deale with you, as they iudge you dare not
come forth to them, either to defend the cauſe of my Lady, or to
make proofe of your loyaltie.</p>
                     <p>This report prouoketh ſuch an earneſt deſire in the knights
that they mounted on Horſeback, and beganne to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in the field, vſing ſuch behauiour with their often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
that the other knights could enioy no reſt, till they
were likewiſe prepared. For ſuch was the enuious dealings
of <hi>Eutropa,</hi> that in this fight, ſhe ſet the Sonne againſt the
Father, one Brother againſt another, and the deareſt fréend

a red Lyon rampaunt, in a field of Sinople. <hi>Oniſtalde</hi> had his

but her minde was bent to ſuch cruelty, that ſhe would
vſe no reſpect to his words. So long endured their violence to
each other, that faintneſſe made them let fal their weapons, and
catch hold of one another, in the manner of wraſtling: which
was great griefe to the Princeſſe in the Caſtle to behold, and

This moued <hi>Eutropa</hi> to ſuch great anger (becauſe ſhée

to goe foorth and fetch them all into his Caſtle. When they
had taken off their Helmets, the King <hi>Recinde</hi> knew his

<hi>Francian</hi> his ſonne, and <hi>Bazilliart</hi> and <hi>Don Roſuel,</hi> were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited

who becauſe he had left him whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was ſomewhat yong,

<pb facs="tcp:13179:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lamented to ſée their kindred and friendes in ſuch great miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and conueyed them into the Caſtle, where they were ſo
honorably vſed, that in ſhort time they had good hope to recouer
them from this danger.</p>
                     <p>When they had attained ſome part of their former health,
they reioyced greatly that they had happened into the company
of their deareſt friends, and declared in what maner they were
deluded by the two Damoſels, which was not ſtrange to them,
who perceiued the daily practiſes of <hi>Eutropa,</hi> to be grounded on
ſuch trecherous deceits,</p>
                     <p>Now did <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> greatly commend his good Fortune,
in gaining ſo many couragious and well approoued knights:
as he was fnlly reſolued, he ſhould now eaſily conquere the <hi>Iſle

and frequented them daily with ſuch delightfull exerciſes, that

                     <p>For this opinion he conceiued, that vſing them with gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

winne their good wils, which hée made more account off, then

occaſion to ſuppoſe, that hée was arriued at the place where ſo

kéepe company with ſuch ougly fellowes. At laſt, hée beheld
the Knights preparing themſelues, as it were to Iuſt: when

leaue of the Prince <hi>Don Edward,</hi> tooke the Speare and

<hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who deſired to ſée the ende of this noble exploit,

                     <p>At the third attempt, Fortune turning her backe to the

quickly taking his féete againe, and maruayling at the puiſſant
ſtrength of the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> who came vnto him
and ſaluted him with theſe wordes. Truſt me (Syr Knight) I
would eſtéeme my ſelfe both honoured of Fortune, and highly

preferred vnto all good lucke, if I were in a place where, to doe
you ſuch ſeruice, as is your reward through your braue behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>

ought to beare the general praiſe among men, eſpecially of me,
who in all his life time neuer ſuſtained ſo ſharpe a plunge, as
at this encountring you haue put me too. Syr, (anſwered the
Prince <hi>Don Edward,)</hi> I knowe not if my behauiour ſéeme ſo
praiſe worthy to you, but this I ſpeake vnfainedly (not to
cauſe you conceiue a pride in your ſelfe) that I neuer met with
a ſtranger knight, ſince I knew what belonged to the bearing
of Armour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pandare</hi> came to ende their tale, giuing theſe wordes to
the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man.</hi> Since (Sir Knight) you haue
done more in the Iuſt, then euery one ſuppoſed to bee in your
power, you muſt now endeuour your ſelfe to deale with me a
while, for that all ſuch as enter this Valley, are bound to fulfill
this ancient cuſtome. But if your heart ſerue you not to fulfill
this enterpriſe, becauſe feare may ſomewhat allay your youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
courage, I wiſh you to yéelde your ſelfe, which will be more
honourable, then to hazard your life, where you are certaine to
loſe it.</p>
                     <p>O ſir (quoth the knight of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi> it ſéemes your
Father was a Senator, by your Clarkly perſwaſion, and that
you being his ſonne, would do more with words then he could
with déedes: but if your Father hath giuen you more wit
then you can beare, I meane to beate it out of you, rather then
you ſhould be ouerburthened. <hi>Pandare</hi> ſomewhat offended to

Then was he conſtrained to leaue <hi>Pandare</hi> and award the

was the great foreſight of the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> that
he ſtill bare off his ſtrokes, and would not ſtrike againe, as

                     <p>Theſe courteous words (aunſwered the Knight of the

                        <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> ſéeing he ſcorned his good will, and eſtéemd his

I perceiue Sir, it is high time to cauſe you know what

and what danger ſhall happen through your owne folly, ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
his head, and commaunding his Sword and Shéeld to

this manner. I would wiſh to ioyne combate with a Knight
ſo hardy as your ſelfe, ſo that the diſpoſition of his health were

                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> would make him no aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
but taking vp the Shield of the Giant <hi>Alligan,</hi> which
was in much more better eſtate then his owne, he aduaunced
himſelfe to <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> ſhewing ſuch agility and nimble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour

                     <p>The Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> found this enterpriſe the

were ſufficient to win him perpetuall renowne: wherefore he

(ſir Knight) the perfect proofe of your infallible minde, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth
me to lament your preſent approching daunger: in
that the gréeuous expence of your blood, cannot long ſuſtaine
you from the vnhappy death. But if Fortune appoint the ruine
of your dayes at my hands, and that (as it is no other like) but
it muſt of force be ſo, I ſhall condemne my ſelfe of monſtrous
ingratitude, in that ſuch a hardy knight ſhall be cut off in his
flowring yeares. Wherefore let me intreate you, that our
Combate may here take concluſion, and to venter no more
the daunger being imminent, which it ſelfe will may not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
you to grant, yet the ruine of your Armour, the ſore wounds
on your body, and the blood that hath coloured the ground vnder
your féete, me thinks ſhould prouoke you to ſatiſfie my requeſt.
Good counſell is better late followed then neuer, where it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to the aduancement of honour, and maintenance of the
ſpotleſſe eſtate of knighthood.</p>
                     <p>Sir (quoth the knight of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi> your requeſt doth
aſke ſuch a ſcope of argument, that I rather deſire to renue the
Combate then conſume time in making you aunſwer. And
hereupon aſſure your ſelfe, that neither your eloquence can
allude, or your force compell to hinder my enterpriſe, but I wil
haue it, or elſe reſigne thée my carkaſſe, to glut vp thy gréedy
minde. With theſe words they went to it againe chéerely,
deliuering ſuch forceable blows to each other, that in ſhort time
their weakeneſſe withdrew them from any more hurt. For
though the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> were in great debilitie,
<hi>Dramuſiande</hi> was brought into as great danger, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
knew not to whom to impute the moſt hurt: ſo that the
Giant would gladly that the knight had made acception of his
offer, becauſe he felt himſelfe to haue receiued ſmall aduantage
in this fight.</p>
                     <p>But no maruell if the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> were
<pb facs="tcp:13179:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
weake indéede, hauing iuſted and dealt with ſo many before,
net did he alway beare ſuch a courage, that they who beheld him
ſuppoſed the contrary. <hi>Primaleon</hi> and the Prince <hi>Don Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
came, aud were uery deſirous to ſeparate them aſunder,
becauſe they feared the death of the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi>
but they laboured in vaine, for no perſwaſion could withhold
the hardy knight, who ſaluted <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> with ſuch a mighty
ſtroke vpon the Creſt, that he cleft his Helmet, and wounded
him very dangerouſly on the head, wherewith his ſword brake
in a great many péeces. <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> ſéeing his ſword was
broken, and himſelfe lie likewiſe vnprouided of weapon, came
and caught the knight about the middeſt, who receiued him in
like maner, that they threw ech other to the ground with great
violence, being iudged as men depriued of their liues, ſo that
it could not be ſaid whether had the victorie.</p>
                     <p>The night approching very haſtily on, the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
of this Combat, addreſſed himſelfe thither in all the haſt,
who made ſuch an obſcurity ouer all the Valley, as he had done
before at the other battaile, in which darkneſſe he departed, and
the knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> was taken away, no body could
imagine how or which way, ſo that theregardants, who thoght
to haue carried him into the Caſtle, could not tell themſelues in
what he was gone.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dramuſiand</hi> was conducted into his fortreſſe, where he was
diligently tended by his Aunt <hi>Eutropa,</hi> who fearing leaſt at
thie time, the knights would ſéeke meanes to eſcape away,
ſhe locked them into a great hall all together, where they had
no light but what came in at a very ſmall window, at which
likewiſe they receiued ſuch things as was néedefull for them.
In this order ſhe vſed them till <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> and his Giants
had recouerd their former health, when ſhe brought them forth
againe into their accuſtomed chambers, greatly diſpleaſed that
<hi>Dramuſiande</hi> would behaue himſelfe ſo friendly to them as he
did. But ſuch was the conference he repoſed in their oath, in
that they would not attempt any thing contrary to his wil and
pleaſure, that he exempted all diſcourteſie from his heart, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
his wonted friendlineſſe to the captiue Princes.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:92" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For on this he alwayes grounded his perſwaſion, that it were
a point of marueilous ingratitude, to breake the vowed oath a
man had made to his friend, and hée that would ſo greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour

as well to ſée what it might be, as to driue other fancies away
that greatly annoyed his mind. When he was entred the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillion,

that he was the noble Knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi> to whom he began in

                     <p>Sir, I ſée that Fortune hath greatly fauoured you, in permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
you to ſée the dead body of the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi>
to whom you were alway a mortall enemy, yet could not bée

hearing the wordes of <hi>Don Roſiran,</hi> was ouercome with ſuch

began to frame his anſwere thus.</p>
                     <p>Indéede, neuer had I more deſire to preuaile againſt any

he hath receiued this miſfortune, and I wil die on him that hath

                     <p>Truſt me Sir (anſwered <hi>Don Roſiram)</hi> my arriuall hath

                     <p>The knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> greatly diſpleaſed, to ſée this knight
brought into ſuch extremitie, began to conceiue better eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the aduenture, then euer he did before, albeit he was
greatly abaſhed, that ſo good a Knight had failed in that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.
Then began he to behold the Armour that lay there by
him, being defaced and hacked in ſo many places, which vrged
him to commend them that had the ſtrength to vſe it ſo, but
more the man that had the might to reſiſt ſuch an extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
wherevpon he ſaye. I may well perſwade my ſelfe, that the
hope to end this adventure is altogether loſt: the Knight bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng

their ſhoulders departed away with it in very great haſt. The
Knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> endeuouring to follow them, they willed

With this perſwaſion he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Credite me Syr, I thinke few or none can accompliſh your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
ſuch incantations and exorciſmes are ſpread ouer all the

                     <p>Thus with ſundry embracings they departed, the knight of
<hi>Fortune</hi> which way pleaſed him, and <hi>Don Roſian</hi> with all
ſpéede rode to <hi>London,</hi> bearing before him the Armour of the
Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> which he could not put vpon his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
becauſe it was ſo cruelly martired. Being come to the court,
he found the king ſitting very ſolitary, for want of the noble
knights that were woont to kéepe him company: and comming
into his preſence, with dutiful reuerence he began in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
Moſt gracious ſoueraigne, I neither thought my heart in
quiet, nor the time ſo happy as it ſhould be, till I had preſented
your Maieſtie, with the Armour of the couragious knight of
the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> whereby you may perceiue (although the

Fame ended his dayes in the face of Fortune, proouing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
no leſſe then he was, the man that deſerued moſt the name
of a Champion, And in reward of his taken paines, he craueth
no more of your Maieſtie, but that his Armour may beautifie
ſome place of honour, to witneſſe the vertuous behauiour he
was woont to employ it in.</p>
                     <p>After hee had certified the King of the whole requeſt, hee
declared at large the aduentures of this hardy knight, againſt
the Gyant <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> and his noble Company, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
to tell him, how hée mette the knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi>
at the Pauillion, who tooke ſuch great griefe for this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happe,
that hee is gone to reuenge his death on him, and all

                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:95" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The King thinking on this froward miſchance, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
foorth into diuerſe paſſions, expreſſing the great dolour of
his minde, he commended the valiant attempt of the Knight of
<hi>Fortune,</hi> and bemoned the loſſe of his ſon <hi>Don Edward,</hi> with
his princely children, attributing this miſhap to bée procured
through his ſearch, and how many aduenterous Knights were
loſt to finde him. Now hée began to veſpayre, that he ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

againe hée remembred the Knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi> iudging the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
ſuch, as none but he could finiſh. Then went he into

by what miſfortune hée had loſt his life. As concerning theyr

                     <p>The King commaunded the armour of this good knight (to

of a Trée, where he determined to ſléepe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

knights were held as Priſoners: vowing to redéeme them
from that aduerſe eſtate, or hee would leaue his life there, as
pledge of his valure. In the morning, <hi>Siluian</hi> brought him his
ſtéed, when preſently they mounted on horſebacke, and rode on
which way he thought ſooneſt to ende his pretence, <hi>Eutropa</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

ſuffered the knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> to come before the Caſtle,
where he perceiued the knights newly come foorth, making a
ſhew of reſiſtance if he durſt offer to venture.</p>
                     <p>This ſight cauſed him preſently to couch his ſpeare, when on
ſodaine a Damoſell came riding on Horſebacke, with a ſhield
vpon her arme, and this ſtaied him. ſir knight, I deſire you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you begin your Combate, to take this Shield for your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

and this day it ſhal ſtand you in cheefeſt ſtéede. Here ending her
talke, &amp; deliuering him the ſhield immediately ſhe departed in
ſuch great haſt, that he could not haue the leiſure to ſpeake vnto
her, or to giue her thanks for her ſo great courteſie. Then he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
his Shielde of Fortune to <hi>Siluian,</hi> faſtening the other

eſcaped the force of the lance, The knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> vpon this
good lucke would haue entred the combate with the ſword, but
<hi>Pandare</hi> comming forth of the Caſtle, commanded the Prince
toreturne, ſo that he could not ſatiſfie his requeſt. <hi>Don Edward</hi>
entring y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſtle, the knight made ſuch ſpéed that he entred with
him: which when <hi>Pandare</hi> perceiued, he ſhut the gate, and came
vanting with his ſword toward the good knight, who in ſhort
time diſhartned <hi>Pandare,</hi> becauſe his blows could not pierce the
ſhéeld,
but he ſo ſpoiled the armor of the giant that in ſhort time
he brought him vnder his obeyſance, being greatly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended of
<hi>Dramuſiand, Don Edward,</hi> &amp; <hi>Primaleon,</hi> for his noble exployt.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Grecian</hi> knights had partly knowledge of him, in that
ſome of them were at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> when the damſel broght
the ſhéeld, which they knew by the beautie, and the braue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice:
and ſuch was their opinion of this knight, that if he fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to end the aduenture, they doubted they ſhould neuer get de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuery
from that cruell Caſtle. Yet ſo great was the pleaſure
they conceiued of him, as they could not tell wether they ſhould
go to welcome him, or enter the combate, and ſo deliuer him:
but ſeeing how he vſed <hi>Pandare,</hi> vrged them to beléeue he ſhould
haue good ſucceſſe in this hautie enterpriſe.</p>

he knew not well what to ſay: for he thought it vnpoſſible
to conquer this hardy knight, hauing ſuch a ſhéeld as could not
all this while be pierced, ſo that he began vtterly to denounce
Fortune, that had fauoured him ſo long, and would now leaue
him at the laſt. <hi>Alligan</hi> (albeit very vnwilling) began againe
to aſſaile the knight: but ſuch was his reward for his trauaile,
that he was brought vnder his ſubiection, and left his head on a
gage to the knight of <hi>Fortune.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> ſaw that <hi>Alligan</hi> was ſlaine, in a

reuenge on the good knight, in the meane time, the Prince <hi>Don
Edward</hi> came vnto him, requeſting ſuch friendſhip at his hands
as he would ſuffer him to haue a ſight of his face. <hi>Floraman</hi> ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he was vnwilling to diſcouer himſelfe: ſaide to him, that he
ought not to deny ſuch a ſmall requeſt, to ſo noble a Prince as
<hi>Don Edward</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>When he heard <hi>Don Edward</hi> named, who was reported to
be ſuch a ſingular knight in Proweſſe, and for whoſe ſake, ſo
many valiant Princes had left their countrey and kindred, to
finde him who was loſt, none could tell where, he cauſed <hi>Silui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
to take off his helmet, when the Prince delighted with his
comely contenance, preſently ſaid. I hope (Sir knight) as
God hath endued you with ſuch a ſéemely and honourable ſhape
ſo he hath reſerued you to finiſh this perillous and ſtrange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture,
for that your behauiour doth eneourage vs all to ſo
good an opinion. Neuertheleſſee, if Fortune do allow you the
victorie, I deſire you to vſe curteſie to this Giant, who prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
himſelfe to encounter with you, for that his gentle vſage
to vs, doth conſtraine me to ſpeake ſo fauourable in this caſe.
The knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi> had not not the leyſure to make him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
becauſe he perceiued <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> comming towardes
him, when <hi>Siluian</hi> hauing armed his head, they began to charge
each other very furiouſly, ſo that now began the proofe of the
fight, for al that had paſſed before, was nothing in reſpect of this
preſent exployts.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrokes of <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> entred the knight of <hi>Fortuns</hi>
ſhéeld, as eaſily as it would haue done in any other, which vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the good knight to think, that the promiſe made of the ſhéeld
was falſe and of no truth, ſéeing it failed when he ſtood in moſt
extremitie. But then he perſwaded himſelfe againe, that if he
gained the victory, it ſhould not be attributed to the vertue of
the ſhéeld, but rather to the gotten by the valour of his perſon,
which ſhould be eſtéemed of more renowne, then to atchieue
the conqueſt by ſuch a prouided meane. Wherefore repoſing no
longer confidence in his ſhéelde he truſted to his ſtrength, and
the good ſucceſſe he did aſſure himſelfe off: vſing <hi>Dramuſiande</hi>
in ſuch ſort, as he had little cauſe to boaſt of his bargains. But
<pb facs="tcp:13179:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to ſpeake vprightly, ſmall was the aduantage on either ſide for
they were both ſore wounded, both alike wearied, and both in
great danger of the preſent death, which made all the Princes
heauy, and the regardants ſorrowfull, to ſée ſuch an vnfriendly
ſpectacle,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> retyring to take pauſe, beganne to ſuſpect that
this was the Knight ſhould bring him and all his vnder obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanue,
of whoſe comming, his Aunt <hi>Eutropa</hi> alway caſt a
great doubt: which to preuent, hee thought beſt to render him
ſome of the Princes, and ſo to will him leaue off his enterpriſe:
but when he conſidered, that to preſent ſuch a condition to his
enemie, might expreſſe his cowardiſe, and extinguiſh the good
report of his woonted knightly déedes, he determined to end his
life with ſo good a champion, rather then to be reproched by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
infamy.</p>
                     <p>The knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> walking vp and down, communing
with him ſelfe in this manner. If doe looſe my life to deliuer ſo
many of my deare friends, I account it the chiefeſt honor of my
life, and the beſt aduenture that euer I enterpriſed. Then ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
turning his thoughts to his faire <hi>Polinarda,</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
he began to vtter his amourous complaints. Madam, if at
any time you reſpected the vowed dutie of your ſeruant, then
at this time vouchſafe to remember me in your Princely fauor,
ſo that if the victory returne according as I wiſh, I may mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
the honour of mine attempt, to your ſoueraigne bounty, by
which I liue, and in which I haue hope to confound my enemy.</p>
                     <p>Then they began againe in ſuch wrathfull manner, that all
ſuppoſed there was no other remedie, but the death of them
both, ſuch was their féeble eſtate, and ſo great the loſſe of their
blood, that <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> was conſtrained to fall downe, hée
could no longer ſuſtaine himſelfe, when the Knight of <hi>Fortune</hi>
ſate downe by him, as glad to haue a little reſt, he was become
ſo faint. <hi>Don Edward,</hi> and the other Princes came running to
<hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> and tooke off his Helmet, that he might receiue
the Aire, deſiring the Knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> to conteut himſelfe
with the victory, and not to worke the death of the friendly Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
to which he anſwered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Although mine intent was to part his head from his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
yet will I not at this time execute ſuch crueltie, reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the honour you haue done me to intreate for him, and I
haue done as much as my heart deſired. The Princes conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them both into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> caſtle, were ſo diligent about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, at their
dangerous eſtate required, eſpecially to <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who
was reduced into very weake eſtate.</p>
                     <p>As they were ſo buſie about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they heard a great knocking
at the gate, which the prince <hi>Platir</hi> opened in all ſpéed: where he
beheld an ancient man, apparelled after the <hi>Grecian</hi> faſhion,
who entred the Caſtell, accompanied with two comely Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels,
carrying in their handes two golden Boxes of precious
Oyntment, wherewith they enbalmed the Knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi>
as alſo the other Knights that had receiued any hurt.</p>
                     <p>The auncient man would not ſuffer any to be about the
wounded knights, but onely the two Damoſels: wherefore he
commanded all the other foorth of the chamber, promiſing them
they ſhould recouer their woonted health againe. This promiſe
did greatly content the Princes, who deſired nothing ſo much,
as the health of the Knight of <hi>Fortune:</hi> in that by his conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Giant, they had receiued their former libertie againe,
and all the cruell Enchauntmentes that <hi>Eutropa</hi> had practiſed
in the <hi>Valley of Perdition,</hi> were now fully finiſhed, and her
power to be no more eſtéemed. The ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t man tooke his leaue
of the Princes, commaunding the Damoſels not to depart
from thence, till they had all recouered their ſound eſtate of
health againe.</p>
                     <p>The Princes did daily accompany the Knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi>
and <hi>Don Edward</hi> woud often viſite the Giant <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi>
labouring to ſhew him great courteſie, becauſe he would not be
vngratefull for the frienſhip hee had found at his handes. In
this manner did the Princes paſſe away their time, vntill their
deareſt friend had gained a good conſtitution of his body, which
the Damoſelles accompliſhed, before they would depart from
the Caſtle.</p>

The Prince <hi>Floraman,</hi> becauſe of his great wiſedome and
iudgement, was appointed by generall conſent to beare theſe
glad tidings: who went into the Armourie, belonging to the
Giant <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> and put on his owne Armor, which was
battered &amp; broken, as alſo coloured with the blood which came
out of his body in the ſkirmiſh, before he was taken priſoner

all, and rode in ſuch haſte that on the ſecond day he arriued at

was ſo greatly bruſed.</p>
                     <p>At length he came to the Court, at what time the king was
ready to goe on Hunting: to whom <hi>Floraman</hi> preſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
deſirous to kiſſe his Graces hand. After his Eſquire had
taken off his Helmet, the king had knowledge of him, when he
imbraced him with theſe words. Certainly ſir <hi>Floraman</hi> your
Armour brought into ſuch a great alteration, doth witneſſe the
great danger hath bene incident to your perſon: which truſt
me is as gréeuous to me in beholding, as it hath bene yrkoſome
to your ſelfe in abiding. It ſéemeth you ſhould bring but ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
tidings, being in ſuch great miſchance as it ſéemeth you
haue taſted: Neuertheleſſe, hauing often receiued ſuch a ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
I can the better endure this, therefore ſay on.</p>
                     <p>My gracious Lord (anſwered <hi>Floraman)</hi> if you would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
to returne into your Pallace, where I might behold your
Quéene, and the Princeſſe <hi>Flerida,</hi> I ſhall diſcouer ſuch ioyfull
newes, as your long continuing wiſhes ſhal be now prenſently
ſatiſfied.</p>
                     <p>At theſe words, the King tooke <hi>Floraman</hi> by the hand, and
walked with him to the chamber where the Quéene and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe

to bring tidings to ſuch a rare Princeſſe of beautie, then after

                     <p>To be tedious in words (my gratious Soueraigne) or to trifle
<pb facs="tcp:13179:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the time with long circumſtances, might offend your patience
to ſtay to heare it, and cumber my memory taſtand to ſhew it.
Wherefore to vſe breuity in ſch a caſe, as you haue long deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and at laſt deſerued: I thinke it expedient conſidering
your heauineſſe, and therefore attend how it hath luckily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.
<hi>Don Edward</hi> your noble ſonne, <hi>Primaleon</hi> with the
other Princes and Knights, that haue bene ſo long time loſt,
and now found at laſt, in remembrance of their obedient due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

the renowned Knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi> whoſe Proweſſe hath

till this long aduenture hath bene ſo worthily brought to end,
and thus haue I certified your Grace what hath bene giuen me

                     <p>Theſe words moued them to looke on ech other, doubting
whether they might giue credance to the report of <hi>Floraman</hi> or

did hardly beléeue what he had ſaid, began againe to perſwade
them as thus. I truſt your Grace doth not thinke, that I
would preſume to manifeſt before you a tale of vntroth, which
to do, might remaine a blemiſh to mine honour, beſide the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
vnto your Grace did deſerue no pardon. And therefore I

that the knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> had the power to conqure him, who

The knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> humbling himſelfe in his preſence, the

déedes of Armes, who is ſo welcome to my Grace, as no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

                     <p>My ſoueraigne Lord (anſwered the knight of <hi>Fortune)</hi>
what I haue done, hath bin thorow Gods appointment, whoſe
power aſſiſting me beyond my deſert, haue finiſhed the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which no pollicie could otherwiſe bring to paſſe. In honor
of this happy victory, they went al to the chiefe Church of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
where ſeruice was acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed with great ſolemnity, and

ſuch courteous demeanour, as beſeemed the roialty of theyr per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
being right glad to haue a ſight of the fayre Princeſſe.
While <hi>Flerida</hi> was vſing courteſie to the other knights, the
king lead the Quéene to the Prince <hi>Don Edward,</hi> ſaying, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame,
behold now your Sonne, for whom you haue wiſhed ſo

paſſions which for his abſence you haue ſuffered. And I
deſire you to entertaine theſe noble Princes, with as great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
as you can any way deuiſe, for that we are greatly bound
vnto them, conſidering the danger they haue paſſed, to finde
our Sonne <hi>Don Edward.</hi> Then he ſhewed her the noble <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon,</hi>
to whom ſhe went, embracing him in her armes, and
gaue him a ſwéete kiſſe for his welcome. The like ſhe did to the
Prince <hi>Vernar,</hi> the king <hi>Polendos, Recinde,</hi> &amp; <hi>Arnedes,</hi> with

                     <p>Then <hi>Flerida</hi> comming to her brother <hi>Primaleon,</hi> imbraced
him in her armes, with theſe wordes. Let it not be offenſiue to
you my noble brother, that I haue ſtayed ſo long, not welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming

<hi>Don Edward,</hi> made me vnmindful of any other body. Your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

Then the King commanded their lodgings ſhould be preſently

Thus ſtaied they a good while in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

So now, I durſt not preſent my ſelfe, where my former newes

all that came: ſo that through the helpe of two Giants (whom
the Knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> hath valiantly foyled) all the wandring
Knights were caught captiue in this Caſtell. In fine, when

and behaued himſelfe againſt the reſiſtaance with ſingular

where a bloody and doubtfull fight was preſently begun.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor ſuddenly ſtaying <hi>Argolant</hi> at theſe words, in
a maze and great feare put forth this demand. Good <hi>Argolant</hi>
before you procéed any further, reſolue me of a doubt, wherein
the laſt report of your diſcourſe hath brought me: know you
where as now the knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> remaineth, and whether
he be aliue as yet or no? for if he fare otherwiſe then well, my
ſtate cannot endure without bearing him company: to which
<hi>Argolant</hi> replyed. At ſuch time, my gratious Lord, as I depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Realme of <hi>England,</hi> I left him in ſuch good diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
as himſelfe could wiſh, or your Maieſty deſire, when eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one reioyced for the good ſucceſſe he had againſt the Gyant
<hi>Dramuſiande.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But may I (quoth the Emperor) vpon your faith and knight
heed, aſſure my ſelfe of this report? If it may pleaſe you my
good Lord, anſwered <hi>Argolant,</hi> to giue credite to my Meſſage,
then beléeue me, that the knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> is in good eſtate of
health, and hath done what I haue manifeſted before this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
aſſembly. Likewiſe the Forreſt of that diſloyall <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropa</hi>
is ſubdued from all her Enchantments, ſo that <hi>Don Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
our infortunate Prince, <hi>Primaleon</hi> your noble Sonne,
and all the other captiue Princes, in deſpite of her and the giant
<hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> are reléeued from their long &amp; vnhappy impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Then turning to the Princeſſe <hi>Bazilia,</hi> he began courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to ſalute her, as thus. It ſtood with good reaſon, faire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that your preſence ſhould be partaker of theſe happy tidings
inſomuch as you, I am ſure, haue ſuffered no ſmall afflictions,
for the abſence of your deare friend the Prince <hi>Vernar,</hi> whom
I can aſſure you to be in as good health as you can wiſh: ſauing
that he is not here, as you could willingly be content, &amp; he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
as in ſhort time he will, I dare awarrant you.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gridonia</hi> rauiſhed with the report of <hi>Argolant,</hi> was ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ouercome with excéeding ioy, that ſhe caught the Princeſſe
<hi>Bazilia</hi> in her armes, (either of them cured of one ſickneſſe) that
one could hardly iudge, whether their preſent gladneſſe excelled
their paſſed gréefe, or in what order they receiued theſe newes,
but it ſufficeth, they had good cauſe to be pleaſant.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:107" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Empreſſe came, and took either of them by the hand, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting
them into her Oratorie, where in heartie and ſolemne
deuotions, they gaue thankes to God for this proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.
In the meane while, the Emperour deſired <hi>Argolant</hi>
to rehearſe the names of ſuch noble Princes and Knights, as
were partners in this long captiuitie, which when he had heard
he greatly reioyced that the floriſhing noble mindes of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome,
bare parts of the miſhappes of the renowned <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Prince, a token of their great loue and friendſhip, in that
they diſdained not the terrour of ſuch hard miſfortune, to beare
him company, whom all hautie hearts did honour. And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was his ioy the greater, becauſe the knight of <hi>Fortune</hi>
contained the magnanimitie of courage, as (notwithſtanding
all bitter brunts to threaten the contrary) he was the choſen
Champion to accompliſh this rare aduenture.</p>
                     <p>Now he called to remembrance, the letter ſent by the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of the Lake,</hi> the ſame day as <hi>Polendos</hi> king of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
him that royall preſent, as alſo the meſſage of the <hi>Sage
Aliart,</hi> which had now diſcouered the full effect of their promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Through all the Cittie, was preſently noyſed the recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Princes, which cauſed euery one to make
ſmall account, of the preſumptuous brags of the <hi>Soldanes</hi> of
<hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> in that they iudged themſelues vnder the
ſureſt defence that might be, now they had obtained thoſe,
whom they euer eſtéemed. The Emperour cauſing <hi>Argolant</hi>
to be brought to his chamber, went ſtraight to the Cloſet of

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argolant</hi> departing on the next morning, was deſired by the
Emperour, to will the knight of <hi>Fortune</hi> make haſt vnto <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
becauſe he had a great deſire to ſée him. And now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Emperour with all his court was indued with as great ioy,
as he conceiued ſorrow at his departure, which he had good
cauſe to do, hauing loſt his chéefeſt defence, in the abſence of the

well eſtéeme the volour of this hardy knight. But ſuch are the
changes and mutabilities of Fortune, who when the heart is

Againſt ſupper was done, the King gaue in charge, that the

a ſumptuous Banquet ſhould preſently be ſerued on the tables.</p>
                     <p>The Dancing and the Banquet finiſhed, and they ſitting
pleaſantly ieaſting one with another, they entred the Hall the
thrée Knights, who had behaued themſelues ſo brauely in the
Tournament. Many deſired to come néere them, becauſe they
would know of whence they were: but to hinder their intents,
ſuch a miſt on a ſudden aroſe in the Hall, as the lights were dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
the Torches burned very ſcarcely, and the Ladies being
diſmaied, caught their Knights in their Armes.</p>
                     <p>To put them out of this feare, the miſt departed, and the Hall
<pb facs="tcp:13179:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was as cleare as it was before, when ſtraight way they beheld
in the middeſt, a Lion and a Tiger enduring a great fight toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and to ſet them at vnitie, there entred a faire Damoſell
with a golden rod in her hand, wherewith ſhe touched them
both, and they humbled themſelues at her féet. This done, ſhee
departed, and they aroſe againe in the forme of two fierce and
vntamed Bulles, which cauſed ſuch an aſtoniſhment to all the
beholders, that they wiſhed themſelues to be foorth of the Hall.
But the Knights ſéeing their Ladies ſo greatly diſcouraged, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
them that it was but ſome deuiſe, artificially prouided
for the delight of the Emperour: but they would hardly beléeue
them, becauſe the two Bulles fought ſo vehemently the one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the other, and being ouercharged with wearines of fight,
fell to the ground, breathing from their mouthes an horrible
and ougly blacke ſmoke, as was before.</p>
                     <p>The Hall auoided of all theſe accidents, and in the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
it was at firſt, they might behold that thrée Knights, with
their heads vnarmed, ſo that he, who would not haue his ſhield
known, was found to be the gentle Knight of the <hi>Sauage man:</hi>
who preſently went to the king, and kneeling downe, kiſſed his
hand, with theſe words. My gracious Soueraigne, I earneſtly
intreate at your hands, this Knight may receiue the courteous
entertainement, your Grace will afford him at my requeſt,
for this is the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi> your Maieſties moſt affectionate
ſeruant, to whom your griefe hath been ſo diſpleaſant, that he
thought himſelfe not in perfect quietneſſe, till he might manifeſt
his humble deuoite to your Grace.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Fredericke,</hi> who had often heard report of the <hi>Sage A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liart,</hi>
by reaſon of the renowne and fame, was ſpred abroad of
him, ſtoode in a doubt how it ſhould bee hée, becauſe his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

him with theſe ſalutations. Certainely, ſir <hi>Aliart,</hi> I am bound

                     <p>My gracious Lord (anſwered <hi>Aliart)</hi> the deſire I haue to

I vnder your Soueraigne pardon, preſume to diſcloſe ſo great
a ſecrete, as ſhall both content your Highneſſe, as alſo this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious

toward, requeſted all the Princes to vouchſafe their audience
when being euery one quietly placed to their owne content,
<hi>Aliart</hi> humbling himſelfe to the Princeſſe <hi>Flerida,</hi> began as
followeth.</p>
                     <p>Madame, it were hard for me to diſtinguiſh, betwéene your
extreame griefes paſſed, and the ſwéete ſolace you enioy at this
preſent: for albeit, this is to be thought beyond compariſon, yet
in time when you were heauie, your wofull complaints were
equally as vehement, as they that were priuie to their aduerſe
caſe, could eaſily beare with the vrgent cauſe. But referring
long diſcourſe of matter, you are to eſtéeme your ſelfe highly
honoured, by this no leſſe hauty then happy, and famous
Knight of <hi>Fortune,</hi> who for your ſake hath ſuffered the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiance
of paine, in recompence of the dangerous trauaile
you ſuſtained for him, at ſuch time as you were deliuered of
two Children in the vnfortunate Forreſt, when your Lord had
left you. For when the <hi>Sauage man</hi> had taken him, and this
redoubted Knight, your Sonne <hi>Florian,</hi> his Brother, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
them to the rauenous iawes of his gréedy Lions, pittie
ſo pierced the heart of his poore and louing wife, that ſhée ſaued
them from the bloody ſlaughter, and nouriſhed them as carefully,
as ſhe did this other, who is her owne Childe. And Madam,
let not be forgotten the wordes ſir <hi>Pridos</hi> rehearſed vnto you,
(at ſuch time as you had loſt both huſband and children) which
was reported to him by the Ladie <hi>Argonida:</hi> for loe at this
inſtant her promiſe is accompliſhed, your noble Lord <hi>Don Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
is reſtored, and your two loſt ſonnes ſafe and ſound reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whoſe Knightly valure, hath ſufficiently diſcharged the
ſorrowe, that then your afflicted perſon ſuffered. The Knight
of <hi>Fortune,</hi> is your Sonne <hi>Palmerin,</hi> to whom you gaue that
name, in honour of the Emperour <hi>Palmerin,</hi> your Father, who
by the meanes of the Knight <hi>Polendos,</hi> receiued your ſon into
his Court, when he likewiſe cauſed him to be tearmed by his
owne name.</p>
                     <p>And this aduenturous knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> is your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sonne, which according to the place of his birth, you called
him <hi>Florian</hi> of the <hi>Forreſt,</hi> him haue you nouriſhed &amp; brought
vp by your motherly care, albeit he was knowen to you for no
other then a ſtraunger. Thus to knit vp your former ioy,
I thought good to preſume ſo farre, as to make you partners of
that, which was not knowen to any, but onely God and my
ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The Princeſſe <hi>Flerida,</hi> and <hi>Don Edward</hi> wel viewing one
an other, were ſuddenly rauiſhed with ſuch an inward ioy, as
it is impoſſible for me to giue iudgement thereon: then <hi>Palmerin</hi>
and <hi>Florian</hi> came &amp; imbraced each other, which moued the king
and all there preſent vnto ſuch delight, that they could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
the great pleaſure they conceiued, whereupon the king en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into theſe words.</p>
                     <p>Truſt me Syr <hi>Aliart,</hi> theſe newes were altogether vnlookt
for at this preſent, albeit they haue béene earneſtly deſired long
before this time, but yet doe me the fauour, to certifie me how
you are aſſured of that which you haue giuen foorth for a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
troth, it may be, here are ſome that dare hardly aduenture
to beléeue it. If I ſhould my good Lord (anſwered <hi>Aliart)</hi> fable
in ſuch a caſe. I were well worthy ſuch ſeuere puniſhment as
is due to him that ſhould falſely informe a Prince. But neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
to giue you the better aſſurance thereof, marke what
ſhall enſue, and then anſwere how you are ſatiſfied.</p>
                     <p>Then drewe hée foorth a little Booke, whereon hauing
read a prettie while, the <hi>Sauage man</hi> and his Wife entred
the Hall, who had nouriſhed <hi>Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Florian</hi> ſo long in
theyr Caue, when preſently the two Princes beholding
them, went and imbraced them both with great courteſie, the
<pb facs="tcp:13179:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the like did <hi>Siluian,</hi> who hauing learned more ciuility in court,
then when he remained with his Father in the Caue (knéeled
downe vnto them as was his duetie. The Princeſſe <hi>Flerida</hi>
receiued ſuch excéeding ioy, that ſhée imbraced them both very
louingly: and <hi>Palmerin</hi> thinking it great diſhonour to him,
to be vnmindfull of his nurſes that had vſed him ſo gently, tooke
them by the hand, and brought them before the King: giuing
him to vnderſtand, that they twain had deſerued a good reward,
in recompence of the great affection his Brother &amp; he had found
at their hands.</p>
                     <p>The King taking them from the ground in his armes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
that their labour ſhould be honorably rewarded: ſo lifting
his eyes vp to heauen, he vttered his ioy in this manner. O hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
Father, this is the laſt good happe that euer I deſired to
ſée, wherefore now if it be thy pleaſure, take me out of this
miſerable world, before vnconſtant Fortune determine any
more miſchance to me. This done, he tooke his two Nephews,
and brought them to the Princeſſe <hi>Flerida,</hi> before whom they
humbled themſelues on their knées, kiſſed her hand a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times, and ſhe caſting her armes about their necke, in teares
remembred the great danger ſhe ſaw them both in, when they
endured the bloody Combate, at ſuch time as ſhee was faine to
ſet them at vnitie.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Don Edward</hi> their noble Father, in remembrance of
the valiant behauiour, he had ſéene in them both at the Caſtle of
<hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> receiued them in his armes, with ſuch courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
gréetings on either part, as the ioy in ſuch a caſe did vrge
them to manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor <hi>Trineus,</hi> a partaker of this Fortunate ſight,
came to both the Princes, and vſed many friendly ſpéeches to
them, in like manner did the Empreſſe <hi>Agriola,</hi> the Kings
<hi>Recinde</hi> and <hi>Arnedes,</hi> with all the Princes and Ladies, whoſe
ioyes were not ſmall for this happy ſucceſſe. Then <hi>Palmerin</hi>
vſed great courteſie to the Prince <hi>Primaleon,</hi> for that he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
him to be father of his Lady and Miſtreſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi> and
Sonne to the Emperor his Grandfather, who had vouchſaued
him his honour, dnring the time he remained in his Pallace
<pb facs="tcp:13179:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The <hi>Sauage man</hi> and his Wife were very
graciouſly entertained, who ſéeing the two Princes in dignity,
beyond their expectations when they were in their Caue, did
greatly reioyce that Fortune had ſo fauourably preſerued their
noble liues. <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſéeing the time that euery one prepared
themſelues to their chambers, commanded <hi>Siluian</hi> to conduct
his father and mother, to a faire and rich Chamber which was
prouided for them. Euery one departing, the king accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Aliart</hi> to his Chamber, where he deſired to know, what the
other knight was that came in his company? If it pleaſe your
Grace (anſwered <hi>Aliart)</hi> to morrow morning you ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
to the vttermoſt, in the meane ſpace aſſure your ſelfe
that he is ſuch a one, as his valour deſerueth to be remembred

euery one went to take their reſt, forgetting all gréefe that was
paſſed before in remembrance of the fortunate ſucceſſe, that had
happened at this inſtant determination of ioy.</p>

he framed his delight to be in his company, and would
not attempt any thing, but he ſhould be priuie to it. The Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes
and ſumptuous feaſtes continued daily aboundantly,
and euery night there was Marking, Dauncing, &amp; rare deuiſes
put in execution: ſo that the <hi>Grecian</hi> Knights, highly honoured
the Ladies of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe braue geſture of Courtly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement,

After a long continuance of this excéeding ioy, <hi>Arnedes</hi> and

ſonnes to accompany the other Princes in their pleaſure: which
the Emperour perceiuing, determined to iourney towards <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemaigne</hi>

their leaue, <hi>Don Edward</hi> and the other Princes, deſired them
to vouchſafe the paines, to ſée the Caſtle of <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi>
wherein ſo long time they had béene kept as priſoners. This
requeſt pleaſed the Emperor very well, ſo that he deſired <hi>Arne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
and <hi>Recinde</hi> to beare him company alſo, and then they
would depart together. Intreaty had quickly wonne them, ſo
that on the morrow they departed themſelues thither, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied

themſelues ſo worthily in the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
prouiding them of new and rich Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
made great haſte, becauſe they would
bee ready to goe with the Giant <hi>Drauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ande,</hi>
onely becauſe they would gratifie
their Ladies, in bearing them company to
ſée this Caſtle. At their departure foorth of <hi>London,</hi> the King
by ſound of Trumpet and Heralde, cauſed them to be proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that no Citizens ſhould offer to follow them, becauſe hée
had determined (being ſo many of themſelues) that none ſhould
enter the Caſtle, but the Ladies and the Knights. For that
night hée concluded to lye in the Forreſt, and therefore ſent ſuch
prouiſion of Tents and Pauillions, that when they were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
there, they found euery thing to their owne content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>The Princeſſe <hi>Flerida,</hi> was deſirous to ſport her ſelfe about
the Forreſt, and walking By the place, where ſhée had ſuffered
the extreame panges of her trauayle, the <hi>Sauage man</hi> came
and humbled himſelfe vnto her, declaring how in that place
he tooke the two Princes from her, and nouriſhed them in his
Coue, which was néere adioyning. On this report, the knights
were deſirous to ſée his Caue, ſo taking leaue of the Princeſſe,
they walked with him thither: where, after <hi>Primaleon, Maior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and the <hi>Soldane Bellagris,</hi> were entred, they began euery
one to be greatly amazed, ſéeing this Caue to containe ſo large a
breadth and length: which made them ſuppoſe it to be in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
an intricate <hi>De dalus.</hi> All about on the walles was hanged
Tapiſtrie, not of Gold, Silke, Caddis, or ſuch maner of ſtuffe,
but the ſkinnes of Beaſtes, which the two Princes had ſlaine,
very finely laboured into an artificiall frame, and ſo decked
foorth the Chambers, that the Knights marueyled in ſo deſart a
place, to finde ſuch a fayre dwelling. A great while they ſtood
debating with one another, about the ſtrange conceyts they
perceiued in this Caue, which made them to iudge, that in
<pb facs="tcp:13179:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
times paſt, it had béene the ſolitary dwelling of ſome noble man
exiled from his Countrey, but therein they were greatly decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
For this ancient edifice, was erected by the Enchantreſſe
<hi>Mellia,</hi> who kept that place a great while, during the raigne of
the king <hi>Armace</hi> her Brother, <hi>Vrganda</hi> and ſhe liued both at
one time, as it is rehearſed in the Hiſtory of the Emperour
<hi>Splandian,</hi> Sonne to the valiant &amp; moſt magnificient king <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madis,</hi>
and the Princes <hi>Oriana</hi> his Wife, Quéene of the great
<hi>Brittaine.</hi> When the Princes and knights had ſatiſfied their
mindes in beholding this place, they returned to the Pauilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to their Ladies, who welcommed them all very louingly,
and <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſitting downe by his ſiſter <hi>Flerida,</hi> rehearſed to
her the manner of the Caue where the two Princes were nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed,
which did not a little content her minde, in that the
place was not ruinated and put into obliuion. This night they
repoſed themſelues in the Forreſt, as honourably ſerued, as if
they had béene in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, and in the morning they
prepared themſelues towards the Caſtle, being all the way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with ſuch fiue deuiſes, ſent by the cunning of the <hi>Sage
Aliart,</hi> that euery one tooke great pleaſure in this Princely
iourney. There were Hunters who purſued wilde Bores,
Harts, Bucks, and all ſuch noble game, and came wearily, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
downe at the Ladies feete, but when they offered to touch
them, they were preſently ſkipping on the farder ſide of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
theſe deuiſes ſo pleaſed the Emperor with all the company,
that they gaue great thankes to <hi>Aliart</hi> who frequented them
with ſuch pleaſant paſtime al the way as they rode. At laſt, they
arriued at the <hi>Valley of Perdition,</hi> where they had a ſight of the
Caſtle of <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> which went ſomewhat to the heart of
the Princeſſe <hi>Flerida,</hi> ſéeing the priſon wherein her louing <hi>Don
Edward</hi> had ſo long remained. The Emperour <hi>Trineus,</hi> &amp; king
<hi>Frederick,</hi> fel into great commendation of the ſumptuous buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

which mooued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to intreate <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of ſuch a ſingular péece of workmanſhip: to which demand,
<hi>Dramuſiande</hi> preſently gaue this reply. My gratious Lords,
this Caſtle was firſt builded by mine Aunt <hi>Eutropa,</hi> &amp; through
<pb facs="tcp:13179:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
her meanes, it hath remayned thus long out of knowledge.
Truſt me (ſaid the Emperour <hi>Trineus)</hi> a Fortreſſe of ſuch
ſtrength and beautie, ought not to be in the hands of one, who
could imploy it to ſuch great abuſe, but commonly we ſée, the
wicked do thriue as well as the good, and enioyas great account
in this world, as they that maintaine all their actions by iuſtice
and equitie. So riding on, at laſt <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> willed them to
a ſuddaine ſtay, where he began in this manuer to vnfold the
cauſe. Me thinks I ſée at the entrance of the Bridge, a ſéemly
Knight ready appointed to the Iouſt, but I can perceiue no
body that offereth him reſiſtance, which maketh me ſupoſe,
that he hath attempted to kéepe this paſſage. At this vnlooked
for accident, they ſtayed to behold the Knight who was very
well mounted on a gray Courſer, his Armour ſpotted with
white and blacke, which greatly pleaſed the eyes of the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
In his ſhéeld he ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of whoſe countenance was ſo excellently figured, that <hi>Altea</hi> (for
whom <hi>Floraman</hi> accompliſhed ſuch chiualricus déeds at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople)</hi>
might not ſéeme to offer compariſon to this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
ſpectacle, neither the faire Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi> might not
preſume to equall her ſelfe, with the braue ſhape of this Lady,
and at the lower end of this ſhéeld in letters of Gold was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<hi>Miragarda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While Princes occupied their eyes in beholding the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
forme compacted in his ſhéeld, they perceiued his Eſquire
come towards them, who after he had done his dutie to them
all, began to ſalute them with theſe proteſtations. Faire Lords
and Ladies, the noble knight my Maiſter, whom you behold
on the Bridge, by me giueth you to vnderſtand, the cauſe of his
trauailes vnto this place. He is of a far countrey, from whence
he had aduentured himſelfe (in honour of his good fortune, and
at the command of his Lady, whoſe humble ſeruant he remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
at this houre) to try his knighthood at this Caſtle, which
hath béene blazed abroad to be moſt infortunate.</p>
                     <p>But being here arriued, he is aduertiſed how the Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is fully finiſhed, and the ſtrength of the Giant <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſiande,</hi>
with all his retinew conquered, by the valour and
<pb facs="tcp:13179:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hautie Prowes of a knight named <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> who
hath deliuered the Princes, that were kept Captiue by the
cruell meanes of the diſloyall <hi>Eutropa,</hi> which newes are moſt
welcome vnto him, in that he deſired nothing more. Yet for
that he is loth to returne to his Lady, being at the place where
knighthood hath bene tryed, and he to paſſe backe againe not
approued of any: he craueth to enter the Iouſt with ſuch as are
diſpoſed, referring the Combate of the Sword, becauſe he will
aduenture for pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>This challenge encreaſed ſuch courage in the knights, that
they entred into ſtrife who ſhould firſt runne with the ſtrange
knight, which the king perceuing, returned the Eſquire with
this anſwer. My friend, tell thy Lord his enterpriſe is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
perpetuall renowne, &amp; if he containe ſuch courage in proofe,
as both his Meſſage and himſelfe giueth in ſhow, his Lady
ſhall haue occaſion to vſe him, according as his valiant attempt
deſerueth. The Eſquire receiuing the kings pleaſure, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to his Lord, to whom he had no ſooner made it knowne,
but <hi>Tremoran</hi> ſhewed himſelfe before the bridge, inuiting the
ſtrange knight to the Iouſt, who ſtayed not to accompliſh his
deſire, but encountring him with ſuch a pleaſant charge, that
<hi>Tremoran</hi> was forced to leaue his ſaddle.</p>
                     <p>This chance ſomewhat diſpleaſed <hi>Luyman</hi> of <hi>Burgondie,</hi>
who thinking to reuenge the repulſe of <hi>Tremoran,</hi> was ſent
himſelfe to kéepe him company. <hi>Belcar</hi> being deſirous to ſhew
his proweſſe among the young Knights, couched his Speare
againſt the ſtrange Knight, who ſent both Horſe and man to
the ground, when preſently <hi>Don Roſuell</hi> tooke the cauſe in
hand, and was made pertaker of the ſame miſhap.</p>
                     <p>In like manner <hi>Guerin, Friſol, Blandidon, Floraman,</hi> &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
other were ſerued, which moued the King <hi>Polendos</hi> vnto
ſuch choller, that he would haue ventured againſt the ſtrange
Knight, had not the prince <hi>Don Edward</hi> perſwaded him to the
contrary. Then there went a great murmuring amongſt the
knightes, who ſuppoſed the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> had brought this
Champion by his Art. to be a diſgrace vnto all their attempts,
and that he had vſed ſuch meanes vnto him, as he might not be
<pb facs="tcp:13179:116" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vanquiſhed, but herein they greatly deceiue themſelues, for it
was onely the noble force of the knight, which was continually
animated, by beholding the faire face of his Ladie, which was
ſo brauely proportioned in his ſhield. <hi>Floraman</hi> being greatly
bent againſt the Knight, and beléeuing that his victorie, procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the beauty of his Lady, would once more put his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in hazard, thinking the feature of his faire <hi>Altea,</hi> to be as
ſoueraigne in authoritie, as the ſtrange <hi>Miragarda,</hi> wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he thus began to conferre with himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Albeit Madame, I haue ſuffered your name to be abſent a
while from my thoughts, yet hath your beautie bene alwayes
extant in my memory, ſo that I neuer vowed the title to any
but you, although miſhap would haue vrged me to the contrary.
Wherefore, at this time let your beautie ſo fauour me, that I
may foyle mine enemy, in the perfect honour of your fame.</p>
                     <p>Then they encountred one another againe couragiouſly, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the firſt courſe with the breake of the Staffe: but at the
ſecond time, <hi>Floraman</hi> and his Stéede was throwne to the
ground very violently, when making recourſe to his former
ſecrete spéeches, be began as thus. I perceiue now <hi>Altea,</hi> that
my miſfortune chanceth thorow your froward opinion of mée,
and that the more I attempt in your honour, the more you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
me ſtill with hatred, which will vrge me to forſake your
ſeruice, and neuer aſſay any thing hereafter on warrant of your
courteſie.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Trineus</hi> and all the Princes, were very ſad
to behold the ſorrowe of <hi>Floraman,</hi> as alſo to ſée <hi>Oniſtalde</hi> and
<hi>Pompides</hi> reduced into like miſchance: whereat the ſtrange
Knight triumphed, which <hi>Don Florian</hi> ſtomaking, to ſee his
friends on euery ſide foyled, and the Knight to vant himſelfe
in ſuch ſort, giuing a <hi>Conge</hi> to the Empreſſe and her Ladies,
ranne violently againſt the ſtrange Knight. Thrée times
they met, yet neither preuayling againſt the other, when the
ſtrange Knight looking on his Shielde, and perceyuing the
faire face of his Lady, to be ſomewhat raiſed with the Speare,
began in this order to talke to himſelfe. Now can I execute my
ſelfe of the diſhonour I haue receiued, in ſuffering her faire
<pb facs="tcp:13179:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
face to be polluted, to whom I owe moſt dutifull affection? for
neither can I preuaile againſt him that hath done it, nor endure
long the Combate, I am ſo attached with ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>At the fourth attempt, they met ſo furiouſly together, that they
were both layde along on the earth, when becauſe the night
approched ſo faſt on, <hi>Palmerin</hi> could not compaſſe the meane
to enter the Iuſt, which made him ſuppoſe hée ſhould diſpleaſe
his fayre <hi>Polinarda,</hi> but <hi>Aliart</hi> to put him from that opinion,
he came to him with theſe wordes. Good Syr, let it not ſéeme
offenſiue to you, becauſe you haue not Iuſted with this Knight,
for if your valoure ſhould returne him any diſaduantage, your
Lady and Miſtreſſe would thinke great vngentleneſſe in you.
I thanke you Syr <hi>Aliart</hi> (anſwered <hi>Palmerin)</hi> for your courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſwaſion, in wiſhing me from that which might be my
hurt, albeit vnknowen vnto me, yet by your Arte made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
to you. But may I requeſt the name of his knight, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you may make mee greatly beholding to you, as alſo it will
cauſe me vſe more circumſpection in mine attempts, wherein I
onely deſire to eſcape the anger of my Lady <hi>Polinarda,</hi> to which
queſtion, <hi>Aliart</hi> ſhaped this reply.</p>
                     <p>Your courteſie is ſuch, and ſo great in mine affection, that I
cannot conceale the thing, which may doe you pleaſure, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

who putteth his noble déedes in proofe, for the honour of her,
whoſe Image you may perceiue figured on his Shielde euen
as you hazard all your actions, to purchaſe the fauour of her
who is your Lady, and his Siſter. At theſe words <hi>Palmerin</hi>
imbraced <hi>Aliart,</hi> giuing him hartie thankes, in that he had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied
his earneſt deſire, which he vowed to kéepe ſecrete, and

                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Florian</hi> being mounted on Horſebacke againe, was

                     <p>On the next morning they concluded to depart from thence,

                     <p>When they were arriued at the <hi>Obſcure Valley</hi> they behold
the Caſtle of the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi> which was ſo ingeniouſly edified,
and ſtrengthened ſo ſure by his induſtrie, that if I ſhould ſtay to
recite their opinions hereon, I ſhould weary your minds with
a tedious diſcourſe. There they ſtayed for the ſpace of foure
dayes, hauing ſuch royall ſeruice by the meanes of <hi>Aliart,</hi> that
they ſuppoſed in their owne Courts, it was vnpoſſible to bee
more Princely ſerued.</p>

                        <hi>Arnedes</hi> and <hi>Recinde</hi> deſirous to their owne Kingdomes,
tooke their leaue of the Emperour and all the company, the one
taking the way towards <hi>France,</hi> &amp; the other towards <hi>Spaine,</hi>
hauing no body with them, but ech one an Eſquire attending

with your your Siſter in Law <hi>Pandritia,</hi> in the realme
of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> which for the Ladies cauſe, I cannot admit
into obliuion, your labours being growne to ſuch a knightly
iſſue. Aſſure your ſelfe that this knight named <hi>Blandidon</hi> is

thought to diſcouer it to you when time and place required, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

dead, and her people ſorowfull at her auſtere kinde of life, you
ſhall manifeſt your honour to eſpouſe her at laſt, beſide, you
ſhall enioy a Princeſſe of excellent beautie, and a Sonne high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eſtéemed for his knightly bountie. <hi>Bellagris</hi> pauſed hereon
a prettie while, debating in his minde on the qualitie of his
enterpriſe, which he ſuppoſed to craue a déeper iudgement, then
the remembrance of his offence which was done paſt, at laſt
hauing remained mute for a good ſpace, he required the Prince
<hi>Don Edward</hi> with this anſwer. Credite me Sir, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
more amazed at any thing, which either Fortune hath ſent
me by miſchance, or mine owne folly by accident, then at this
report which you haue vouchſafed to diſcloſe, being as farre
from my thought, as I am from my natiue Country. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
I make ſuch eſtimation of <hi>Blandidon,</hi> that I accompt
my ſelfe happy to haue ſuch a Sonne, and for the affection I
beare to him, I wil accompliſh that, which elſe I neuer thought
to haue done, and hereupon I bid you hartily farewell, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

may.</p>
                     <p>Thus departed the <hi>Soldane Bellagris</hi> and <hi>Maiortes</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied

not ſparing his perſon, but would ieopard himſelfe in the places

                     <p>Long rode <hi>Primaleon,</hi> without any aduenture worthy the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſall,
till at laſt being come to the <hi>Triſtfull Valley,</hi> (where

he eſpied two Horſes comming from the Caſtle of <hi>Pandritia,</hi>
one of them hée knew to belong to the knight, that maintained
the Iuſt before the Caſtle of <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> which made him
ſomewhat amazed, to ſée him wander without his Maiſter. At

a Trée, attyred in blacke Armour, and in his hand the Shielde
with the Portraite of his Lady, whereto hée vſed many amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

and deliuering his Horſe to his Eſquire, drewe néere vnto the
Knight, who was ſo farre rauiſhed with beholding his Ladies
counterfaite, that he perceiued not the comming of <hi>Primaleon,</hi>
but thinking no body to be néere, continued his diſcourſes after

                     <p>Madame, if the deſire of him, who hath but once had the ſight

who not onely haue the continuall view of your heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beauty, but are partakers of your incomparable courteſie,
which being ſufficient to inueigle the mindes of the gods, hath
larger force to intrap the heart of any earthly Gallant. How
often doe I imbrace your Picture with an vnfained heart? And
how after powre foorth my complaints in the middeſt of all
miſhaps: liuing by the nobilitie of your name, as the Elephant
doeth by the Ayre, and reioycing in your Shrine, when God
knowes I am too far from the ſubſtance: Oh <hi>Florendos,</hi> borne
<pb facs="tcp:13179:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to great happineſſe if thou eſtéeme thy Parentage, but brought

to loue her, who endeth in likeing thée. Well mayſt thou call
thy ſelfe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> and good occaſion had he that gaue thée that
name, for which my poore heart hath paide indifferently, but

                     <p>Continuing theſe and a great many ſuch like ſpéeches, <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon</hi>
well knew that it was ſonne <hi>Florendos,</hi> whoſe grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
paſſions cauſed him to call to memory, the like ſorrowes
which himſelfe had endured, when he ſpent his trauayles for
the Princeſſe <hi>Gridonia:</hi> wherefore, drawing néere vnto him
he would not as yet take any knowledge of him, but ſaluted
him in theſe tearmes. Sir Knight, would you not impart ſome
of your gréefes to him, who ſorroweth to ſée you ouercharged
with ſuch heauineſſe? Truly Sir (aunſwered the <hi>Triſtfull
Knight)</hi> I receiue ſuch contentation in my troubled thoughts,
and haue vſed them ſo long to my good liking, that I would bée
loath any ſhould be priuie to my paſſions, but onely my ſelfe, to
whom they are alway welcome. But what are you that make
your ſelfe ſo hardy, as to diſturbe me from my contended exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe?
certainly if you dare expect a while, I will either force
you to repent this diſcourteſie, or bring you as a vaſſaile to my
Lady and Miſtreſſe.</p>
                     <p>So calling his eſquire to arme him, <hi>Primaleon</hi> mounted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently

that he would make him no anſwer, but ſtayed his comming
a pretty way from him. When the <hi>Triſtfull Knight</hi> was ready
prouided, and had bethought himſelfe of his vngentle wordes,
he came vnto <hi>Primaleon</hi> with theſe ſpéeches. Sir Knight (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me I pray you) if I haue forgotten my ſelfe towards you,
aſſuring you that I am ſorry for the wordes I gaue you in my
choller. Tuſh Sir (anſwered <hi>Primaleon)</hi> that is nothing to
me, to whom you may vſe what talke you pleaſe: but prouide
your ſelfe, for I am determined to trie your courage, becauſe
you would attempt to giue me the dare. At theſe words they
couched their Speares, which were deliuered on either ſide
<pb facs="tcp:13179:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with ſuch force, that the <hi>Triſtfull Knight</hi> was ſent to the earth,
<hi>Primaleon</hi> bearing him company, becauſe the girts of his Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
were broken. Being either of them greatly abaſhed, they
drew their Swords, and charged one another with very fierce
ſtrokes: <hi>Primaleon</hi> vſing no pittie vnto his ſonne, but hacked
his armour as eagerly, as had he bene his greateſt enemy in the
world.</p>
                     <p>By this you may perceiue, that furie little regardeth fréend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
or affinitie, but is ſo extreame, both in the Father, and in
the Childe, that it ſtretcheth beyond reaſon, or the limits of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Long was the fight, and very dangerous on either part
their armour ſpoyled, their bodies ſore wounded, and their
ſtrengths ſo much altered, that one would haue ſuppoſed death
to be the next remedie.</p>
                     <p>Then withdrawing themſelues to pauſe a little, they caſt

being greatly afflicted to behold the Ladyes, as alſo angred at

theſe ſpéeches. Sir knight, I will trie at this very inſtant
if the Portraite of your Lady will ſtand you in any more néed,
or the deuotions that you vſe vnto her, to deliuer you out of my

know how vaine it is, to ſpend your time in ſuch fooliſh cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

otherwiſe then I thinke for, becauſe of the tariance of my ſonne
<hi>Primalaon,</hi> whoſe abſence is no ſmall cauſe of my heauineſſe.
With that the Emperour ſate downe by the Ladies, whom
<hi>Primaleon</hi> began to behold very earneſtly, becauſe he percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them growne into great alteration, eſpecially the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
his Father, whoſe countenance was much changed, then
when he ſaw him laſt, and the Princes <hi>Gridonia,</hi> had greatly
offended his faire face, with the continuall mourning ſhée vſed
for the abſence of her Lord: ſo generally beholding them all, and
ſtaying from ſpeaking an indifferent long ſpace, to the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing
of the Emperor, as alſo the company of the courtly La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
at laſt he vnclaſped his Beuer, &amp; began in this order. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you, my gratious father, to pardon my long ſilence, as alſo
the great time of mine abſence from your royall Court, hauing
no other Meſſage to preſent you, but the good health of your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
friends in <hi>England,</hi> as alſo of your Sonne <hi>Primaleon,</hi> who
humbleth himſelfe before your gratious preſence. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
was ſuddenly wrapt with ſuch an inward ioy, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> for a great
time he remained as it were in a trance, in like maner the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe,
<hi>Gridonia, Polinarda,</hi> &amp; al the Ladies, who came running
altogether, &amp; imbraced him with ſuch ioy, as it is impoſſible for
me to giue iudgement thereon. After hée had vſed curteſie to

he ſaid. Faire Siſter, feare you not, your Lord <hi>Vernas</hi> will not
long abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t himſelfe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, but you ſhal haue him here right ſoon
I dare warrant you. Then was he vnarmed, when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb facs="tcp:13179:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
could not ſatiſfie himſelfe, till he heard the ioyfull newes
lately chanced in <hi>England:</hi> but when he vnderſtood, how <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
was ſonne to the Prince <hi>Don Edward,</hi> and his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Flerida,</hi> he receiued great contentation, in that he was nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed

her ioy from any one, <hi>Dramacian</hi> excepted, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe was
accuſtomed to diſcloſe her ſecrets. Great was the pleaſure for
the returne of <hi>Primaleon,</hi> whom the nobles and gentlemen of
the cittie came dayly to welcome: but to their greater content,
within a while after, the Prince <hi>Vernar</hi> with a great many of
the Princes &amp; knights of <hi>Greece,</hi> arriued at the Court, whoſe
company was not ſo long deſired, as now they were ioyfully
and hartily embraced. In the middeſt of this great triumphing
and ſolace, a Meſſenger ſent from the <hi>Soldane Belagris,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
himſelfe before the Emperour, who diſcloſed his meſſage
in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Illuſtrious Prince, the <hi>Soldan Bellagris,</hi> my Lord and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
in humble duty kiſſeth the hand of your excellency, giuing
you to vnderſtand, that ſo ſoone as he was arriued at his court
he was aduertiſed how the <hi>Soldon</hi> of <hi>Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> hauing with him
a great and puiſſant armie, prepared himſelfe to ouerrunne
your country and Empire, and to make a generall ſpoile of your
people and Dominions, your eſtate being weakned through
the loſſe of thoſe knights, who haue left your Court to ſéek the
aduentures of great <hi>Brittain.</hi> But when he was taking Ship,
and his Army at poynt to hoyſe their ſailes, word was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brought him, how certaine Lords in his Realme, had leuied
a number of his owne ſubiects, to enter armes againſt him, for
that they were able no longer to ſuffer his oppreſſing tyranny.
Vpon this occaſion he ſtayed his armie, to bring them in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance,
that had béene ſo hardie to rebell againſt him: which
thing he can hardly do, without the loſſe of <hi>20000. Pagans,</hi> but
when he ſhall finiſh with them, thou he intendeth to viſite
you. Which that you might preuent, my Lord thus willed me
to make knowne vnto you, wiſhing to ſée the houre of his own
death, before your imperiall eſtate ſhould be any way be diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Gramercy my good friend (ſaid the Emperour) at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
I perceiue the great good wil which the <hi>Soldane</hi> thy Lord
hath alwaies borne vnto me, to whom I pray thée commend
me with honourable thankes, proteſting to do as much for him
if (as God forbid) he ſtand in the like néede. I thinke it beſt for
you to take your reſt a while, becauſe hauing endured ſo long
trauail, you cannot elſe chuſe but be very ſore laboured: yet firſt
I deſire thée to rehearſe, how fareth thy Lord ſince his coming
home? My Lord (anſwered the Meſſenger) euer ſince his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual,
hath delighted to diſcourſe of the ſtrange aduentures, which
not long ſince are brought to ende in great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> which
how rare they be, I know your highneſſe hath heard, wherfore
I néed not to reherſe them. You ſay true (quoth the Emperour)
and aſſure your ſelfe that the impriſonment of the Engliſh
Prince <hi>Don Edward</hi> will cauſe the Caſtle of <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> to
remaine in perpetuall and renowned memory. Thus conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their talke, the Emperour went to the Empreſſe chamber
where, in the preſence of the Ladies, he rehearſed the Meſſage
from the <hi>Soldan Bellagris:</hi> and on the morrow the meſſenger
departed, bearing with him the Emperours letters to his Lord.
Now was the Court and Citizens repleniſhed with as great
ioy, as before they were filled with heauineſſe, when they ſtood
in feare of the Armie of the <hi>Soldan</hi> of <hi>Babylon.</hi>

him great occaſion of pleaſure to behold it. This Caſtle vrged
him to aduance his courſe thither, but there lay a blocke in his

gréene ſhade as he rode, he perceiued three Ladies of ſuch ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular

ſéene the like. Theſe Ladies continued a very ſerious diſcourſe

of <hi>Florendos:</hi> who gaue a great good liking to them all, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
ſhée that ſat in the middeſt, to whom the other twaine
ſhewed very great reuerence, being of moſt ſtately beautie, as
alſo of a ſingular and erquiſite behauiour. But ſhall we ſay, that
<hi>Florendos</hi> was enamoured at this faire ſpectacle? O no, hee
could as well eſchew it, as the Bird faſt caught in the Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
ſnare, and he liked her no better, then he that did moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and heartily loue her: ſo that hee changeth his mirth into
mones, his talke into teares, and his whole cogitations, to a
Louers complexion: aiming the whole courſe of his affection
on the Lady, whoſe face had the power to detaine his fréedom,
and her behauiour the operation, to be chiefe ſtarre within the
compaſſe of his Sphere. Still he ſtroue with himſelfe, to goe
backe againe, and ſhun the blaze that had ſet on fire his ſences:
but affection had hung ſuch a clog on his conceits, and one looke
brought his heart into ſuch a Labyrinth, that <hi>Ariadnes</hi> thread
could do him no good, but only the ſaint that had giuen him this
glaunce. While he remained in theſe muſes, ſuch occaſion the
Ladies receiued, that they leaue the field, and walke into their
Caſtle, which gaue ſuch an vnkind corſey to the heart of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendos,</hi>
that now his mind was in ſome more outrage then
before: yea, they were no ſooner gone, but he fell into ſuch rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
accuſations againſt himſelfe, partly becauſe timeritie
withheld him from ſpeaking to them, and then againe, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
his cauſe was to haue mooued ſpeech, ſo that betwéene
the one &amp; the other, he was eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a man diſtraught of his wits.
Then began he to feele the ſeuerall accidents, which loue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printeth

pierce more déepe with his aiming ſhaft, then the hardy enemie

in more ſuretie when the Bullets flew about his eares, then
when Beautie had ſent her charges to warre againſt his eies,
which was able to do more in an houre, then the other had po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
in the ſpace of a yeere. Well, ſad as he was, he walked to
the Caſtell, where finding the gate ſhut, hee fell into his former
agonies: but by Fortune, caſting his eyes aſide, hee beheld a
<pb facs="tcp:13179:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Shéeld hanging on the wall, wherin was liuely giuen to view,
the Portrait of the Lady (who was miſtreſſe of his hart) which
he iudged to be handled in ſuch perfection, that it wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but in reſemblance of the perſon. Vnder this ſhéeld in
golden letters, was artificially written the name of <hi>Miragarda</hi>
whereby <hi>Florendos</hi> verily ſuppoſed that it belonged to her who
iuſtly deſerued it: becauſe her beautie did not only merit to be
viewed, but would likewiſe inuegle the hearts of the ſtouteſt
that durſt conceiue the hardineſſe in themſelues, to come to her
place of abode. Yet were not thoſe letters placed there to that in

to trauaile that way, to be carefull to themſelues for feare
of the Giant <hi>Almarol,</hi> who was Lord of that Caſtle, and kept
that Shéeld there in the behalfe of this faire <hi>Miragarda,</hi> againſt
any knight that durſt preſume to take it from thence. While
<hi>Florendos</hi> ſtood vſing a thouſand amorous deuotions to this
ſingular picture, he eſpyed the Giant to come forth of the caſtle,
armed with a Iacke of Azier, no leſſe faire then ſtrong, and
mounted on a ſturdy blacke Courſer, when to <hi>Florendos</hi> he
began to vſe theſe words.</p>
                     <p>Credit me ſir knight, the myſtery of theſe letters, hath gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſuch a maiſtery of you, that I feare you will repent when firſt
you ſaw them, and that fortune was ſo much your enemy to
conduct you to this place. Truſt me (anſwered <hi>Florendos)</hi> if I
did not more fauour the portrait, then I ſtand in feare of thy

reſpect theſe words thou vſeſt in thy ruffe, I ſhould hardly ſhew

no forbearance but ready payment, I will cauſe my ſword at
this time to ſeale thée quittance. Theſe words, cauſed one either
ſide cruell blowes with their weapons, not ſo dangerous to the
one, but as doubtfull to the other: yet fortune fauouring the
Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> brought the Giant <hi>Almoral</hi> into ſuch eſtate
that he had bene made ſhorter by the head, had not <hi>Miragarda</hi>
preſently diſcended, who perceiuing <hi>Almoral</hi> brought into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,

beare not ſuch a bloody minde to deſire the loſſe of his life, but if
for my ſake you will do ſo much, then fauour him to whom I
am very much beholding, as well for his gentleneſſe, as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                     <p>Madame, of ſuch force are your gratious ſpéeches, as alſo the
good opinion I conceiue of your ſéemely ſelfe, that I not onely
vow my heart at your command, but alſo my hand to maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
your cauſe, wherefore I grant him his life, deſiring that
your gentle nature wold afford me the like, for that your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
claimed ſuch a conqueſt of me, as none but your ſelfe can any
way mitigate. <hi>Miragarda</hi> giuing him great thanks for his cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie,
departed into the Caſtle againe, accompanyed with the
Giant: <hi>Florendos</hi> ſtill remaining without, complaining on the
wound he receiued by her beautie, and not of the hurts he had
gained through the Giant. In whoſe company he enterpriſed to
kéepe the ſhéeld of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> entring the Combat in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
with all the Knights that made their iourney that way,
which indéed were nany, through the ſingular report of her
beautie, yet fortune at that inſtant preferring <hi>Florendos,</hi>
cauſed him ſtill to remaine the Conquerour.</p>
                     <p>Thus remained the Prince in extreame conflict of his loue,
frequencing dayly his Ladies picture, with his amorous and
penſiue complaints, which <hi>Miragarda</hi> tooke ſuch pleaſure to
behold, that ſhe fained for to loue him, onely becauſe ſhe would
ſcorne at his fond and fooliſh dealings. But when Fame had
blowne abroade the aduentures of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> how the

Miragarda</hi> conceiuing ſuch an opinion of him, did
earneſtly requeſt that he would take his iourney thither, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
him that the aduenture of the Fortreſſe, was only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
to be finiſhed by his valour.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Florendos</hi> loath to diſobey her commandement, tooke vpon
him to crauaile, that he arriued in <hi>England,</hi> at ſuch time as he
heard the aduenture to be finiſhed, and the Princes were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
themſelues to come to the Caſtle, where on the bridge
<pb facs="tcp:13179:126" rendition="simple:additions"/>

you ſhall be reſolued how the faire <hi>Miragarda</hi> chanced to
this Caſtle, and why the Giant <hi>Almorol</hi> defended her as you

and that the noble Gentlemen of the Court, ſtriuing to

ſafetie, as you may aſſure your ſelf it is to be feared. The knight
ſuddenly awaked, and ſetting hand to his Sword, preſently
ſtarted vp: When <hi>Palmerin</hi> had knowledge of him to bee the
Prince <hi>Gracian,</hi> whoſe company was not a little welcome to
him, being in ſuch a ſolitary and vnfrequented place of paſſage,
wherefore hee began in theſe tearmes following. Sir <hi>Gracian,</hi>
let not my preſumption be admitted to any offence, but rather
eſtéemed of in this ſort, that I am yours any way to command
in ſeruice. <hi>Gracia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> being glad to ſee the Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his puiſſance might remedy part of his miſfortune,
which being willing to diſcloſe, he imbraced the Prince in his
armes, and in this order began to vtter his tale. As it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne,
worthy ſir, how your knightly chiualry hath brought
to end the adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture which was tearmed beyond any poſſibility,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo knowe I that your affection is inclined to ayde thoſe, whoſe
miſaduenture requiret the helpe ſo good a Knight, and how
happie your arriuall at this time is, let the ſpectacle you ſhall
ſhortly ſée, remaine as an vndoubted and infallible witneſſe,
which becauſe delay in words may turne to ſome danger, thus
it is.</p>
                     <p>If you follow on the way you ſée right before you, it will not
be long before you ſhall come to the place, where the Princes
<hi>Platir</hi> and <hi>Floraman</hi> abide in great danger, to whom you may
yéelde maruailous friendly ſuccour, if you make haſt to them,
who would gladly be ſo happy as to haue a ſight of you.</p>
                     <p>In the meane time, if <hi>Siluian</hi> will doe me the fauour, that I
may mount vp behinde him, if we come not vnto you, I deſire
you to except vs at the <hi>Forgetfull Stone,</hi> where haue you no
doubt but we will meete together.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> being ſory to heare theſe newes, but highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
his Fortune, that he came ſo luckely to the aide of the
two Princes, promiſing to fulfill the requſt of <hi>Gracian,</hi> he ſet
Spurres to his Horſe, and rode as faſt as poſſible he might to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them. He had not rode very long, but that he came to a
place, where two pathes ſeruing two ſeueral wayes, made him
to ſtand in a muſe which way he were beſt to take, but to driue
him from his doubt, he eſpied a Damoſell come riding towards
him, vſing ſuch heauy clamours, as if one had purſued her to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
her of her life. <hi>Palmerin</hi> abaſhed at this vnlooked for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture,
ſtayed his Horſe to queſtion with her, but ſhe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his intent, in a great feare gaue him theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>Good Sir offer me not the diſcourteſie, to be a hinderance to
my happy trauaile, for that you may endamage me, with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
harme if you ſtay me, then the diſcourſe of my miſfortunes,
can yéelde you any content to heare, which I am afraide to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe,
becauſe I doubt your valour can giue me no comfort in
this great miſhappe. Truſt me Lady (anſwered <hi>Palmerin)</hi>
as for my valour, I can hardly make you any warrant of it,
but ſo great is my deſire at this inſtant, that I muſt requeſt
you ſhewe me the cauſe of your grieuous lamentation. Well
Syr (quoth ſhée) ſince you are ſo deſirous to vnderſtand the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extremitie
<pb facs="tcp:13179:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of my caſe, come with me, and you ſhall be certified
hereof, as much as you can poſſible craue. So riding on with
her, at length he eſpyed a goodly Caſtle, and heard a great ſlaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and bruit of weapons, to which noyſe the damoſell brought
him, &amp; ſhewed him where ten knights had ſetled themſelues in
fight againſt twaine, who defended them with ſo great pollicy,
and charged their enemies with ſuch courage of minde, that in
a little ſpace they had laid fine of them dead on the ground.</p>
                     <p>By theſe knights ſtood certaine men, holding two faire and
comely Ladies, with whom they would haue entred into the
Caſtle, but that theſe two Knights kept themſelues ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the gate, ſo that it was not poſſible for them any way to
enter in.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> beholding the Combate very fierce on both ſides,
their blood cruelly waſted, &amp; their ſtrengths altogether brought
into great weakeneſſe, had not ſtayed long before he perceyued
a mighey bigge knight to come forth of the Caſtle, who was
very ſtrongly armed and mounted, with him ten well appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
men, that garded his perſon, and were very diligent about
him. Aduauncing himſelfe, to the remainder of thoſe that
were left aliue of the ten knights, and endured ſtill the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
with the other twaine: verie Maieſtically he gaue foorth
theſe wordes. Retire you Varlets, and let me breake the
bones of theſe Caitifes, who haue procured me to high and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
diſpleaſure. When <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſaw the two Knightes in
very féeble eſtate, ſo that this freſh reſiſtance were the vtter
loſſe of their liues, he ſtepped to the knight, replying in this
manner. If thou haue either regard of Knighthood, or the
honourable conditions, thou oughteſt to vſe in any martiall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
then leaue them whom thou ſéeſt are too weake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
and prouide thy ſelfe for me, who haue enterpriſed their
quarrell.</p>
                     <p>The knight offended at theſe words of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> couched
his ſpeare, and ran againſt ech other with ſuch puiſſance, that
being not able to reſiſt the encounter, they were ſent together
violently to the earth. Then falling to the combate of the
Sword, the other armed men came in defence of their Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when by good Fortune, the Prince <hi>Gracian</hi> came and ayded
them with ſuch couragious helpe, that they foure aſſayling the
knight and his companions, in the end preuailed, and ſiue them
all outright, which cauſed the other ſtanding by, and ſéeing their
Lord and his knights ſlaine before their faces, to run into the
Caſtle, and betake themſelues to darke Sellers and Vauts,
onely becauſe they ſtood in feare of loſing their liues.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſéeing the field was theirs, and no body came to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any more reſiſtance, he went to the Ladyes, who were very
pale of colour, by reaſon of the great feare they ſtood in, when the
cruell <hi>Dramaco</hi> tooke them, ſeeking to diſhonour them, and to
offer them what villany he could: wherefore the Prince in theſe
words began to ſalute them.</p>
                     <p>Faire Ladyes, ſhew me I pray you the occaſion why this
villanous wretch endeuoured himſelfe to your diſhonour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I am ignorant how it hath happened, yet being certified
of your miſfortune, came to do you the beſt ſeruice I might. <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir</hi>
and <hi>Floraman,</hi> when they had knowledge how it was the
Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> ſtayed the Ladyes anſwer, comming and
imbracing him with great courteſie, gaue him harty thanks for
his friendly ſuccour. Nay truſt me (anſwered <hi>Palmerin)</hi> giue
your thanks to the Prince <hi>Gracian,</hi> for I had not come vnto
you at this time, if he had not declared vnto me the heauineſſe
of your eſtate. Then taking the Ladies by the hang, they went
into the caſtle, where they found no body but two aged women,
who ſate wringing their hands for the death of <hi>Dramaco:</hi> and
ſéeing them coming in that had ſlain him &amp; all his companions,
diſſembled the greef which remained in their harts, &amp; ſubmitted
themſelues, fearing leſt they ſhould taſt of the ſame cup them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
onely requeſting that their liues might be ſaued, which
the renowned <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England</hi> did preſently grant them,
Then were they and the Ladies brought into a goodly Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where their Eſquires bound vp their wounds, and made
prouiſion to get them their ſtrength againe: but <hi>Palmerin</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to haue more knowledge of the knight which was ſlaine,
queſtioned with one of the old women, who was his mother,
when ſhe preſently returned him this anſwer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Knight whom you to my griefe haue ſlaine, was called
<hi>Dramaco,</hi> hée being my ſonne, and begotten by the valiant Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant

Worthy Sir, we are the daughters of a Lady, who inhabiteth
not farre from this place in her Caſtle, where we liued in ſuch
quiet content of life, and ſo well guarded (as we ſuppoſed) from
any enſuing danger, that we feared no miſhap, being ſo well
gouerned by our Lady Mother.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But as none can auoide what the deſtenies haue ordained, but
muſt abide the doome of their appointed fortune: ſo we allowed
to this great vnhappineſſe, haue felt part of the rygour of this
cruell tyrant. For he being addicted to ſuch a cruell nature,
that the Noble he rewarded with bloody murther, fayre Ladies
and Damoſelles he defaced of their honour, and vſed all alike
in his villainous furie: he ſent tent Knights to the aforeſayde
Caſtle of our Mother, who finding vs altogether vnprouided of
refuge at that time (inſomuch as our woonted ſafetie gaue vs
ſmall cauſe of doubt:) without reſpect to her teares, or our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
brought vs away by extreame violence.</p>
                     <p>By the way as they brought vs, we met this Knight, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Prince <hi>Gracian,</hi> whom they diſmounted from his
Horſe: and becauſe they perceiued him ſuch a comely Knight,
they ſaued his life, but tooke his Horſe, and left him on foote to
goe whither him pleaſed, thinking ſcorne to accept the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
which by ſundry meanes he offered vnto them. Leauing
him there alone, they brought vs with them to the Caſtell,
when theſe other two Knights ſwiftly purſuing after vs, ſtood
our defence in ſuch order, that they would not ſuffer vs to bee
lead into the Caſtell.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Dramaco</hi> ſéeing theſe Knights, preuailed ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his ſeruants, came himſelfe to accompliſh what they
could not fulfill, but then how well you ſtood our friend, the
happy effect remaineth as a ſubſtantiall witneſſe. When
<hi>Palmerin</hi> had well marked the diſcourſe of the Lady, theyr
great miſfortune and the monſterous crueltie of <hi>Cramaco,</hi> hée
reioyced that he found <hi>Gracian</hi> in ſuch a luckie time, by whoſe
meanes he had brought the aduenture to ſuch a good and happy
concluſion.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Gracian</hi> rehearſed, how in the time hée ſtayed at the
trée, <hi>Platir</hi> &amp; <hi>Floraman</hi> came that way (after the knights that
conducted the Ladies had taken his horſe, and left him there in
the order as you haue heard:) to whom he declared the miſhap
of the Ladies, whereupon they rid haſtily after them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
the Combat, as you haue already heard, vntill ſuch time
as one of the Ladies eſcaping away, met the Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and brought him to defend their oppreſſed cauſe. After they had
ſifted euery matter, according as themſelues deſired to knowe,
the Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> gaue the Caſtle to both the Ladies, &amp; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
his farewell very gently of them all, he mounted on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,
leauing them at the cure of their woundes at the Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>The Ladies were very carefull to helpe the Princes, who
at length were brought to their former ſtrength: where they
paſſed away the time pleaſantly with the Ladies, recounting
the ſtrange aduenture which they had happily paſſed. But the
death of <hi>Dramaco</hi> comming to the eare of theſe Ladies mother,
cauſed her to come thither to ſée her daughters, who, when ſhe
was there arriued, gaue great thankes to the Princes for their
imployed paines, and gratified them with ſuch honour, as ſhée
could deutie expedient for the time and place.</p>
                     <p>When the Princes ſaw euery thing in due and deſent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
they determined to depart from thence: deſiring the Ladies
to vſe courteſie to the ancient mother of <hi>Dramaco,</hi> becauſe ſhee
was innocent, and not culpable in his miſchieeous practiſes. At
their requeſt, the Ladies willing to ſhewe, that liberalitie is a
vertue of great commendation, gaue her the caſtle of her ſonne
<hi>Dramaco,</hi> for which ſhe rewarded them with very courteous
thankes.</p>
                     <p>So the Princes going into the Armoury of <hi>Dramaco,</hi> where
they prouided themſelues each one of a notable Armour: and
from his ſtable likewiſe tooke three of his faireſt Stéeds, which
might better ſerue their neceſſitie, then to abide there, and put
to no exerciſe. Then leauing the ladies there in the Caſtle, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to depart to their owne abiding, they vowed to ſtay in no

and the billowes of the Seas brought the ſhip to a ſtrange

made a great raging, he alighted and gaue
his Horſe to <hi>Siluian,</hi> deſirous to looke a

any body there, of whom hée might be reſolued from whence
the veſſel was, and wherfore they ſtrooke on land in ſuch an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequented

that in an aduenture of no better countenance, it was but méer
folly to hazard his perſon, but when he ſaw his words might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
no perſwaſion from his attempt, he ſuffered him to enter
the ſhip according to his own deſire. No ſooner was the prince

offred to caſt himſelfe on land againe by the boughs of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Trees,
but all was in vaine, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ship lanched forth in the déepe, and
with a full gale of wind rode merily vpon the ſurges. In ſhort

himſelfe, but iudging all for the beſt, he repoſed on the mercy of

alway ſerued, as an eſpecial remedy to his amorous aſſaults,
and wanting his company now in this heauy caſe, hee was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to vtter diuers and ſundry complaints.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſpent hée all that night, in a Courtly debate betwéene
reaſon &amp; his earneſt deſire, the one to perſwade him from that
dangerous kinde of trauaile, and to exclude from his mind, the
fond allarmes giuen by his fancy: the other, how continually
it wrapped him in an intricate or endleſſe vexation of his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But as often we ſée, Reaſon is ſubiect to the amorous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
ſo the prince not able to reſiſt the aſpiring drifts of his eger
paſſions, reſigned both his will and wit, to follow the loue and
amitie he had begun to his Lady and Miſtreſſe. When hée had
waſted the night in this ſmall order of reſt, &amp; the chéerefull mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
deliuered her faire countenance, he went on, ſtill muſing
on the wordes he had read vpon the Pillar, which he eſtéemed
to be flat mockage, becauſe he could perceiue nothing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
ſuch a forewarning.</p>
                     <p>But as he trauailed in a faire plaine field, ſtill vſing his
minde with his former exerciſes, hée came to a Fountaine of
ſingular beautie, the Pillars whereof, was of fine wrought A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure,
&amp; the water iſſuing forth at the mouthes of diuers beaſts
very artificially made. The Prince ſtanding a good while in a
muſe at this Fountaine, how ſo much water ſhould aſcend vp
ſuch a high Mountaine, and why ſuch a faire thing ſhould ſtand
in ſuch a vacant place, could not readily thinke with himſelfe
what he might iudge thereon, for at the lower end of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Pillars, lay two cruell Tygers, and two fierce Lions, who
as hée ſuppoſed kept Paſſengers that they ſhould not drinke at
this Fountaine.</p>
                     <p>This ſtrange ſight made him ſomewhat abaſhed, and to ſtand
in feare, that it was ſome Enchantment practiſed, to get him
into ſome preſent danger: becauſe the beaſtes behaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in ſuch order, as though they might eaſily be brought vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the chaine, which was of ſuch bignes, as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
<pb facs="tcp:13179:133" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to holde ſuch furious beaſtes, yet were they tyed at ſuch
ſhortneſſe, that they had very litle ſcope of walking. <hi>Palmerin</hi>
knew it was néedles, to aſke leaue to drinke at this Fountaine,
of thoſe that had no reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make him anſwer, albeit they were
too ſtrong in force, to offer him reſiſtance: wherefore he attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to try the friendlineſſe of Fortune, and to put his life in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
vpon this aduenture. Then aduancing himſelfe to taſte of
the water, vpon one of the Pillars in letters of Gold, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graued
theſe words: <hi>Behold here the Fountaine of the wiſhed
water.</hi> And going a little farther, he eſpied an other, which was
thus: <hi>He that hath the courage to drinke of this Fountaine,
ſhall bring to ende any enterpriſe that belongeth to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement
of Honour and Fame: ſo that he ſhall accompliſh
as much, as may be comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the ſtrength or proweſſe
of a man.</hi> But ouer againſt it, was written theſe words: <hi>Paſſe,
and drinke not.</hi> This made the Prince not a little aſtonied, in
that as the one gaue him encouragement to approach the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
ſo the other ſtood in the way to hinder his determination.
But yet he concluded to try the aduenture, in that he iudged it
was impoſſible, to méete with an occaſion of more hautie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.</p>

from thence, he arriued at a Caſtle, whereon he ſawe foure
Shields placed, and being vrged by the Poeſies hee ſawe
written on them, to try the ende of this vnlooked for acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
hee entred the Combate againſt foure knights that

in his minde, as concerning what
might happen by this gorgeous ſpectacle,
becauſe the poeſies were placed in ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
manner, that he verilie ſuppoſed it
was but ſome trappe or ſecret fetch, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
him to venture on his owne deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Wherfore hee determined to depart from thence, and not
meddle with the Beaſts, becauſe he ſaw their faire ſhew of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſſe,
was but onely to haue him approch the Fountaine.
When he had walked a little way from thence, he began to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
and blame himſelf, that either ſeare ſhould cauſe him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
his duty, or any occaſion withdraw his mind from ſuch an
honourable attempt.</p>
                     <p>Then returning couragiouſly backe againe, he aduanced
himſelfe againſt one of the Tigers at the corner of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:
who like wiſe gaue himſelfe in ſuch manner againſt the
Prince catching hold vpon his Shield ſo forceably, that the
handle brake off, and detained it in ſuch wiſe, that the Prince
could not by any meanes get it againe, but charged him with
ſuch a ſound ſtroke ouer the legges, that the Tiger could not
vſe himſelfe ſo well as he would.</p>
                     <p>To ſuccour the féeble eſtate of the Tiger, came the other
thrée Beaſtes, behauing themſelues ſo furiouſly againſt the
Prince, that he thought this the moſt doubtfull aduenture, in al
his life time he had attempted. Hauing wounded one of the
Lions verie ſore, ſo that he was conſtrained to fall to the earth,
the Prince ſtouped downe to recouer his ſhield, which the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
had abandoned, but the other Lion approched ſo néere vnto
him, that catching hold vpon his Helmet, he drew him within
his reach ſo violently, that hee was enforced to fall vpon his
knées, whan the other Tiger cruſhed him with his pawes ſo
cruelly, that had not his Armor been the ſtronger, he had torne
the Prince in a hundred péeces.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
When he perceiued himſelfe attainted with ſuch an extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that his life ſtood on the very point of danger: with his ſword
he ſaluted him ſo déepe through the heart, that the Tiger ſpraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
on the earth cleane bereft of life. In bréefe, the courage of
his noble minde, did animate him with ſuch hardineſſe, that (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
with great paine and trauaile) hee made a diſpatch of all
their liues, when then he ſate him downe to take a little reſt,
becauſe the Tiger had preſſed him to the ground with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
violence, that he thought verily all his bones had bene
broken. After he had red him for a prettie while, he went to the
Fountaine, being deſirous to quench his thirſt, but he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
another little Poſey, which was ſo darkly couched, that he
could not gather any meaning of it, wherefore he preſently
drauke of the water, finding no more pleaſantneſſe in it, then
any other running Riuer or ſpring. But he iudged both the
Fountaine and the aduenture, to be placed there by ſome cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Enchantreſſe to diſharten the timerous, and glut the eyes
of the valiant with a faire and pleaſant ſhow.</p>
                     <p>When he ſaw no other hazard to be tried in that place, he
went on ſtill in the path, that was made from the Fountaine,
but at laſt on a ſuddaine, he eſpyed a very goodly and well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Caſtle, ſo finely moated round about, with a draw bridge
at the entrance, and the Trées ſhadowing it in ſuch a delicate
manner, that his minde was altogether delighted in beholding
this rare and ſeemely caſtle.</p>
                     <p>Before the gate there ſtood foure very faire Iaſper pillars,
and vpon ech of them was hanged a knightly ſhéeld, which
<hi>Palmerin</hi> taking perfect view of, beheld in the firſt vpon a Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ground, this Poſey, <hi>No man dare conceiue the courage to
take me downe.</hi> No (quoth <hi>Palmerin)</hi> by your leaue I will be
ſo bold as to trye, for if the taking downe of a ſhéeld ſhould
feare me, no matter if the aduenture did worthily foyle me, and
ſince your proteſtations are ſo hautie, I will enforce you to
humble your ſelfe to me, as well to ſerue my néede becauſe I
want a ſhéeld, as alſo to prooue the bragges contained in theſe
words. When <hi>Palmerin</hi> had faſtened the ſhéeld to his arme,
he eſpyed a knight comming forth of the Caſtle, with a verie
<pb facs="tcp:13179:134" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great Maieſtie, béeing ſtrongly armed, who ſeeing the Prince
without a Helmet, (the Lyon hauing bruſed it in ſuch ſort, that
he could not weare it) proudlie began to vtter theſe ſpéeches.
He that will preſume to take downe one of theſe Shieldes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not armed according to finiſh ſuch an enterpriſe, muſt taſte
the puniſhment due to his fault committed, becauſe hee may
learne againſt another time, to arme his head, which ſtandeth
in moſt danger.</p>
                     <p>With theſe words, (not ſtaying to heare the anſwer of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin)</hi>
he began to charge him with very mightie ſtrokes, and
ſtill aimed to hit him on the bare head, but <hi>Palmerin</hi> preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his determination ſo well, that cloſing faſt vpon him, hée
brought him downe vpon both his knées, &amp; making ſemblance
as though he would haue ſlaine him, the knight deſired mercie,
and yeelded himſelfe to the Princes courteſie. <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſauing
his life, demanded of him if hee had any more to deale withall,
to whom hee anſwered, that the chiefeſt danger was behind,
wherupon the Prince arming his head, with the Helmet of the
vanquiſhed knight, went to the ſecond Pillar, whereupon the
Shield in a Campe of Azure, he read as thus, <hi>I am more peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and therefore worthie to be feared, for in me conſiſteth
the greateſt danger.</hi> Truſt me (quoth the Prince) it may bée
thou ſaiſt true, yet ſhalt thou not ſuppriſe my minde with any
cowardly feare, and ſo leauing the firſt Shield, he took downe
the ſecond, when preſently came forth another knight, who
ſpake to the Prince in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Trulie ſir knight, you haue done vnwiſely to hazard your
ſelfe in this place, eſpecially to take downe the ſhielde, which
requireth no rther ranſome then your heart blood. Sir (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Palmerin)</hi> if you ſee that dutie, or knightly behauiour
hath failed in me, behold me here ready to deliuer a recompence
with my Sword, ſo leauing their words, and ſetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
ſtoutlie the one againſt the other, in the ende the Prince
reached him ſuch a ſure warrant on the Creaſt, that the ſword
pierced ſo deepe into his head, as he fell to the earth, diſcharged
of his life.</p>
                     <p>Then pauſing a little while, at laſt he went to the third Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wherein the middeſt of the Sheild vpon a field of Sineple,
in Azure Letters was written theſe words: <hi>By mee is to bee
gotten the honour of this aduenture.</hi> When he had taken it
downe, he expected the comming of the third Knight: who ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
ſoone after came forth in great haſte, and without vſing any
words, entred a more dangerous Combate then the other
twaine paſſed: but <hi>I alemerin</hi> hauing cut off one of his armes,
and wounded him very ſore in many places on his body, brought
him with long enduring the fight into ſuch weakneſſe, that hée
fell downe, and yéelded vp the ghoſt at his feet.</p>
                     <p>This good Fortune cauſed the Prince to aduance himſelfe
to the fourth Pillar: where viewing the Sheild, he beheld in
Letters of gold this good encouragement: <hi>In me remaineth the
happy victorie.</hi> Theſe words made him deſirous to end this
fortunate aduenture: when taking downe the ſhield, came out
the fourth Champion with theſe ſpéeches. I did not think your
fondneſſe had béene ſuch, that you could not content your ſelfe
with a ſufficient conqueſt: wherefore that your paiment may
witnes your iuſt deſert, prepare your ſelfe to receiue my hardy
blowes. <hi>Palmerin</hi> not accuſtomed to make anſwere, in place
where knightly ſtrength ought to ſhew it ſelfe, deliuered him
his mind in halfe a ſcore ſtrokes wellaid on, that (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
he was of more force then the other thrée) yet he ſerued him
of the ſelfe ſame ſauce, for ioy whereof, he kneeled downe and
hartily gaue thanks to God, that his prouidence had permitted
him to enter this hauty exploit. Then demanded he of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> knight
that had ſtood by al this while, and ſéene his noble behauiour, if
there were any other aduenture in the Caſtle, that he ſhould ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
himſelf againſt: to which requeſt he made this anſwere.
Credit me, worthy ſir, there are as yet things to be finiſhed,
which I perſwade my ſelfe may be accompliſhed by your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe,
becauſe I well perceiue, in ſpight of any thing to the
contrary, your valor muſt and will enter into this place. For in
you haue I ſéene that, which I neuer thought to find in any, as
your preſent behauiour conſtraineth me to confeſſe, that vertue
ſo gouerneth all your actions, as ſhée will ſée you Conquerour
in any attempt you vndertake.</p>

him reſiſtance. And how he paſſed ouer a blacke riuer in
great danger, where he met with the Enchantreſſe Eutro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa,
Aunt to the Giant Dramuſiande, who threw her ſelfe
headlong into the riuer, thinking to haue pulled the prince
after her, but ſhe failed of her pretence. Likewiſe, how the
Knight (whoſe life he ſaued) reported to him the death of
the three Knights of the Emperours Court, when they
aſſayed to enter into the Caſtle, and deliuered to him Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zilliart
and Germaine of Orleance, who were kept priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
there in a Dungeon, and certified him, that the Caſtle
was called, the perillous Iſle.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that <hi>Palmerin</hi> had vanquiſhed theſe
foure Knights, and he ſawe no more come
to offer him reſiſtance, accompanied with
this other knight, he entred the Caſtell.
Which being a thing of ſuch admirable
beautie, all about the Courts were pillars
of Iaſper ſtone, ten cubits in length, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
many goodly chambers, and faire lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings
were built, the Court paued with Marble, wrought into
colours of red and gréene, with euery thing ſo curious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly
framed about the Caſtle, that the Prince ſuppoſed it
the moſt excellent thing that euer he had ſéene. When hee had
wearied his eyes with beholding this ſumptuous Paralell, hée
walked thorow a faire Gallery, which brought him into a Hall
of ſingular beautie: at the entrance whereof a mighty giant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
himſelfe before the prince, holding in his hand a knagged
Mace of yron, which hee held vp in ſight to reſiſt his paſſage.
<hi>Palmerin</hi> perceiuing his bold inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, would not ſeeme to diſmay
himſelf: but reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring how fortunately he had begun without,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
determined to ende as valiantly within. And ſo ſetling him
to the Giant, found him play a while, but in the ende he payde
him home, ſo that he made him quiet enough for ſpeaking any
more. Hauing thus worthily conquered his enemy, he walked
a while vp and downe the Hall, till at laſt thorow a little gate,
he entred into a more ſumptuous Gallerie, wherein he could
finde no way out, but firſt hée muſt paſſe ouer abroade place
of water, where ouer was layde a little Boord or Planke, of ſo
ſmall breadth and ſtrength, that he ſuppoſed it not able to abide
the leaſt wayght in the world. Faine he would haue béene on
the further ſide, but this vnhappy place hindered his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which mooued him to ſo many grieuous conceites, that he
began greatly to blame his aduerſe Fortune. For if the Boord
did breake, he ſhould fall into a water ſo blacke and ougly, that
the Riuer <hi>Stix</hi> whereon <hi>Acheron</hi> carryeth the damned ſoules
to hell, might not be compared to this fearefull lake. Well, ouer
he would though it coſt him his life, wherefore diſarming him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
becauſe the heauineſſe of his armor might be the chiefe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to breake the planke: with a good courage he beganne to
venture vpon it, hauing nothing to defend him withall but his
Swoord, what euer might happen. When he had attained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
the middeſt, this olde rotten planke began ſomewhat to
cracke, ſo that <hi>Palmerin</hi> then verily ſuppoſed, there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
remedy, but he muſt fall into the helliſh gulfe, wherefore
calling his faire <hi>Polinarda</hi> to memory, he began in this manner
to deſire her fauour.</p>
                     <p>Madame, if hitherto I haue aduenture my life, both in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
exploytes, and dangerous attempts for your ſake, crauing
nothing at your handes but your ayde and fauour, I ought at
this inſtant, by greater reaſon to wiſh for the ſame, ſéeing that
now I try the greateſt hazard, onely to aduance your honour.
Whoſe friendſhip if I may be ſo happy as to finde, which is the
onely meane to encourage me in this diſtreſſe, I ſhall aſſay ſuch
renowne on your behalfe, as you ſhall be faithfully ſerued, and
my ſelfe for euer fully ſatiſfied.</p>
                     <p>Thus concluding his ſpéeches, to his no little ioy, he had gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the further ſide, when he perceiued an olde withered Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to come forth at a doore into his preſence, her face al wrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
her haire ougly blacke, and diſpearſed all abroad ouer her
her ſhoulders, ſo ſtaying awhile began in this manner.</p>
                     <p>What eſtimation ſhall I make of my ſelfe? or what ſhall I
iudge all my cunning to auaile, which can warrant me ſafetie
in no place, but ſuffers me to be vanquiſhed by one knight ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?
Then ſtretching forth her hand to take hold on <hi>Palmerin,</hi>
verily thinking to plucke him after her, ſhe caſt her ſelfe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
into that filthy puddle, ending her life as wickedly, as her
tretcherous and villanous déeds had deſerued.</p>
                     <p>The Prince ſéeing ſhe had failed of her intent, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with ſadneſſe at this wretched ſight, went through diuers
chambers to get downe, where he found many Mayden fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
of whom he enquired for the knigt, whoſe life he ſaued in
the Combate, and when he had found him, he deſired him to
ſhew the name of this Caſtle, as alſo what ſhe was that had ſo
deſperately drowned her ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Worthy Sir (anſwered the knight) the proofe of your noble
valour is ſuch, that I cannot conceale any thing from you,
which may do you pleaſure to know, wherfore marke what I
ſhall ſhew vnto you. This Caſtle is called by the name of the
<hi>Perillous Ile,</hi> whereof ſome hold opinion, that the <hi>Sage Vrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
was the firſt founder and Lady, and that in this place ſhe
hid her ſelfe becauſe after her heath this Caſtle remained En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted,
ſo that no perſon could attaine to inhabite here, in
this order ſhe left this faire Pallace, and the Fountaine which
you ſée a little from the Gate. And becauſe you may the eaſier
beleeue it, it was no longer agoe then ſithence our time, that it
was inhabited by any, who could giue aſſurance of the ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this Ile, but only the Dame who is drowned, who was
named <hi>Eutropa,</hi> Aunt to the Giant <hi>Dramuſiande.</hi> For after
he was vanquiſhed by the prowes of a famous knight of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
ſhe coeceiued ſuch inward ſorrow, that ſhe had almoſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraught
her ſelfe of her wits, and to reuenge his miſhap, ſhe
ſent with all ſpeede to the <hi>Soldan</hi> of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that he ſhould
prepare a mightie Army, wherewith he might ruinate the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the whole Empire of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But her diueliſh deſire could not take effect, becauſe the <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane</hi>
had enough to doe with his owne ſubiects, who had raiſed
themſelues in a mutany and open rebellion againſt him, for
which cauſe, ſhee ſeeing all her drifts could not accompliſh her
wiſh, came vnto this place, accompanied with the thrée knights
that you haue ſlaine and my ſelfe, ſo were we performed (more
by her damnable Art, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any volantary affection of our ſelues)
into this Iſle, where round about ſhe hath ſo diſperſed her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments,
that ſhe might allure all wandring knights vnder
her power, either to ſlay them preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, or to kéepe them in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
orizon. And to ſatiſfie her inſatiable and bloody deſire, we
here haue maintained her ſafety a long time, being alwayes ſo
fortunate, that many knights we ſlew, &amp; ſome we tooke captiue.
But it chanced not long ſince in an euening, that Fortune con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
hither fiue noble knights, who after we had ſlaine thrée
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the other twaine conquered me, and two of my fellowes,
but yet at laſt they were brought in ſubiection of the fourth
knight, and remaine as priſoners here in the Caſtle. I pray you
ſir (ſaid <hi>Palmerin)</hi> ſhew me the names of the thrée knights that
were ſlaine, as alſo the Priſon where the other two are, that I
may beſtow vpon them their former libertie: to which demand
he made this anſwere. The firſt Knight was called <hi>Medruſian</hi>

which he had ſent for that purpoſe, only thorow him to diſapoint
her vile pretence. Downe went the Knight with the Prince to
the priſon, carying a Torch lighted in his hand, becauſe it was
ſo déepe vnder the ground, as a man might ſhoote with a Croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow

to a grate, which they opened, &amp; ſaw whereas the two knights
were, attending the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of ſome to do them villainy as they
ſuppoſed, rather then to ſet them at liberty, which was the leaſt

great yrons vpon their legs, and yron chaines about their mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,
which cauſed him preſently to fall into teares, and not able

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the knight to take off their chaines and irons. But <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zilliart</hi>
did not like this very well, becauſe he feared they ſhould

them as thus. Sir knight, you might doe vs more pleaſure, to
let vs reſt in this captiuity, then to lead vs now to any place of
puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Sir <hi>Bazilliart</hi> (ſaid <hi>Palmerin)</hi> they that impriſoned
you in this place, would hardly conſent to deliuer you ſo ſoone.
Then minding to put them out of this feare, he would not hide
himſelfe any longer, but but off his Helmet: when <hi>Germaine</hi> of
<hi>Orleance</hi> catching him in his armes, renued his acquaintance
in this order. I ſée well, Sir <hi>Palmerin,</hi> that hereafter I muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon

browes, as <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> can amply teſtifie. After they had
ſaluted one another very courteouſly, they came preſently forth
of this noyſome priſon, and then they were all conducted into a
very faire chamber, where after they had refreſhed their hungry
ſtomacks, they diſcourſed with each other, what had hapned in
their ſundry aduentures.</p>

that they could not chuſe but commend it, as it did highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue.</p>
                     <p>Then walked they from thence to the Fountaine, yéelding

foorth in an afternoone, to ſit in the pleaſant ſhadow vnder the

ryding, who were preſently knowne by their Shields: for they
were <hi>Francian</hi> and <hi>Oniſtalde,</hi> endeuoring themſelues to ſéeke
the Prince <hi>Palmerin.</hi> At ſuch time as <hi>Siluian</hi> had declared vnto
them the loſſe of his Lord, ſuch was their good fortune, that they
came to the place where <hi>Palmerin</hi> entred the ſhippe, and there
they found paſſengers ready to croſſe the ſeas, ſo that by intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
they ſealed with them, hauing ſuch fayre winde and tyde,
that at length they diſcouered the <hi>Perillous Iſle.</hi> This place
made all the Paſſengers greatly abaſhed, becauſe they were
both ignorant of the ſoyle, and knew not the danger they might
receiue in that place: yet at the requeſt of the two knights, they
were ſomewhat pacified, &amp; ſet them on land in the ſame place,
where <hi>Palmerin</hi> entred firſt on ſhore. When they had attained
the top of the hye Rockes, they came to the Pillar that had the
fearefull ſentence vpon it, which vſing very litle regard (becauſe
the affection they bare vnto their deare friend, incited them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward)
they came as I haue told you, both into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fight &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

<hi>Eutropa</hi> drowned her ſelfe, all the way extolling the worthy
Proweſſe of him, that had the power to atchieue and ende ſuch
ſingular exploytes. When occaſion ſo fell that they would
néedes depart, <hi>Palmerin</hi> left the Caſtle, in the cuſtody of the
gentle knight <hi>Satransfort,</hi> intending to make a preſent of it to
the noble <hi>Sage Aliart.</hi> So friendly departing from thence, they
came to the Sea ſide, where they inbarqued themſelues among
diuers Paſſengers: the foure Knightes by themſelues, and
<hi>Palmerin</hi> alone as was his deſire. When they were enired the
ſeas, from the ſight of any land, <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> who conducted the

                     <p>At length, ſuch was his fortune, that he attained the Coaſt
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which pleaſed him very well, becauſe he would try
his valour in the preſence of the faire <hi>Miragarda,</hi> to the intent
that he might know, if her beauty were comparable to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
<hi>Polinarda.</hi> When he was come to the chiefe city of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
he heard maruellous commendations of <hi>Florendos</hi> the
<hi>Triſtfull Knight,</hi> who becauſe his father <hi>Primaleon</hi> had bruiſed
his armour very ſore, made himſelfe a notable faire new armor,
and hauing done many famous Actes in the Court of <hi>Recinde</hi>
King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> came home at laſt to the Caſtle of the Giant
<hi>Almarol. Miragarda</hi> ſo ſoone as he was there arriued, would
néedes know of his ſucceſſe before the Caſtle of the Giant <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſiande,</hi>
albeit ſhe had béene admoniſhed thereof before, yet
would ſhe neuer accept of that which the <hi>Triſtfull Knight</hi> had
done in <hi>England,</hi> but was of this mind, that whatſoeuer he had
done, ſhe made no account of it. But being deſirous to ſée, if his
déedes might bee agréeable to the reputation hee had deſerued,
commanded him to kéepe the paſſage there at her Caſtle, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that ſo many good Knightes would endeu our themſelues
thither, ſo that this aduenture ſhould be as much renowned, as
was the Caſtle of <hi>Dramuſiande.</hi>

Knights thither, that in her defence he had conquered more

an vnſpeakeable contentment, yet making no ſhew of

which gaue ſuch great delight to them who beheld it, that euery

                     <p>In his Shield on a plaine of Sinople, was curiouſly figured
the Image of <hi>Deadly Hope,</hi> which was ſo ſingular well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

ſéemels ſhadowing of her attire, that euery one iudged it a very
naturall proportion: her name was likewiſe preſented vnder
her, ſo that through this deuice, he was named of euery one the
<hi>Deſpairing Knight.</hi> In this manner he ridde toward the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
of <hi>Almarol,</hi> very deſirous to trie his force, in this aduenture
eſteemed of ſo great fame, not fearing the perill, if Fortune
ſhould vnkindly turne her ſelfe from him. But perſwaded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
that it was vnpoſſible to attaine the top of Honour, if a

Patience is the moſt noble conqueſt. Yet had I alway

that the loſſe of ſo valliant a Prince as <hi>Florendos</hi> was, might

hath the courage, to conquere this heart of mine, which as yet

I may endeuor my ſtrength to exalt your Princely beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which who ſo dare preſume to ſpeake againſt, ſhall receiue
the puniſhment due to ſo great an offence.</p>
                     <p>While he continued in this amorous thought, the Giant

thus to buſie your ſelfe in beholding this Portrait, which thing
I would rather perſwade you too by gentleneſſe, then to ſhew

                     <p>If I were perſwaded, that the Miſtreſſe of this picture, wold

for then my trauaile ſhould be little, my loſſe leſſe, and my heart

would gladly receuer it againe, I entend to enter the Combats
with thee, to the intent thou maiſt report, thy words could not
foile mee, nor yet thy workes had the puiſſance to daunt mee.
<hi>Almarol,</hi> who naturally was accuſtomed to cruelty, and not of
ſuch courteſie as was the gentle <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> receiued theſe
ſpeeches in very angrie manner, and being both ready proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

returned to <hi>Almarol</hi> with ſo great fury, that he inforced him to
ſtart this way and that way, as glad to auoide the blowes
wherewith he was charged. At laſt <hi>Almarol</hi> fell to the earth,

                     <p>Moſt noble knight, the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda</hi> by me doth
ſent intreaty, that you would ſatiſfie your ſelfe with the honor
of your victorie, and not to depriue the Giant of life, whoſe loſſe
might be more griefe to her, then all your indeuours can any

My friend, the faith and affection thou beareſt to thy Maiſter,
ſéemeth to me worthy of great commendation. And as his déeds
remaine a true confirmation and witneſſe of your woryes, yet
you muſt not vſe any euill ſuſpect to him, who is altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
of you, and would alſo enter combate wich your Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
were he preſent in this place. And if it were any chauce to
to be vanquiſhed by him, I would content my ſelfe to be placed
among theſe other conquered, whoſe aſſurance haue béene as
likely as mine, and peraduenture it might be more to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite,
if I left my Shield vnder her obeyſance, whoſe will I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſéeke to ſatiſfie, by ending my life in ſuch a hautie enterpriſe.

Maiſter, who is vnknown to me, albeit I confeſſe, not ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

ſure) by this notable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſts, but alſo by proofe of this knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
curteſie. For if I ſhould that way equal my ſelfe with him, It

finiſhed.</p>
                     <p>While he continued theſe ſpéeches, hée eſpied a farre off two
knights, come riding along the Riuer ſide: one of them had
his Armour coloured blacke and white, with diuers borders of
Gold finely wrought vpon it, bearing in his Shield for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
a murthered body in a campe of Sinople: the other had his
Armour of a gréene colour, very thicke beſet with Lyons of
Gold, &amp; in his ſhield two Lions rampant. Theſe twaine were
no ſooner arriued at the Caſtle, but <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> incontiuently
knew them: for the one was <hi>Don Roſuel,</hi> and the other was
the Prince <hi>Gracian,</hi> who ſometime had béene his Priſoners,
and whoſe amitie hée alwayes made great account of. But
albeit their friendſhip was very acceptable to him, yet the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb facs="tcp:13179:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he had made <hi>Miragarda,</hi> commanded him to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
confidering alſo that loue had gotten the maiſterie of him,
and directing his minde in this enterpriſe, made him neither to
ſpare friend nor foe, but vſed all alike that trauailed thither.
Then mounting on his ſtéed, he came forth before them, when
they perceiuing he prouided himſelfe to the Iuſte, were very
well pleaſed, becauſe they deſired to approue their ſtrength, in
the behalfe of the faire <hi>Miragarda.</hi> But caſting their eyes on
her beautifull Picture, which they beheld in the middeſt of the
Shieldes that <hi>Florendos</hi> had conquered, they were ſuppriſed
with ſuch a ſuddaine amazement, that they had quite forgotten
for what cauſe they came thither: which <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> ſeeing,
addreſſed himſelfe to them, with this manner of ſalutation.</p>
                     <p>Sir Knights, the Portraite of this Lady is not here placed,
to be contemplated with ſo great eaſe, but hée that deſireth to
enioy ſuch a Iewell, muſt firſt combate againſt me, who deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him that priuiledge, till I am vanquiſhed, and if that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

                     <p>Truſt me (anſwered the Prince <hi>Gracian)</hi> if a mans life may
ataine the honour of ſuch a ſingular perſonage, behold him who
hath the courage to aduenture firſt. So concluding his ſpéeches,
he met <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> valiantly with the breake of the Speare,
which was with ſuch force, that hee was throwne to the earth
with ſo ſtrong a violence, that for a great while he was voyde
of any feeling. This mooued <hi>Don Roſuel</hi> to ſuch diſpleaſure,
that to reuenge his friend, hée pricked foorth againſt <hi>Dramuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ande,</hi>
who being ready prouided with another Speare, ſent him
to beare the Prince <hi>Gracian</hi> company.</p>
                     <p>This rude encounter made them both maruaile, and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that their enemy was the renowned <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
whereof being deſirous to be reſolued, <hi>Gracian</hi> as the hardieſt
of them both, with his ſwoord drawne in his hand, entred into
theſe tearmes. Sir Knight, althogh Fortune hath béene your

becauſe I would trie your valour to the vttermoſt, if I may

                        <hi>Gracian</hi> hearing himſelfe named by the Knight, of whom he

                     <p>Worthy ſir, ſince my fortune hath béene ſo good, as to obtaine

Then mounting on Horſebacke, he ridde away ſo faſt as

                     <p>As he was about to take a little nap, his Miſtres <hi>Polinarda</hi>

manifold courteſies, which he receiued while he remained at

lamentations, as eſpecially the ſharp command of his miſtres:
which being loath to breake, mad him to abſent himſelfe from
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> longer then otherwiſe hee would gladly haue
done.</p>
                     <p>In theſe thoughts hee fell into a ſound ſleepe, when foure
Damoſels came walking foorth of the Caſtell, who beholding
the Prince his chéekes all dewed with teares, and his eye lids
very redde with ouermuch wéeping, were all conſtrained to

with their helpe, caried the Prince into a faire Chamber in the
caſtel, cauſing his armes to be faſtened together with a chaine,
to the ende he might vſe no reſiſtance againſt them. When
he awaked, and found himſelfe in this great alteration, he was
ſo ouercome with griefe, that he knew not what to ſay: but the
Ladie bearing great affection to him, (at euery inſtant chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

being deſirous to ſhunne any occaſion, whereby hée might bée

without Horſe or Armour, onely to auoide her importunate
ſute.</p>
                     <p>This moued the Lady to ſuch extreame griefe, that ſhe viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the bondes of Reaſon, whoſe limits duty had alwaies war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

hee remained in griefe beyond all perſwaſion, ſo that he
determined to goe ſtraight to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and if he failed of

he being now deceaſed, the Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte</hi> his faire
Daughter, is come to unhabite this ancient and famous Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
For ſhe being vnwilling to gouerne her people, by reaſon
ſhe is but yong of yeeres, as alſo vnmarried, committed the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of ſo waighty a charge, to ſuch honourable perſons in her
Court, as ſhee knew both vertueus, wiſe and diſcrete, to vſe

hath blazed abroad the aduentures finiſhed at the caſtle of

<hi>Miragarda,</hi> whoſe ſtately magnificence being ſo highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
is the cauſe as ſhe ſuppoſeth, that ſhée is not beloued of a

                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
On this beliefe, ſhe hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded me to goe ſée the Princeſſe
<hi>Miragarda,</hi> whereby ſhe may be certified, if her beauty that is
ſo highly extolled, may ſurmount that wherewith nature hath
ſo plentifully adorned her ſelfe. Which if it ſo fall out, that the
Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda</hi> carry the credit from her, then is ſhe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to deliuer the Knight, and he ſhall remaine no longer her
priſoner: but if my Lady prooue ſuperiour to the canonized ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle,
then know I ſhe will put the knight to death, conſidering
the iniury he hath offred her, who hath ſo much abaſed her ſelfe,
as to beare an vngrateful perſon ſuch affection, of whom ſhe can
gather no knowledge or acquaiatance. <hi>Don Florian</hi> well
pondering the Damoſelles wordes, and being ſomewhat plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
diſpoſed withall, demanded if the beauty of her miſtreſſe
might compare with the indifferent condition ſhee had of her
owne. Mruſt me Sir (quoth ſhe) if you finde any thing in me,
that deſerued to beare the title of beautie, when you ſhall
chance to haue a ſight of my Lady, you will ſay you haue made
a very ſimple compariſon. Fayre Damoſell (ſaide <hi>Florian)</hi>
would you followe my counſell, you ſhould here make ſtay
your haſty iourney: for credite me, <hi>Miragarda</hi> is much more
beautiful then you. Lady (quoth <hi>Pompides)</hi> let not theſe words
ſéeme to ſtay you from your Miſtreſſe commaund; but procéede
in your enterpriſe, and you ſhall ſée that, which neither of vs is
worthy to vſe any talke of: ſo ſhal you ſaue the life of the knight
whom ſhe loueth, and certifie your Lady with a certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
as for what it hath pleaſed this Knight to ſay, his
wordes are but ieſting, for he neuer ſawe the faire <hi>Miragarda.</hi>
It ſéemes then Sir Knight (anſwered the Damoſell) that you
haue béene affectioned to the faire view of this Princeſſe, that
you can ſo readily ſtand for a witneſſe, in the behalf of her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
I deſire you therefore, to returne with me to the Princeſſe
my Lady, ſo ſhall you ſaue me a iourney, in that you are able to
ſpeake vpon iudgement, where perhaps I might ſtray by vſing
affection. So alighting from their Horſes, they went altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into the Caſtle, when the Damoſell gaue her Lady to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,

<hi>Arnalte</hi> being very glad of theſe newes, cauſed a fayre
Chamber to be prouided for the two knights, where when they
had diſarmed themſelues, and taking a little eaſe, being wearie
with trauaile, ſhée came and courteouſly welcommed them to
her Caſtell, ſhewing all the commodities that might vrge them
to pleaſure, and walking forth to the Pondes ſide, ſitting them
downe vnder the Cipreſſe Trees, in a very pleaſant ſhadow, ſhe

                     <p>Gentlemen, albeit I am ignorant how you can accept my
wordes, or in what manner it ſhall pleaſe you to ſhape mee an
anſwere, yet will I not be ſo timerous, but that without any
ill ſuſpect I may craue ſuch leaue, as to cut off a doubt, which
hath of long time been concealed. At ſuch time as the King my
Father, who gouerned all this countrey, had finiſhed the courſe
of his terreſtriall time, I betooke my ſelfe to liue ſolitarie in
this habitation, till the Gouernors of my Kingdome had choſen
me ſuch a Phéere, as might in all reſpects ſatiſfie the will of my
late deceaſed Lord and Father. But Fortune, the enemy to al
mine actions, permitted an vnknown knight to happen to this
Caſtell: whom I made ſuch choiſe of, that he was the onelie
man I loued, becauſe I neuer liked any but him, ſo that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my affection, I concluded him as Lord, both of mee
and all my Princely poſſeſſions. But hee neither regarding
bountie nor beauty, applieth himſelfe ſo diſdainful to my gentle
deſire, that he rather taketh pleaſure in irons, wherewith I
haue charged him, then in the Princely offers whereto I haue
chaſen him. And although his great deſpiſing me is an inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
torment, yet haue I diſſembled my diſquietnes, ſuppoſing
that his affection to ſome other hath ouercharged his wittes, ſo
that he could not perceiue the honour wherewith I preſented
him. And yet this opinion I vſed fondly with my ſelfe, that no
ladies beauty was ſufficient to win him from me, the Princeſſe
<hi>Miragarda</hi> onely excepted, whoſe report filleth euery Climate,
with extolling her benefit. Yet becauſe I had ſome doubt of her,
I commanded one of my Damoſels to take her iourney thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to ſee if my beautie might not ſtand equall with hers, if ſo
<pb facs="tcp:13179:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be, ſhe were onely perfect without compariſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then had I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to ſet the knight at libertie: but if I were found to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
as high a title as ſhee, then would I reward him with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
according as his diſdainfull nature did worthily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue.
<hi>Horian</hi> well noting the proud minde of <hi>Arnalte,</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to cauſe her abide in her vaine opinion, as thus.</p>
                     <p>Truly Madam, I would with you not to vſe any other tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

<hi>Pelmerin</hi> out of memory, as though ſhe had neuer ſeene
him in all her life. Wherefore, being in euery part repleniſhed
with an vnſpeakeable ioy, ſhe tooke each of the knights by the
hand, and returned with them into the Caſtell, where againſt
their comming, the Table was ready couered, but before they
ſat downe, <hi>Florian</hi> deſired to ſée the knight, at whoſe requeſt,

commending her good fortune, in that ſhe hoped of the Prince

hauing put on his Helmet, mounted on his Stéede, and tooke a

                     <p>I deſire you Sir Knight, for the honour you haue receiued in
your knightly déedes of Armes, at this inſtant to conceiue ſuch
courage as to followe me, &amp; you ſhall receiue the greateſt praiſe
in giuing me ayde, as in all your life time you neuer gained the
like. <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who bare Armes only to ſuccor the weake eſtate
of the diſtreſſed, deſired <hi>Pompides</hi> to kéepe his Brother <hi>Florian</hi>

was gone before him, but he had ſo far outreacht him, that <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides</hi>
could not ouertake him a good while after. <hi>Florian</hi> hauing
diſmounted eight of the Kuights, could deale with no more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his laace was broken, but one of the ladies came and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
him with another, deſiring him to breake that one lance
for her ſake. <hi>Florian</hi> thanked the Lady very courteouſly, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to employ that lance, as a Preſent come from the hands of
her, to whom he would aduenture his life in ſeruice: which to
witneſſe, he prepared himſelf againſt the ninth knight, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a good opinion of himſelfe, began in this order to ſpeake to
the Prince. I haue a great deſire, ſir Knight, to try your valour
which is of ſuch eſtimation, being in hope that I ſhall manifeſt
that to you, which you haue not yet ſeene. Thus concluding his
ſpéeches, and caſting his eye vpon <hi>Carmelia,</hi> the handmayde to
the princeſſe <hi>Florenda,</hi> whom he had choſen as chiefe miſtreſſe
of his heart: he couched his ſpeare againſt the Prince <hi>Florian,</hi>
thinking to honour his Saint with his ouerthrow. But recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
without his Hoſt, he was faine to make a new account,
and poſſeſſe the place on the ground himſelfe, being now as ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull
for his ill Fortune, as he was pleaſantly diſpoſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he entred the Iuſt. Hauing thus vnhorſed them all the laſt
Knight came and tooke his turne, being the valiant <hi>Germayne</hi>
of <hi>Orleance,</hi> who had vndertaken the charge to conduct the
Princeſſe, being her affectionate and loyal friend: he bare in his

the Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> to reuenge the diſhonour his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

that at the third attempt he was enforced to keepe his friendes
company, not a little diſpleaſed to be foyled in the preſence of
her, to whom he had vewed the honour of all his victories. The

<hi>Florenda,</hi> he vttered his ſpéeches on this wiſe. Faire Miſtres,
I account it no diſhonour to be vanquiſhed by this Knight, for
that in all his attempts he euer remaineth victor. When the
Princeſſe vnderſtood, that he was <hi>Florian</hi> of the <hi>Deſart,</hi> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
allied to her by kindred, ſhe came running to him, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
him with a maruellous proteſtation of exceeding loue.
And then commanding the Tents to be taken downe, becauſe
it was the time of her departure, ſhee deſired <hi>Florian</hi> to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
her to the <hi>French</hi> Court, where ſhe might do him more
honour, then ſhe was able in that ſolitarie place. But <hi>Florian</hi>
deſired pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for at that time he could not ſatiſfie her deſire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he would follow the Lady, who allured his Brother and
<hi>Pompides,</hi> to ſtray from him in that manner. The Princeſſe
vnderſtanding, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the knight, who went with the lady, was the
famous <hi>Palmerin,</hi> took <hi>Florian</hi> by the hand, with theſe words.
Now truſt me ſir <hi>Florian,</hi> it grieueth me that I was not ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
as to know him in the time he remained here, being the
knight that I alwaies deſired to ſée: wherefore I deſire you to
make haſte after him, and at your returne to paſſe thorow the
kingdome of my father, that I may do him the ſeruice my hart
deſireth. Then the lady, whoſe words procured <hi>Pompides</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
after <hi>Palmerin,</hi> came to the prince <hi>Florian,</hi> with theſe ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Sir, I would faine haue knowledge of the knight, who
hath betaken himſelfe to trauaile after my Lord your Brother,
deſiring you to certifie him, the ſorow I conceiue for the words
I gaue him. Faire lady (anſwered <hi>Florian)</hi> he is ſuch a knight,
as I am ſure will bée ready at all times, to employ himſelfe in

in the world, who haue trauelled through the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>France,</hi> thinking to find a valiant and renowned

how happy were I, if the effect of your deedes would agrée with
your wordes, for in this Village there remaineth three Ladies
Priſoners, the Daughters of one of the moſt noble Lordes in
this Countrey, who becauſe their Father would not giue them
in Mariage, to the Duke of <hi>Ronſilion</hi> and his two Brethren,
they found the meanes to murther him, and theſe three Ladies
they kept here in a Caſtle, to whom they haue graunted the
commodity, to finde a knight that can preuaile in the Combat,
and then they ſhall be reſtored to their former libertie. So that
this is the prefixed and appointed day, when the Combat muſt
firſt be tried, againſt <hi>Bramerin</hi> the chiefe gentleman belonging
to the Duke, and one of the moſt renowned knights in all this
Countrey. If it chance that he be vanquiſhed, then muſt you
hazard your ſelf, againſt <hi>Cliaſter</hi> and <hi>Alfarin</hi> his two kinſmen,
yet all theſe being conquere, will not returne this victorie, for
then muſt you deale with the Duke and his two brethren, who
are knowen to be ſuch ſtoute and noble Knightes, that no one
will conceiue the courage to deale with them. Yet muſt the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
this day finde a knight to auenge their quarrell, or elſe the
Duke hath ſworne they ſhall looſe their heades, and to put the
Ladies in ſome hope, I went and told them I had brought a
knight, who would vndertake to deale in their cauſe, which the
Duke no ſooner hearing, but hee began to be greatly offended.
Surely ſaide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> I muſt néedes venture my ſelfe again
thoſe, that will take vpon them to vſe cruelty to any faire Lady,
and will alwaies diſallow, that a King or Prince ſhould ſuffer
any iniury, to be vſed to a Lady within his Dominions, and in

ſéeing his life to ſtand in ſuch a ieopardy, deferred not to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill

entred the Caſtle, and in the Court eſpied <hi>Chaſter</hi> and <hi>Alfarin,</hi>
each of them in a very faire gréene Armour, thicke beſet with
Azure flowers, who when they beheld <hi>Palmeria,</hi> they ran both

one of them ſo ſoundlie on the head, that he made him ſure
enough for doing any more harme. Which his fellow percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,

when demaunding if he would yeeld, he made anſwer
no: becauſe he thought ſome would come to his reſkew, but
<hi>Palmerin</hi> ſéeing him ſo obſtinate, failed not to ſend his head from
his ſhoulders. Al this while, he was ſo happy to eſcape without
any hurt, whereupon he came to the gentlewoman, and aſked if
there were any thing els, wherin ſhe would haue him to imploy
his ſeruice. Certainly ſir (quoth ſhe) I ſee no danger can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw

as hitherto you haue had againſt theſe iii. knights, in hope wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I will not leaue your company, but be partner of al the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats

the ſtaires, which he ought to aſcend, where he might find the
Duke, and his brethren, when <hi>Palmerin</hi> commanding <hi>Siluian</hi>
to ſtay his comming without, tooke his ſword and went vp,
till at laſt he came into a very faire Hall, where he beheld three
Ladies ſitting attyred all in blacke, and endued with ſuch ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>
He had not long ſtood beholding them, but he perceiued thrée
Knightes very well armed to come before him: and to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
one of them began in this manner. Faire Ladies, why
ſhould you procure ſo great miſfortune to your ſelues, and alſo
labour to worke our ruine and deſtruction? you are the cauſe
our three knights haue béen ſo cruelly abuſed, whoſe deathes
I entend to reuenge ſo ſharpely, and your liues ſhall ſatiſfie
part of our loſſe, wherat your Champion ſhall be but little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and we not with all this fully ſatisfied. The Duke who
ſpake theſe words, came from the Ladies accompanied with
his Brethren, bearing all one manner of deuiſe in their ſhields,
which was <hi>Cupid</hi> chaſed away, leauing his Bow and Arrowes
all bloody, and broken in peeces, the Duke aduanced himſelfe
to <hi>Palmerin,</hi> on this wiſe. Sir knight, ſuffiſe your ſelfe with the
ſlaughter of my knights, and yeelde your ſelfe friendly into my
hands, for ſurely it would bee to my great griefe, to bée the
death of ſo good a Knight, whereto <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſhaped his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
Sir, thing not to abuſe me, albeit I am in place, where
you ſuppoſe you may command me, for I am come to no ſuch
ende, but rather to conſtraine you to vſe recompence to theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
whom you haue ſo highly offended, then for any fauour I
ſeeke at your hands. With that the Duke and his Brethren
ſtrooke freely at <hi>Palmerin,</hi> and he on the other ſide charged them
couragiouſly, the Ladies weeping, deſtred God in the force of
the Prince, to ſhew ſome fauour and louing regard vnto them,
for they well perceiued how dangerous the fight was, eſpecially
on his ſide to contend againſt three. Yet in the end, ſuch was
his valor and high good fortune, that by one and by one he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
them all, but the Duke ſeeing his Brethren vanquiſhed,
and himſelfe left alone to abide all the hazard, tooke occaſion to
pauſe with theſe words.</p>
                     <p>I pray you Sir Knight if your thinke it good, to tell me your
name, and of whence you are, that I may know him I ſhall
vanquiſh, or at leaſt that ſhall remaine victor ouer mee. Sir,
ſaid <hi>Palmerin,</hi> the knowledge of me is ſo needeleſſe, that I
will no ſtand to ſatiſfie your deſire, firſt, let vs make an end of
our Combat, and then perhaps I will let you vnderſtand more.
<pb facs="tcp:13179:158" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Belike (quoth the Duke) you make ſuch account of the victory,
that you will admit no leiſure to Parley: well, ſince you are ſo
bent, I do not yet conceiue ſuch weakneſſe of my ſelfe, that I
will make ſute to you for any fauour. Then they began againe,
the great effuſion of their blood, witneſſing the perillous danger
of their fight, but at laſt the Duke was conſtrained to fal downe
at the foote of the Prince, as il pleaſed as he was ſhrewdly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
eſpecially becauſe he thought neuer to ſee his Lady and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe

Prince to ſaue his life, who being alwaies accuſtomed to great
pittie, and ſeeing him ſo affectionate towardes his Lady, tooke
him from the ground in his armes, promiſing to vſe the matter
in ſuch ſort, that he would make him to be highly eſteemed of
her. The Duke receiued the Prince offer, but vpon this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
that if ſhe ſcorned to be mercifull vnto him, then ſhould he
preſently bereaue him of life, becauſe it was vnpoſſible for him

the power to accompliſh ſo rare exploits: but when hee beheld
the Picture of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> he could not chuſe but confeſſe the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
ſhe had aboue his Lady <hi>Targiana.</hi> Neuertheleſſe, hée
would put her will in due execution, albeit that night he could
not, time was ſo farre ſpent: but in the morning he preſented
himſelf before the Caſtle, when <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> aduertiſed of his
arriuall, armed himſelfe, and came foorth on Horſeback, ſo after
a litle friendly greeting paſſed betwéen them, they couched their
Speares, and at the third encounter, ſent one an other to the
ground couragiouſly. Then drew they forth their ſwords, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
ſuch cruell aſſaults to one another, that <hi>Miragarda</hi> and
her Ladies did highly commend them: but yet ſhée ſtood in feare,
leſt <hi>Albayzar</hi> ſhould vanquiſh <hi>Dramuſiande. Albayzar,</hi> who
all his life time had not felt ſuch hardy blowes, thought not his
promiſe ſo certain, as when he departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Princeſſe <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> found his enemy ſo ſtrong, that he could
hardly aſſure himſelfe of any victory: for ſo cruelly did they deale
with one another, and wounded one another in ſuch grieuous
maner, that one would not haue thought, how poſſible the life
could remaine in them: whereupon <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> began thus
to the faire <hi>Miragarda.</hi> My good Lady, doe not now refuſe your
ſeruant in ſo great a néede, that he which hath neuer done you
ſeruice, ſhall cauſe your <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> to loſe the recompence,
which he thinketh by his trauels to haue worthily deſerued.
On the other ſide. <hi>Alybazar</hi> was in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<hi>Targiana,</hi> deſirign her but to remember him in fauor, and
that was ſufficient to ouercom his enemy: ſo commending him
ſelfe to his God <hi>Mahound,</hi> he began again afreſh with <hi>Dramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiande.</hi>
Long they fought, yet neither could preuaile, for they
thought themſelues indifferently matched, ſo that the night ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
on, made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to leaue off their Combat, and to finiſh
it on the next day if they could. <hi>Dramuſiand</hi> entred his lodging,

meaning on the morrow to ende their ſtrife one way or other,
and <hi>Albayzar</hi> retired being of the ſame minde: but knowing
no where to reſt him for that night, that hee might the better
deale with <hi>Dramuſinde</hi> on the morrow, he returned to the trée
of the Shields, where remembring the promiſe he had made to
his Lady, euery one being faſt aſleepe, he tooke downe the ſhield
of the Prineſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> which hée purpoſed to beare with

couered that no body ſhould know it. And there where he lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
he ſtayed vntill his wounds were healed: very ſorrowfull

When he had ſought all about the Trée, and could not finde

ſecretly as might be, he concluded to perſue preſently after him,
not ſtaying till the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda</hi> was certified thereof,

the Giant <hi>Almarol,</hi> yet hardly did he knowe that this was he:
wherefore encouraging himſelfe, he approched vnto them with
theſe ſpéeches. I pray you my friend, to report to me if you can,
ſome tidings of a young knight, whom Loue hath cauſed to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake

to make you any anſwere, for I am he whom Loue hath
allowed to all miſfortune, but neuer to no day, houre minute
of quietneſſe. With that the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi> began in this
order. Oh ſir, doe not you ſéeme to blame Loue ſo much, if you
haue ſuſtained any loſſe, impute it to the féebleneſſe of Fortune
and not to Loue, let me alone to complaine of Loue. <hi>Armello</hi>
caſt good view vpon him, and knew that it was the Lord, albeit

down at his féete, he deſired him, not to execute on himſelfe ſuch
extreame griefe, as he would not fauour himſelfe with ſome pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

                     <p>Sir, I haue taken the paines to come hither, that you might
vnderſtand a matter greatly for your profite. <hi>Dramuſiande</hi>
hath long time kept the ſhield of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> and many knights
hath he brought vnder her obeyſance, but ſuch is the miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that her Shielde is ſtollen from thence by a Knight, of
whom ſhe hath no hope to recouer it, but only by your meanes.
<hi>Florendos,</hi> to whoſe heart was already ſtroken a ſuddaine ioy,
began in this manner. What will you <hi>Armello</hi> wiſh me to goe
ſuccour other, ſeeing me ſcant able to helpe my ſelfe, how may
I in this weaknes preſume againſt any one, when being in my
chiefeſt ſtrength, I could not conquer one onely knight? Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles,
becauſe I wil not ſtill remaine in ſorrow, which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

the Knight that hath borne away the Shield of my Lady, and
will (if I can) make him to yéelde it me againe, but if Fortune
<pb facs="tcp:13179:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſend him the victory againſt me, then I ſhall be out of all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and ſorrowes in this world. Thus riſing vp, he deſired his

kind of life, to follow the noble exerciſes wherin he had béene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
trained, for albeit he was as then ſimple, yet had he béene

with his ſorrowful life, yet had he not that power to refuſe
the requeſt of the gentle P. <hi>Florendos,</hi> for whoſe amitie they
left their ſhéepe, and went into a Towne hard by, where they
remained till they were ſtrong enough to endure trauaile. And
in their time of ſtay there, they made each of them a fine new
blacke Armor, both alike, without any deuiſe at all, becauſe the
Prince would not be knowne, which made him not to ſend for
his Armor at the Caſtle of <hi>Almerol.</hi> Then departed they from
thence, and trauailed to ſéeke the ſhield of the faire <hi>Miragarda,</hi>

no leſſe affectionate to <hi>Miragarda,</hi> then the knight that on
her behalfe had won ſo many ſhields, wherevpon hee began in

Armes, ſéeing thou haſt not the power to appeaſe thy tedious

wherby thou mightſt ſhun any more to follow this

when both Fortune flies from thée, and thou not able any way

But ſéeing too late, I come to the knowledge of mine errour, and

my miſhappes haue a ful concluſion, and diſpaire ſtrike me dead

                     <p>Thus breaking off his lamentations, he walked along by the
Riuer <hi>Theſin,</hi> forſaking Horſe, Armour, &amp; al knightly behauior,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
entring a little ſhade of Trées, where he determined to liue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie.
And the greateſt contentation he had, was when he ſat
kéeping Shéepe, to play mournfull deuiſes vpon his Flute, and
to write and graue in the barke of Trées, certaine amorous ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
and Paſſions of a Louer, which as the Trees grew, ſo
his ſeuerall Sonnets flouriſhed vpon them.</p>
                     <p>And albeit he was reſolute to liue from al company, yet when
<hi>Florendos</hi> came vnto him, he found him ſo néere agréeing to his
complexion, and his manners and motion coyned in the like
ſtampe, that he was glad to receiue him for a partner in his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uineſſe.
So that they liued together with Hearbes and roots,
pangs, griefe, ſobbes, ſighes and ſalt teares, the daily foode and
ſuſtenance of a Louer, this was both their ſollace and ſorrow,
till <hi>Armello</hi> cauſed them to depart from thence, as you haue
heard diſcourſed already.</p>
                     <p>It ſo fortuned, as theſe two careful Princes rode along by the
Sea ſide, they eſpied a little Galley comming towards them,
wherein ſat a Lady endued with ſuch ſingular beauty, attyred
in blacke, and accompanied with ſuch a modeſt behauiour, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one might iudge her to bee ſome perſon of Nobilitie. At
this Ladies feete ſat two aged women, who eſpying theſe two
Princes, commanded the Marriners to row to the Shoare,
when beholding the Princes very rufully, the Lady ſaluted
them in this ſort. Sir Knights, I deſire the one of you to doe
me ſo great fauour, as to come abord my Galley, to aide me in
a cauſe, which deſireth the helpe of one onely Knight. Faire La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
(anſwered <hi>Florendos)</hi> we beare Armes for no other purpoſe,
but to imploy our ſelues in the aide of diſtreſſed perſons, ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
the Galley, he commanded <hi>Armello</hi> his Eſquire, to take
his Horſe, and expect his comming at the Caſtell of the Giant
<hi>Almerol,</hi> where he would not faile to méete him.</p>
                     <p>Thus leauing the Prince <hi>Floraman,</hi> the Galley launched
forth, that it was quickly out of ſight: wherefore he rid on, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
the company of <hi>Florendos,</hi> to whom he became maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
affectionate. After he had trauailed thrée daies, he came to
a very ſtrong Bridge, at the foure corners whereof, was foure
very faire ſtrong Towers erected, being deſirous to approch
<pb facs="tcp:13179:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there vnto, he eſpied a Knight willing to paſſe, but an other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him, ſaying: if he would leaue his Shielde behind him,
and giue vp his name to be ſigned in writing, as was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
of the Fortreſſe, he ſhould be permitted to paſſe quietly.
Such an ill cuſtome (anſwered the Knight) was not ordained
to hinder ſuch as my ſelfe, but rather for ſuch, as could not make
their part good againſt their enemie: this ſayde, he gaue his
ſhield that he bare to his Eſquire, and receiued another of him,
and ſo encountred with the knight of the bridge, but he not able
to withſtand the force of the Speare, was diſmounted from his
Horſe, and throwen into the water. <hi>Horaman</hi> ſomewhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed
at this hardy encounter, approached néere the Bride,
where he behold in the Eſquires hand, the Portrait of the faire
Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> which made him deſirous to ſtay, to ſée
how this enterpriſe would take concluſion. The Knight of
the bridge was no ſooner giuen the turne ouer, but there in one
of the Towers one ſounded a Horne very vehemently, at ſound
wherof a knight came forth, bearing in his hand a mighty Axe:
wherwith approching to the knight, he charged them with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſharpe and dangerous ſtrokes, but in the ende, ſuch was the
valour of the other Knight, that hee laide him flate vpon the
ground, giuing his place to another, becauſe he had no leiſure to
ariſe. Then came foorth a tall and ougly Giant, bringing in his
hand a Mace of iron, &amp; to the knight he deliuered theſe taunts.
Thou deſtroyer of my blood, doe thy duty to defend thy ſelfe, for
to reuenge the horrible iniury thou haſt offered me, I intend to
cutte thy body in ſo many pieces, that the Fowles of the ayre
ſhall be glutted with thy carkaſſe. The knight refuſing to giue
him any anſwere, couered himſelfe with his Shield, ſo that
betwéene the Giant and him, began a terrible and dangerous
Combate, but in the ende, the Knight who was named the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
<hi>Albayzar,</hi> ſo coniured the giant, that he left him not while
there was any life in him. <hi>Albayzar</hi> being very ſore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and ſeeing no more reſiſtance come, entred the Foretreſſe,
where he ſtayed till he was able to deale with <hi>Floraman,</hi> who
deſired to haue a ſling at him, for to get the Shield of the faire
<hi>Miragarda.</hi> For being in that low eſtate, he did eſtéeme it great
<pb facs="tcp:13179:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſhonour to aſſaile him: becauſe couragious mindes, rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to encounter thoſe who haue might to reſiſt them, then to
deale with ſuch as haue no power to defend themſelues. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he paſt the Bridge, not knowing whither he were beſt to
take his way: for his deſire was, not to abſent himſelfe farre
thence, becauſe he would not looſe the commoditie to ſight with
<hi>Albayzar:</hi> in the meane time he waſted away the idle houres,
in this woonted ſilent and amourous Paſſions.</p>

in the middeſt of the Sea, which was very artificiall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon a Rocke: where taking occaſion to ſtrike on ſhore, ſhe
began to <hi>Florendos</hi> in this manner. Sir Knight, now will I
declare for what cauſe I haue brought you to this place, letting
paſſe my boldneſſe vnder your knightly courteſie. Within this
Caſtell abideth a Damoſell, of as little vertue as beauty, who
vnderſtanding that I had eſpouſed one of the faireſt Lords in
this Countrey, deuiſed the meane to acquaint her ſelfe with
him, by reporting that a Knight had depriued her of one of her
Caſtels, ſo that by her intreaty, ſhe won him to ſtay her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
in her diſtreſſed cauſe. At the time as ſhe had gotten him
to her Caſtle, ſhe fell into ſuch vnlawfull liking of him, that ſhe
vowed neuer to ſuffer him to depart from thence, vnleſſe ſuch a
Knight came, as could preuaile againſt fiue Knightes of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous
ſtrength, but againſt more then one Knight, ſhee will
not ſuffer Champion to enter combat, ſo that I ſtand in doubt,
neuer to recouer my louing Lord and Huſband againe, Faire
Lady (ſaith <hi>Florendos)</hi> ſend you to ſummon theſe fiue Knights
to the ſight, meane while I will prouide my ſelfe to ſtand in
your defence.</p>
                     <p>Shortly after, he aduanced himſelfe toward the Caſtel gate,
he eſpied the fiue Knights to com forth at a falſe doore, who
were all ſtrongly armed, and to the Prince one of them began
in this order. Sir knight, wee eſteeme it beſt for you to yeeld
your ſelfe, ſeeing Fortune hath been ſo much your enemie to
conduct you hither: ſo ſhall you find vs friendly to you, where
otherwiſe you may incurre your ſelfe double deſpite.</p>
                     <p>Truſt me (ſaid <hi>Florendos)</hi> firſt I intend to trie your cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
before I will vſe any regard of your gentlenes: afterward
I will make you anſwere of my further intent. Vpon this they
came and aſſailed the Prince, and he likewiſe behaued himſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:13179:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with great agility againſt them: ſo that they confeſſed, they had
neuer found ſuch valour to remaine in one Knight, and he, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to haue aſſayed a more perillous aduenture. Often they
ſtaied and fell to it againe, the Prince hauing ſlaine two of
them, and the Lady vſing reprochfull wordes vnto them, that
they fiue had not the power to preuaile againſt one, which ſet
the other in ſuch a chafe, that they began to charge him with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull
blowes, ſeeing they had no way to eſcape from him,
becauſe on the one ſide the ſea hindered them, and into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell
they could not retyre, for the lady within had commanded
the gate to be made faſt. Wherefore two of them fell downe
dead before him, when the laſt Knight ſéeing the danger he ſtood
in, tooke the point of his Sword in his hand, and humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
before the Prince, as thus.</p>
                     <p>Moſt worthy Knight, ſince fortune hath allowed you the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of this victorie, and that you haue preuailed againſt all my
companions, let pitty enter into your heart, to ſaue the life of
him, who moſt humbly ſubmitteth himſelfe to your mercy.
I grant thée thy life (ſaid <hi>Florendos)</hi> becauſe I will not bée
thought of ſuch a bloody mind, to kill him that is not able to reſiſt
me.</p>
                     <p>Then ſat he downe to reſt himſelfe, the Lady vſing great
care to bind vp his wounds: when the Lady within the Caſtle,
ſtanding in feare leſt her ſtubbornnes might procure the greater
iniury, ſent one of the damſels, who opened the gate, which <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendos</hi>
ſéeing, tooke the Lady by the hand, and entred the caſtel,
where they met the Lord that had béen priſoner ſo long, who
imbraced his Lady with very great thankes, for bringing the
Knight that had won him his liberty, to whom he began in this
order.</p>
                     <p>Worthy ſir, your Knightly déedes haue gained ſuch honour,
that I cannot make eſtimation of them according as they haue
worthily deſerued, but if it ſhall pleaſe you to reſt here a while,
we will yéeld you what courteſie we can, and then we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

there to ſée the Lady that kept the caſtle: but he could not attaine
to his deſire, becauſe ſhe had made her ſelfe faſt in her Chamber,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:167" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo that no one might come to haue a ſight of her.</p>
                     <p>Then went he to ſée the place, where the Lady vſed to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

when I enterpriſed my iourney to the Court of the <hi>French</hi>
Quéene, two knights came and reſiſted me, endeuouring them
ſelues to abuſe mine honour. But Fortune was ſo fauourable
to me, that at my cry, a Knight came who defended my cauſe:
and behaued himſelfe ſo worthily againſt them, that in open
fight he ſlew them both. Then paſſing by a Caſtle at the end of
this ſtone wal, he was aſſailed by twelue Knights: who, I feare
me, will be the death of him, if he be not ſpéedily holpen by ſome
good reſcue, and truſt me Gentlemen, the loſſe of him would be
very great, being one of the moſt hardy knights in al the world.
I pray you Lady (ſaid <hi>Florian)</hi> bring vs to the Caſtle where the
knight remaineth in ſuch danger as you ſeeme to report: for it
were great pittie, to ſuffer ſuch a knight to die for lacke of helpe,
Although (quoth ſhe) I was otherwiſe determined, yet will I
bring you to the place, as well to try your worthineſſe, as alſo
ſhew my good will to the Knight, who in his owne danger hath

the clattering of the weapons, where they found the knight to

very manfully againſt the other, whereat the Prince fell into
great admiration, which the Lady ſéeing, how they ſate ſtill and
looked on, began to enter into theſe wordes. Why Gentlemen?
if you determined to doe nothing when you came, it had béene
more honour for you to haue kept on your iourney, rather then
to ſuffer ſo good a knight to be ſlaine in your preſence, and you
ſtand by refuſing to aid him, which maketh me iudge, that your
weapons are very ill beſtowed on you. Faire Lady (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Palmerin)</hi> the Knight doeth ſo well diſcharge his dutie, that
we ſhould offer him great wrong if we preſumed to aid him: for
ſo might we cut off the praiſe, which he ſhould worthily beare
in the obtaining the victory, which is the only cauſe of our ſtay.
Mary, if we ſhould perceiue the Knights, to haue any dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
aduantage ouer him, then would we ſhewe him ſuch ayde
in their reſiſtance, that you ſhould recall your words, and haue
a better opinion of vs. While they continued this Parle, the
Knight (who was the famous <hi>Albayzar)</hi> of the twelue knights
had left but foure aliue, which vrged <hi>Florian</hi> to this opinion in

one of your ſpeares vpon me, to receiue the knight that prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
himſelfe againſt me, aſſuring you, that I will not forget to
reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber your courteſie in ſo doing. Sir, ſaid <hi>Palmerin,</hi> becauſe

                        <hi>Albayzar</hi> taking the Speare of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> ſaid: If Fortune bée
ſo much mine enemy, that ſhe ſuffer me to be brought into this
knights ſubiection, you ſhall haue the better leiſure and loue, to
manifeſt the proweſſe which remaineth in you. Then his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſeeing his maſter to want a ſhield, came and preſented him
the Portrait of the faire <hi>Miragarda,</hi> but <hi>Albayzar</hi> refuſing it,
ſaid. That it was rather made to looke on, then to employ it
to any vſe in fight. So preparing himſelfe to run at <hi>Dramorant,</hi>
who ſéeing him deſtitute of a ſheeld, caſt his owne to the ground
with theſe words. <hi>Albayzar,</hi> I am very ſory to ſée thée in this
poore eſtate, becauſe the victory I might obtaine in vanquiſhing
thée, cannot returne any great honour to me: and becauſe thou
ſhalt not thinke me, to haue any aduantage of thée, I giue thee
this priuiledge which neuer yet had any. Here ending his talke,
they fetched their courſe, and met each other with ſuch puſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance,
that they were both forced to fall to the ground, very ſore
hurt: then riſing and taking their Swordes, they beganne ſo
fierce a Combat, that <hi>Palmerin</hi> did highly commend the valour
of <hi>Albayzar,</hi> whom he would gladly haue knowledge of, which
made him to begin in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Truly I make ſuch account of him, that detaineth in his
puiſſance the Shield of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> as I verily beléeue, <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſiande</hi>
who had it in kéeping, hath bin vanquiſhing &amp; brought
into his ſubiection, which doth vrge me to great maruell, ſeeing
I could obtaine very little more at his hands, ſo that were
this Knight ſo well diſpoſed as I, I would hazard my ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, to bring the ſhield to the place from whence he hath
brought it. Credite me, ſaid <hi>Florian,</hi> I can hardly beleeue
that <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> is as yet vanquiſhed, albeit the déeds of this
Knight may mooue vs to thinke it: wherefore let him firſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
his combat, and then we may be reſolued out of this doubt.
<hi>Albayzar</hi> &amp; <hi>Dramorant</hi> ſtroue ſo long together, that <hi>Palmerin</hi>
would haue parted them, but his labour was in vaine: for <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayzar</hi>
would by no meanes giue ouer, till hée had diſcharged
<hi>Dramorant</hi> of his vitall breath. When himſelfe being at the
point ready to faint with his long trauaile, as alſo the loſſe of
his blood: <hi>Palmerin, Horian,</hi> and the Lady came and ſuſtained
<pb facs="tcp:13179:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him, leading him into the Caſtle, where they were better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
then they looked for, and had good leiſure to attend the
wounds of <hi>Albayzar,</hi> which were very many, as alſo verie
dangerous.</p>

to kill the innocent, rauiſh and ſpoile fayre Ladies, with his
continuall inclination to all deſperate and cruell attempts, ſo
that he was feared of the Countrey round about him, vntil ſuch

Sir knight, you ſée wel in what eſtate I am at this preſent, but

whither I intend to goe ſo ſoone as I may poſſible: I will cauſe
you to know, how farre the beautie of my <hi>Targiana</hi> doeth ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount

arriued in the kingdom of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> being glad they had attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

former doubts, as concerning the commaund of his Lady and
Miſtreſſe: <hi>but Siluian</hi> the onely Phiſition of theſe extreame
Paſſions, gouerned his maiſters cogitations excéeding well.
Neuertheleſſe, his two Brethren perceiued ſomewhat, yet they
durſt not intrude themſelues in the matter, but rid on till they
came to a place, where they would take ſhipping to paſſe into
<hi>Greece.</hi> And while the Mariners were prouiding for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
the Princes delighted to walke along in a faire plaine,
where they had not long ſtaied, but they eſpied a Coach couered
all with blacke, and thrée Eſquires that droue it, making very
dolefull and grieuous lamentations. Vpon this mourneful ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle,
<hi>Florian</hi> approached the Coach, and lifting vp the cloath,
he beheld a knight lying in gréene armor, ſo imbrued with blood,
that one could hardly iudge of what colour it was. This moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<hi>Florian</hi> to great heauines, and being deſirous to know the
cauſe of his miſfortune, he came to one of the Eſquires, willing
him to report, by what miſchance the Knight was ſlaine. The
Eſquire hauing ſmall leiſure to ſtay, made him ſhortly anſwere
in this ſort.</p>
                     <p>If you deſire to vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infortunate hap of this knight,

I haue alwayes deſired to imploy my ſelfe, where I ſuppoſed to
be the greateſt danger, yet could neither feare diſmay me, nor
any doubt hinder me. And thus concluding his ſpéeches, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Coach, deſirous to ſée the ende of that the Eſquire
had told him. <hi>Palmerin</hi> and <hi>Pompides</hi> ſéeing him gone ſo ſoone,
walked ſoftly along the valley, when in a while a Damoſel pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
her ſelfe before them, mounted on a blacke palfray, and
ſaluted them in this manner. I deſire you gentlemen, that one
of you would ſo much fauour me, as to goe with me to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour

herto death in moſt cruel maner. <hi>Pompides</hi> hearing the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plait

ſo darke as they could not deſcrie one another) he heard the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy

my trauels are to no other end, and I ſeeke him, onely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
with him, to bring backe the Shield, with his head to the
Caſtell of <hi>Almaroll,</hi> from whence he was ſo bold as to take it
away. So that this enterpriſe toucheth me more then any one
aliue: wherefore, I deſire you to giue euery our trauell, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
your ſelfe to reſt of your life, for mine hath been preſerued
in the danger of this aduenture, which maketh me the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to follow it. <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> (who was ignorant of this
Knight) ſeeing him to vſe his intent in that order, endeuoured
to know him, but his labour was ſpent to no ende or profit.
Wherefore they were ſo incenſed with ſuch anger, that they
gaue ſcope to their Stéedes, and met together ſo nobly, that they
were both diſmounted to the ground, and then they fell to it a
freſh with their ſwords, ſo that their Armour and expence of
their blood, witneſſed the dangerous eſtate of both their perſons.
For <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> thought, no two Knights in the world could
handle him ſo, without it were the noble <hi>Palmerin,</hi> or <hi>Florian</hi>
his brother, which made him a great while to think this knight
was one of them, till at laſt faintneſſe one either ſide willed
them to breath, when <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> looking on his battered ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
began on this manner.</p>
                     <p>Oh wretched Fortune, am I brought into ſuch debility, that
I haue not the power to vanquiſh this one knight? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Miſtres, I know this miſhap chanceth, onely becauſe you haue
no mind to remember me. This fight haue I attempted vnder
your gracious name, wherein ſuffer me not to be vanquiſhed,
but grant me ſo happy, that I may render your Shield againe
into your cuſtody: and afterward (in recompence of my dutifull
and faithfull ſeruice) put me to death if it be your gracious plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>The Knight on the other ſide was as grieuouſly paſſioned,
thinking verily to finiſh his daies in this Combate: wherefore,
he began in this order to vſe his complaints. Madam, I ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:13179:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be very happy (conſidering the deſire I haue alwayes had) at
this preſent houre to ende all my troubles, becauſe your delight
hath euer béene, to bring me to the laſt extremity of my vitall
courſe. Yet am I highly one way contented, knowing that I
die in the honourable ſeruice, wherwith I haue continually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured
to gratifie your deſire.</p>
                     <p>So breaking of his ſpéeches, they fel very egerly to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
and at laſt was brought vnto ſuch feebleneſſe, that they
were both forced to fall to the ground: but Fortune, who preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
them to a greater conqueſt of honor, cauſed at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
the noble <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to arriue in that place,
who knowing <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> ſuppoſed verily that he was ſlain,
wherefore he came to the other knight, and taking his Helmet
off, and perceiuing that it was the noble <hi>Florendos,</hi> he became
ſo ouercharged with griefe, that he could hardly ſuſtaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
from falling to the earth.</p>
                     <p>Then he commaunded <hi>Siluian</hi> to goe to the Citie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to bring Chirurgions with him, becauſe he thought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
they were almoſt paſt recouery: and <hi>Siluian</hi> knowing, that
the death of theſe two knights, might be an occaſion to put his
Maiſters life in danger, vſed ſuch diligence, that in ſhort time
hee returned with two very expert Maiſters in Chirurgerie.
<hi>Palmerin</hi> deſired them to manifeſt their knowledge at that
preſent, in recouering the health of thoſe dangerous wounded
Knights, and his recompence ſhould excéed in liberalitie: ſo
when the Chirurgians had ſearched their wounds, they found
them not ſo dangerous, as their weakeneſſe and wearineſſe,
wherefore they promiſed (by the grace of God) to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
as good eſtate of health as euer they were. The Prince reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at their good anſwere, and cauſed <hi>Siluian</hi> to fetch a Coach

                     <p>Moſt dread and puiſſant Emperor, I haue béene conſtrained
to viſit your Court, for two cauſes which I hold as eſpecial: the
one to ſée the noble mindes that are alwayes here abyding, the
other to try my ſelfe againſt them all, on her behalfe that hath

the Shield of the faire <hi>Miragarda,</hi> which by force I beare, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to honour that Saint, to whom I homage my heart, and will
enforce all knights to yeeld as vaſſailes. So that if your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

of your Court, as alſo any other that dare auouch the contrary:
My Lady and Miſtreſſe <hi>Targiana,</hi> the onely Daughter to the

the prize all for beautie.</p>
                     <p>And theſe conditions I doe require in mine attempt, that the
Defendant, on his Shield ſhall bring the liuely Portayt of his
<pb facs="tcp:13179:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lady, with her name to be verified at the foote thereof, becauſe it
ſhall be the onely recompence the Conquerour ſhall gaine. And
there be any, who will manifeſt themſelues to be but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
fauoured of their Ladies, they ſhall be ſworne to giue in
writing the name of their Miſtreſſe.</p>
                     <p>As for him that hath the good hap to vanquiſh me, he ſhall not
onely be Lord of the ſhield of my Lady <hi>Targiana,</hi> but ſhall haue
likewiſe deliuered to him, all the ſhieldes which Fortune ſhall
allow me by my proweſſe. And furthermore to be granted, that
the knight diſmounted in the Iuſt, ſhall not haue the licence to
fight with his Sword, but as vanquiſhed, deliuer his Shield,
and ſo depart.</p>
                     <p>Now expect I your anſwere moſt redoubted Emperour, as
concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> requeſt of him, that hath trauailed many a ſtrange
Countrey: and now commeth to make triall of the valure and
puiſſance of your knights, if ſo be they can conceiue the courage
to aduenture the combat on the behalfe of their Ladies. When
he hadde ended his ſpéeches, a great tumult aroſe among the
Knights and Ladies of the court, who were very deſirous to ſée
<hi>Albayzar</hi> in the field: the Ladies, to know the valour of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
ſeruants, and the Knights to manifeſt the cauſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
their loue, euery one wiſhing to quallifie this preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
challenge.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour would make no anſwere to <hi>Albayzar,</hi> till
ſuch time as he had conferred with his Councell: when then he
returned with this reply. You haue (ſir knight) attempted ſuch
a hauty enterpriſe, as if wée ſhould deny, we ſhould not onely
grant our cowardiſe, but alſo hinder you of many noble Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits,
to the griefe of your ſelfe, as alſo of ſuch knights, as haue
a deſire to ſhew themſelues in the field. Wherefore, the fielde
is licenced you at what time you pleaſe, and your conditions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,

me of one thing, are you not allied to the <hi>Soldane Oloric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que</hi>
of <hi>Babilon,</hi> becauſe it ſéemeth you reſemble him ſomwhat
in fauour? My lord (anſwered <hi>Albayzar)</hi> the curteſie you haue
offered me, moueth me in humility to kiſſe your gratious hand,
aſſuring you that I am the ſon of the <hi>Soldane Oloricque,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:13179:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperor aroſe immediatly and imbraced him, ſaying:
I would gladly ſee you in my Court, in another eſtate then you
are at this preſent, but loue ſhall now excuſe your enterpriſe.
And then he commaunded, a Chamber ſhould be prouided for
him, but he made refuſall thereof, becauſe he had ſworne not to
depart the field, till he ſaw the iſſue of his hauty deſire.</p>
                     <p>The Empreſſe and <hi>Gridonia</hi> ſent vnto him, deſiring that he
would ſuffer them to view the Shields of <hi>Targiana</hi> and <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garda:</hi>
whereon they entred into iudgment, that although <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana</hi>
was very faire, yet was ſhe nothing comparable to the
Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda.</hi> With ſeuerall ſuppoſe they went from
hand to hand, till at laſt they came to the Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi>
who was ſomewhat offended, to ſee the princeſſe <hi>Miragarda</hi> ſo
ſingular and faire: which made her now to wiſh, that the noble
<hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England</hi> would now arriue at the Court, for ſhée
perſwaded her ſelfe, that his worthineſſe would aduance her to
the glory of the Shields. So that ſometime ſhe was minded to
ſend for him, but then by and by ſhe altred her thought: ſo that
ſhe miniſtred occaſion, to ſome diſdainfull minde of that noble
Sex, how no ſtability or conſtancy, is to be found in a woman.</p>
                     <p>Then was the picture of <hi>Altea</hi> brought, which for a precious
Iewel, ſupplied a roome in the Empreſſe coffer: and comparing
her with the faire <hi>Miragarda,</hi> ſhe was found to differ very far
in beautie. <hi>Albayzar</hi> receiuing his Shields, departed to the
place appointed for the Turnament, where the Emperour had
commaunded two Tents to be erected: and on a Pillar neare
adioyning, was placed the faire Portrayt of the Princeſſe <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana,</hi>
and <hi>Miragarda</hi> was ſet at her féete, in ſigne of being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed.
And becauſe it was as then ſomwhat late, the knights
had not the oportunitie to trie themſelues that night, wherfore
they referred their determination till the next morning.</p>

the Iudges of the field, that no one ſhuld
approach the Tilt, but firſt to be permitted
by their appointment. Then was <hi>Criſpian</hi>
of <hi>Macedon</hi> allowed the firſt Iouſt, but <hi>Albayzar</hi> would not
receiue him, becauſe he brought not in his Shield the Portrayt
of his Lady, according to the order appointed: in like caſe all the

                     <p>On the fifth day, <hi>Emerald</hi> the <hi>Faire,</hi> who was reputed in the

The Emperor came to the Iuſting place the ſecond day, a great

was on horſeback, attending him that ſhuld firſt come, who
was Sir <hi>Badiart</hi> the Knight to <hi>Lucenda,</hi> but the ſlendernes of

victor, to the little content of the Emperour, who ſaw his
Knights ſo foiled, as alſo the noble <hi>Primaleon,</hi> who determined
if he remained ſtil conquerour, to enter the combat againſt him.
Oftentimes would <hi>Albayzar</hi> frequent the Image of his Lady,
with his Amorous diſcourſes, being ſo blinded in Loue, that the
picture of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> whom euery one commended, he ſuppoſed
inequall to his Lady <hi>Targiana.</hi> The Retrait ſounded, euery one
retyred, &amp; the Emperour after ſupper, required the Prince <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayzar</hi>

ſhew themſelues, becauſe they were aſhamed to come before

enioying very litte reſt, becauſe of the deſire he had to bee at his

Iudges of the Field cauſed a Trée to be placed by the Pillar, to
hand the Shield vpon that <hi>Albayzar</hi> won, and on the toppe
they ſet the Shields of the Princeſſe <hi>Miragada,</hi> in token that
it had béen attained in Combate, whereas the other was but
the figure of his owne amorous loue. Then entered the Field
<hi>Bellizar,</hi> the Sonne of the Prince <hi>Belcar,</hi> very brauely Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
before him was carried the Picture of his Lady, the faire

Sir knight, you aſke much of him, who wanteth to anſwere
that which you ſéeme to craue, for if the ſhield I haue preſented
lacke that you would haue, and I as much wiſh, it is onely to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue it in reſemblance to him, that hath borne it many a day
with grief, but neuer a houre of ioy or gladnes. Yet haue I ſéene
the time, I could haue preſented you a picture which could haue
enforced you to a great maruaile, &amp; my ſelfe very little to eſtéeme
of your might, but ſo vnhappily hath Fortune frowued, and my

with nothing, but this dolefull apparance, which in midſt of my

of his Lady and Miſtreſſe, deſiring you to excuſe me,
for this is the beſt auailes, that Fortune hath left me.</p>
                     <p>Sir Knight (anſwered <hi>Albayzar)</hi> I willingly would, that
the picture wherwith you threaten me, were at this preſent in

which you haue reported, conſtraineth me to breake my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
I francke and fréely permit you the Iuſt. Then couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Speares, they paſſed the firſt courſe very gallantly,

that he loſt both his Stirrops, and was conſtrained to hold by

But when he perceiued the Knight ready to charge him

I know right wel, that weapons were inuented to maintain
honour, as alſo to diſcharge any perillous aduenture, wherefore,
it had beed much better for me, to haue paſt my life without

Fortune, but in the ende I finde my ſelfe vanquiſhed, I knew

being the Author of mine euill, and wilfully ſéeke mine owne

a pleaſant valley thicke beſet with Trées, the Princeſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
to ſtay a while, till the heat of the day were ſomewhat paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.
Not long had they reſted them, but they eſpied foure knights
come riding towards them, who ſéeing the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana,</hi>
and being lately come from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> wher they had bin
vanquiſhed by <hi>Albayzar,</hi> in whoſe Shield was her picture ſo
naturally drawn, that the knights haue bin ouermuch blind
if they had miſtaken her: wherefore knowing, and perſwading
themſelues it was ſhe, one of them offred her theſe ſalutations.
Faire Lady, we eſtéeme it as lawfull and honourable, that they
to whom your beauty hath bene a cauſe of great loſſe and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
ſhould haue the aduantage in recompence of their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happe,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Florian</hi> aroſe vp in an anger, and gaue them this anſwere:
Gentlemen, if you be well, follow your way, if you haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
any miſchance, impute it to your folly, and not any occaſion
procéeding by your Ladies: as for this Lady, ſhee is not ſo
fond as to goe with you, nor I ſo fooliſh as to accompliſh your
will in ſuch a vaine requeſt. You anſwere ſo brauely (ſayde)
one of the Knights) that now we are fully determined ſhe ſhall
goe with vs: and if you ſéeme, or dare offer to offend her,
we ſhall quickly coole your courage, becauſe you are diſpoſed ſo
ſuddenly to chafe.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Florian</hi> mounted on horſbacke preſently, and came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with theſe ſpéeches. Now am I determined, to try if your
worthines will proue according to your words, you may come
to me one after another, or all foure at once and if you pleaſe: for
diſloyalty can neuer ſhew it ſelfe, but where it is continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident.
Tuſh (ſaid one of the knights) do not hold ſuch a proude
opinion with your ſelfe, for one of vs alone will find you worke
enough and that is my ſelfe, who will be ſo bold as to ſtay your
haſtineſſe: as for my followes, I iudge they would thinke it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
to them, if they ſhould deale with ſuch a one as you. <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
not able to abide theſe words, ran with ſuch courage againſt

<pb facs="tcp:13179:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he threw him dead to the ground: then the other comming vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
vpon him, he ſerued them in ſuch ſort, that two more of
them were ſlaine, the other was glad to ſaue his life by flight.
<hi>Florian</hi> being diſcharged of theſe foure knights, alighted from
his Horſe, and came before his lady <hi>Targiana:</hi> who was ſo wel
contented with the victory of her knight, as ſhe would haue béen
diſpleaſed, if Fortune had alotted him the contrary. And in this
pleaſure, ſéeing the night approch ſo faſt vpon them, ſhee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the Eſquires, to plate their thrée Tentes in the bottom
of the Valley, neere to a gréene bancke, whereby there ran a

<pb facs="tcp:13179:185" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the firſt, that this Emperor was very much affectioned to haue
his dwelling in a ſolitary place, néere to ſome pleaſant ſpring, or
ſome ſuch faire and coſtly Fountaine: and the ſecond, becauſe
the name of <hi>Marcellus</hi> was in many places about the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
néere whereunto was two Knights, who ſuffered their

                     <p>Theſe two Louers thus walking &amp; talking, found the words
of the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana</hi> to be true indéede, for at the foote of
this Trée, they eſpied a goodly knight laid along, &amp; no company

that his Maiſter might the better report the amorous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints
which were alwayes reſident in his penſiue minde, and this

loath to diſturbe him being ſo ſeriouſly buſied, withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
a litle ſo cloſely as they could, when the knight, not thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
any to be ſo neare him, began to vnfold his griefe after this

                     <p>My Lady, how haue I béene offenſiue to you, that you ſhould
offer me ſo great vngentleneſſe? leauing me aliue to wiſh daily

me die, onely that I might paſſe my time, in vneſtimable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

to prolong my life in doing you ſeruice, wherto you vſe ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly
meanes, that you will not permit me to be imployed
therein, but as the onely Authour of mine euill, and daily occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

courſe of my life. Which truſt me ſerueth very ſtrange, for that
I neuer ſaw affliction in any man, but there was ſome meane
whereby to tollerate it, as for mine, it kéepeth at one certaine
ſtay, and when it commeth to the beſt change, it falleth from an
Ague Quartaine, to a Quotidian, as if all miſhap were onely
meant to me. Other men ſuſtaine their griefe in hope of a ſhort
ende, but my Fortune is ſuch, that mine extreames will neuer
take ende, which vrgeth me to this beliefe, that you triumph
to ſée me tormented, and iudge me vnworthy to liue in your
ſeruice, in which vexation, I content my ſelfe ſo well as I
may.</p>

a recompence to him that hath deſerued a better reward, &amp; that
your vngentlenes hath bin more, then either cuſtome can bold

with ſuch a grieuous ſigh, as though hee had fetchht h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

gaſpe. <hi>Florian</hi> attached with griefe, to heare the heauy tale of
this diſtreſſed knight, tooke his Lady <hi>Targiana</hi> by the hand to
returne: but the Knight hearing the noyſe, which the Silke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell
of the Princeſſe made in the Buſhes, ſtarted vp, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Helmet on his head, came to the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> with
theſe words.</p>
                     <p>Abide Sir Knight, and becauſe againſt another time, you
ſhall learne more manners and diſcretion, defend your ſelfe, for
I truſt you ſhall report my Proweſſe, where you take occaſion
to rehearſe my complaints. Séeing Sir (quoth <hi>Florian)</hi> you are
ſo minded, it were folly for me to offer any excuſe, and therefore
procéede in your determination. So drawing their Swordes,
they beganne a very braue fight, charging one another in ſuch
dangerous manner, that <hi>Targiana</hi> commended this exployt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all that ſhe had ſéene before. While they were thus ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
againſt one another, a Knight in gréene and white Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
chanced to arriue there: in his Shield hée bare for his
deuiſe a Speare, which was pierced in many places, with
blowes that he had receiued he had two Eſquires attending on
him, and was deſirous to knowe the cauſe, why theſe two
Knightes endured the Combate ſo cruelly. Wherefore, hée
came to the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana,</hi> to knowe of her: but when he
had beheld her a while, he quite forgat what he ſhould demand:
and becauſe he was one of the knights that <hi>Albayzar</hi> had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed,
he had knowledge of her preſently, wherfore, he ſet her
vp behind one of his Eſquires, and riding away with her, gaue
her theſe ſpéeches. Faire Lady, ſéeing theſe Knight are not
able to beare you company, I know none ſo worthy as my ſelfe
to kéepe you, for through you. I ſhall recompence all the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
I haue gotten.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:187" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Targiana</hi> ſéeing, that neither her faire intreaty, nor reſiſtance by
her ſmall ſtrength could pacifie him, &amp; that <hi>Florian</hi> maintained
the Combate ſo fiercely, he could not heare her cry, beganne in
this order to perſwade him. I know not, Sir Knight, how you
dare preſume to make entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vpon an others poſſeſſion, ſeeing
that although you haue the power to carrie me away with you,
yet my good will and affection, ſhall alway be eſtranged to you.
And ſéeing there is no remedie, I pray you ſuffer me to goe on
foote to yonder Fountaine, where abide mine attendance, who
ſhall goe with me: aſſuring you, that they haue no weapons,
wherewith to aſſiſt againſt you, or defend me. I am content
(ſaid the Knight) to ſatiſfie your deſire, as he that moſt deſireth
to honor you in ſeruice: ſo they walked downe to the fountaine,
where at this time we minde to leaue them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Don Florian</hi> and the Knight were ſo earneſt in their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
that they neuer perceiued when <hi>Targiana</hi> was carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
but if they had ſeene her they were brought to ſuch weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
that they could not haue reſcued her. In which dangerous
eſtate, Fortune was ſo friendly vnto them, that <hi>Dramuſiande</hi>
(trauailing toward <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to recouer the ſhield of the
faire <hi>Miragarda)</hi> arriued there: where ſeeing the extremitie
that theſe two Knights were in, and knowing by the Armes
the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> as alſo beholding another Knight to
endure the Combate ſo well, he was greatly abaſhed, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to loſe the man he moſt loued, he gaue his horſe the ſpurs,
and ran betwéene them with theſe words.</p>
                     <p>Gentlemen, I deſire you at my requeſt to ende your debate,
for that your weakneſſe rather requireth reſt, then to continue

(ſpeaking to the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Dragon)</hi> you ſhould not refuſe to
grant my deſire, for in ſo doing, this other knight I hope ſhall
haue occaſion to thanke me. When <hi>Florian</hi> heard the name
of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> he conceiued ſuch griefe, that throwing his ſword
from him, he fell to the ground in manner as he had béene dead:
wherefore <hi>Palmerin,</hi> ſéeing ſo great debilitie in him, that he had
found ſo vertuous and valiant, commaunded <hi>Siluian</hi> to vnloſe
his Helmet, that he might receiue the ayre. But when hee

ſo ill intreated, began to him in theſe words. How might I
recompence the great offence I haue committed, that forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſhould ſo much gouerne my ſences, as not to know the
hardy blowes of my noble Lord? My noble brother (anſwered

that ſo ſoone as his wounds were brought into better e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate

the meane, to ſet both the Princes on Horſebacke,
departed with them from out the forreſt, when <hi>Florian</hi> caſting

and ſéeing his Lady <hi>Targiana,</hi> he could hardly ſuſtaine himſelfe
from falling to the ground. The <hi>Blacke Knight</hi> ſtaide a good
while beholding the ſhields <hi>Albayzar</hi> had conquered: but when
he ſaw the portrait of the faire <hi>Miragarda,</hi> the teares ran down
his chéekes, and he began in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Madame, how is it poſſible, that the thing wherein Nature
hath ſhowne all her ſkill to make it ſurpaſſing faire, ſhould bee
in the power of him, that might be glad to be vanquiſhed by you?
for my ſelfe, I would triumph to be found ſo Fortunate at this
preſent, becauſe I deſire to die to maintaine the truth, and I
hope to diſcouer the deceit of <hi>Albayzar,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
ſhall returne what he hath iuſtly deſerued. <hi>Albayzar</hi>
greatly reioyced to ſée his Lady <hi>Targiana,</hi> for whoſe loue ſhe had
attained ſuch eſtimation of honour, wherby he had ſo farre ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot
himſelfe in his prodigall pleaſure, that he ſtood in a maze,
whether it was ſhe or no. The <hi>Black Knight</hi> hauing ended his
complaint, and ſéeing <hi>Albayzar</hi> ſo farre diſtracted, put himſelfe
a little néerer, and awaked him with theſe wordes. <hi>Albayzar,</hi>
whereon doeſt thou vſe thy mind ſo mutely? I aduertiſe thee,
that the Princeſſe in my company is called <hi>Targiana,</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the great <hi>Turke,</hi> who hath taken the pains to come hither
to ſée thy valour, which is ſo much blazed &amp; commended through
the world. <hi>Albayzar</hi> at theſe words alighted from his horſe, and
hauing taken off his helmet, he came and kiſſed the hand of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana,</hi>
with this manner of ſalutation. Madame, I know not
how I may requite my ſelfe to you, hauing honored me ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
aboue my deſert. <hi>Targiana</hi> receiued him very gratiouſly, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
him hearty thanks for his noble ſeruice, whereof ſhe made
ſuch eſtimation, that <hi>Florians</hi> deeds were preſently forgotten,
yea, and ſo farre banniſhed out of memorie, as though ſhe had
neuer ſéene him in all her life, manifeſting rightly the inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of ſuch as regard their ſeruants, according as they are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in authoritie. <hi>Albayzar</hi> hauing done his duty to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<hi>Targiana,</hi> mounted on horſebacke, and began thus to the
<hi>Blacke Knight.</hi> Sir Knight, I would faine know, what moued
you to bring my Lady hither, as alſo if you haue deſire to enter
the Iuſt, for vpon the preſenting your ſhield, you ſhal be receiued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sir (quoth the <hi>Blacke Knight)</hi> after the ſtrife is concluded
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene
vs, ſhe ſhall diſcourſe the certaintie thereof her ſelfe.
But as concerning the ſhield, which you ſay I muſt preſent, to
be allowed the Iouſte, I am at this time vnprouided thereof,
becauſe thou haſt diſloyally ſtolne it, which elſe I might haue
worne here to honour my Lady. Wherefore I haue thus deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by my puiſſance, to cauſe thee confeſſe the ſame, before
this honourable aſſembly: and if Fortune fauoureth thee ſo
much, as to ſuffer me be vanquiwed at thy hands, faile not to
reuenge thy ſelf on me, as on the greateſt enemy that euer thou
haddeſt: but if I vanquiſh thée, I deſire no greater victorie, in
recompence of the trayterous wrong thou haſt offered me, then
to carry backe the Shielde of my Lady <hi>Miragarda,</hi> to the place
where it hath alway been accuſtomed to remaine. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
(anſwered <hi>Albayzar)</hi> that if Fortune permit thée conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
ouer me, thou enioy all theſe Shields ſhe hath ſuffered mée
to vanquiſh, and that thou bring me to the Caſtle of <hi>Miragarda</hi>
where ſhe ſhall ordaine for my life as pleaſeth her: and the like
ſhall my Lady <hi>Targiana</hi> deale with thée, if mine accuſtomed
good happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> returne me the Victorie. Syr (quoth the <hi>Blacke
Knight)</hi> my will is thereto as ready as thine: albeit thou ſhalt
finde no more friendſhip at my hands, then I will offer to my
greateſt enemie.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor with all the company, were ſuddenly ſtrooken
into a great maruaile, when they had heard the wordes of the
<hi>Blacke Knight,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Primaleon,</hi> who deſired greatly to
haue knowledge of him, whereupon, the Iudges commanded
them the Field, and <hi>Targiana</hi> entred with them, according as
<hi>Albayzar</hi> requeſted.</p>
                     <p>The Trumpets ſounded, and the Knights mette ſo couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
with each other, that <hi>Albayzar</hi> was thrown to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
his héeles vpward, and the <hi>Black Knight</hi> was diſmounted with
the Saddle betwéene his legges, becauſe the girtes of his horſe
were broken, or elſe he had kept on horſeback ſtill, which made
the Emperour to iudge, that <hi>Albayzar</hi> ſhould not depart with
ſuch honour as hee thought for. When they had drawne their
Swordes, they laid at each other in ſuch terrible manner,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:191" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that <hi>Albayzar</hi> thought he had neuer met with a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger knight
and the <hi>Blacke Knight</hi> very well eſtéemed the ſtrength of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayzar:</hi>
ſo that the generall verdict was, neuer had been ſéene a
more hauty combat. For <hi>Albayzar</hi> was encouraged by his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Targiana,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Blacke Knight</hi> ſo animated with the picture
of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> that betwéene them was declared the deedes of
incredible proweſſe.</p>
                     <p>At laſt, <hi>Albayzar</hi> ſéeing his Armour ſo bedewed with his
blood, and himſelfe brought into ſuch extremitie, hee retyred to
take breath, and began thus to complaine. What do the noble
victories which I haue attained againſt many noble mindes,
preuaile me now in any thing? ſeeing that at this inſtant, I
muſt loſe all the glorie I haue gotten. Oh my Lady <hi>Targiana,</hi>
if I haue had the power to vanquiſh the beſt Knights in all the
world in your abſence, why ſuffer you one Knight to preuaile
ſo much againſt me in your preſence? to looſe my former honor,
is more deere to me then life, which falling out ſo contrary as
it doth, maketh me to thinke, that you are more affectionate to
ſome other then you are to me, which is the onely cauſe the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
will not fall on my ſide. But yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what Princeſſe is there
in all the world, more braue in bountie, beyond you in beautie,
or better deſerueth the title aboue all titles then you? truely,
I may loſe the victorie of this Combat, through defect of my
weakneſſe, but not by any fault that is in your excellency, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                     <p>The <hi>Blacke Knight</hi> on the other ſide, ſéeing his dangerous
eſtate, and that he could not aſſure himſelfe any good ſucceſſe, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
to the picture of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> he entred into theſe ſpeeches.
Madame, ſeeing it hath pleaſed you, to vſe me in affaires that
haue greatly touched me, I deſire you not to forſake me in this
enterpriſe, which is wholly yours, wherein, though <hi>Alba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Targiana,</hi> who excelleth all theſe figured Ladies in beauty, yet
ſhew you your ſelfe excelling all other in that ſingular gift, to
ouercome him that hath conquered ſo many. For I perſwade
my ſelfe, you wil not fauor him that hath done you ſuch wrong,
as diſloyally to beare the Shield from your Caſtle: but let me
<pb facs="tcp:13179:191" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that am your true and faithfull ſeruant, giue you the honour of
this hautie attempt, and afterward deale with this curſed car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſe

After this they fell to to the combate a freſh, when the Emperor
ſéeing the ſmall defence they had for themſelues, ſuppoſed they
could not long continue the fight, and <hi>Primaleon</hi> through opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which came by nature, in griefe of mind receiued perfectly
the cruell wounds of the <hi>Blacke knight,</hi> as though he had felt
them vpon his owne body, becauſe he ſuppoſed him to be of his
linage. And by the cruell behauiour they vſed to ech other, the
Empres &amp; <hi>Gridonia</hi> departed, as not able to abide the grieuous
ſight of theſe two champions, who after they had griped one an

and vncloſed his helmet to haue ſmiten off his head, but the
Emperour called to him to vſe more mercy, yet he makking as
though he heard not, lifted vp his ſword, when the Princeſſe
<hi>Targiana</hi> fell before him on her knées, with theſe ſpéeches. Syr
Knight, firſt I deſire you to ſtrike off my head, and afterward
proceed in what ſhall pleaſe you, for loth would I be to ſee him
die that hath ventured his life in danger, to do me ſuch honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſeruice. The <hi>Blacke Knight</hi> ſeeing the modeſtie of the

the <hi>Blacke Knight</hi> honoured, according as became a victorious
conquerour. But he would not depart out of the Field before
the Portrait of the faire <hi>Miragarda</hi> was placed in the middeſt,
where, againſt all reaſon, the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana</hi> ſupplied the
roome, whom he led with him, to be honoured according as her

kiſſing his highneſſe hand, vpon his knee began in this manner.
Moſt dread and mighty Emperour, I deſire that this Princes
may be regarded aboue all in your Court, for you ought to ſhew
more honor to her, then to any other perſon that I know. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

While they were in their triumphing, the Empreſſe, <hi>Gridonia,

                     <p>When the Emperour and all were placed, to regard the cauſe

a little Key of Gold that hung about her necke, ſhe opened it:
whereout ſhe tooke a curious and coſtly Cup, which was ſo arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficialle

what was within, which was nothing but water, ſo hard
congealed and frozen, that it was impoſſible to moue any moity

the Coffer againe to the Knight, whereon ſhe ſet the Cup, and
looking wiſhly vpon all the company, at laſt ſhe began to vtter
theſe ſpeeches.</p>
                     <p>Moſt noble Emperour, I haue been in ſo many Princes
Courts, to make triall of the ſtrange aduenture contained in
this Cuppe, that, not finding any to ende the ſame, I am wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to ſeeke auy further, as alſo out of opinion of any good hap.
Except that now in your Highneſſe Court, which is moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
and eſteemed vpon the whole earth, I may find ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Fortune, as of long time I haue failed in, which doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
me ſomewhat, conſidering there is not the like. But
firſt before the triall be attempted, I will diſcourſe the cauſe of
this rare aduenture, becauſe each one of theſe noble gentlemen,
may be the better affectioned to her, who holdeth his heart as
<pb facs="tcp:13179:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
chiefe Miſtreſſe of his thoughts. There was ſometime ruling in
<hi>Thrace,</hi> a king who was name <hi>Sardamant,</hi> ſo excellent well
ſéene in the Art of Magique, that for the qualitie of that gift, he
ſurpaſſed all other liuing in his time. This King had a daughter,
of no leſſe beauty then Courtly behauiour, who was greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
of two knights, the one called <hi>Brandimar,</hi> the other <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi>
but they kept cloſe their ſecreat loue from each other, til for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,

<hi>Brandiſia,</hi> eſteemed chiefly the ſeruice of <hi>Artibel,</hi> which her

which by fortune the king heard, and comming thither with his
gard, he found <hi>Brandimar</hi> almoſt ſlaine. Whereupon <hi>Artibell</hi>
was committed to priſon, and <hi>Brandimar</hi> hauing declared all to
the King, ſhortly after yeelded his life. The king knowing that
his daughter was conceiued with child, kept <hi>Artibell</hi> in priſon
till time of her deliuerance, vpon which day hee cauſed him to
be beheaded, and in this Cup, he ſent her the hart of her beloued
<hi>Artibell.</hi> The Princeſſe perceiuing the cruell reuenge of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and deſirous to accompany her déere friend in death, tooke
the Cup, and making a thouſand complaints ouer the heart of
<hi>Artibel,</hi> ſhe continued mourning ſo long, till ſhe had filled this
Cup with her teares. Afterward thinking this not ſufficient,
to manifeſt the faithful loue ſhe bare to the knight, ſhe tooke the
Cup and ſent it to her Father, vttering to the Meſſenger theſe
ſpeeches. Tell my Father, that it may be, he hath ſent mee this
<pb facs="tcp:13179:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
true and faithfull token, of my moſt affectionate &amp; loyall friend,
only that I ſhould ſhew in the maſſaring of mine owne life, my
hart was iointly vnited, with this harmeleſſe heart of my deare
<hi>Artibell,</hi> whom ſince I loued in life, I wil not forſake in death,
neither for my Fathers rigor to him, and cruelty to me, but will
honour his death with loſſe of my life, my Father being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of all this euill. So taking out the heart, and the meſſenger
departed with the Cup, ſhe tricked her ſelfe in her braueſt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
&amp; putting the heart of her friend <hi>Artibel</hi> between her breſts,
with theſe words. Oh <hi>Artibel,</hi> receiue thine own <hi>Brandiſia,</hi> ſhe
caſt her ſelf headlong out of the chamber window, where death
tooke his due of this faithfull and conſtant Princeſſe. The king
ſorrowfull for his Daughters death, ſolemnized her Funerals
with great honour and dignity, and taking the Child, whom he

                        </gap>anied
with Ladies &amp; gentlewomen, where ſhe was nouriſhed
for the ſpace of foure yeeres. At the end wherof, he made an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment
halfe a mile from his place in a Valley, wherein he
likewiſe Enchaunted the yong princeſſe <hi>Leonarda,</hi> which En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment
he had vſed in ſuch order, that none might ſée her, nor
yet come neare vnto her, for a far off might be diſcerned a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fortreſſe, but when any endeuoured to come neare it, it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
away, &amp; nothing could be ſéene. When he had ſo done, he
tooke this Cup, wherein he had congealed &amp; frozen the teares,
vſing his Art ſo vpon them, that he hath brought them into this
ougly blackneſſe which you now behold. And at the houre of his
death (ſeeing his kingdome ſhould remaine deſtitute of an heire
to ſuccéed him) he commanded this Cup ſhould be carried into
all Princeſſe Courts in the world, to paſſe the hands of many
noble Knights, vntill the teares came to the firſt eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
So ſhould the knight be found, that ſurpaſſeth al other in
worthineſſe and conſtancy of Loue, as alſo that is able to expell
and end the enchauntment of the princeſſe <hi>Leonarda,</hi> who ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
mariage with her, ſhall gouerne the ſcepter and Diademe
of <hi>Thrace.</hi> But if ſo be, the Knight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who hath the power to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
this aduenture, ſhall haue vowed his faith to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſo that the princeſſe cannot marry with him, the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<pb facs="tcp:13179:194"/>
of the king is ſuch, that the Princeſſe <hi>Leonarda,</hi> ſhall
ioyne in Mariage with him, that this aforeſayde Knight ſhall
command.</p>
                     <p>Aud one thing more you ſhall vnderſtand, that if any knight
may equal himſelfe in faith and loyalty, with him that hath the
power to molifie theſe teares, the aduenture is ſuch, as they wil
turne to their former obſcure eſtate againe, but if ſuch a one
come, as may not in that excellent gift be comparable to the
Knight, then is there nothing can cauſe them to to change their
colour. So that if any knight aduance himſelfe to this cup, and
is not a faithfull and conſtant Louer, the teares ſhall remaine
as darke as you ſée them at this preſent. Likewiſe, after the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment
ſhalbe fully finiſhed, that the Lady and the Knight,
may beheld themſelues in the teares, they ſhall ſée the perfect
forme of thoſe perſons, who are their deareſt friends, and their
greateſt enemies. And if any will knowe thoſe that are leaſt in
fauour, vpon the taking of this Cup, they ſhall féele a ſauour ſo

ſomewhat his conſtant loyaltie in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
of his Cup: wherefore receiuing it
at the hands of the Damoſel, he turned him
toward the Empreſſe, and ſaid. Truſt mée
Madame, if it be true, that faithful loue may
conuert theſe teares, then I perſwade my
ſelfe to haue ſome title in it. So holding the Cuppe a great
while, and perceiuing that it changed not the colour, he began
to be ſomewhat offended with himſelfe: wherefore the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
receiued it againe of him, and to mooue him from ſadneſſe,
gaue him theſe ſpéeches. My gratious Lord, I ſée that age
hath decayed the force of your affection: but had this aduenture
béene deliuered you when time was, I know it could not haue
remained thus at this preſent. <hi>Primaleon</hi> preſently came and
tooke the Cuppe, but his Fortune was no more fauoured, then
the Emperor his Father: which vrged him to ſome cauſe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
fearing that <hi>Gridonia</hi> would haue giuen him but ſlender
thankes. Then came the Prince <hi>Vernar,</hi> and in his hand the
Cup receiued a little brightneſſe: whereby the Ladies knewe,
that the Damoſell had reported nothing but the trueth. After
<hi>Vernar,</hi> came the King <hi>Polendos,</hi> and in his hand the Cup be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
as blacke againe as euer it was: whereat the Ladies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to laugh, and the Damoſell of <hi>Thrace</hi> ſpake to him in this
order. Syr <hi>Polendos,</hi> if the loue you beare your Lady, be of no
more effect then it ſéemeth at this preſent, I iudge ſhe hath cauſe
to be but little beholding to you. Gentlewoman, anſwered <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendos,</hi>
it is ſo long time ſince amorous thoughts haue let me,
that it is no maruaile, if Fortune ſéeme ſo aduerſe to me now.
<pb facs="tcp:13179:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Then aroſe the prince <hi>Gratian,</hi> thinking to end the aduenture,
by the faithfull loue he bare to his faire <hi>Claritia,</hi> and in his hand
the Cup receiued more brightnes then it did when the Prince
<hi>Vernar</hi> had it, whereat his heart was rauiſhed with vnſpeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ioy, and giuing the Cup to his brother <hi>Guerin,</hi> it became
as blacke againe as euer it was. The ladies greatly delighted to
ſée the variable quality contained in the cup: ſo that they had an
aſſured meane, to ſée which of their knights might excel in loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of loue. <hi>Berolde</hi> P. of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the onely beloued of the faire
<hi>Oniſtalda,</hi> aduanced himſelfe to take the cup, vſing this ſilent
opinion to himſelfe. Madame, I haue euer deſired your helpe in
all mine affaires, but at this preſent I craue no ſuccour at your
hands, for that the merit of my conſtancy, promiſeth me a large
title in this honourable aduenture. Then taking the cup, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
brighter then euer it had béene, and the frozen teares began
ſomewhat to melt, which mooued the Princeſſe <hi>Oneſtalda</hi> to ſo
great pleaſure, that ſhe could not conceale it, but the Ladies ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
by did perceiue it. After him came the P. <hi>Platir,</hi> the knight
of <hi>Fidelia,</hi> daughter to the king <hi>Tarnaes:</hi> but albeit he bare her
great good will, the Cup was not ſo bright in the hands of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolde,</hi>
but while he held it, it became as black. Then came <hi>Belli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zart,</hi>
ſeruant to the faire <hi>Deniſia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Dramian</hi> the knight of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian:</hi>
but both of them ſped alike in their enterpriſe. <hi>Francian,</hi>
who loued the faire <hi>Bernard,</hi> tooke his turne next to trie the
Cup, but he ſped ſo ill, that he wiſht himſelfe out of the place: for
in his hand the cup loſt all the brightnes, that the other knights
had brought it into, whereat he was greatly agrieued, and the
Emperor laughing a good at him, began merrily in theſe words.
Sir <hi>Francian,</hi> you may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend your fortune to be in ſuch liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
for the Ladies will not receiue any haſtie occaſion, whereby
they may thinke good to fal in loue with you, and you may ſhape
your ſelfe of like diſpoſition, at no time to be haſtie in truſting
them. After him came <hi>Friſol, Oneſtalde, Eſtrellant, Tenebrant
Luyman</hi> of <hi>Burgondy, Pompides, Bla didon, Germaine</hi> of
<hi>Orleance, Dridan, Polinarde, Tremoran, Baromont,</hi> &amp; <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>
of <hi>Freeze:</hi> amongſt which company, the beſt fauoured were
<hi>Polinarde, Beromont,</hi> and <hi>Germaine</hi> of <hi>Orleance,</hi> yet none of
<pb facs="tcp:13179:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them might be compared to the Prince <hi>Berolde.</hi> The Damoſel
of <hi>Thrace</hi> was in great deſpaire, thinking the aduenture would
not be ended in the Emperours Court, when preſently came the
ſorrowfull prince <hi>Floraman,</hi> &amp; at the Emperors requeſt he tooke
the cap, ſaying: My Lady, remember the danger wherin you ſée
me, as alſo the griefe I ſuſtaine for your ſake: wherout you may
deliuer me if you pleaſe, &amp; ſet me once againe in my ioyfull ſtate.
When he had ended his ſpéeches, the Cup receiued ſuch a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous
brightneſſe, &amp; the congealed teares melted ſo ſuddenly,
that the whole aſſembly, thought the aduenture to be fully fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed:
but the Damoſell knowing the contrary, went to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
who, in her preſence, ſpake thus to the Prince of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignia.</hi>
I know well Sir <hi>Floraman,</hi> that this aduenture was
reſerued for you, becauſe the firmeneſſe of your faith, gaue mée a
great deale more aſſurance, then the experience I haue to report
this enterpriſe: and truſt me I am very glad it is ſo fallen out,
becauſe now, all other will hold you in the eſtimation, that my
ſelfe of long time repoſed in you. The ladies, who euer bare good
affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>Floramá,</hi> were now a great deal more vrged towards
him: which y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> damoſell perceiuing, &amp; that euery one ſuppoſed the
aduenture to be ended, to the Emperor ſhe began in this maner.
My gratious Lord, I deſire you that all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> knights may abide in
this place, for albeit the cup is brought into this good effect, yet is
not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> brought to paſſe which muſt be finiſhed. I know ſaid <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raman,</hi>
that fortune is wont to cauſe me begin euery enterpriſe
with ioy, but at the concluſion thereof, ſhe threatneth my death.
Then <hi>Don Roſuel</hi> &amp; diuers knights aſſaied the Cup, ſome ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
well, &amp; ſome ill, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as their conſtancy did differ in quality.
At laſt, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany were minded to retire for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> time,
they eſpied a knight in gréene Armour, to preſent himſelf before
him, whoſe ſtoutnes of behauior cauſed al to feare that tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to behold him, there was none y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> knew him but <hi>Primaleo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi>
who preſently ſaid, that it was the giant <hi>Dramuſiand,</hi> wherfore
he deſired the Emperor to ſtay a while, when aduancing himſelf
to méet him, <hi>Dramuſiand</hi> came &amp; imbraced him with very great
reuerence. When he had opened his helmet, <hi>Primaleon</hi> brought
him before the Emperor: where humbly vpon his knée, he began
<pb facs="tcp:13179:196"/>
in this maner. I deſire you my gratious Lord and Father, that
you wil receiue this knight with your accuſtomed honor, for that
his valiant and noble behauior, hath made him as much renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as any on the earth. The Emperour knowing that it was
<hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> would not ſuffer him to kiſſe his hand, but imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
him in his armes, began as followeth. Albeit your friendly
dealing, did long time detaine my life in an vnexpected danger,
yet the good report of your Proweſſe, and noble behauiour ſince
that time, hath vrged mee to forget all, vowing my ſelfe your
friend to command, and ſo I pray you for euer to vſe me. <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſiande</hi>
very often thanked the Emperor, and <hi>Primaleon</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
him to the Empreſſe and <hi>Gridonia,</hi> who albeit they
made a ſhew of a friendly welcome, yet could they not do it har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
conſidering the griefe they ſuſtained for the impriſonment of
<hi>Primaleon.</hi> For they ſay, it is the nature of women, not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
and forgiue their iniuries, but to ſéeke reuengement, when
they are thought to be out of all remembrance. The Emperour
tooke <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> by the hand, and reported to him, how they
were gathered together, to ſée who could finiſh the aduenture of
the Cup, wherfore he deſired him to make trial therof, to ſée if he
were ſo happy as to end it. I ſhal (quoth <hi>Dramuſiand)</hi> do what
pleaſeth your Grace to command mee, and if Fortune ſtand ſo
much my friend, that I may preuaile aboue al in this enterpriſe,
I ſhall manifeſt the ſoueraigne duty, wherein loue hath bound
me: but if I faile therin, I ſhal haue the leſſe cauſe of maruell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is not the firſt time that fortune hath forgotten me. So
receiuing the cup of the damoſel, it became almoſt as cléere, as it
did in the hand of the Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> whoſe hap was as yet ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
for the moſt perfect, and then the Emperour commended
<hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> to think that a perſon ſo ſtrong and valiant, ſhuld
haue ſuch faithfull countenance and honour in loue. The day
was ſo far ſpent, that they al returned to the Pallace, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
deſiring the damoſel not to depart as yet, becauſe he would
haue <hi>Albaizar</hi> and <hi>Florendos,</hi> ſhould make their trial likewiſe,
for he verily thought, that one of them ſhould haue the power to
ende it. The Damoſell promiſed to accompliſh his pleaſure,
wherefore ſhe walked with them, and made her abiding in the
Emperours Pallace.</p>

the Giant <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> left them: and when they were very
well healed, and appointed with new Armour, which <hi>Siluian</hi>

thanking the Religious, for the good diligence they had vſed

becauſe they ſuppoſed it was not time as yet to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

became as cleare as when the prince <hi>Floraman</hi> held it, whereat
<hi>Targiana</hi> receiued gread pleaſure, but <hi>Albayzar</hi> was not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
becauſe he ſaw the aduenture was not concluded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> (who becauſe he would not be knowen, bare a <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>

                     <p>The Emperor very often beholding them, and iudging that
they were perſons of ſome great authority, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded that they
ſhould be placed by him, where he began to diſcourſe at large of
the cup, deſirous to know likewiſe of whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they were, but they
excuſed themſelues ſo honourably, that the Emperor held him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented. While theſe two Engliſh princes held talke with
the Emperor, the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> who was leaning on the

proue me loyall in truth. So taking the Cup of the Damoſell,
it receiued a farre more brightneſſe then euer it had before, and
the teares were brought into ſuch eſtate, as though they had not
béen frozen at all: whereat the Emperour and <hi>Primaleon</hi> were
very ioyfull to ſée ſuch a perfect proofe of Amitie in the Prince
<hi>Florendos,</hi> which made them to requeſt of the Damoſell, if the

proofe at all, and then if the Cup receiue no change, eſtéeme
this Knight the moſt conſtant &amp; faithfulleſt Louer in the world.
But if ſo be the Cup do alter againe, beleeue aſſuredly, that that

                     <p>The Emperour ſeeing that al his knights had aſſaied the cup,
he deſired the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Dragon</hi> &amp; his fellow to make triall
alſo: but <hi>Palmerin</hi> was ſo buſie in beholding his faire <hi>Polinarda,</hi>
that he heard not the Emperors words, wherfore <hi>Florian,</hi> who
was frée from a Louers paſſions, albeit he could diſſemble with

the ſame: for while he held it, there is nothing in the world can

                     <p>This anſwer of <hi>Florian,</hi> albeit it ſéemed acceptable to many
of the knights, yet the Ladies receiued it in great contempt: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their naturall quality is ſuch, to yéelde according to the
déedes of thoſe, who ſubmit themſelues to abide their pleaſure:
and contrariwiſe, their naturall inclination is, to vſe ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence,
as their ſeruice they haue receiued neuer deſerued.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſel of <hi>Thrace</hi> came to the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Dragon,</hi>
deſiring him to try the Cup, according as diuers other had done
before him, perſwading him, that of a perſon ſo knightly as hée
ſéemed, there was to be expected a very good iſſue. <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the matter brought to this extremity, caſt his eye on the
Damoſell, and his heart on her, whoſe obſtinacy cauſed him to
die with griefe, entring into theſe ſpéeches. If this aduenture
be of a truth, then I pray you my Lady, henceforth to excuſe the
fearfulneſſe of him, who dares not preſume to think what is in
your mind. So receiuing the Cup, it contained the ſame qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,

could not exceede farther.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour being very glad, tooke the Cup to prooue the

<hi>Florian)</hi> make triall thereof no more, for he hath ſo little deſire,
to kéepe his loue faithfull to any Lady, that the Cup in his hand
will ſtand in great danger, at which pretty triump, the Ladyes
conceiued good occaſion of laughter.</p>

Then the Emperour commanded, that al the knights ſhould
take the Cup againe, but their labour was in vaine, for it neuer
ſéemed to alter the colour, wherefore the Empreſſe tooke it, and
beheld the Emperour ſo perfectly in it, as if ſhe had verily ſéene
his face. After the Empreſſe, came <hi>Gridonia</hi> and <hi>Bazilia,</hi>
wherin they ſaw them that they chiefly eſtéemed, but when the
Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda</hi> took it, ſhe perceiued the noble <hi>Palmerin</hi> of
<hi>England</hi> in ſuch heauines, that (not able to endure his extreame
grieuous countenance) ſhe deliuered the Cup from her, fearing
to let it fall, her hand ſhaked ſo maruelouſly. But none knew
what was the cauſe thereof, except the Emperour, whoſe amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
youthfull time gaue him occaſion to thinke, that ſhee had
ſéene ſome one in the Cup, who greatly deſired to doe her ſeruice
which made him to round her in the eare, ſaying: Faire Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
you make mee iudge that you want a ſeruant. At which
words ſhe began ſo ſweetely to bluſh, that with her rare beauty
it gaue her an excellent colour, whereat the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>
became more and more afflicted.</p>
                     <p>The cup paſſed from hand to hand, till it came againe to the
Prince <hi>Palmeriu,</hi> who beholding in it the ſwéet face of his faire
<hi>Polinarda,</hi> tooke occaſion to ſpeake in this maner to himſelfe.
My gratious Lady, I very well perceiue by your countenance,
that you haue not forgotten him, who was only borne to do you
ſeruice, yet doth the miſerie of his time, conſtraine him to liue
without hope, deſiring nothing elſe but to accompliſh your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
Then he deliuered the Cup to his Brother <hi>Florian,</hi> who
beheld in the bottome of the teares, the Princes <hi>Araalte</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre,</hi>
and the faire <hi>Targiana,</hi> as alſo many other Ladies, who
were as greatly offended with him, as were theſe twain whom
he had deceiued, wherefore the Damoſell taking the Cup from
him, ſaid. Doe you now (Sir Knight) behold the iſſue of your
vnfaithfull Loue (whereto he preſently ſhaped this anſwere.
It ſéemeth that your ſex canno hartily fauour the Knights that
oweth them moſt affection, which maketh many not force of
their conſtancy to you, but yet thus much I dare aſſure you,
that Ladies, both haue and ſhall be a great deale better ſecured

and to whom it hath ſhowne more fauour then to me.</p>
                     <p>The damoſell making him no anſwere, turned to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,

be made, of thoſe that are moſt and chiefeſt beloued: wherein
(credit me) you will receiue great pleaſure. Agréed (quoth the
Emperour) and I intend my ſelfe to mak triall firſt, for ſo ſhal
I perceiue, that being but ſlenderly fauoured of the Empreſſe,
I haue loſt the power to end the aduenture. So holding the
Cup, it remained in the ſame order ſtill, without any change or
apparance of heate: wherefore the Damoſell ſaid. My Lord,
you muſt confeſſe your ſelfe, that your time is paſt, and therefore
deliuer the Cup to the Empreſſe, who hath ſo truly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
loued you.</p>
                     <p>In the Empreſſe hand it continued to ſtill, wherfore <hi>Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon</hi>
and the King <hi>Polendos,</hi> who being faithfully beloued of
their Ladies, made the cup ſtill to containe the chiefe brightnes.
After theſe two Princes, <hi>Don Roſuell</hi> aduanced himſelfe to
make triall at his Loue, which was ſo little, that the heate the
Cup contained, vrged him to deliuer it to the Prince <hi>Platir,</hi>
who found it not altogether ſo hot, as when <hi>Don Roſuell</hi> had
it. It paſſed the hands of them all, ſome with good hap, &amp; ſome
with ill, till it came againe to the Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> but he paſſed
it as lightly as the other, becauſe his heart was exempted frée
from any Louers griefe. From him <hi>Albayzar</hi> tooke it, whom
Loue fauored ſo much, that he held it a great while. Then came
the turne of the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> whoſe hap proued worſe
then all the reſt: for the Cup was ſo enflamed round about him,
that it ſéethed euen as water doth vpon the fire, which cauſed

had the patience to abide it. For now he verily thought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumate
his daies, and that the vexation of his life, ſhould end by
this ſupportable meane, which made him that he would not let
go the Cup, but kept it ſo conſtantly, that euery one thought
there was no remedy but death.</p>
                     <p>Truſt me (ſaid the Damoſell) the vnfained loue of ſo true a
knight, deſerueth not to be rewarded with ſo ſharp a reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence:
and with theſe words ſhe offered to take the Cup from him, but
<pb facs="tcp:13179:199" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he gaue backe, anſwering her thus. Faire Ladie, I deſire you
to ſuffer me abide the doome, which my miſhap hath alway or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined
for me, and wherein I may end the troubles that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
to a mourning and continual diſpairing life. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
not able to abide ſo great crueltie executed in his preſence,
aroſe &amp; caught the cup from him, which was immediatly quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
as though it had neuer bin ſo violent, whereat he receiued
no ſmall cauſe of amazemen. Then the prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> albeit
he was weake, yet deſirous to be partner in conſtancy with the
<hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> receiued the Cuppe from the hand of the
Emperour, when preſently the rigour that the Princes <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garda</hi>
vſed towards him, cauſed him to ſuffer the ſelfe ſame tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as did the noble Prince <hi>Palmerin.</hi> For the flame which
aroſe out of the cup, had ſo inuironed the body of the prince, that
he was ſéene ſighing and lamenting in the midſt thereof, which
mooued all the Ladies to ſhed aboundance of teares, and to vſe
many extreame words againſt the cruelty of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> which
<hi>Florendos</hi> (though he were in the midſt of the flame) could
hardly ſuffer to hear her blamed, for whoſe ſake he was ready to
make a ſacrifice of himſelfe. The Emperor ſéeing many meanes
applied to quench the flame, yet none of them all had the power
to preuaile, put himſelfe in the midſt thereof, and tooke the Cup
from <hi>Florendos,</hi> thinking that then it would preſently bequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched:
but all their labor was to no effect, for the flame continued
about him as it did before. The Empreſſe <hi>Gridonia,</hi> with al the
lad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

maruailous to heare the noyſe that was made: at which grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
ſpectacle, <hi>Polendos</hi> the king of <hi>Theſſalie,</hi> came to the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell
of <hi>Thrace</hi> with theſe words. I deſire you, faire Lady,
ſéeing you haue found the thing you ſought for, that you would
vouchſafe the courteſie, to ſuccour the dangerous caſe of the
Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> I am ſo agrieued (quoth the damoſel) at this
great tumult which is made, wherein they wil not vouchſafe to
heare me, that I know not what to ſay: but doe you giue order
to appeaſe this murmuring, &amp; I wil work the meane to deliuer
the Prince from danger. By the Emperours commaundement
the diſturbance was quieted: when the Damoſell preſented her
<pb facs="tcp:13179:200" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſelfe before the Emperor, ſaying. I aduertiſe you moſt dread and
gratious Emperor, that the adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture of the Cup is already paſt
and finiſhed: but the flame which doth compaſſe the prince <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendos,</hi>
can no way be extinguiſhed, but only by the vertue that
conſiſteth in the teares, which by the hand of the Knight, who
hath ended the Enchantment of the Cup, muſt be ſprinckled on
the flame wherein he is encloſed, and then I dare aſſure you the
prince ſhall be brought into his former eſtate. For the fire being
ingendred, by ſuch a cruell woman as he loueth, cannot be any
way quenched, but onely by the teares of ſuch a pitiful Lady, as
was this conſtant and faithfull <hi>Brandiſia.</hi> Then ſhe deliuered
the Cup to the <hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> who put his fingers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and ſprinckled a few of the teares vpon <hi>Florendos:</hi> when
preſently the fire vaniſhed away, leauing <hi>Florendos</hi> (whom all
men thought verily to be dead) aliue and in good eſtate, to the
great content of the Emperour and all the company.</p>

On a ſudden there entred the Hal a Lady, accompanied with
three mighty and ougly Giants, whoſe Armour was of on co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and faſhion, their Helmets being carried after them by thrée
men, ſo that their ſwart and euill fauoured faces, cauſed the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to tremble, as alſo many of the Knightes to change their

the middeſt of the Knightes, aduancing themſelues before the
Emperour, without ſhewing any courteſie or reuerence, where
they ſtayed, for that the Damoſell had in charge to declare: who
ſéeing ſo great Nobilitie about the Emperour, was ſomewhat
offended, yet notwithſtanding, ſhe ſeaſed her fury, and began in
this order.</p>
                     <p>I perceiue right noble Emperour, that the renowne which is
blazed all the world our, of your Princely Court, is too little,
reſpecting the honourable company I ſee at this preſent, which
vrgeth me to enter into due land therof, as it hath rightly &amp; iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſerueth: ſo that I am of the opinion, you might ſubdue &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uern
the whole world, if you would diſtribute your force, which
as I iudge, is no way able to be matched. But yet fortune who
in all your affaires hath hitherto proſpered you, may now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
(as enuious at your long quiet &amp; peaceable felicity) turne
her backe towards you, &amp; ſo ſuddenly in her fury ouerturne your
good Fortune, that the glory you haue gained in the prime of
your yeeres, may now be defaced, when your aged eſtate forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
you to follow the trauaile of Armes, and your long hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
vnwilling to enter the warres, wherewith I come to
ſummon you, from the <hi>Soldane</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> principal Captaine of
the Law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as alſo from the great <hi>Turk,</hi> and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> noble
Gouernours of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey belonging to the <hi>Soldane</hi> of <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
named <hi>Albayzar,</hi> who in ſtrange aduentures, hath put
himſelfe to make triall of his valour, vpon hope of long expected
good Fortune. From all theſe before named, I am to let you
vnderſtand, that when time was, there were certaine Heathen
Princes, here ſlaine before the walls of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whoſe
death hath vrged them to great impatience, and to ſéeke reuenge
for the great wrong you haue offered them. But the Gods, the
protectors and defendor of your welfare, fauouring you beyond
<pb facs="tcp:13179:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their expectation, haue heretofore hindred the determination of
theſe Princes: for when they were prepared to the ruine of your
kingdomes, and vtterly to race out your fame &amp; memorie, there
hath ſuch quarrels and ſeditions ſprung vp amongſt them, that
they haue murthered one another, which happening many and
ſundrie times, hath not ſuffered them to put their pretence in
execution. Wherefore, to auoid any more ſuch miſchance, as
alſo to fauour you in the euil which may happen: they haue ſent
vs to your Highneſſe with certaine conditions, the performing
whereof, ſhall end all hatred, and ioyntly ioyne them as your
continuall friends.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that you ſhall ſend <hi>Polinarda,</hi> Daughter to the
Prince <hi>Primaleon</hi> your ſonne, to the <hi>Soldane</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> aged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
xxv, yéeres: a Prince as much renowned, as he is puiſſant
and incomparable in riches, to whom ſhee ſhall bee eſpouſed as
beſéemeth ſuch a noble Prince. The ſecond, that <hi>Florandos</hi> his
Sonne, ſhall promiſe to marry with <hi>Armenia,</hi> Daughter to
the <hi>Soldane</hi> before named, who is a Princeſſe of ſuch ſingular
heauty, that ſhee is thought to excell all Ladies liuing on the
earth. To her Dowrie, the <hi>Soldane</hi> will giue all the title hée
hath in theſe parts about your Empire, without deſiring any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
recompence, on the behalfe of the faire <hi>Polinarda:</hi> but onely
that it might ſtand with your pleaſure, to ſend to the great <hi>Turk</hi>
a <hi>Chriſtian Knight,</hi> who as I remember is named <hi>Florian</hi> of
the <hi>Deſart,</hi> for that by his deceit, he hath brought his Daughter
<hi>Tragiana</hi> from thence into your Court: whoſe mariage he hath
already prouided, to the Prince <hi>Albayzar,</hi> now <hi>Soldan</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
becauſe the <hi>Soldane</hi> his Father is lately deceaſed. Thus
haue I reported the whole ſumme of my Ambaſſage, attending
how your Highneſſe ſhall anſwere the ſame: and if you wil not
agrée with the Heathen princes, theſe Giant haue in charge
to tell you that, which perhappes may enforce you to a greater
maruell.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour hauing noted the words of the Damoſell,
ſmiling thereat, began to ſay. Truly Lady, I deſire to heare
what the Giants muſt report, becauſe perhappes I ſhall haue a
better opinion of their words, then of thoſe which here you haue
<pb facs="tcp:13179:201" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſpoken. As concerning the amitie which your Princeſſe requeſt
with me, the conditions are lincked to ſo many contraries, that
I rather chuſe perpetuall warre, wherein my ſelfe, my friendes
and ſubiects will more willingly die, then to hold league with
them in any ſuch order. And for the Knight whom you requeſt
to haue, I am altogether ignorant where he abideth: but if hée
were here preſent in my Court, I would not ſuffer him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
any iniury, and I perſwade my ſelfe, as the Princeſſe <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana,</hi>
is rather come hither with her will, then by any compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that hath béene vſed to her. No other anſwere haue I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to giue you: wherefore, let your knights declare what
they haue in commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>With that, one of the Giants aduanced himſelfe before the
Emperour, and very vnreuerently entred into theſe ſpéeches.
The Heathen Princes, whoſe iuſt &amp; law full requeſt you thinke
ſcorne to grant: by me doe ſend defiance to thée, and to all that
dare vndertake, by any meane or motion to offer thée ſuccour.</p>
                     <p>Yea, I pronounce open warre againſt thée, and on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
call my gods for my record: that we not onely intend thy

                     <p>I ſée (Gentlemen) ſuch a cholericke humour ariſe in you, that

thinke it ſhame to enter the fight with you you. While the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror

ſo incenſed with anger, that hee could not content himſelfe to

them all, turning to the Emperour on this wiſe.</p>
                     <p>Moſt high and mightie Emperour, the great benignity and
courteſie of Princes, is often an occaſion to encourage a wilful
offendor: euen ſo, the lenity of your noble heart, with the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

The Giants hearing him to confeſſe, that he had brought the

that they deſired the place might be aſſigned, where they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently

With theſe words, they all mounted on horſebacke, and rode

But ſhe ſéeth full well my griefe, and couereth her ſelfe with
ſuch a cloſe conceit, that ſhe will not ſéeme to know it: onely
becauſe ſhe is either daintie of her courteſie, or elſe thinketh
ſcorne to recompence my trauell. I deſire you to beare witneſſe

<hi>Leonarda,</hi> the heire and princes of <hi>Thrace,</hi> whoſe loue (I feare

inconſtant of faith, or negligent in promiſe: for which cauſe I
haue the greater deſire to ſpeake with the princeſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi>

                     <p>Well, quoth ſhe, if your conſtancie be ſuch as you report, I
thinke in ſo ſmall a matter, it will not be changed. But as for
ſpeaking with my Lady, I know at this time it is vnpoſſible:
wherfore, for a further triall of your truth, prepare your ſelfe to
depart with the Damoſell of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and in your abſence I wil

Truſt me (quoth <hi>Polendos)</hi> our hope would ſtand in hard

eſtéeme it more honour, to end our liues in the face of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

hereupon aſſure thy ſelfe, that the Emperour would more glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leaue all the knights in his Court, then to ſatiſfie thy deſire
with him, who is one of the moſt hardy and nobleſt knights on
the earth, to whom likewiſe I wiſh as much good, as to mine

                     <p>At theſe words, the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana</hi> caſt her ſelfe on her
knées before her Father, deſiring him not to vſe ſuch cruelty to
them, who had done her ſo much honor in the Emperors court,
as alſo deliuered her in the peril of her life, being dangerouſly
aſſaulted as they came in the voyage. The <hi>Turke</hi> ſeeing how
imporunate his Daughter was on him, in a great anger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayed
himſelf forth againe, becauſe he would not ſée the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

gone, intreated the king <hi>Polendos</hi> and his company, that
they would ſuffer themſelues to remaine as Priſoners, and not
to abide the danger, if they ſhould offer reſiſtance, being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and hauing nothing to defend them withal. And during the
time they were in priſon, ſhe would either deuiſe or accompliſh
ſuch meanes, as ſhe had no doubt but to purchaſe their liberty.
Vpon this good perſwaſion they yeelded themſelues, when they
were preſently carryed into a deepe dungeon in a ſtrong tower,
and there were laded with as many irons as they could poſſible
beare, whereat <hi>Targiana</hi> receiued great griefe, cloathing her
ſelfe in mourning apparell, and would neuer ſhew any merry
countenance, during the time the Knights were in Priſon,
where they remained a long time, as you ſhall reade in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

                     <p>The <hi>Turke</hi> commanded the Chriſtian Galleys to be kept in
ſafe and ſure protection, and preſently ſent word to the <hi>Soldane</hi>
of <hi>Perſia</hi> with all the other Princes, how he had diuers of the
Emperours knights priſoners, on whom he determined ſharp
<pb facs="tcp:13179:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reuenge, for the great iniury which <hi>Florian</hi> of the <hi>Deſart</hi> had
done him. Theſe newes they eſtéemed very ſtrange, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
being very fearefull any way to diſpleaſe him, they made
reſemblance of a good opinion in this matter, giuing him coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell

whom elſe the Emperour might cauſe to be ſlaine.</p>
                     <p>The great <hi>Turke</hi> truſted very much on their deuiſe, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the captiue Princes, that they might ſend their Eſquires
to the Emperour <hi>Palmerin,</hi> to aduertiſe him of the miſerie
wherein they remained, but the Eſquires by no meanes
would forſake their Maiſters, deſiring, as they had accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
them in proſperity, ſo not to leaue them now in this great
miſchance.</p>
                     <p>Which when <hi>Belcar</hi> perceiued, he commanded his Eſquire,
to go and certerfie the Emperour, what great miſhap had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>follen

theſe newes were nothing welcome to the Emperor, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>Primaleon,</hi> who before him entred into theſe words.
My gratious Lord and father, this miſchance is onely procured
by your meanes, for that you dealt ſo courteouſly with them,
who had neither quality nor any motion of deſert in them. But
now I would gladly ſée, what thing you can accompliſh any
way to pleaſure them, for I iudge, that all your power is not
ſufficient to deliuer them from the bondage wherein they are.
Wherfore I thinke it beſt, that you ſend with all ſpéed to ſéeke
the prince <hi>Albayzar,</hi> through whom you may recouer the king
<hi>Polendos</hi> and your knights, other way I cannot perceiue, that
may pleaſure them or profite you.</p>
                     <p>My Sonne (anſwered the Emperour) if the impriſonment
of <hi>Polendos</hi> and my knights were perpetuall, I would not
ſéeke to ſet them at liberty by this meane, for I had rather
they ſhould enioy the death, then to accompliſh that which
might be my continuall reproach, for this difference I alway
craue, betweene me and all the world that the good may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
diſcerned from the euill. <hi>Albayzer</hi> is not guilty in the
iniury which the <hi>Turke</hi> doeth ſéeme to offer my Knightes:
<pb facs="tcp:13179:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore it were againſt honour, that he ſhould ſuffer for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
offence, but this is it whereat I am moſt amazed, that
<hi>Targiana</hi> will ſuffer this great diſcourteſie, conſidering the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

                     <p>The Lady at theſe words fell into a great rage, and as though

One of the chéefe knights that kept him company, preſented
himſelfe to him in this manner. Moſt worthy Sir, to whom
Fortune hath alway béene ſo great a Friend, that no danger or
diſtreſſe could offer to diſmay you, ſéeme not now to diſcourage
your ſelfe in this aduenture, for your accuſtomed proſperity, can
not forſake you at this preſent. Yet ſometime a raw procéeding
returneth an vnexpected and vndeſerued puniſhment: but as
this caſe ſtandeth, your noble ſelfe accompanied with ſo great
aduiſed care, cannot moue a foote further then vertue ſhall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
your ſafety. Pardon me good Sir, if I haue béene ouer la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſh
in my ſpéech, which I intended to no other iſſue, but onely
to aduertiſe you, that this aduenture is perillous, and therefore
craueth the more héed, and that a friendly admoniſhment, is
better then too late repentance?</p>
                     <p>Sir, anſwered <hi>Palmerin,</hi> your counſaile, ſhewing ſo great
grauity and foreſight, I eſtéeme a great deale more then at this
time I will vtter: for if Fortune ſpéede me in this enterpriſe,
I will not be vnmindfull of your friendly good will. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
preſented with ſo great humanitie, enflamed a ſuddaine
enuy in the hearts of ſome there preſent, who for the hope they
had to ſée him king, began to enter into more diſſembling pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
then any true or faithfull ſubiect would ſéeme to offer. For
they began to perſwade him, that no aduenture, how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
ſoeuer it proued, might attaine the power to aſtoniſh his
perſon: but he declining from ſuch vainglorious prayſes, as
was the dayly gifts and workes of flatterers, courteouſſy tooke
his leaue of them all, and ſet ſpurs to his Horſe, riding towards
his determination.</p>
                     <p>An example ſurely worthy of great praiſe to all Princes
and rulers liuing on the earth, that they ſhould not incline
and leane to ſuch, who onely ſtudy with ſwéete words, flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

and the vicious rightfully for euer reproched, then would
not the plaine dealer, be gouerned by ſuch as haue béene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
but the good ſhould be openly diſcerned from the euill, and
all enioy one hope for a continuall quiet: but to our matter,
<hi>Palmerin</hi> being come ſomewhat neare the place, the light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to darken, the Ayre to be maruellouſly troubled, and
miſtie, ſo that the Lords of <hi>Thrace</hi> were ouercome with ſuch
feare, that ſome fell beſide their Horſes, ſome hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
very ſore, and they all made haſt to the Citie as faſt as
they could, where tho darkeneſſe likewiſe was very terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Siluian,</hi> whom <hi>Palmerin</hi> had willed to ſtay behind him, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this ſuddaine feare, tooke ſuch courage that he would follow
his Maiſter, but the Enchantment would not ſuffer any to
enter there, ſaue onely the Knight, who had the power to ende
it: that <hi>Siluian</hi> was forced to returne to the Citie, where
hée found the people in a great aſtoniſhment, at that which
happened ſince the departure of <hi>Palmerin.</hi> Who remembring
the wordes of the ancient Knight, beganne to diſlike the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of ſharpe an euill, for he thought eaſily to finde the
way of this aduenture, but he was greatly deceiued, when hée
felt ſuch paine, as he ſuppoſed would haue rent him aſunder.
Likewiſe he thought not to finde any in this place, who had
the power to torment him, beyond the loue he bare to his lady:
but he found his expectation altered, when an inuiſible motion
diſmounted him from his Horſe, wherevpon in an anger hee
drewe his Swoord, thinking to preuaile againſt him that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrew
him, but ſéeing his blowes to be ſmitten againſt the
winde, he thought to mount on Horſebacke againe, and then to
ride forward.</p>
                     <p>But all his labour was in vaine, it was not poſſible for
him to finde his Horſe, but that which was more to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage,
not onely his Swoord was taken from him,
but likewiſe all his Armour was caught away on a ſuddaine,
and the darkeneſſe was ſo violent, that hée had not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
to goe forward, nor yet to goe backe againe, to the
place where he commaunded <hi>Siluian</hi> to tarrie.</p>

                     <p>Vpon this he heard a fearefull hollowe voyce, but looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

                     <p>Néere to him he eſpyed an olde withered Trée, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath

                     <p>But as they thought to cloſe together, a darke Cloude ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly

                     <p>Héereupon he looked how hée might diſcende downe, for the

no other way, but to breake his necke, in this extremitie hée
committed himſelfe to God, and afterward to his Miſtreſſe
he beganne in this manner. Madame, it is not the loſſe of life
which appaleth me, but the hope of your fauour that ſuſtaineth
me in doubte, but if I well conſider with my ſelfe, the ending

ground from the top, which was ſo ſlender and rotten, that hée
thought it not able to abide the waight of his Armour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
to make himſelf the lighter, he determined to leaue his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
there, yet not knowing what occaſion he ſhould haue to vſe
it, when he ſhould come to the top of the Rocke, he bound
himſelfe about the middle with the Rope, when preſently hée
was pulde vp with maruailous ſpeede, and when he was at
the toppe, he could not perceiue them that had drawne him vp.
Then he knew he was in the Field where the beaſts were
ſlaine, and that euery thing the Enchauntment preſented to
him, was for no other cauſe but to abate his courage: where
fore, he addicted himſelfe ſo aduenturous, that all the feare in the
world, had not the power to diſmay him.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or all that night, <hi>Palmerin</hi> reſted himſelfe
vnder a Trée, and in the morning he beheld
the Towers very brauely: wherefore he
walked on, and at laſt eſpied his Horſe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a Trée, in no worſe caſe then when he
left him. So mounting vpon him, he rode
a little further, where hee met with two
Knights, who without any words, couched
their ſpeares againſt him: the firſt receiued vpon his Shield,
and the Knights preſently vaniſhed away: the ſecond burſt his
Lance vpon him, whervpon <hi>Palmerin</hi> followed him, to requite
him with a blow of his ſword, but he loſt the ſight of him, in like
maner as he did of the other knight.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Palmerin</hi> looking about, eſpied a man readie to draw
a Bridge, which was the paſſage ouer a water, which made
him to gallop thither apace, ſo that he entred the gate before he
had the power to locke it. When he-ſawe himſelfe in ſo faire
a Caſtle, he aduanced himſelfe to ſée the brauerie of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
but two Giants came and laid at him with their Maces,
ſo that he was enforced to fall on the ground, but recouering
himſelfe, &amp; thinking to faſten halfe a good blowes on them,
they were gone, nothing remaining before him but a great
ſmoake.</p>
                     <p>This cauſed him, to make the leſſe eſtimation of any thing
<pb facs="tcp:13179:216" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that chaunced, and whatſoeuer reſiſted him, hee would but
little force of, ſo comming into the Court of the Caſtell, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
a little gate on high in the wall, whereto he muſt aſcend
by a paire of ſtaires, ſo narrow and dangerous, that a man
would haue hardly truſted himſelfe on them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin,</hi> deſirous to ſée the ende of his labours, aduentured
to goe vp vpon them, and when he was on the middle ſteppe,
all the walles about him beganne to ſhake very vehemently, ſo
that <hi>Palmerin</hi> doubted the whole Caſtell would fall vpon him,
and till came to the top of the ſtaires the Enchantment la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
where he was no ſooner come, but a general terror did ſhew
the Enchantment to be fully ended.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> entring through that little doore, came into a darke
entrie, where there was a great gate, made faſt with great
Lockes and boltes of Iron, and hard by the gate lay a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Serpent, whoſe horrible bigneſſe and oughly forme, made
the Prince to be greatly amazed, about whoſe necke vpon
a Chaine, was hanged the Keyes that ſhould open the
gate.</p>
                     <p>The Prince knewe not how to paſſe this gate, except he
might winns the Keyes from ſo terrible a Porter, whom hee
charged with many noble ſtrokes, and the Serpent breathed
ſuch horrible veneme and ſmoke, hauing the Princes Swoord
in one of his noſtrilles: that with a terrible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

through one of the windowes. The people ſéeing it flye ouer the
Cittie, which made them iudge, that <hi>Palmerin</hi> as then was in
ſome painefull trauaile, for whoſe good ſucceſſe they prayed very
often.</p>
                     <p>When he ſaw the Serpent was gone, he found the Keyes
on the ground, wherewith he vnlocked and opened the gate, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into ſo faire a Hall, that the <hi>Perilous Iſle,</hi> where <hi>Eutro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi>

by the King of <hi>Thrace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He walked all about, and found all things new to bee
<pb facs="tcp:13179:216" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in perfect eſtate, for that the Enchantment was fully finiſhed,
but at laſt he came to a Chamber, where he perceiued certaine
Damoſels talking, and by them ſtood an armed man, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
tooke pleaſure to conferre with the Damoſels.</p>
                     <p>The Prince loth to trouble them, entred into a verie faire
Garden, where on a gréene banke, by a faire Fountaine, he
beheld diuers Ladies of excellent beautie, but eſpecially, the
faire young Princeſſe <hi>Leonarda,</hi> who had no ſooner eſpied him
but ſhe came to him very courteouſly in this manner. Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
me Sir Knight, I finde my ſelfe ſo largely beholding to
you, that I cannot recompence you ſo nobly as you haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued,
but in time I ſhall endeuour my ſelfe to requite the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
bounty receiued at your hands, meane while, I
ſhall requeſt you, to accept my good will in ſatiſfaction of your
noble déedes, which are imprinted ſo déepe in my heart, that I
ſhall not faile to accompliſh, what your Proweſſe hath bound
me in.</p>
                     <p>My gratious Lady (anſwered <hi>Palmerin)</hi> the beauty which
Nature hath aboundantly adorned you withall, is ſufficient
to content the greateſt trauailes, attempted by the hardyeſt
Knight in the world: if ſo be Fortune had allowed him the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
to receiue ſo great a benefite of ſuch a gratious Lady.
But ſéeing the aduenture here ſo wonderfull, that theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
put them paſt into darke obliuion, I ſhall intreate you
to tell me, if I haue any greater danger to paſſe, then this
which it pleaſeth you to preſent before me, for truſt me I ſhall
diſpaire to accompliſh them, knowing right well, that the
hope of ſo rich a Treaſure, as is your beautie, ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
for the Knight who is indewed with greater Preweſſe
then my ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words procured a ſwéete bluſhing in the Princeſſe
face, whereof to be reſoued, ſhe replyed thus. I know not,
Sir Knight, what danger you ſuſtaine at this preſent, becauſe
all the dangers and hazards of the Caſtle, tooke end at ſuch
tune as you came into this Garden. But then to breake off
their talke, there came in the Lords and Gouernours of the
<pb facs="tcp:13179:217" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Citty, who ſéeing the Serpent fly ouer the Citty, which they
knew very well to be the end of the Enchantment, they came
with great Maieſty riding to the Caſtle, where comming into
the Garden, they humbled themſelues on their knées before the
Princeſſe <hi>Leonarda,</hi> offering likewiſe to kiſſe the hand of the
noble <hi>Palmerin,</hi> which he would not ſuffer: but receiued them
courteouſly as his friends and companions. The Quéene <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melia</hi>
ſent a Coach to the Caſtle, wherein the Princeſſe. <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narda</hi>
was brought to the Pallace of her Vnckle, who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
her as became her high eſtate and dignity: and the Prince
<hi>Palmerin</hi> likewiſe they vſed great honour and Princely obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance,
but when he came to the Camber, he found there <hi>Siluian</hi>
who was not a little glad to ſée his Lord ſo ſauely returned.</p>

The words of the Damoſell, ſéemed very reaſon able to the
Duke and his company, but ſéeing they could obtaine no other
anſwere of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> they returned againe to the Quéene <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melia,</hi>
concluding, that he ſhould giue a noble Lord to enioy the

                     <p>I account this honour (worthy Gentlemen) the greateſt that
euer fortune could ſent me, in ſuffering your Princeſſe to ioyne
in Marriage according to my minde: and therefore thus aſſure
yourſelues, that I ſhall beſtew ſuch a Prince vpon her, as both
ſhe and you ſhall be contented to receiue.</p>
                     <p>The Lords of <hi>Thrace</hi> gaue him very harty thankes, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his anſwere to the Queene <hi>Carmelia,</hi> who made ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation

ſomewhat offended, and would haue fallen into anger, had not
the Damoſell of <hi>Thrace</hi> vſed theſe words vnto her.</p>
                     <p>Faire Princeſſe, me thinkes you ſhould not thinke ſo ill, of
the conſtant faith and loyaltie of the Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who wil
kéepe his vowe he hath made to her, which perhaps is nothing
inferior to you in beauty and wealth: and this I can aſſure you,
that <hi>Palmerin</hi> hath a brother, a Prince ſo ſaire and vertuous in
all his déedes, as if he ioyne you in marriage with him, I know
you will gladly held your ſelfe content.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſell vſed her perſwaſions ſo well, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<hi>Leonarda</hi> was very well pleaſed: of whom <hi>Palmerin</hi> tooke

                     <p>And if you thinke it good, that I might cauſe her to be brought

For that I perſwade me, he would ſo wel entertaine her, as the

                     <p>Madame ſaide <hi>Palmerin,</hi> I aſſure you, the Emperour will

ſith all their skill would not ſerue to aſſwage my
<pb facs="tcp:13179:223"/>

ſoone to my health.</p>
                  <p>By this example may be gathered (right worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
how neceſſary it is (oftentimes) to reade Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which in the iudgement of the wiſe are eſteemed as
healthfull to the mind, as Phiſick is accounted holeſome
for the body: yea, oftentimes more, for that the ſodaine
inward conceit of delight (wherewith Hiſtories are plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
enriched) may ſooner breake and qualifie the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity
of a painfull diſeaſe, then the long and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
applying of Phyſicall receipts. Yet, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
the one, nor extoll the other more then it deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
I allow of both very well: but I muſt needs thus
confeſſe with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that Hiſtory is the Schoolemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe
of Princes, and the onely Trumpet that ſoundeth
in the eares of all noble perſonages, the famous deeds of
their worthy progenitors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plato</hi> likewiſe affirmeth, that the name of Hiſtory was
giuen to this end, that by recording matters of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
our fleeting memories might be ſtayed, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
would ſoone be loſt and retaine little.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then (right worſhipfull) that Hiſtories carry
ſuch credite among the learned ſort, and haue not bene
a little eſteemed of both Emperours, kings, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

happily brought to the end the cruell en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment,
wherein the faire <hi>Leonarda</hi>
Princeſſe of <hi>Thrace,</hi> was long time detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and hauing ſtaied long in that realme,
he concluded to take his leaue of the Quéene <hi>Carmelia,</hi> and the

to hinder him from his voyage to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
whoſe walles was incloſed the ineſtimable treaſure of his
knightly and loyall minde, which indéede was the faire
Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi> the ſoueraigntie of whoſe beautie was
of ſuch power, as made him refuſe the Crowne of <hi>Thrace,</hi>
which was preſented vnto him, (according as the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi>
made rehearſall before theſe famous aduentures) by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
noble Gentlemen throughout the realme of <hi>Thrace,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:225"/>
who hartily deſired if it might be poſſible, that the noble <hi>Palme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> (whoſe honeſtie, valour and Knightly cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie
was agréeable together) ſhould fulfill the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their King <hi>Sardament,</hi> which they would haue béene
very loth to contrary, had he thereto conſented. But <hi>Palmerin</hi>
made knowne his minde and ſecret intent, as well vnto them
as alſo to the Princeſſe, both what he intended, and what hée
would ſée eſpecially performed, wheron his honor ſhould ſtand
for a warrant, which they in the end gratefully accepting, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
themſelues, to take their farewell of him, and he framing
the like toward the Quéene, the Princeſſe, and them all, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a princely conge, and rode on in a thouſand thoughts
toward <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> bearing his aforenamed deuiſe of the
<hi>Tiger</hi> in his ſhield, where, to his proſperous iourney we will
leaue him a while, and returne to the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> ſon to
the noble <hi>Primaleon,</hi> who hauing ſlaine <hi>Aſtribor,</hi> and giuen li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to the Lady that was priſoner in his Caſtell, departed on
his iourney with <hi>Albayzar,</hi> in whoſe company he paſſed the
Realme of <hi>France,</hi> without any deſire to approach the Court,
becauſe he doubted if the King and the Quéene <hi>Melicia,</hi> knewe
of his being there, they would ſtay him longer then he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
would.</p>
                     <p>Therefore continuing on his way, he entred the kingdome
of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> wherein when theſe two worthy Knights had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed
two dayes, at length they entred into a faire and goodly
Valley, through the middeſt whereof there ran a pleaſant Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
which had diuerſe ſorts of trées planted about it, very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
to the beholders. The ſight hereof greatly reuiued the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue
minde of the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> who could not bridle his
thoughts from the remembrance of the Caſtell of the Giant
<hi>Almaroll,</hi> wherein the Iewell of his happineſſe remained, and

                     <p>They had not long trauailed in this pleaſant Valley, but
within a while (to their greater delight) they eſpied by the Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſide, a ſtrong and well fortified Caſtell, whereto as they
were about to aduance themſelues, they beheld a Damoſell
<pb facs="tcp:13179:225"/>
(accompanied with two Eſquiers who were on foote) prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
herſelfe towards them, to méete them: which <hi>Florendos</hi>
perceiuing, and knowing himſelfe to be armed if the worſt
ſhould happen, he gaue forth himſelfe nobly to méet them, to
whom the Damoſell ſpake after this ſort.</p>
                     <p>Sir knight, the faire <hi>Arnalte,</hi> Princeſſe of <hi>Nauarre</hi> my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
and Miſtreſſe, commaundeth you, in reſpect of the daunger
that may happen vnto you by this aduenture, that you faile not
to accompliſh one of theſe thrée conditions wherewith I ſhall
preſent you. The firſt is, that you muſt returne vnto the place
from whence you now came, where you ſhal ſweare, that ſhe is
the onely Princeſſe of beautie in the whole world. Secondly,
that you muſt enter Combat all the way as you ryde, with any
that dare maintaine the contrarie. Or if you will not accept of
theſe two conditions, you ſhall then make promiſe, that you
will neuer beare Armes in any cauſe, wherein knighthood may
be witneſſed, or you merite renowne by any ſuch enterpriſe,
neither on the behalfe of any diſtreſſed Lady, or in triall of your
knightly loyaltie.</p>
                     <p>Thus Gentlemen, if you cannot put on the minds to ſatiſfie
my Ladies will, you muſt hazard your ſelues to endure the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
perils contained within this Valley: wherein, if either
your cunning faile you, or the ſufficiencie of her noble demaund
foile you, you muſt content your ſelues to abide perpetuall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
wherin nothing will be ſo bitter vnto you as life,
and nothing better vnto you then preſent death: this is héere
prouided for thoſe, who dare endue themſelues with the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
to refuſe to obey the conditions I haue tolde you. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Gentlemen, if you will follow my aduiſe, I would counſel
you to take your oath in maintenance of her beauty, which can
no way impeach you of diſhonour, or diminiſh any iote of your
knightly valour, conſidering you ſhall iuſtifie nothing but a
truth, wherin you can neuer faile, and rid your ſelues of a great
deale of trouble, which ſurely to knights is an infamous blot:
for I aſſure you, ſuch as fall into the daunger through their
owne folly, may well ſit and repent their extreme miſhaps <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Faire Damoſell (aunſwered <hi>Florendos)</hi> I take in verie
great diſdaine what your Miſtreſſe commaundeth me, in reſpect
of her vaine glorious requeſt, and for that my Knighthood ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vppon better regarde: and this I aſſure you, that I take
leſſe pleaſure in your counſell, then I dread the perill in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
your Ladies claime: this alwaies conſidered, that her
conditions are ſuch, as ſhe may neither demande, nor I defend.
Yet to aduantage me the more, I would requeſt, if you would
doe me ſo much fauour as to declare, to what ende this ſtately
enterpriſe of your Lady tendeth: for it ſéemeth immodeſt in her
to wil ſo much, and I ſhould ſhew my ſelfe very vnmannerly
to thruſt my ſelfe into ſuch vnreuerent ſeruice.</p>
                     <p>I promiſe you ſir Knight (aunſwered the Damoſell) the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe
is ſo full of doubt vnto the hardieſt Knightes, as it is
conuenient that firſt we ſhould receiue their oathes, before wée
diſcouer to them the will of the Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte,</hi> whereof if
they ſhould be acquainted before hand, they would not aduance
themſelues to promiſe any thing. And if it chance that my Lady
compell them to yéelde by méere conſtraint, they ſhall beare but
bad eſtates when they depart out of her hands, becauſe ſhe was
ſo gentle to y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>queſt, and they ſo daintie in making promiſe.</p>
                     <p>Damoſell (quoth <hi>Florendos)</hi> I very well perceiue the ſcope
of your meaning, how with threatning words of enſuing dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
you would bring me like a yong Nouice to that, which your
Lady would haue me ſo gladly performe: but ſurely I am not
ſo childiſh as to ſatiſfie her minde, by promiſing any one of the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions you haue rehearſed, for I rather deſire to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt difficult dangers, wherewith you ſéem ſo much
to menace me, and whereto I very willingly giue my conſent,
rather then I will be ſo baſe minded as to accompliſh her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
and ſo you may depart and tell her. The Damoſel
with this aunſwere returned to the Caſtell of her Ladie, from
whence in ſhort ſpace after, came forth ſix knights very gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mounted and armed, and bearing their Launces downward,
approched to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> to whom they deliuered forth
theſe ſpéeches. Sir knight, it is thought good by our lady and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> you ſhould vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d at this preſent, the danger which
<pb facs="tcp:13179:226" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the ancient cuſtome vſed in this place, doth bring all Knights
into, that dare ſéeme to denie it, and for that our Lady hath béen
ſo courteous as to demand, and thou ſo impudent as thou wilt
néedes deny, thou ſhalt well know that we may, can, and will
compel thée. Few words and ſwéet (anſwered <hi>Florendos)</hi> your
Lady may do much, but not command: you as much, but not
compell, and for my ſelfe, I will neither command nor compell,
but bid you hartily welcome to what you dare doe. At theſe
wordes they gaue the ſpurres to their Horſes, and all ſixe fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their carire againſt the good and hardy Knight <hi>Florendos,</hi>
who likewiſe prepared himſelfe to receiue them couragiouſly,
which in ſooth he did with ſuch knightly proweſſe, as at the firſt
he depriued one of them of his life, and in ſhort ſpace the other
were left deſtitute of their Lances. Then he began to take hart
a freſh, and ſetled himſelfe manfully toward the other fiue, to
endure the ſharpe charges wherewith they aſſaulted him. The
fight hereof mooued <hi>Albayzar</hi> to immeaſurable griefe, who
wiſhed that he were then ſo happie as to maintaine the cauſe
of that good Knight, for that he would reuenge the iniury which
the other vncourteouſly offered him, and which he perceiued to
be ſo great, as he wiſhed rather to be preſently voyd of life, then
to want his Armour in ſuch an extremity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Florendos</hi> enuironed on euery ſide with his enemies, knew
not well which way to ſhun the perril, but the moſt vnhappieſt
thing of all, one of the Horſes of one of the Knights, gaue him
ſuch a cruell ſtroke, as hee was conſtrained to fall to the earth.
But it was not long before he recouered his feete againe, when
preſently he tooke himſelfe to a Trée, to reſcew himſelfe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
from their mallice, which when the Knights perceiued,
they deliuered vnto him theſe ſpéeches. Syr Knight, this Tree
neither can nor ſhall defend you from our power, and therefore
it is very ſlender helpe for you to truſt vnto, wherefore wée
iudge it far better to render your ſelfe to the priſon of our Lady
and Miſtreſſe, then to ſuffer ſo great danger, as we ſee you in
by the great effuſe of your blood. I had much rather (anſwered
<hi>Florendos)</hi> endure the death, making an ample proofe of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
minde, then to render my ſelfe into the hands of ſuch cruell
<pb facs="tcp:13179:227" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and diſcourteous perſons as you are. Wherfore if you be Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
ordare conceiue ſo good an opinion of hardines in your
ſelues, do me the knightly fauour, as to let me deale with you
one after another, which is honeſty in me to requeſt, and honor
in you to grant. Otherwiſe, if you be ſo faint hearted of your
ſelues, as you dare not fight but altogether, then diſmount from
your horſes, and I will ſhew you how much the vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of a good knight is eſteemed, aboue the brutiſh manners of
the cowardly mind: whereunto one of the Knights preſently
thus replied.</p>
                     <p>I ſée no reaſon ſir, why you ſhould ſo much preſume on your
ſelfe, in that there is no one of vs, but thinketh himſelfe able e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
to compell you to ſubmit your ſelfe. But ſo little account
do we make of the vanquiſhing you, as we deale with you alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
rather to pleaſe the humor of the Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
for any diſhability in our ſelues to quite you man for man. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe,
ſéeing you haue ſuch a deſire as we ſhould come to
you on foote, we are content to giue ouer our horſes. Wherupon
they preſently alighted and came together to aſſail <hi>Florendos,</hi>
who receiued them very gladly, and behaued himſelfe toward
them ſo brauely, as in ſhort time they reputed that they left
their horſes. For <hi>Florendos</hi> had not long fought with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but
he diſcharged one of them of his life quickly, and continued his
deuoir ſo gallantly with his ſword toward the other foure,
as one after another, he ſent thrée more to kéepe the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
At length when <hi>Florendos</hi> had brought the laſt of them
into ſubiection, and was about to part his head from his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
the Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte</hi> ſuddenly came, accompan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ed with
her domoſels, deſirous to ſaue the life of the knight, wherupon
ſhe ſpake to <hi>Florendos</hi> after this manner.</p>
                     <p>Sir knight to the end that this great victory which you haue
atchéeued, may not call your name into diſhonor, by murdring
him who hath no power to defend himſelfe, I beſéech you that
you would giue me the life of this knight. And for the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie
you haue ſuffred by him and his fellows, amends may be
made in other maner, for I will put my ſelfe by way of duty, to
acompliſh any thing that it ſhall like you to ordaine, prouided
<pb facs="tcp:13179:227" rendition="simple:additions"/>
alwaies, that my honour and authority be no way impeached
therby. Madam (anſwered <hi>Florendos)</hi> why ſhould life be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a finger is not to be giuen to ſuch perſons, as ſo much
forget their owne honour, to imploy themſelues in ſuch vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
attempts: neuertheleſſe, your vertuous and honeſt ieſture
hath gained ſo much power ouer me, that I will not refuſe to
graunt you any thing, conditionally, that you will do me ſo
much honour, as to tel me the reaſon why you cauſe to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
this ſo bad cuſtome.</p>
                     <p>Sir knight, anſwered the Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte,</hi> fearing that by
long ſtaying in this place, your wounds may turne you to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
daunger then you expect, I pray you do me ſo much fauour
as to go with me into my Caſtle, where, hauing prouided to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
your wounds, as alſo thoſe which my knight hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
I will not faile to anſwer in what you pleaſe. <hi>Florendos</hi>
hauing need to ſuccor himſelf, by reaſon of his dangerous fight,
would not refuſe to agree to the will of the Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte,</hi>
who cauſed one of her Damoſelles to ſée the curing of his
wounds, which in ſooth were in no greater danger, then that he
might eaſily trauell the day following. After that the Princeſſe
had cauſed thoſe to bee buried that were ſlain, ſhe tooke <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi>
by the hand, and walked with him very chéerfully and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
diſpoſed, which courteſie he held in great reputation, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
made his proweſſe ſo nobly knowne againſt her Knights.
But then as ſhe walked, ſhe began to contemplate the beautie
of the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> with very great admiration, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
preſently came to her remembrance the Prince <hi>Florian</hi>
of the <hi>Forreſt,</hi> which cauſed a crimſon colour to a mount into
her chéekes, ſo that all her face deliuered an amiable bluſh,
which <hi>Florendos</hi> well noted at the beginning, whereupon hée
was donducted by the Princeſſe to the ſide of a window, the
proſpect whereof was ouer a faire running riuer, when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the hardineſſe to ſprake to him in this manner.</p>
                     <p>I know wel, ſir knight, that the cuſtome of my Caſtle ſéemeth
vnto you, to be ordained againſt all reaſonable regard: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
vnderſtood for what occaſion I maintaine it in this order,
you will not be any wayes offended thereat. It is ſo Sir, that
<pb facs="tcp:13179:228"/>
my Lord my Father leauing me in the cuſtody of ſundry noble
Gentlemen of this Realme of <hi>Nanarre,</hi> he deſired them at the
very houre of his death, that they would ſée I ſhould be married
to mine owne pleaſure &amp; contentment. Attending which time,
I withdrew my ſelfe (to auoyd popular frequentation) into
this my Caſtles, where hauing by Fortune ſoiourned a while
there chanced to arriue here a comely Knight, a moſt braue,
gallant and an honeſt Gentleman, and and ſo worthily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with vertue and proweſſe, that my good liking coupled
with equall loue, I deſired aboue all other to match with him,
holding opinion alſo, in him I ſhould iuſtly ſatiſfie my Lord
and Fathers commandement, ioyning hereunto that I ſhould
greatly grace my ſelfe, and ſuch in ſooth was this braue Knight.
But he being come from the Caſtle of the Grant <hi>Almorall,</hi>
was ſo altered in nature, that he neuer made account of my
freendſhip, refuſing altogether mine honeſt offer, &amp; caſting the
remembrance of my great good will, into contemptuous and
vnkind forgetfulneſſe. Whereupon I cauſed him to be taken
and layd in priſon, which I did with very kind and tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
becauſe I ſaw he was vnarmed, which could promiſe no
ſecurity to himſelfe, if I ſhould haue ſhowne my extreameſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</p>
                     <p>For Fortune was ſo happy a friend to him, as ſhe ſent an
other Knight vnto this place called <hi>Florian</hi> of the Forreſt,
whom you do very much reſemble, whoſe behauiour gained
ſuch power ouer me, as not onely made me ſet at liberty this
firſt knight, but that which gréeued me far more, he made me
ſo forgetfull of my ſelfe, as I ſuffered him to gather the fruit
of my garden, which my honour commanded mée to kéepe
with better regard. Furthermore, beſide all this, he ſo farre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
me with his flattery of purpoſe, as I permitted him to
depart, for that he made mee a faithfull promiſe to return ſo
ſpeedily as it was poſſible, and then hée would not fayl to come
and marry mée. But after that I had attended him a very long
time, and ſaw him not returne according to promiſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluded
my ſelfe to come into this pleaſant valley to make
<pb facs="tcp:13179:228" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thoſe ſweare which profeſſed arms, that they ſhould not break
ſpeare, nor put armor on their backs againſt any other knight,
then this onely one, who hath offered me this great deſpight.
And I held this opinion, that any valiant knight happening
into this place, whom I could get to maintain, that the beauty
of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> in no reſpect might be equalled with mine, wold
cauſe <hi>Florian</hi> (who is curious in ſearching ſuch hauty aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures)
to take the hardines, to come proue againſt the knight,
the contrary, by the aide of whom, I might chance to recouer
my long deſired <hi>Florian</hi> of the <hi>Forreſt.</hi> And if that eaſily my
knights might conquer any other knights, they ſhould make
them alſo ſweare to maintaine the conditions, which my da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell
declared vnto you at your firſt comming.</p>
                     <p>Many knights fearing the perill, wherein they might fall
by comming this way, and not daring to take ſo hardy an oth
vpon them, haue bene glad to returne and not ſtay here, when
as my knights haue come forth, and preſented themſelues to
defend my beauty.</p>
                     <p>Madame (anſwered <hi>Florendos)</hi> I know verie well the
knight of whom you ſpeak, and aſſure your ſelf that very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhall you bring him into this place, without he liſt himſelfe,
in that he is ſo noble and valiant a knight of Armes, as you
can hardly ioyne him with any equall: therefore I pray you,
do not greeue your ſelfe, although, he be forgetfull in ſatiſfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his promiſe, for I can aſſure you, that it is not his cuſtome
to affect greatly the ſeruice of Ladies, eſpecially in any amou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
opinion, or queint conceit of loue. As for your knights, I
cannot but yeeld their honeſt attempt very great commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and eſtéeme likewiſe very much of them, who aduanced
themſelues to maintaine your beautie, which in ſooth is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to binde in ſeruiceable duty, all thoſe that haue deſired to
render you ſembleable good will and liking. Neuertheleſſe, I
would perſwade you, that hereafter you would not maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
this cuſtome, and likewiſe I would deſire you, that you
would deſtow on me ſuch knights as you with hole by impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment,
who ſhalbe able to honor you more by their knightly
ſeruice, being at liberty, then you ſhal aduantage your ſelfe by
<pb facs="tcp:13179:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>
kéeping them in ſuch ſeruitude. Sir anſwered <hi>Arnalte,</hi> the great
honeſty wherwith you are accompanied, hath gained ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
ouer me, that I cannot ſée how I ſhold reefoſe, but that I
muſt néeds grant what you deſire. But I find my ſelf brought
into ſundry maruailous extreame paſſions, for that by your
words, you make me altogether out of hope, that I ſhal recouer
againe my Knight: for whoſe ſake I will that the impriſoned
knights be deliuered you, and for that you ſhal be the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of my words, I deliuer into your own hands the keys of
the priſon, which I would not giue into any knights hands in
the whole world, but only to you. The prince <hi>Florendos</hi> had
no ſooner receiued the keyes, but he deliuered them to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Prince
<hi>Albayzar</hi> who was very deſirous to ſée the priſoners, wherefore
he ſtaied not long, but tooke his way downe into the Caſtle,
with a lighted torch in his hand, for that the dungeon was very
déepe, and opening a little Tower, there he found many priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
whereof he knew diuers incontinent, whom he failed
not to ſalute, for that he knew them among the knights at <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
when he fought the combat there, in mainteuance
of the beauty of the faire Princeſſe <hi>Targiana,</hi> by means wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
they ſéeing themſelues deliuered by him, they knew not wel
what to thinke. But when they were come vp into the Caſtle,
and that they perceiued they enioyed their libertie by the means
of the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> they failed not to come &amp; humble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

great Oakes, he was armed in blacke Armour, and bare in
his Shield a white <hi>Bull,</hi> in a fielde of <hi>Sable,</hi> and mounted on
a very gallant Courſer, ſo that theſe thrée Knights conceiued
very good opinion of him, and to him they would haue approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
but that ſuddenly an Eſquier ſtept before them, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ſaluted them very courteouſly, deliuered his minde after
this order.</p>
                     <p>Gentlemen, the knight (which ſtandeth by theſe Dakes) gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
you to vnderſtand, that he hath enterpriſed to guarde this
paſſage, in that he hath kept it a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time againſt many knights:
not for that he hath deſire to offer any knight diſcourteſie, but
onely to ſatiſfie the will of a Lady, to whom he remaineth affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate,
loyal, and obedient. Therfore if it may ſtand with your
liking, to grant ſuch things as he will demand, the paſſage ſhall
be at libertie for you: but if you enterpriſe to doe the contrary,
he will put in triall to make you confeſſe perforce, that which
you cannot reaſonably deny or refuſe to grant.</p>
                     <p>Declare vnto vs (quoth the Prince <hi>Florendos,)</hi> firſt the wil
of thy Maſter, and ſoone after we will make thée anſwere: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
very hardly can we determine of the matter whereof we
are ignorant, by reaſon that thou concealeſt it ſo cloſely.</p>
                     <p>Hee will cauſe you to confeſſe (anſwered the Eſquier) that
<hi>Arnalce</hi> the Princeſſe of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> is the fayreſt creature vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
heauen, and moſt worthy of knightly ſeruice. It ſéemes
to me ſayd <hi>Albayzar,</hi> that we ſhall find this ſame knight, who
(to ſhunne the Combate at her Caſtle) hath accorded and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to fulfill her impecious conditions. Therefore I iudge it
in mine opinion, &amp; for good cauſe I know it aſſuredly, that his
enterpriſe is very dangerous, and ought no longer to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
Let it happen what pleaſeth Fortune (ſayd <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos)</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:230" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and afterward turning to the Eſquire, he anſwered him in
this order. My friend, you may goe &amp; aſſure your maiſter of the
Iouſte. While the Eſquire was buſie in ſpéech to the Prince
<hi>Florendos, Floraman,</hi> no ſooner perceiued him to returne to his
maiſter, but he deſired <hi>Florendos,</hi> that he would graunt him the
Combate, againſt the Knight that kept the paſſage, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
he would not denie him: wherevpon <hi>Floraman</hi> gaue the
ſpurres to his horſe, and ran couragiouſly againſt the Knight
of the princeſſe <hi>Arnalte,</hi> they both encountring together with
ſuch great force, that they were both diſmounted to the earth,
with their héeles vpward, but they recouered themſelues
promptly, and like good knights ſet their hands to their ſwords,
wherewith they began to ſtrike one another very daungerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
vſing ſuch knightly dexteritie, as <hi>Florendos</hi> and <hi>Albayzar</hi>
greatly delighted to behold them.</p>
                     <p>And for that <hi>Floraman</hi> was reputed for a good Knight, they
were abaſhed greatly, that any aduantage ſhould happen to
the Knight of the Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte,</hi> for the loue of whom hée
fought very brauely. But that which was moſt diſpleaſant to
<hi>Floraman,</hi> (who did his dutie like a good and vertuous knight)
was, leaſt the Princeſſe <hi>Florendos</hi> and <hi>Albayzar,</hi> ſhoulde
take any euill opinion of him. On the other ſide, the Knight
of the paſſage thought on the bonde, wherein the loue of the
Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte,</hi> had tyed him, which did the more harten
and encourage him.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two knights continued Combate ſo long, that being
ouercome with extreame trauaile, they were conſtrained to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
to take breath, the ſtraunge knight reioycing thereat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to vſe this language towardes <hi>Floraman.</hi> I know Sir
knight, that you might better breake your will and ſaue your
life, then be depriued of them both: for when you ſhall come to
confeſſe, that the Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte,</hi> is the fayreſt Lady aliue,
you ſhall not be any iote ſpared by fauour, alwayes conſidered,
that you ſhall but confeſſe the truth. If I did conſent to thy
will (anſwered <hi>Floraman)</hi> I ſhould maintaine a thing farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
any dutie: for in how much <hi>Arnalte</hi> is faire and worthy
to bée ſerued, by ſo much the rather thou makeſt me to thinke,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:231"/>
that the world enioyeth ſome ſuch, to whom ſhe is not in any
thing to be compared, for that diuine beautie hath made them
ſo ſingular faire, as the Princeſſe of <hi>Nauarre</hi> may in no wiſe
be equalled with them. And on the other ſide, I haue in time
paſt loued a Lady my ſelfe, in reſpect of whom, (the whole
world being filled with the report of her prayſe) I will rather
die, then accord to the preſumption thou wouldeſt haue me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Floraman</hi> had no ſooner concluded his ſpéech, but they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a freſh to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Combat, charging one another more ſuriouſly
then they had done before, ſo that it could not be iudged, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the one had any aduantage of the other, or who was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeſt
to win the victory, they maintained the ſight ſo brauely.
But in the end, the Knight that kept the paſſage, beganne by a
little and a little to feele that feebleneſſe ſomewhat aſſailed him,
and that ſtroke by ſtroke his word turned in his hand, and his
Armour was broken in many places, and likewiſe the Armour
of <hi>Floraman</hi> was in no better caſe then his enemies, but he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
his ſtrokes more wiſely, and dealt ſo gallantly at this
ſecond charge, that once againe they were conſtrained to retire.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Floraman,</hi> who was accompanied with ſuch gratious gifts,
as imbraceth the heart of a vertuous Prince, would proue if he
might poſſible chaunge the Knight from his fonde opinion:
Whereupon he ſpake to the Knight in this maner.</p>
                     <p>Sir Knight, you ſée very well that your enterpriſe is not
truth, according as you haue iudged it in conceit, wherefore I
pray you to confeſſe, that there are many Ladies in the world,
whoſe beautie the Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte</hi> may no way paragon. I
know well Sir, (ſayd the Knight of the paſſage) that the
weakeneſſe where into you ſée me brought, giueth you the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe
to vſe me with ſuch perſwaſions of reproofe: but ſo it is,
that I am ſo greatly affectionate towards the Princeſſe <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalte,</hi>
as I haue deliberated with my ſelfe to ſuſtaine y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> death,
before I will graunt to that which you ſay. When he had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
the end of his purpoſe, he charged <hi>Floraman</hi> afreſh, who
in ſhort time laide him along on the ground, whereat <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi>
and <hi>Albayzar</hi> was ſomewhat afraid, to ſée him brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:13179:231"/>
to ſuch daunger, wherefore quickly they opened his Helmet, but
when they had beheld him a while, they knewe him to be Syr
<hi>Albanis</hi> of <hi>Friſe,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Denmarcke,</hi> the ſight of whom
made <hi>Floraman</hi> very penſiue, for that he bare him maruellous
good will.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Florendos</hi> and <hi>Albayzar</hi> conducted theſe two Combattants,
into the houſe of a knight, whoſe abode was neare to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and as they walked together, they demanded of <hi>Albanis</hi>
of <hi>Friſe,</hi> vpon what occaſion he enterpriſed to gard the paſſage.
Worthy Gentlemen (anſwered <hi>Albanis)</hi> I will not defer to
tell you the ſum of your deſire, aduertiſing you, that Fortune
guided me one day into the Valley, where the Princeſſe <hi>Arnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi>
maketh her preſent abode, &amp; I was ſo rauiſhed in beholding
her beautie, that I remained her vowed ſeruant in good will,
wherevpon ſhe put to me three conditions, how I ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
againſt all wandering Knights, and maintaine it by my
proweſſe, that ſhe was the faireſt Princeſſe in the world, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
you that I came into this place, rather for the deſire I
had to doe ſeruice to the princeſſe of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> then for any feare
I had of her ſix Knights.</p>
                     <p>But now my deſteny is ſo farre vnfortunate, that I am fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
into the hands of Sir <hi>Floraman,</hi> which hath made me looſe
the hope, that till this houre I entertained. They which make
profeſſion of Armes (ſaide <hi>Florendos)</hi> ought not to be abaſhed
when any miſfortune befalles them, and I aſſure you that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalte</hi>
is a Princeſſe which merriteth very much, yet not ſo
much as many others haue deſerued, who are farre aduantaged
aboue her, therefore I wiſh you Sir <hi>Albanis,</hi> to thanke God,
who cauſed you to fall into the hands of your friendes, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
yourſelfe, that we would be loath to ſée you any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured.</p>
                     <p>Continuing this talke, they arriued at the houſe of the
Knight, who receiued them very gladly, for that he was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to lodge all wandering Knightes, and ſuch diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
was vſed, that in ſhort time the woundes of <hi>Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>
were méetly healed, and certaine daies he was accompanied
by the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> who was attached with vnmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:13179:232"/>
griefe, for the deſire he had to finde the Caſtle of <hi>Almarol.</hi>
Yet he diſſembled his griefe as much as he could poſſible, and
forced himſelfe to mirth to gratifie his friendes, as it is a wiſe
mans part, to forget his ſad and melancholike affections, to
content thoſe perſons with whom he is ioyned in friendſhip.</p>

Empire, when as the Damoſell of <hi>Thrace</hi>
chanced to enter the Court, which ſéemed
to her much changed, becauſe ſhe ſaw not
the Knights which were accuſtomed to bée
about the Emperor, at whoſe féete ſhe failed not to humble her
ſelfe incontinent, but hée cauſed her to be taken vp preſently,
and to be entertained with very gracious behauiour, then hée
deſired to vnderſtand how all things happened to his Nephew
<hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in the aduenture he vndertooke for <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narda</hi>
the Princeſſe of <hi>Thrace,</hi> the naming of whom, cauſed
the Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda</hi> to giue a moſt ſwéet and delicate bluſh
in her face, in whoſe preſence the Damoſell of <hi>Thrace</hi> began to
vſe her language after this manner.</p>
                     <p>If I ſhould rehearſe to your Maieſtie; the moſt Knightly
proweſſe of your noble Nephew, I ſhould find my ſelfe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne
in a great perplexity, for that I know his worthy
déedes are reſerued to bee deliuered, by one of more prompt and
diſcréete memorie then my ſelfe. Neuertheleſſe, to diſcharge the
<pb facs="tcp:13179:232" rendition="simple:additions"/>
great bond of Friendſhip, wherein his Princely courteſie hath
ſo ſtraitly bound mee, I will report what I haue ſéene, during
the time he was in my companie, which when hee tooke occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to leaue, he went to the place where the Princeſſe <hi>Leonar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
was Enchaunted: and where hee witneſſed ſuch Knightly
valour, as will render to his Name perpetuall honour, hauing
finiſhed an aduenture ſo ſtraunge and admirable. The whole
diſcourſe whereof, the Damoſell deliuered in circumſtance to
the Emperour, giuing him to vnderſtand, the hard cauſes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
eftſoones offered to the knight of the <hi>Tiger.</hi> But when
ſhe came to report the manner of his paſſing the Lake, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Iſle was compaſſed about, the daunger of the Boate,
and the faſhion how it was drawn with the Cord, the Ladyes
that were preſent, remained ſo mightily ouercome with griefe,
as the ſwéet and delicate colour, wherewith their diuine Faces
were moſt plentifully endued, began very ſadly to alter, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the great perills which the Noble <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
had paſſed, putting his life to ſuch extreame points of hazard, for
the deliuerie of the Princeſſe <hi>Leonarda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I haue heard reported (ſaid the Emperour) many ſtrange
Aduentures, and haue knowne ſome worthily atchieued in my
time, but I neuer heard in all my life of any ſo perillous as this:
for I know well that the imagination of the King <hi>Sardamant,</hi>
was very farre different to any other Kings. But well I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue,
that the Proweſſe of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> excelleth very farre the
valour of all other Knights: for I aſſure you, that as yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſaw the Knight that might be equalled with him, without
great impeachment, or that could finde the meane to diſcharge
ſo great daungers.</p>
                     <p>After that the Damſell had ſufficiently ſet to ſale, the praiſe of
the thriſe noble <hi>Palmerin,</hi> in the eares of ſo many gratious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages,
ſhe changed her talke after this manner. To him that
hath thus woorthily deſerued, I did beſtowe my vttermoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuor,
to bring him within the compaſſe of affection to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<hi>Leonarda,</hi> whoſe good minde was altogether placed on the
entertainement into her Princely Fauour, the Knight of ſuch
a hautie diſpoſition. But as it ſéemeth to me, he is either alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb facs="tcp:13179:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>
blinded in his owne conceite, or elſe his heart of affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
placed on ſome other perſon: for I aſſure you, he made
no account of the Crowne of <hi>Thrace,</hi> bnt did flatly refuſe it, as
alſo to eſpouſe the Princeſſe <hi>Leonarda,</hi> who was brought into
his preſence, by the principall noble Gentlemen of the Court,
according as it was ordained by the Teſtament of King <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant</hi>
her Grandfather. By reaſon whereof, the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
the Quéene <hi>Carmelia,</hi> that ſhee would ſend to your
highneſſe their Princeſſe, to remaine in the company of the
Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi> (your Neece, and the Daughter of the
prince <hi>Primaleon)</hi> as alſo of other noble ladies, wherwith your
renowned Court is plentifully enriched, whoſe gratious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation
may not onely entertaine the heart of <hi>Leonarda,</hi>
with the precious dignitie of vnſpotted vertue, but alſo by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
their honourable examples, ſhe may the more highly be
eſtéemed in the acceptable fauour of ſuch noble perſonages, as
preferre the renowne of Ladies, with the felicitie of their owne
life.</p>
                     <p>The Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> very well liked of the intent of the
Queene <hi>Caemelia,</hi> by meanes whereof ſhe doth humbly deſire,
that it might ſo ſtand with your Highneſſe pleaſure, as not to
make deniall of this requeſt to her, ſeeing you haue not hitherto
re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ed the entertainement of any, in the fulfilling whereof, ſhe
ſhall eſtéeme herſelfe and her whole Kingdome, perpetually
bound to your excellency. And becauſe your highnes may eſteem
of the greater truth, what I haue made report of, ſhe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
me to preſent your Maieſty with this her letter of credite,
wherein full well you ſhall perceiue the reſidue of her pleaſure:
may it like your highneſſe to pardon this blunt diſcourſe of an
vneloquent maiden.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour very gratiouſly receiued the letter, which
when he had peruſed, he thus framed his anſwer to the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell.
Vertuous and ſage Lady, I not onely pittie the great
paiue you haue ſuffered in trauelling thus farre, but alſo giue
you thanks for ſuch a good endeuour, not forgetting to honour
you with bountifull courteſie, for the good newes you haue
brought me of my Nephew <hi>Palmerin,</hi> in regard of whom,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:233" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both his Princely deſerts, and my vttermoſt requitall, which is
but his duty, I deſire of God my power may ſtretch ſo farre, to
requite you according as you haue worthily merited.</p>
                     <p>And for the Lady, the regard of whom cauſed my nephew, to
hold ſo ſmall eſtimation of the Princeſſe <hi>Leonarda,</hi> I know
her care is beyond iudgement, in deuiſing by what meanes ſhe
might gaine the power, to requite a cauſe of ſo great honour.
And where you deſire I would yéeld my conſent, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<hi>Leonarda,</hi> might come to remaine in my Court, aſſure
your ſelfe, that I am well contented, and thinke my ſelfe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
honoured by ſuch a requeſt. And the better to declare how
gratefull I accept her comming hither, and how thankfull I
would be for your great trauaile, I giue to you the countie of
<hi>Salin,</hi> which by reaſon of the death of the county <hi>Arlae,</hi> remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vacant, he not hauing left any heirs to repoſſeſſe the ſame.
The Damoſell preſently threw her ſelfe at the Emperors féet,
offering to kiſſe his hand, in ſigne of her thankfull mind, but he
ſuſtained her in his armes very graciouſly, which he was not
accuſtomed to do to any ſtranger, yet ſuch was the eſtimation
he had of her.</p>
                     <p>The damoſell behaued her ſelfe in the ſame manner of duty
to the Empreſſe, as alſo toward the Prince <hi>Primaleon,</hi> and
<hi>Gridonia,</hi> but they (to witneſſe their beneuolent mindes, and
the honour wherewith they would entertaine ſuch a fréendly
gueſt) by their great intreaty and courteſie made ſtay of her
humble offer, whereupon ſhe returned to the Emperour, and
deliuered her mind theſe words.</p>
                     <p>I can hardly withhold my ſelfe at this inſtant (my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Lord) being ſo deſirous as I am, to vnderſtand of the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
mind of the Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> both in dealing, and
eſcaping from a <hi>Tiger</hi> ſo hideous and fearefull, as alſo being ſo
happy to end ſuch an aduenture: but your gracious fauour is
ſo agréeable to my deſirous thoughts, and ſo plentifull in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
beyond my poore demerits, that I ſhall leaue the report
thereof in your highneſſe memory, till ſuch time as I returne
with the Princeſſe <hi>Leonarda:</hi> for I aſſure your Maieſty, that
my heart is vnſpeakeably ſatiſfied with pleaſure, in that I ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:13179:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſpéede ſo well, as to be reſolued by your excellencie, in the thing
I haue ſo long time wiſhed for. Wherefore moſt humbly I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you that I may depart, for the deſire I haue, to enforme the
Princeſſe <hi>Leonarda,</hi> of your gratious fauour, cauſeth me to
iudge euery day a yeare, till I haue in this cauſe fulfilled my
dutie.</p>
                     <p>Faire Damoſell (anſwered the Emperour) it ſhould like
me very well, if you made your abode here ſtill with me in
my Court: but for that I perceiue your great deſire, to returne
with anſwer of your thankfull meſſage, I wiſh to you: as to
my ſelfe, in the whole courſe of your iourney. The Damoſell
humbly tooke her leaue of the Emperour, and all his company,
and came to the Chamber of the Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi> who had
ſecretly withdrawne her ſelfe, to reueale to <hi>Dramaciana</hi> her
waiting Gentlewoman, the good opinion her hart had ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceiued of thoſe ioyfull tidings: ſo then with her a while
the damoſell kept company, when preſently ſhe beganne to
coniecture, that it was the beautie of this Princeſſe which had
cauſed the Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> to refuſe the gouernement of
<hi>Thrace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi> very modeſtly began to queſtion
with the Damoſell of euery particular chance that had happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> for whoſe ſake ſhe honoured the
Damoſel with very Princely courteſie, and ſhe deſired her that
ſhee would bee the Meſſenger of her vnfayned good will to the
Princeſſe <hi>Leonarda,</hi> whome ſhee would not willingly ſhould
ſtay, but come vnto the Court preſently. The Damoſell made
promiſe to performe euery thing to the vttermoſt, ſo, departing
from the Princeſſe, ſhe went through the palace to her ledging,
where ſhe locked vp the honourable Preſents, which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
and <hi>Gridonia</hi> had (ſince her comming) ſent vnto her: ſo
hauing all things in readineſſe, ſhee departed, farre more Rich
and more ioyfull then ſhe was before.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſell wee intend to leaue in her iourney, becauſe
we will returne to the Noble and renowmed Knight of the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
who after hée departed from the kingdome of <hi>Thrace,</hi> tooke
the ſtraighteſt way that hee could poſſibly chuſe, to bring him
<pb facs="tcp:13179:234" rendition="simple:additions"/>
vnto <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> wherto when he drew ſomewhat neare,
by chance one day hee arriued in a very great Forreſt, which
was farre from any houſes or reſort of people, and likewiſe the
Trées much defaced and ſpoyled, ſo that it ſéemed a waſt and
deſolate wilderneſſe. Ryding along very ſad and penſiue in
minde, he heard the trampling of a great many horſes, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
his eye that way where he heard the noyſe, he eſpied ten
or twelue Knights very well armed, croſſing ouerthwart the
Forreſt. Wherevpon, he gaue his horſe the ſpurres (being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to doe them ſeruice, if ſo be they had néede to vſe his aide)
and followed them that way they rode, when in ſhort time he
ouertooke one of their company, who could not ſo ſpéedily iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
as the other did, by reaſon that his horſe had receiued an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint
in one of his legges, with this Knight, <hi>Palmerin</hi> deſired
friendly to conferre, which made him vſe his ſpéeches in this
maner.</p>
                     <p>I deſire you Sir, if I may demand ſo bold a requeſt of you,
as to report vnto me the cauſe, why theſe Knights iourney ſo
ſpéedily, and whither they goe through this vnfrequented For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.
I know well Sir (anſweeed the ſtrange Knight) that
their enterpriſe doeth not concerne you in any thing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is it as néedeleſſe to tell you, as you haue ſmall occaſion to
demand of their purpoſe, but for that I ſée your acquaintance
with the cauſe, can neither impeach them with your mallice,
nor pleaſure them with your aide, I am content to reſolue you
in what you requeſt.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall vnderſtand Sir, that thrée leagues diſtance from
this place, there is a Lady, a very courteous creature, remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in a ſtrong and well fortefied Caſtle, who hath a daughter
of moſt exquiſite perfection in beautie, with whom a Knight of
this Countrey, named <hi>Feliſtor,</hi> is very deſirous to marrie, but
her Lady mother will not ſuffer to be ſo beſtowed, hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
giuen her to be eſpouſed, to another rich Gentleman
of this Countrey, named <hi>Radimar,</hi> wherefore the Lady and
her daughter haue conſented with this Gentleman, to goe vnto
a Caſtle of his owne, where they will ſecretely knit vp their
determinate purpoſe, and deceiue the long and labourſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb facs="tcp:13179:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Feliſtor.</hi> But being aduertiſed of their cloſe intent,
hath determined to hazard his Fortune in the extreameſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
either to hinder them, &amp; helpe himſelfe, or to leaue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
in a doubtfull eſtate. And he that may the better preuaile,
if fortune darken not the Sun-ſhine of his good hap, he hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
a ſecret ambuſhment in a little wood, by which, the Lady
and her daughter muſt of neceſſitie paſſe, &amp; hauing giuen ſtrait
charge to them in ambuſh, that the life of <hi>Radimar</hi> be put to the
ſwoord, as ſoone as they may lay hands on him, for that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of him is a blemiſh to his earneſt intent, he will then
marry the Damoſell, in deſpight of any dare ſay the contrary.
And becauſe this marriage may be the better accompliſhed, I
am to aſſiſt him with my company, onely for the good wil which
I vnfainedly beare him, but Fortune is very contrary in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to me, for that my horſe bath taken ſuddainly an attaint,
whereby I ſhall hazard the breach of my promiſe, which would
no more diſlike my friend, then it will be grieuous to me, if ſo it
would happen.</p>
                     <p>To preuent the worſt therefore, I pray you Sir to thinke ſo
well of me, as to lend me your horſe, and to content your ſelfe
in meane time, with that whereon your Eſquire rideth, and he
I iudge will take mine in good part, which courteſie will cauſe
me (in place where I haue power anſwerable to my will) not
to forget ſuch a fauourable pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Truely Sir (anſwered <hi>Palmerin)</hi> I ſée well if I ſhould doe
you ſo great a pleaſure, you are bent to vſe my gift in a deede of
greater diſhonour, for that it better ſtandeth with your cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
to defend the cauſe of a diſtreſſed Lady, then to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
whereby her honour may receiue ſuch diſgrace, and
therefore as I found you, I leaue you, being ſo deſirous to be
with your companions, as I cannot at this time ſtay to make
you any other anſwere, and ſo he poaſted to ouertake <hi>Feliſtor,</hi>
which the ſtrange Knight perceiuing, preſently entred into
theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>Alas fond foole, thou makeſt ouer much haſt to entertaine
thine owne miſfortune, in that the ſimpleſt of them before
thée, is able ſufficient to teach thée and thy fellowe your duties,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but I wiſh that ſo ſoone as my companions, haue giuen due
chaſtiſement to ſhe pride wherewith thou art fondly accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
thy horſe may fall to my ſhare, as well to teach thée what
thou oughteſt haue done at my courteous requeſt, as alſo that
I may diſcharge my promiſe made to my fréend.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> had attained ſuch length of ground,
that he vndeſtood, not the preſumptuous language of the
ſtrange knight, but yet he once looked back, whereby he gaue
him to know, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hauty diſpoſition of an aduenturous mind,
is not to be moued at the fearefull foreſhew of ſuppoſed dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
where contrariwiſe, the cowardldy wretch eſtéemeth euery
flaw a tempeſt, and a little motion of miſchance, the vtter ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
of all his ſoueraigntie.</p>
                     <p>The noble <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England</hi> purſued theſe Knights ſo
long, that he was ouercharged with the gloomy fogge of night,
ſo that he could not perceiue how to follow them any further
by the trackes of their horſes, by reaſon whereof he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to alight, when he gaue his horſe to his Eſquire, enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to repoſe himſelfe ſo well as he could in this deſolate place,
vntill <hi>Aurora</hi> faluted him with her beautifull countenaunce. But
in vaine did he beſtow his labour, to take his reſt in the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
houres of ſléepe, for the earneſt deſire he had to defend the
cauſe of the iniuryed Ladie, would not ſuffer him ſo much as to
cloſe his eyes.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the day began no ſooner to péepe, but he cauſed
<hi>Siluian</hi> to bridle the horſes, when preſently he tooke the way
which <hi>Feliſtor</hi> and his company had paſſed before but when
he could ſet no eye on them, he beganne to be very gréeuouſly
mooued, imitating them, which can enioy no quietneſſe of mind
till they haue deliuered the innocent from their cruell oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
which among all the déeds of knighthood, beareth the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt

<pb facs="tcp:13179:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would hardly eſcape their hands, gaue her Palfrey the bridle,
and ſo rode ſolitarily muſing along the forreſt, which the knight
of the <hi>Tiger</hi> perceiuing, began very much to gréeue at: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
ſo valiantly he dealt with the other knights, as when
he had ſlaine thrée of them, the reſt tooke themſelues preſently
to flight, whereupon the knight (whoſe horſe was attainted
with trauell, and who had ſo pleaſantly iybed with the Prince)
came and humbly yéelded himſelfe, deſiring that he would not
remember what diſcourteous words had paſſed from him,
whereupon the knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> (according to his courteous
nature) did very gently entertaine him.</p>
                     <p>The Lady ſéeing her enemies ſo happily vanquiſhed, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in her heart vnſpeakeable ioy, but when ſhe looked about,
and could not ſée her daughter, her ioy was preſently amated
with ſorrow: wherefore that ſhe might the better recouer her
againe, ſhe came and fell downe before the knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi>
giuing him moſt humble thankes for his ſo noble ſuccour, and
deſiring if it might ſo pleaſe him, as to lend her his aſſiſtance,
till ſhe had found her daughter, for whoſe abſence ſhe remained
more oppreſſed with gréefe, then ſhe was before, being in the
danger of her cruell enemies.</p>
                     <p>Madame (quoth the knight of the <hi>Tiger)</hi> you ſhould attribute
the honour of this victory, to the miſfortune of your vnkinde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries,
in that ſuch as they do alwaies receiue recompence,
according as the wickedneſſe of their liues deſerueth, for diuine
iuſtice will not ſuffer them to eſcape vnpuniſhed, who are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting ſuch heinous offences. As for your daughter
I iudge her to be within this Forreſt, therfore it is good that we
trifle no time in vaine, but haſtily beſturre our ſelues in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſearch of her: for I promiſe you I will not leaue you, till I
haue ſafely deliuered her into your owne ſecurity, whereto the
Lady replied.</p>
                     <p>I ſée well Sir knight, that both vertue and magnanimitie
ſhineth brauely in your noble heart, and I would that my
poore power were of ſufficiencie, to requite your princely boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
neuertheleſſe, I truſt that God will repay your good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts,
which I am farre vnable to do at this preſent, yet will
<pb facs="tcp:13179:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I remaine all my life time dutifull in good will, to ſhewe
what acceptable thankes I can, at your noble commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Lady concluding her ſpéeches, the Knight of the
<hi>Tiger, Siluian,</hi> and the Lady, rode on which way they iudged
the Damoſell had taken, but they iourneyed all that day, and
moſt part of the night, yet were they neuer the nearer their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
and it is not to be maruailed why ſhe ſhould ſtray ſo far,
for that the feare ſhe had, leaſt her honour ſhould be impeached,
cauſed her to take thoſe occaſions vpon her, which in her iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
might beſt preſerue it.</p>
                     <p>They hauing thus trauailed very late, they were conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to alight to eaſe their horſes, which <hi>Siluian</hi> did preſently vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridle,
that they might refreſh themſelues in the Paſture: then
gaue he to his Lord and the ſorrowfull Lady, ſuch prouiſion for
their ſuſtenance as he carried with him, wherewith they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
themſelues ſo well as they could, for that they knewe in
ſuch a deſolate place, it were very ſtrange to looke for courtly
dainties.</p>
                     <p>Faire <hi>Auba</hi> had no ſooner deliuered the faire morning in
ſight, but they preſently mounted on horſbacke, and rode about
the whole Forreſt, yet not finding her they ſo gladly looked for,
which made the Lady conceiue ſo great griefe, as the Knight
of the <hi>Tiger</hi> by no perſwaſion could appeaſe: wherefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
her to goe to her Caſtle, in that it was vnfit for her to
take ſuch vnaccuſtomed paines, wherewith (with much adoe)
at laſt ſhe conſented: then they rode to her Caſtle, where they
arriued about the Euening, but the entrance thereof was gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the foure knights, which <hi>Feliſtor</hi> had giuen charge to
remaine there. This began a freſh to vexe the Lady, firſt to ſée
her daughter ſo vnhappily loſt, and then to be forbidden the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into her own houſe, theſe two extreames mouing many
other paſſions, cauſed her to repute her ſelfe, as the vnhappieſt
vnder the Sunne.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> ſéeing the Lady in ſo great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
beganne to flatter the eyes of the Knightes, with
ſhowes of moſt gratious behauiour as it is the cuſtome among
<pb facs="tcp:13179:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aduenturous mindes, to diſſemble their intents with deuiſes,
of amiable conceit, which ſometime preuaileth more in pollicie,
then déedes that manifeſt knightly power. And ſo it fortuned,
that the Knights of <hi>Feliſtor</hi> came to receiue them, for they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo many, made them ſo venturous: but their chiefeſt intent
was to haue murthered the knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> and then to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
backe the Lady with them.</p>
                     <p>But herein they found themſelues greatly deceiued, for the
Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> perceiued no ſooner the bride to bee let
downe, but he entred thereon, and beganne very valiantly to
charge theſe foure knights, who ſetled themſelues altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and one of them began to vſe theſe words. I perceiue
well Sir Knight, that your great folly will be an occaſion of the
preſent ending of your life, which ſéeing you are wilfully come
to ſéeke, we will deliuer you anſwerable paiment to your bold
enterpriſe. Theſe words the Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> nothing at all
regarded, but dealt ſo roughly with them, as two of them were
quickly diſpatched of their liues, and their fellows fearing leaſt
they ſhould be brought into like eſtate, caſt downe their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
and yéelded themſelues.</p>
                     <p>The Lady ſéeing this happy ſucceſſe, alighted and entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her Caſtle, greatly abaſhed at the noble bountie of the
Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> and ſorrowfull beſide, becauſe ſhe knewe
not how to recompence ſo great courteſie. And as ſhe ſtood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the no ſmall danger he ſuſtained, to deliuer her out of
the hands of <hi>Feliſtor,</hi> and his company, ſhe beheld her daughter
comming, conducted by fiue Knights, who were in a certaine
Tent, wherto in her ſtraying ſhe happened to come. When the
Damoſell was gone into the Caſtle to her mother, and that
theſe Knights beheld the blood of thoſe ſlaine Knightes before
their faces, they were attached with ſuch a ſudden feare, as they
would very gladly haue béene further thence.</p>
                     <p>But the Lady (who perceiued the cauſe of their diſmaying)
went to them incontinent, and hauing imbraced them, deſired
that they would not ſuffer any cauſe of doubt to ariſe, but that
they would ſhewe their thankefull mindes to the Knight of the
<hi>Tiger,</hi> who had deliuered her out of ſo great danger. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
<pb facs="tcp:13179:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they humbly went and ſaluted the prince, who kept them
company there the ſpace of eight daies, at the end whereof he
departed thence, taking his iourny toward the place, where his
heart deſired to be.</p>

Sir (anſwered the <hi>Hermit)</hi> I would be loth to reſolue
you in this demand, for ſuch a queſtion ſéemeth to me, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
an earneſt deſire in you, to offer the combate to theſe
Giants, which I would be ſorry you ſhould do, in that the
meaneſt of them is of abilite to reſiſt thrée of the beſt knights
in this realme. Therefore I deſire you, if your affection be
bent that way, that at my requeſt you would bridle it within li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of regard, and to remember, that it is diſhonour to a
noble mind, to adenture his life more wilfully then wiſely,
and yet to couer my intent vnder the title of ſeeking renowne,

which ſées the danger to be beyond his compaſſe, and yet will

if ſuch a one be well corrected. Wherefore good Sir, to

auoide the worſt that may happen to you, I deſire you to let no
ſuch minde remaine in you, but that you would witneſſe your
valour in thoſe occaſions, which may repreſent more hope of
victory, and ſéeme of better equalitie with your Knightly force,
for in doing otherwiſe, you ſhal cauſe any good minde to thinke,
that deſperate hope hath rather conducted you hither, then any
carefull aduiſe, which way to returne victor from theſe Giants.
And it is their woont to walke abroade in the mornings, when,
here they murther one, there, they villeinouſly mangle ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
hauing ſworne to continue this crueltie, vntill they can
meete with the two Sonnes of the Prince <hi>Don Edward,</hi> on
whom their intents is to be famouſly reuenged, for that their
Brethren were ſlaine by their hands.</p>
                     <p>I perceiue Father (ſaid the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi> that
you make no conſcience in condemning thoſe, who aduenture
then liues to redeeme the wretches eſtate, of poore Soules ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by ſuch cruell tyranny, for if you remember your ſelfe,
Armour ought not to be borne by any, but onely ſuch as imploy
their pains to ſuccor thoſe, who are no way able to ſhield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
and the order of Knighthood is giuen vs to this end, not
that we ſhould faint at a ſhadow, or be conquered by wordes,
before we ſee the deedes, wherefore father, perſwade your ſelfe,
that Fortune ſhal no ſooner preſent me with the occaſion, but I
will put my hap in aduenture.</p>
                     <p>At theſe words the aged <hi>Hermit</hi> began to ſhed teares, to ſée
that he could not remooue him from his determination, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
he laboured ſtill in perſwaſion, but his paines was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowen
to ſmall purpoſe, for he was not ſo full of intreatie, as
the other was reſolutely bent, ſo, they paſſed away the night in
friendly communication. In the morning <hi>Florian</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
himſelfe to depart, at what time he heard a great noyſe
without the Cell, when going to the doore, he eſpied a Damoſel
came haſtely riding, and ſhe ſeeing the Knight of the <hi>Sauage
man,</hi> came vnto him for ſuccour, in that ſhe was egerly purſued
by the Giant <hi>Brocalon,</hi> who was in ſame white Armour, and
well mounted on a luſtie Courſer, from which he alighted, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thus to the Damoſell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I ſée well Damoſell, that you haue taken a place of ſmall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
to your ſelfe, for that your knight will deliuer you into
my hands, which if he ſhould not doe, he ſhould preſently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the eſtate of my diſpleaſure, whereto the knight of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
man</hi> thus anſwered. Truſt me Syr, you are deceiued as
farre as I can perceiue, for here is none that oweth you dutie,
much leſſe any that will ſtand in feare of you: and I doubt not,
but the diſloyall tyrannie which thou vſeſt, ſhall well enough
be tempered, ere thou and I part. Theſe wordes cauſed a ſore
Combate betwéene them, the brauery whereof much delighted
the aged <hi>Hermit,</hi> who ſtill prayed for good ſucceſſe to happen to
the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> but ſo gallantly did hee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
the fight, that the Giant was enforced to take a breathing,
which was very acceptable to the Prince, in that his Shielde
was greatly defaced, and himſelfe ſurcharged with very much
trauaile, but yet he was in farre better ſtate then the Giant,
who ſéeing his blood trickle downe his Armour ſo faſt, began to
vſe theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>How comes it to paſſe, that one Knight hath the power to
preuaile ſo much againſt me? Certainly I feare me, that the
hope I haue alwayes had, to vanquiſh thoſe Knights that ſlew
my Brethren, by this one Knight will be brought into ſome
doubt, yet if I muſt néedes end my life, I had rather it might be
at one of their handes, for that their valour carrieth ſo large
commendation, then by this Knight, who is vtterly vnknown
to me.</p>
                     <p>Thus concluding, he began to charge the Knight of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
man</hi> with very rough and forcible ſtrokes, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
ſo duly awaited his oportunitie, as at length he
brought his enemie vnder his ſubiection, when taking off his
Helmet, he preſently parted his head from his ſhoulders, the
ſight hereof was no ſmall ioy to the aged <hi>Hermit,</hi> as alſo to the
Damoſell, who came and humbled her ſelfe to the Prince in
this manner.</p>
                     <p>It is vnpoſſible for me Sir Knight, to render you thanks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your worthy deſerts, neuertheleſſe, I will report
ſuch laudable language of your Knightly déedes, in the Court
<pb facs="tcp:13179:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Vernar</hi> the Emperor of <hi>Allameigne</hi> (whither at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
I direct my courſe) as your Fame ſhall remaine in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
memory. And very gladly would I bee acquainted
with your name, which I the more earneſtly deſire for two
cauſes, the one, that I might the more exactly diſcourſe your
noble valour, to the amazement of all other that cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
ſo well, the other, that I might know the noble Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whoſe gratious bountie I might repay with my contiuu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
prayers.</p>
                     <p>Faire Damoſell (quoth the Prince) if you deſire to knowe
my name, that I may doe you ſeruice to the vttermoſt of my
power, I will declare it vnto you, rather for that cauſe then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other, but I aſſure you, my déedes are of ſo ſmall eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as credite me, you may more worthily caſt into diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
then giue them any ſuch praiſe as it hath pleaſed you
to vtter. And let it not ſéeme in your eares, as an vnaduiſed
ſpéech, which at this preſent of neceſſitie I muſt diſcloſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
mine eye and my heart haue taſted both on fierie Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
but rather let it obtaine ſuch an acceptable opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of beliefe
in your modeſt thoughts, as, I remaining captiue, and at your
mercy, may finde you as ready to pittie me, as your beauty was
to wound me, vpon theſe ſpéeches the <hi>Hermit</hi> tooke occaſion to
begin thus.</p>
                     <p>Sir Knight, it is a déepe point of wiſedome to flée the ſubtill
temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of beautie, which is not ſo glorious in the eye, as it is
grieuous in the heart, nor ſo ſwéete in conceite, as it is ſower in
triall, the reaſon is, for that iealouzie, frenzie, beggerie, murder,
with many other miſchiefs, are always waiting on her as yok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowes.
You haue already eſcaped one extreame danger, and
now are like to fall into a more greater, for the one could haue
béene but hnrtfull to the body, the other hangeth more waity on
the ſoule, remember this my ſon, for thy fall will be as grieuous
to me, as to thy ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Father (ſaid the Prince) Beautie is ſo familiarly welcome
into the eyes of all men, as you ſée they haue no power to
eſcape from her, and her delights ſo agréeable in their hearts
likewiſe, as were they of flint, ſhe would mooue affection, euen
<pb facs="tcp:13179:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo, if you did but contemplate the heauenly grace of this beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Damoſell, you could not otherwiſe chuſe, but offer your
ſelfe as her humble ſeruant, which if you did refuſe to doe, I
ſhould perſwade my ſelfe, that good nature had altogether for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
you, as alſo I might iudge him very colde in kindneſſe,
that could not be moued by ſuch a forcible motion.</p>
                     <p>I ſee well (quoth the <hi>Hermit)</hi> that the pleaſure of the fleſh,
makes thee forgetfull of the health of thy ſoule, wherefore, I
will pray that thou maieſt be conuerted in time, leaſt thou féele
the puniſhment of thy follie, when it will be too late for thée to
helpe thy ſelfe: whereto the Prince anſwered thus.</p>
                     <p>I pray you Father tell me, can you conquere theſe earthly
delights, when you ſit wreſting many matters in your Study?
Or wil the looking on your booke, abate the ſecret inflamations
of your heart? I haue heard of many of your calling and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that haue laboured to kill that in other, which (for all their
learning) hath quickned in themſelues, and by ſeeking to draw
a throne out of anothers heele, haue prickt themſelues therwith
to the very heart: tuſh father, be religious in reaſon, I haue ſeen
an olde Billet burne freſher, then a young Bauen, and you (for
all your holineſſe) if I ſhould inueigh againſt the ſecret delight
of Loue, would take me for an heretique: but it is good that I
argue, to ſhew my folly, and that you allow not, to declare your
wiſedome. Well (quoth the <hi>Hermit)</hi> I will betake my ſelfe to
my <hi>Oratorie,</hi> and you to your youthfull and worldly pleaſure,
the deſert whereof will (no doubt) in the end reward you. And ſo
he went into his Cel, making ſuch ſpeed, til he had ſhut the doore
after him, as if the Giant <hi>Brocalon</hi> had beene aliue againe, and
had followed him: wherat the knight of the <hi>Sauageman</hi> laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
heartily, then comming vnto the Damoſell, he began to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
her in theſe tearmes.</p>
                     <p>I could wiſh (faire Lady) to be ſeruant to ſo kiude a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe,
if it might as ſhall like you to allowe me your ſeruice:
in ſooth I iudge you would like of my behauiour, if you doe
not, I will be content to auoide, when it is your pleaſure.
Worthy Sir (anſwered the Damoſell) I cannot be ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull
for your great good will, in defending me, when I was
<pb facs="tcp:13179:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in greateſt diſtreſſe, but that (to my power) I muſt witneſſe
ſome ſhew of a thankfull minde: in mean time, I deſire to haue
your company for theſe two or thrée dayes, till I be out of
theſe places of ſo great danger, and then ſhall I account my
ſelfe then more highly beholding to you.</p>
                     <p>Lady (quoth he) I receiue ſo great pleaſure in your cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
anſwer, as I thinke my ſelfe the happieſt man a liue
to attaine ſuch bountie: wherewith he preſently tooke his horſe,
cauſing his Eſquire to mount the Damoſell, who by the way

whom your ſingular beautie hath ſecretly fettered. They
continuing theſe pleaſant purpoſes of ſpéech, at laſt they came
to a goodly Riuer, the pleaſant ſight whereof, inuited them to

Many affable ſpéeches the Prince ſpent, that the Damoſell
might the better entertaine him into his fauour, at length he
was ſo bold as to giue her a gréene gowne, when I feare me
ſhe loſt the flower of her chaſtity, but whether it were ſo or no,
I know not, but mine Authour ſaith, that the Eſquire at his
departing left her a Maiden, and at his comming againe, he
found her a woman.</p>

to waxe heauy a ſléepe, like vnto thoſe that

rather to ſuffiſe their appetite, then any thing elſe, for he made
ſo ſmall account of a Louers paſſions, as his humour once ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied,

(quoth ſhe) I (being vnworthy to ſhew my face among per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

as he ſéemed to her to exéede the Giant <hi>Brocalon.</hi> And

he called his Eſquiers, and commanded them to wait ther neare

                     <p>Hereat the Damoſell was greatly abaſhed, ſo that (ſtanding

                     <p>I ſée it is great folly for me to repoſe any credite in the Gods,
who either want power, or elſe are wilfully bent, to euerthrow
him that hath moſt truſted them, and good cauſe haue I to

                     <p>The Giant (extreamely moued to heare the braue language

                     <p>Then they began a fierce and cruell Combat, wherein the

him very louingly, and on ſuch a poore bed as he had, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him to lie down, vſing ſuch good regard vnto him, as within
fewe dayes his dangerous eſtate was well recouered. Then
did he deſire the Prince, that he would ſuffer the Damoſell to
depart on her iourney, giuing her to vnderſtand, how ſhe might
now trauaile without danger, for that ſhe knowe her ſelfe the
Giants were both ſlaine, and alſo he ſaid, it ſtood not with her
honeſt report, that ſhe ſhould ſo kéepe company with a Knight
at Armes, whoſe affaires lay in ſo many ſundry places, as it
was not decent for her, nor honour to him, to be ſéene after ſuch

The Prince was very well content that ſhe ſhould depart,
albeit the Damoſell found her ſelfe greatly agreeued, that he
did vſe no more eſtimation of her, hauing ſealed the Fort of her
maidenly honour, which none had the power to obtain before,
neuertheleſſe, when ſhe ſaw no remedy, but that ſhe was forced
to make a vertue of neceſſity, with teares ſhe tooke her leaue of

                     <p>I cannot beléeue (ſayd the Prince <hi>Don Edward)</hi> that the

of <hi>Albayzer</hi> to the end, that the ſafegard of his life might
redéeme the other their woonted liberty: whereto the Prince
<hi>Florian</hi> thus replied. I am perſwaded good Father, that the
<hi>Turke</hi> will hardly be remooued from his determination, which
maketh me the greater to miſdoubt the ſafety of thoſe knights,
the abſence of whom (I am aſſure) ſo gréeuouſly offendeth the
good Emperour, that I am perfectly reſolued to goe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him: conſidering it is a part of dutie on my behalf, not to
be ſo farre from him at this time, ſéeing he is depriued of them
that ſhould defend him. The aged king <hi>Fredericke,</hi> his Father
<hi>Don Edward,</hi> nor his mother the Priuceſſe <hi>Flerida,</hi> could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
him from his determination, but contrary to their wils
he departed from the Court, taking his iourney toward <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
being armed after his accuſtomed maner, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in his Sheeld his vſuall deuiſe. Thus the happy ſucceſſe
which may fall vnto him, at this time we intend to leaue him,
becauſe we will returne to the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> who by his
time is wel néere the caſtle of the giant <hi>Almarol,</hi> hauing in his

him to a number of ſad coniectures, wherein he paſſed that
night as quietly as he could.</p>
                     <p>In the morning they rid on toward the Caſtle of <hi>Almaroll,</hi>
when <hi>Albayzar</hi> beganne to vſe ſome doubt of his entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

which were planted about the Riuer <hi>Theſin,</hi> and with all, the
walles of the Caſtle of <hi>Almaroll,</hi> but his heart was immeaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
touched with ſuddaine feare, remembring how many
ſtormes he had endured, and the perilles whereto he muſt now
render himſelfe againe afreſh, a ſpectacle certainely of woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

his Eſquire <hi>Armello,</hi> who had (ſince his departure (ſo well gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

<pb facs="tcp:13179:246" rendition="simple:additions"/>
amorous of <hi>Lardemia,</hi> the Damoſell attendant on the faire
Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> and ſtayed in that place to contemplate
the beauty of his beloued Miſtreſſe, rather then for any care he
had of his Maiſters ſhéeld and Armor, for he was gone ſo farre
ouer ſhoes in loue, as he had no other pleaſure then the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the Damoſell, who tooke great delight to ſée him ſo
gréeuouſly attached for loue.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Armello</hi> ſhas ſo ſet on fire in affection, as he could not know
his Lord and Maiſter, and ſome other cauſe there was to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, for that he was ſo, diſguiſed in blacke Armour, but
when he perceiued the Prince <hi>Floraman,</hi> and had likewiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpyed
the ſhéeld of the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> he preſently did
coniecture, that the blacke Knight, was his Lord the Prince
<hi>Florendos,</hi> to whom he reuerently drew néere, vſing theſe
ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>I hope (my good Lord) you haue no occaſion to hide your ſelf
from him, who hath ſuch earneſt affection to do you ſeruice, and
ſpecially hauing recouered ſo rare a Iewel, as is the Shéeld of
the faire <hi>Miragarda,</hi> at whoſe commandement, you made your
departure from this place, and well worthy is ſhe to be impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
of high ingratitude, if ſhe ſhould not now fauourably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
you, who hath ſo nobly and worthily deſerued.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Florendos</hi> being not able to conceale himſelfe any longer, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
his helmet, and then embraced his Eſquire <hi>Armello,</hi> to
whom he deliuered the Shéeld of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> willing him to
ſet it in the place where it was woont to ſtand, before that the
Prince <hi>Albayzar</hi> ſo diſcourteouſly tooke it away, and bad him
alſo take the Shéeld of the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana,</hi> and to ſet it at
the féete of the portraiture of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> which did not a little
offend the Prince <hi>Albayzar</hi> to behold.</p>
                     <p>At length came foorth of the Caſtle the Giant <hi>Almarol,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well Armed, and gallantly mounted on a white Courſer,
for he ſuppoſed that theſe thrée Princes came to demand the
Iouſt, but when he beheld the Shéeld of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> in the
place where it was wont to be, being ſuddainly abaſhed, he
knew not well what to ſay. At laſt he knew the Prince
<hi>Florendos,</hi> by reaſon that he had lifted vp the Beuere of his
<pb facs="tcp:13179:247" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Helmet, whereupon he caſt his Lance to the ground, and with
ſtretched out armes came and embraced the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi>
entertaining him with theſe words.</p>
                     <p>I did alwaies perſwade my ſelfe (worthy and renowned
Prince <hi>Florendos)</hi> that you would bring to end that honorable
exployte, which I now perceiue you haue happily atchieued, a
deſert ſo laudable and knightly, as the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda</hi>
cannot otherwiſe chuſe, but requite you with better entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then ſhe had done heretofore. And if ſhe continue her
former obſtinacy, &amp; vſe not that gratious acceptation towards
you, which your nobleneſſe doth worthily merite, and her due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
commandeth ſhe ſhould fauour you with all, I will ſo ſhake
the honour of her name with ſpéeches of importance, that the
world ſhalbe acquainted with her monſtrous vnkindneſſe,
who I hope will beare me company in iuſtly condemning her,
that can affoord ſuch great diſloyaltie to ſo good a Knight.</p>
                     <p>Thus breaking of his ſpéeches, &amp; without ſtaying to heare
the anſwer of the Prince, he preſently ran into the Caſtle,
where he declared to the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> the noble and
Knightly returne of her loyall Seruant <hi>Florendos,</hi> which
newes enflamed her heart with vnſpeakeable ioy, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

not able to withhold his choller any longer, he began to touch
her very highly with the Princely ſeruice of <hi>Florendos,</hi> how

the true teſtimony of an inuincible minde, which ſhe
countenancing with ſo ſmall regard, did notoriouſly impeach
herſelfe of ingratitude, and too iniuriouſly requite him that had
deſerued ſo well.</p>
                     <p>All theſe words did ſéeme nothing to moue her reſolute will,
but with a hardy countenance ſhe gaue ſhow to the Giant,
that ſhe was the Lady and Miſtreſſe of a ſelfe-willed conceit,

the Princes returne, but becauſe her modeſt ſhamefaſtneſſe

foorth of her preſence, very much accuſing her obſtinate minde,
and comming to the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> they could not hide the
great diſcourteſie of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> which the Prince contented
himſelfe withall, becauſe he was woont to haue no other enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement,

that the greateſt deſartes in the world were not ſufficient to
anſwere her beautie, neither that <hi>Florendos</hi> could endure too

                     <p>The two foremoſt Knights came ſinging very pleaſantly,
that the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi> tooke great delight to heare them,
and they accorded in ſuch good muſicke together, as the Prince

left their ſinging, and pulled downe the Beuers of

and when they came before the Trée where the ſhields hanged,

to breake a couple of Lances with me. I will doe my endeuour
as beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth a good knight, on condition he prouoke me not, to

that the Lady which oweth this faire Picture, would very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely
puniſh me, for offering offence to any of her Knights, as
contrariwiſe ſhee will entertaine them with eſpeciall fauour,
that take vpon them to enter the Combat for her: to whom the
Prince <hi>Florendos</hi> thus replied.</p>
                     <p>It were pitie Sir, to put you foorth of ſo good a minde, ſéeing
your ſtomacke ſerueth you ſo wel for the purpoſe, and becauſe I

am ready prouided for the Iouſt, I force not greatly to beſtow
the breaking of a Launce or two on you: and therefore take the
field at your pleaſure, for I will ſanctifie you in this requeſt.</p>
                     <p>With theſe words they parted to fetch their courſe, and met
together with ſuch force, that their Launces ſlewe vp into the

deſtitute of Launces, cauſed ſome to be brought forth of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
and being deliuered to their Eſquiers, they went and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
their Lordes withall, who valiantly met againe to breake
their Launces the ſecond time: but their encounter was ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible,
that the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi> loſt one of his ſtirroppes, on
which ſide he was in ſome danger, to haue fallen beſides his
horſe: Neuertheleſſe, the Knight in the gréene Armour meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his length on the ground, but he recouered himſelfe againe
quickly, and being out of meaſure diſpleaſed at his fall, drew his
ſword with theſe words.</p>
                     <p>Syr Knight, for that I made the meanes to ſummon you to
the Iouſt, albeit the foyle hath happened to me, yet am I not
offended thereat, ſo that you will now ſo much honour me, as
to let vs trie one another a while with our ſwords and if in the
ende it be your good hap to vanquiſh me, your valour ſhall haue
the larger eſtimation. I knowe not (anſwered the Prince
<hi>Florendos)</hi> how theſe Gentlemen in your company eſteeme of
your requeſt, becauſe I ſée them preparing themſelues to offer
me the Iouſt: therefore let my intreatie at this time per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
you from this deſire, in that we ſhall haue time enough
to trie our manhood together, when you ſhall not thinke your

                     <p>Thus concluding, he gaue his horſe the ſpurres, and ranne

Noble <hi>Florendos,</hi> you haue good occaſion to content your

who are your eſpeciall friends, and we would haue you know,
that we are not offended at our miſchance, being vanquiwed
by a Prince of ſo great and ſinguler proweſſe. And for that you
may be the better perſwaded of my words, you ſhall vnderſtand
that he which is ſo earneſt in prouoking you to the Combat, is
your déere friend the Prince <hi>Berold,</hi> the other is your own bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Prince <hi>Platir,</hi> who to their great paines (I thanke
them) haue honoured me in trauaile with their worthy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
as for my ſelfe, I am your humble Seruant the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi>
of the <hi>Obſcure Valley</hi> who had knowledge of you, ſo ſoone as I

their manifold and Knightly aduentures, which they lengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

of the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> who was ſo dainty in ſhewing
her ſelfe, as very ſeldome would ſhe come to the open window,
but looke forth at ſome priuy or ſecret place, for that her greateſt
felicitie was, when ſhe might ſée the fiield died with the blood
of thoſe, who came to contend for the ſingularity of beauty, in
triall whereof, ſhe was not a little proud that the victory retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
alwaies to her, which made her take the greater deilght,
when ſhe perceiued the liues of them that tried the Combats,
to ſtand in danger, which ſhe did oftentimes behold in the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry

                     <p>The Marriners were brauely decked with the colours of
their Ladie, whereof (I may ſay to you) they were not a little
proude, for that in behauiour they ſéemed ſo pleaſant, as no
accident what ſoeuer could haue power to change them: and
in theſe great ſhewes of delight, they brought their Boates to
the ſide of the Caſtle, continuing theſe ſwéete harmonie, which
by the Eccho of the water, gaue an acceptable noyſe to their
eares, who at the windowes of the Caſtle ſtoode to behold
them.</p>
                     <p>The two Princes, <hi>Florendos</hi> and <hi>Floraman,</hi> thought the
time too long, till they might haue further knowledge of theſe
Ladies but eſpecially the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> who being earneſt
in deſire to knowe the Knight in the Boate, caſting his armes
together, thus communed with himſelfe. I am of the mind that
the very e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>treameſt rigour of miſfortune is reſerued for me,
and that it is adioyned me to lament, when others reioyce, in
that I am daily and hourely toſſed in the ſurges of vncertaine
chanches, when each one elſe can haue harbour in the hauen of
happineſſe: and if I ſpeake amiſſe, let the world enter into
iudgement on me: firſt, the whole courſe of my life in Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeruice, and the reuerent dutie I haue alwayes borne to
my Miſtreſſe, yet what I haue gained in the one, I haue loſt
in the other, which is a ſpeciall argument, that I am altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vnfortunate. Hee would haue procéeded furder in ſecret
complaint, but <hi>Floraman</hi> ſtayed him with his friendly imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and ſo walking together, they behelde to come from the
Boate, where the Lady ſate, a very modeſt and ciuill Damoſel,
and out of the other Boate came two Eſquires, who after they
had vailed their bonnets to their Lady and Miſtreſſe, went or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
together before the Damoſell.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:254" rendition="simple:additions"/>
When they came before the two Princes, the Eſquires very
reuerently did their dutie to them, and the Damoſell gaue them
a very gracious ſalutation as ſhe paſſed by them: at laſt, they
came before the Trée where the Shieldes were placed, when
the Damoſell (beholding the portraite of the faire <hi>Miragarda)</hi>
turned to the Eſquires with theſe words.</p>
                     <p>This diuine motion of vnequall beautie, cauſeth me to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a hard opinion, which is that our Lady and Miſtreſſe
will returne as greatly diſpleaſed, as ſhe is arriued here with
ſuppoſe of pleaſure, for that the baſe Stone of Saint <hi>Vincents</hi>
Rocke, may not preſume to paragon it ſelfe with a pure and
perfect Diamond. So, ſhee procéeded on towards the Caſtle,
where, in the windowe (by reaſon of this ſuddaine aduenture)
the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda</hi> was very ſtately placed, before whom
ſhe ſhould haue deliuered her meſſage, but that ſhe was maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
damped by the glimpſe of her ſingular beutie, which was
an occaſion of her pauſing a while: a thing not ſtrange in wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who are quickly abaſhed at a ſimple cauſe, and therefore
the more worthy of a fanourable conceite, but after the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſel
had attained more hardineſſe (yet not without very mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
and ciuil baſhfulneſſe) ſhe ſaluted the Princeſſe <hi>Miragar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
with theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>Let it not ſéeme (faire Princeſſe) offenſiue in your gracious
eye, that I thruſt my ſelfe into your preſence after ſuch bold ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
for that countrey Maidens are ſildome acquainted with
courtly qualities, and beſide, a meſſenger is pardonable, becauſe
ſome audacitie muſt be vſed in declaring a meſſage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
preſuming on your noble fauour, I omit néedeleſſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixious
phraſes, becauſe they are not incident to the matter I
haue to diſcloſe, neither is it neceſſarie to offend your cares
with long and tedious proteſtations.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall therefore vnderſtand (moſt gratious Princeſſe)
that <hi>Arnalte</hi> the Princeſſe of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> my eſpeciall good Lady
and Miſtreſſe, by me kiſſeth the hand of your excellencie, who
for the deſire ſhe hath to doe you ſeruice, and to ſpend ſometime
in your ſo farre famed and commended company, hath béene
ſo bold to trauaile thus farre, and here ſhe is arriued with ſuch a

ſmall traine as attendeth on her, not daring to enter on land
or preſume to your Caſtle, before ſhe be firſt reſolued, if it
ſtand with your good liking to affoord her entertainement, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
being very loth to offend you, ſhe will returne from
whence ſhe came: to which words the Princeſſe thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
                     <p>Faire Damoſall, your requeſt is honeſt and commendable,
and for my part I eſtéeme very well thereof, but yet lyeth not
in me to grant your Ladies requeſt, which is no ſmall gréefe
vnto me: and I aſſure you, that the comming of the Princeſſe
of <hi>Nauarre</hi> is as acceptable to me, as the greateſt good Fortune
in the world beſide, that might happen to me: but as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
her friendly deſire, truſt me, the cuſtome of this Caſtle
is flatly againſt it, in that the entrance is as well defended
againſt women (whoſe company is very ſtrange here) as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
men, that daily imploy themſelnes in deeds of honour.
And if I (for the good affection I bare to your Lady and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe)
ſhould preſume on my ſelfe to breake the cuſtome, the
Giant <hi>Almaroll,</hi> whoſe authority here ſtretcheth further

I deſire you not to imagine any ill, in that I do not grant
to your Ladies requeſt, for there is great truſt committed to
thoſe Knights without, that (on their perill) none muſt enter
into this Caſtle. And ſo I pray you to returne my acceptable,
thankes to your Lady, excuſing me by my allowable anſwer
and this you may aſſure her, that my griefe is greater then ſhe
can iudge, or you imagine, in that I am deſtitute of the power
to accompliſh her courteous will.</p>
                     <p>Madame (anſwered the Damoſell) I ſhall not faile to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare

ſo that ſhe is highly bound to your courteous nature, in ſending
her ſuch a forewarning.</p>
                     <p>And ſo ſhe humbly tooke her leaue of the Princeſſe <hi>Miragar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
whoſe anſwer ſhe thorowly deliuered to her Lady and
<pb facs="tcp:13179:255" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Miſtreſſe, whereat ſhe receiued ſo great vnkindneſſe, as ſhe
would hardly ſuffer the Damoſell to report the allowable and
ſufficient excuſe of the Princeſſe, and ſhe grew into ſo great
melancholly, as neither one nor other might ſpeake vnto her,
which when the knight in the gréene Armour perceiued he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe,
and began thus to pacifie her.</p>
                     <p>Madame, you ought not to take in euill part, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<hi>Miragarda</hi> maketh réfuſall of your entry into her Caſtle,
for that perchance ſhe is a fraide, leaſt your beauty ſhould ſtaine
or blemiſh hers, and then you know (when ſuch a doubt ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in the way) ſhe ſhould ſéeme very vnwiſe, in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
hee caſe to ſo great hazard: wherefore I pray you, let this
perſwaſion (which I imagine to be the cauſe of your deniall)
ſo quietly content you, as no further choller remaine vpon your
ſtomacke.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words which the knight vſed, were of ſuch force in
the eares of the Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte,</hi> as ſhe contented her ſelfe
with the anſwer the Damoſell brought her: and becauſe ſhe
would not preſently depart thence, without ſeeing ſome further
occaſions, ſhe commanded the knight to go to the place where
the Shields hanged, and from thence to bring her the Shield,
wherein the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda</hi> was pictured, becauſe ſhée
would carry it away with her.</p>
                     <p>The knight eſteemed this commandement very highly, in

wherfore, without fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with the damoſell that carried the meſſage to the Princeſſe, to
whom when ſhe had made knowne his intent, ſhe preſently
went to the two Princes, <hi>Florendos</hi> and <hi>Floraman,</hi> whom
ſhe ſummoned with theſe words.</p>
                     <p>Gentlemen, the knight which you ſée, is come in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of my Lady and Miſtreſſe, deſireth you to ſend him the
Princeſſe <hi>Miragardaes</hi> Sheeld, for that his Lady would vſe it
in thoſe occaſions, which in her iudgement ſhe eſtéemeth to be
well thought on: and if you ſhould ſéeme ſo bold as to denie his
demand, and carry ſuch an opinion of your ſelues, as he may
not ſpéed of his purpoſe by faire meanes, know you then,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:255" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that he ſhall be conſtrained to fetch it away againſt your wils,
yea, in deſpight of any thing you dare doe to the contrary, which
truſt me he would be loth to doe, ſuch and ſo great is his gentle
nature, as he would not willingly offer iniury to any knight of
this Countrey: vpon theſe wordes the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi> thus
anſwered.</p>
                     <p>Gentle Damoſell, the Knight (as it ſéemeth to me) is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the daungers which this Shielde doeth promiſe to
him, who cannot content himſelfe to feede his eyes, with the
beholding and contemplating a thing of ſo rare beautie and
excellency, but hee muſt needes enter into ſo proude an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
as for his owne pleaſure or his Ladies, he muſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Shield away with him, and that there belongeth no more
to the matter but ſo: truſt me (faire Damoſell) the Lord hath
néede of him, and he himſelfe hath no néede of the Shield, if
he haue, hee may chance goe without it at this time, vnleſſe
he bring a larger Commiſſion, or get my good will to deliuer
it him, and commonly I am not accuſtomed to ſend a Shield
by a woman, becauſe it is a thing ſhe knoweth not how to vſe,
therefore, ſhe will haue it, bid him be ſo good as to fetch it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe you ſhall carry a ſound meſſage vnto him,
I pray you doe mee ſo much fauour as to let him vnderſtand,
that I will at this time, take the matter ſo hardily vpon
mee, as to defende the Shielde againſt the vttermoſt hee
can doe, when, if his Fortune ſerue him ſo well, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere

by his Proweſſe, I ſhall eſteeme my ſelfe the moſt fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
man aliue, for that when I looſe it, I ſhall looſe my
life, and then will my wonderfull vnfortunate race haue a final
ende.</p>
                     <p>Neuertheleſſe, you muſt let him vnderſtand, that ſéeing he
doth eſtéeme ſo well of his Lady, as (for her ſake) he will intrude
himſelf into deſperate aduentures, it is neceſſary he bring ſome
witneſſe or teſtimonie of her gratious fauour, which may bee

placed at the féete of this faire portraite, leaſt perchance for
want thereof, when the victorie ſhould chance to him, Fortune
doe turne her backe, and ſo his expectation may be vtterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued:
now you knowe my minde, you may depart and tell
him.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſell returned to the place where the Knight at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
to whom when ſhe had told the anſwere of the Prince,
<hi>Florendos,</hi> he tooke his leaue of his Lady, and accompanied
with two Eſquires, came brauely marching toward the prince,
to whom when he drew ſomewhat neare, he began very proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to vtter theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>I ſée well Sir Knight, that good counſell is not to be vſed
towards them, who are of ſo ſmall diſcretion, as they cannot
take it when it is offered: it is méete therefore, that they be
taught by diſcipline the principles of their duty, when friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perſwaſion is yrkeſome to their cares. I willed you by a

And for my Ladies fauour which you demand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

gazing on this delicate ſpectacle, as the Combate was quite and

he tooke him by the arme, and thus awaked him.</p>
                     <p>Sir knight, he that preſumeth to enter Combate with me,
ought not to be ſo forgetfull of himſelfe, as it ſéemes you are:
therefore either prouide to defend me, or I promiſe you I will

he happened to the paſſage, which was guarded by the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<hi>Arnaltaes</hi> knight, whereof two were vanquiſhed by his

                     <p>Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte</hi> well noting his worthy behauiour, as

accuſtomed to vſe towards them, who reſembled <hi>Dragonalt</hi> in

not curious in accepting his gentleneſſe, in that his preſence did
rather adde an eſtimation of honour of her, then impeach her of
any vndecent cauſe, wherefore all things being in a readineſſe,
with as much conuenient ſpéede as might be, ſhe ſet forward

ſo that in ſhort time they came to a Citie, ſtanding on the
bankes of the Riuer <hi>Theſin,</hi> which made two leagues from
the Caſtle of the Giant <hi>Almaroll,</hi> where they ſtayed till they
had prouided two Boates to paſſe along the Riuer, wherein
they came to the Caſtle of <hi>Almaroll,</hi> and <hi>Dragonalte</hi> had the

rid ſomewhat before the reſt) did preſently leaue her Coach,
and mounted on a goodly white Palfray, whoſe harneſſe was
very rich and coſtly to beholde: the Princeſſe her ſelfe, was
brauely attired after the <hi>Greekiſh</hi> faſhion, that ſhe might the
better delight the eyes of them which did behold her, her Robe
was of Carnation Veluet, very fairely imbrodered with paſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Lace of Gold, her Clocke was of Scarlet, cloſed before

ſet forth here coſtly Veſture, and beſide, the glimpſe of them ſo
ſweetly dazeled in her face, as the youthfull Knights, whoſe
thoughts were frée before from the aſſaults of loue, were now
ſuddenly entrapped with her ſingular beautie.</p>
                     <p>The Emperor, albeit he was farre in yeeres, yet he did attire
himſelfe very youthfully, to giue the greater grace to the yong
Princes that bare him company, ſo comming to the Princeſſe
<hi>Leonarda,</hi> he entertained her with very ſtately and accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

his Sonne, who kiſſed her hand in very gentle manner, and ſo
did all the other Princes that came with the Emperonr, whoſe
preſence witneſſing ſo great eſtate, did much content the mind
of the young Princeſſe, who was no ſmall deale abaſhed at the
great honour, which the Emperor did ſo nobly affoord her, as to
grant her licence to remaine in his Court, in remembrance of
which courteſie, ſhe would haue ſtouped downe to kiſſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors

honored by her preſence, would not ſuffer her to humble her ſelfe
ſo much, giuing her to vnderſtand in very friendly ſpéech, that
in her comming to abide in his court, he did accept it as a thing
of no ſmall contentation to him. Then ſetting forward on their

This Knight was mounted on a luſtie bay Courſer, hauing
attending on him two Eſquiers, one of them carying a Shield
couered ouer with cloath, ſo that the deuice thereof could not be
diſcerned, the Knight hauing eſpied the Emperour, ſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
one of his Eſquiers vnto him, who being come before the
Emperour, rained his Palfrey, and began to ſalute him in this
order.</p>
                     <p>My gratious Lord, the Knight whom you behold vnder
yonder Oake, is ſuppriſed with a maruellous earneſt deſire, to
trie againſt theſe Knightes of your Court, the renowned va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
which hath beene ſo much reported of them through the
whole world, and he willed me to certifie you, that it is a long
time ſince he bare Armour, or followed any Knightly aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
therefore he would now gladly make proofe of the good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
he holdeth of himſelfe, and becauſe he might the better
ſpéede in his purpoſe, and not be denied in his honeſt requeſt,
he is determined this day to guard this paſſage, not doubting
but he ſhall defend himſelfe ſufficiently, againſt any that dare
iudge ſo great hardineſſe in themſelues, as to paſſe by without
aſking him licence. Wherefore he humbly deſireth your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie,
that you would command your Knights to Iouſt with
him, for he hath promiſed to refuſe none of them, except the
Prince <hi>Primaleon</hi> your Sonne, againſt whom he will neuer
conſent to beare Armes.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour was ſo ioyfull at theſe tydings as might be,
and the rather he would conſent to the knights requeſt, for that
it was a meane, whereby the Princeſſe <hi>Leonarda</hi> might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
ſome pleaſure: conſidered alſo, that it did very well like
him, becauſe ſhe ſhould perceiue the noble valour and proweſſe
of the Knights that remained with him in his Court, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
opinion, that the Knight which had enterpriſed to guard
the paſſage, was one well ſeene in hautie exerciſes, he returned
the Eſquier this anſwere.</p>
                     <p>My friend, ſay vnto the Knight thy Maiſter from me, that I
freely giue him leaue to proceede in his honeſt requeſt, and I am
partly ſorte, that my aged yéeres will not ſuffer me to be one in
the number of thoſe, who (I am ſure) will hazard their honour,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:260" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to get libertie of thy Maiſter for the Princeſſe <hi>Leonardaes</hi> paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,
and in her company I promiſe thée will I abide, till ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they haue woonne it valiantly, or loſt it vnfortunately.
Then came he againe to the Princeſſe <hi>Leonarda</hi> (the Eſquire
being departed with this anſwer to his Maiſter) and to her he
began with theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>Madame, do you thinke it reaſonable, that any one ſhould

no more knights to Iouſt: but on a ſudden, euen as <hi>Francian</hi>

                     <p>Then when he ſaw, that all the Knights of the Emperours

that may happen, ſhe deſireth you to returne her Father good
words, but not forgoe the Prince <hi>Albayzar</hi> (whom you know
her lawfull huſband) before firſt your Knights be foorth of her

(as ſhe would be very loath) your Maieſtie may (as you ſée
cauſe) finde your ſelfe agrieued with the offenders.</p>
                     <p>Faire Damoſell (anſwered the Emperour) I accept very
gratefully the good aduice of the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana,</hi> and I ſée
very well, that the honour ſhe receiued in my Court (albeit it
was but ſmall) is now double and double rewarded: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
your ſelfe, that I am determined to follow her counſell.
The Emperour concluding his minde, the Damoſell came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to the Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi> to preſent her with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
commendations of the faire <hi>Targiana:</hi> but when ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde
the rare and ſingular beautie of the Princeſſe of <hi>Thrace,</hi>
which ſet by her, the damoſell tooke the hardineſſe to demaund
and if that Lady were not the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> for whom
and by whom, the Prince <hi>Albayzar</hi> was vanquiſhed.</p>
                     <p>In ſooth faire Damoſell (anſwered <hi>Polinarda)</hi> this is not the
Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> but this is <hi>Leonarda,</hi> the Princeſſe of
<hi>Thrace,</hi> whom the noble <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England</hi> deliuered out
of the enchantment, wherein ſhe remained a long and tedious
time: at theſe wordes the Damoſell tooke occaſion to beginne
thus.</p>
                     <p>By your fauour, Madame, I knowe now who this Lady is,
becauſe I haue not forgotten the ſtraunge aduenture of the
Cuppe, which was brought by a Damoſel into his Court: and
I aſſure you that <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was of a very ſtrange
nature, that he could both make ſo ſmall account of ſuch a faire
Princeſſe, as alſo in refuſing the ſtately gouernment of the

friendly giuen them to vnderſtand before, of the tidings which
were brought thither by the Ambaſſadour: who beiug arriued
at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Emperour ſent the chiefeſt Princes
and knights of his Court, to receiue him with very friendly and
courteous entertainment: but when the Damoſell heard that
the Ambaſſadour was come, ſhe preſently departed thence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Spaine,</hi> to go find out the Prince <hi>Albayzar,</hi> promiſing
the Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda</hi> to returne by <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> before
ſhe made her returne into <hi>Turkie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Emperour deſſred the Damoſell, to preſent the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of his good will to the king <hi>Recinde,</hi> as alſo to the Prince
<hi>Albayzar,</hi> and after that he had beſtowed diuers rich and coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
giftes on her, ſhe betooke her ſelfe to trauaile, being verie
glad, that ſhe was eſpyed by none of them which came with
the Ambaſſadour, who (as I haue already declared) was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in very Princely order, not as he were an enemie, but as
became beſt the eſtate of him, to whom he was ſent, who in
ſooth was of ſuch a noble and vertuous minde, as when he
ſhould deale roughly and extreamely with his enemies, hee
would entertaine them as his vowed and profeſſed friends, and
ſuch was his courteſie to this Ambaſſadour.</p>
                     <p>To the Emperours pallace he was conducted very worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
riding among the chiefeſt Princes and knights of the
Court, and the Emperour himſelfe (to doe him the greater
honour) came and receiued him at the gate of his Pallace: but
the proud <hi>Turke</hi> would not one vouchſafe to vaile his bonnet,
or offer any honourable ſigne to the Emperour, ſuch was his
malicious ſtomacke towards him, who had in no caſe offended
the <hi>Turke</hi> his Lord.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour perceiued well the ſmall regard he had of
him, by the words which the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana</hi> had ſent him
by her Damoſell, but yet he ſuffred him to do what he thought
beſt, vſing ſtill ſo great courteſie vnto him, as at laſt he was
conſtrained to ſhew more decent ieſture, when he preſented
the Emperour with a letter from his Lord the <hi>Turke,</hi> the

                     <p>You ſhall doe what you imagine conuenient in your owne

Ambaſſadour did lodge in the Pallace of the great <hi>Turke,</hi> that
he might the better fulfill his dutie in the charge committed
to him. I beſéech your grace (ſaid the <hi>Turk)</hi> to let theſe néedleſſe
ſpéeches goe, and remember your ſelfe of the hundred Knights
of your Court, which are held as priſoners by my Lord the
<hi>Turke,</hi> and ſée that you make ſome prouiſion for them, for my
Lord hauing them in his power (to reuenge diuers iniuries,
which he hath receiued by ſome of your Subiects) he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to put them to death: but to witneſſe his gratious and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

                     </p>
                     <p>But truſt me, you are to thinke your ſelfe in no ſmall fauour

the <hi>Turke</hi> had determined you ſhould neuer ſée againe, vntill
your Highneſſe had ſent him the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi>
that he might reuenge the iniurie which he (too forgetfull of

<hi>Targiana,</hi> a deed truly worthy of ſharpe puniſhment: the <hi>Turke</hi>

there pauſing, the Emperour tooke occaſion to beginne thus.</p>
                     <p>Certainly, I confeſſe my ſelfe greatly bound to the Princeſſe
<hi>Targiana,</hi> but farre more to the faire Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> in
that (had not her wiſe foreſight beene the greater) my Knights
had ſuffered the extreame rigour of death: but this I aſſure you,
(that ſince cruell Fortune had ſo throwne the Dyce on mee, I
rather would haue loſte twice ſo many more as they are, then
to ſend your Lord the <hi>Turke</hi> my Knight of the <hi>Sauadge man,</hi> in
the preſence of whome, here I faithfully promiſe to deliuer the
Prince <hi>Albayzar,</hi> prouided alwayes, that you make me ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
aſſurance of them, whome the <hi>Turke</hi> holdeth in vnkinde
ſeruitude, whereof (how I may be certainly perſwaded) I pray
you vouchſafe me the knowledge, how and in what manner the
caſe muſt be ordered.</p>
                     <p>The courſe which you muſt take in this matter, (anſwered
the <hi>Turke)</hi> is thus, your Maieſtie muſt ſend vnto my Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
and Lorde, the Prince <hi>Albayzar,</hi> vppon his inuiolable
Oath, which (by mee) he voweth to you, and which you may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of ſo great and ſufficient truth, and he will not faile (by ſo
great a bond) to ſend you the prince <hi>Polendos</hi> your ſonne, with
the other Princes and Knightes that are in his companie, and
this you may be bolde of, that my Lorde more willingly would
looſe his life, then falſifie his faith towards your Excellencie.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour leaning vpon his arme, and noting well the
words of the Embaſſador, pauſed a good ſpace, without making
any anſwere, which the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> perceiuing, being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
acquainted with the infidelitie of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> then the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
was: and fearing leaſt hee would haue giuen credite to
this ſubtill aſſurance, preſently ſtarted vp, and began as thus.
Moſt worthy Emperour, if you but conſider the cauſe why the
great <hi>Turke</hi> detayneth your Knights in Priſon, you ſhall well
perceiue the ſmal truſt you ought to repoſe in him, in that the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
was ſo little, and the aſſurance of his troth is much leſſe.</p>
                     <p>Againe, if you ſuffer the Prince <hi>Albayzar</hi> to eſcape vpon his
worde, you may chaunce (ſooner then you would) to repent your
ſelfe: For if you remember his vnfaithfull dealing to the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> in the time hee kept the Shield of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb facs="tcp:13179:267"/>
                        <hi>Miragarda,</hi> how (contrary to his vowed promiſe) he
brought it from the Caſtle of <hi>Almaroll</hi> in the night, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
with it into the Court, did brauely giue it foorth in ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
that he had woon it by his knightly endeuour, which diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
dealing he found in the end too coſtly.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is very neceſſarie, that the King <hi>Recinde</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
him more carefully then hitherto he hath done, in that
the libe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

your Knights. And if this Ambaſſador will take vpon
him to maintaine, that this meſſage which he preſenteth you
from the <hi>Turke</hi> his ſoueraigne, is onely with regard of royall
clemency, I will defend the contrary againſt him, yea, and
I will enforce him to confeſſe, that this proceedeth on the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
inſtance made by the ſubiects of the Prince <hi>Alb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

who are importune in ſute, to haue their Lord and gouernour
at libertie: for if it ſo fall out, that the <hi>Turke</hi> doe not ſatiſfie
this their continuall requeſt, he ſhall be conſtrained to guard
himſelfe from them, who were wont to defend him with their
eſpeciall aide. Knight (anſwered the Ambaſſadour) thou ſhalt
aſſuredly vnderſtand, and I promiſe thee by the authoritie of
my ambaſſage, which alloweth me to enter in armes againſt
thée, that I will not faile to make thée know, with what reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
thou oughteſt to entertaine, the vnreproueable word of
my Lord and Soueraigne, and I doubt not beſide, but to giue
due recompence to thy diſloyall and vnſeemely dealing: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> thus replyed.</p>
                     <p>It is the moſt acceptable thing I make account of, for thée to
enter the Combatte with me, in reſpect of good encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I haue thereto, and of the ſmall honor that will fall to thy
ſhare. The Emperour perceiuing his Nephew in ſo great chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere,
touched him with the Scepter which he held in his hand, to
the ende he ſhould procéed no further, and he was ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
offended, that he did giue ſo hard and rough ſpéeches: but
neuertheleſſe, hee eſtéemed well of his good Counſell, which to
maintaine, hee came to the Embaſſadour in this manner. You
ought not to be offended, when my knights aſſiſt me with their
good and carefull aduiſe, and eſpecially for the Prince <hi>Florian</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:267" rendition="simple:additions"/>
my Nephew, who is not ignorant long ſince of the cuſtome &amp;
maners vſed in the <hi>Turkes</hi> court. And for the great <hi>Turke</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
I haue that opinion of his faith and promiſe, as he hath
himſelfe, beleeuing well, that he would not for all the honour
he profeſſeth, violate or breake his word in any thing: but yet I
dare not build or aſſure my ſelfe thereon, leſt they (who now
are priſoners) take occaſion to complaine of my fond dealing,
remembring the hard vſage they haue all this while ſuffered.
Moreouer, if I ſhould preſume ſo venture ſo raſhly, the King
<hi>Recinde</hi> (I know) would not ſo willingly conſent with me,
whoſe ſonne is amongſt the Princes as a priſoner, &amp; til he haue
him in his owne aſſurance, he will not grant libertie to the
Prince <hi>Albayzar:</hi> wherefore you may thus giue your Lord to
vnderſtand, that if he will ſend me home my priſoned knights,
I will not faile to ſend him the Prince <hi>Albayzar:</hi> this requeſt
is but lawfull, and I promiſe on my honor to performe it. But
if it ſo chance, that he doubt of any faithfull dealing herein, I
will giue him a pledge of aſſurance, his owne daughter the
Princeſſe <hi>Targiana,</hi> who I am ſure will make anſwere for
me, as well for the perfect knowledge ſhe hath of my fidelitie,
as alſo for the deſire ſhe hath to recouer home her huſband:
the Ambaſſadour ſtanding a while muſing, at laſt replyed thus
to the Emperour.</p>
                     <p>I ſee well, that by the knowledge of ill doing, men attaine to
follow that which is good and lawfull, and ſo I take my leaue of
your excellency, aſſuring you, that the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana</hi> wil
aduenture her life, onely vpon your word and promiſe: in
that you withhold him who is her onely felicitie, and who hath
done ſuch noble ſeruice to my Lord her Father. In ſo doing
(ſaid the Emperour) ſhe ſhall very highly pleaſe me, and for the
good will I beare her, I pray you (on my behalfe, and with my
heartie commendations) to kiſſe her Princely hand: for ſuch is
the eſtimation I haue to her, as ſhe hath power to diſpoſe of
me, in anything ſhe taketh pleaſure to imploy me.</p>
                     <p>The Ambaſſadour made promiſe to fulfill his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when (with a courteous obeyſance) he tooke his leaue, and
departed from the Emperor, who (after his departure) ſate and

weakened and ouer-ſpent with yéeres, as
it ſéemed hee was ready to fall to the Earth. The Emperour
iudged him a perſon of ſome Authoritie, by reaſon of his goodly

great haſte, as hee had not the leiſure to take leaue of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe,
and his other Friends.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour fell into queſtioning with the Knights of his
Court, if any of them did knowe that Auncient man, in whoſe
company his Nephew <hi>Florian</hi> was ſo ſuddenly gon, but not one
of them all could report of whence, or what he was. <hi>Primaleon</hi>
was very much offended, that the Emperour his Father would
command his Nephew <hi>Florian,</hi> to depart ſo ſoone with the aged
man, not knowing firſt into what place, or to what aduenture
he would conduct him: wherevpon the very ſame day, <hi>Berolde</hi>
the Prince of <hi>Spaine, Platir, Blandidon, Pompides, Gratian,
Polinard, Reccamon, Albanis, Don Reſuel,</hi> &amp; all the other moſt
renowmed Knights of the Emperors Court, departed to folow
the Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> for that they feared leaſt any euill ſhould
happen to him, vnder the guilefull dealings of this Aged man.</p>
                     <p>When the Emperour ſaw his Court left deſolate (in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
of the noble Knights that was woont to kéep his company,
he found himſelfe very grieuouſly perturbed in minde, fearing

who rode on ſtill in the company of his Aged Guide, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

againe on Horſebacke, and reſted not all that day likewiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:269" rendition="simple:additions"/>
till they were come within the ſight of a fayre Caſtle, which

the eyes of them that did behold it, at the foote whereof a goodly
Riuer had his courſe, ſo déepe and dangerous, as they that went
vnto the Caſtle, were conſtrained to paſſe ouer in a very ſmall
Boate, wherein two men could hardly paſſe at one time. The
Aged man being very wearie with ryding, and deſirous to haue
a little eaſe, alighted from his Horſe, vſing his language in this
manner to the Prince <hi>Florian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the danger (Sir Knight) wherin we muſt hazard our
liues, if we be ſo bold as to venture our ſelues both together in
this little Boate: therefore I pray you that you will alight, and
you (for the more ſecuritie) ſhall paſſe ouer alone, then your Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyre
and I will come one after another, becauſe we will bring
ouer with vs the Horſes. You reaſon wel (anſwerd the Prince
<hi>Florian)</hi> in reſpect of your Aged and vnweldy péeres, as alſo in
wiſhing me for my beſt auaile, therfore I intend to follow your
counſell, for that I ſée neceſſitie compelleth vs to doo as you ſay.
At theſe words he diſmounted from his Horſe, and entred into
the little Boate, commanding him that had the charge thereof,
to paſſe him ouer, but ſcantly had he attained the middle of the
water, when ſuddenly ſuch a blacke and ougly clowde ouerſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
him, as the Aged man and the Eſquyre (being on land)
had loſt the ſight of him, which when the Eſquire perceiued, hée
was about to leape into the water to followe his Lord, but as
he was in this deſperate intent, he eſpyed a great Hill ſuddenly
before him, which would not ſuffer him to paſſe any further.</p>
                     <p>Vpon this, he turned to goe to the place where he left the aged
man, but he was ſo quickly rapt away and gone, as the Eſquire
could not poſſiby imagine which way he had taken, then the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquire
began to iudge, that the teares which the Aged man ſhed
in the preſence of the Emperour, was to no other end, but only
ſhadow the treaſon which he wretchedly we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t about, ſo there he
ſtood muſing a great while, and after he had canuaſed out a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
imaginations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a he concluded to ſearch his Maiſter about all
thoſe parts, and if it were not his fortune to find him, he would
then return to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Emperors court, to make known the vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

loſſe of his Lorde and Maiſter, to the ende that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(who were his Friends) might take vpon them to enquyre
after him, for ſuch was the opinion of this loyall Eſquyre, that
the diligent ſearch of a great many Knightes, might happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
his Lorde againe.</p>
                     <p>The Noble Prince <hi>Florian</hi> of the <hi>Forreſt,</hi> had no ſooner got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
the further ſide of the Riuer, but the Clowde conueyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the Boate (wherein he paſſed) in ſuch ſort, as hee could by
no meanes haue a ſight of it, wherevpon, hée began to aduance
himſelfe towardes the Caſtle that ſtood vppon the Rocke, not
fearing any daungers that might happen to him: but becauſe
the Rocke was high and troubleſome to climbe, and the Armor
hee had on very weightie withall, hee was conſtrained to reſt
himſelfe thrée or foure times by the way, ſo that the Night had
chaſed away the gladſome Day, before hee could arriue at the
Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>When hee came vnto the Caſtle Gate, there came foure ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
gallant Damozells to receyue him, and after they had cauſed
many Torches to be alighted, they ſhewed themſelues very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
to entertaine him into the Caſtle: which courteous offer
the Prince would not ſéeme to denye, for that the Beautie of
them did ſo much blinde him, as he had no minde on the Daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
that might ſuddenly happen, but hee fedde his Eyes with
beholding them altogether, as one that had his will free and out
of Bondes, becauſe hee would neuer greatly hurt himſelfe with
affecting Ladyes. With theſe Damoſells the Prince entered
into the Caſtle, the Court whereof was paued with fayre and
goodly Marble Stones, and when they had paſſed through this
Courte, they came into a very great Hall, which was builded
with maruellous Artificiall Antique worke, at the Entraunes
wherof, the Prince was receiued by a Damoſell, who had thrée
more attending on her, but ſhe was of ſo great and huge ſtature
as a Gyant, albeeit ſhee was indeede a Woman, and not paſt
ſixtéene yéeres of Age, a very gentle and milde natured perſon,
who tooke the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> by the hand, and lead him with
her into an other fayre Hall, which was hanged with Tapiſtry
of ineſtimable value.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:270" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Prince being come into the place where it pleaſed the
Damoſell to bring him, he then tooke off his helmet, when his
beautie ſéemed ſo acceptable in the eyes of the Damoſell, as at
that very inſtant ſhee gaue her whole affection vnto him, yet
was ſhe ſomewhat abaſhed, that ſhe ſhould eſteeme ſo well of
him, whoſe dealings was not vnknowne to her, neither of
whence or what he was: the conſideration whereof, turned her
ſuddaine good liking into as ſuddaine hatred &amp; diſdaine, which
ſhe would gladly haue diſſembled, and therefore thus beganne
to parly with him.</p>
                     <p>Sir knight, my heart is at this time greatly ſuppriſed with

that you will goe reſt your ſelfe for this night, becauſe your tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
doth require ſome eaſe, and to morrow morning I will
recite the cauſe, wherein you may doe me very much pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>Madame (anſwered the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi> I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
with my ſelfe, how déeply I am indebted for this excéeding
fauour, and how much I am bound to him that conducted me
to this place, where I reioyce that it is my good fortune to doe
you any ſeruice, which I account of ſo great honour, as were
my life of greater value then it is, I would hazard it in any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
perill, which your excellency did thinke well off to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
me.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſell (who was not accuſtomed to be entertained
with ſuch Courtly language) preſently returned him this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.
I thanke you Sir for your friendly offer, &amp; I pray you that
you would make a good Supper to night, that you may in the

we wil diſcourſe of that, which I haue occaſion to vſe your

hoping to ſpeede ſo well in the fauour of the Damoſell, as fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
cauſes of friendſhip ſhould ariſe betwéene them, it may be,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he thought to ſpéed ſo well with her, as he did of the Damoſell
which the <hi>Hermit</hi> rebuked him for, but what haue I to doe
with his ſecret intent. The Prince is in his chamber, ſet down
to ſupper, and there is very worthily ſerued by the Damoſels,
who gaue him entertainment at the gate of the caſtle, among
them all, he thought beſt of her which waited of the Cup, for
that in ſooth ſhe was very well adorned with perfect beautie,
which made him forget his former affection to the Lady of the
Caſtle, ſuch (you may perceiue) was his conſtancie in loue.
Well (in briefe) he began very queintly to deuiſe with this Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell,
and ſhe likewiſe mooued conceit with her companions,
the Prince glanced at her in amorous toying, and ſhe iybed
with him in double conſtruing, but Supper being ended, he
was brought by theſe Damoſels into his bed Chamber, where
(after he was in bed) ſhe (who had bene ſo famialiar with him
all his Supper time) came to him with theſe amiable ſpéeches.
Sir knight, if the time and place were ſo commodious vnto
me, as it is not, you ſhould well perceiue the good account I
make of you, but ſéeing Fortune is ſo aduerſe to my determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and the burning Lamps of affection, muſt be quenched
with a déepe and ſorrowfull ſigh, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>pray you accept of this
King, whereof I make no ſmall eſtimation, as an earneſt pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of further good will.</p>
                     <p>So concluding, ſhe left the King in his hand, and not atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Princes anſwer, ſhe departed after the other Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſells,
and he remained as well pleaſed as could be, by the
friendly language the Damoſell had giuen him, for the loue of
whom, he put the King on one of his fingers on his left hand,
but incontinent the Prince was ſo depriued of his power, and
brought ſo farre out of courſe with himſelfe, as he could not
moue or ſtirre any part of him, for there was a Stone in the
King of ſuch vertue, as he had no ſooner put it on his finger, but
preſently all naturall féeling was taken from him. The Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſelles
were no ſooner returned vnto their Lady, who was
named <hi>Arlencea,</hi> but preſently (bringing them in her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany)
ſhe came into the chamber where the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> lay, who
was ſo maruailouſly enchanted, as he had no power at all to
<pb facs="tcp:13179:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſcerne them, then ſpake ſhe vnto her Damoſels in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
I ſée now my friends, that our iourney is not imployed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
in vaine, and I iudge that my mother <hi>Colambia</hi> will
now liue in great contentment, hauing power to reuenge the
death of her ſons, <hi>Brocalon, Baleato, Calfurnien,</hi> and <hi>Cambol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
all my Brethren, but as ſhée pronounced theſe wordes,
ſhe caſt her eyes vpon the Prince, and ſéeing how young and
ſwéet his countenance was, ſhe entred into theſe termes. I am
greatly abaſhed, in thinking how ſo noble and valiant force
ſhould conſiſt in a knight of ſo young yeares, and if all they had
not the power to ouercome this one man, ſurely I muſt néeds
thinke good fortune was on his ſide, this matter doth mooue me
to a doubtfull opinion, and as it ſeemeth to me, his viſage is
ſomwhat comfortable vnto fortunes fauourites, which makes
me repute him, as neare allied to her by ſupernaturall affinitie,
and I aſſure you, I could very willingly remit the offences hée
hath done, if the death of my brethren did not prouoke mée to
ſéeke ſharpe reuengement on him, who was the death of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
good and hardy Knightes. Thus, regard of her enuie, and
his amiable perſonage, did mooue a ſecret contention within
her, willingly ſhe would haue ſaued him for his Knightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
but the loſſe of her brethren was ſo grieuous vnto her
as all fauourable pittie did quite and cleane forſake her, ſo that
ſhe was preſently minded to cutte off his head, but as ſhe was
at the very inſtant to doe the déede, the aged man (who was
ſent to ſéeke <hi>Florian,</hi> and had brought him thither) arriued there
before her, who knowing how to fit her fancie, preuailed ſo
much with her, as he changed her angry moode, wherevpon he
began as thus.</p>
                     <p>You haue no accaſion (Madame) to feare that the knight wil
eſcape from you, hauing brought him into ſuch an extreame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration,
wherefore, I pray you to change this ſharpe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
humor, and reſerue his life till you haue brought him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your Mother, who will take pleaſure in ſéeing him die, that
hath cut off the flowres of her honourable linage, and that we
may deliuer him the ſooner, I thinke it beſt that wee doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque
our ſelues, to goe ſéeke the Iſland where ſhe remaineth.</p>

Albeit my minde was otherwiſe bent (anſwered <hi>Arlencea)</hi>

Since I perceiue good Madame (ſaid <hi>Alfernao)</hi> that you

what a platforme I haue laid for you. It is ſo, that the knight
of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> is at this preſent, in the Court of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of <hi>Greece</hi> his grandfather, where he is growne ſo amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

will not I faile to bring him to you, to receyue ſuch due reward
as you ſhall thinke your ſelfe ſufficiently contented withall:

farre from the Caſtle, which the ancient Knight <hi>Alfernao</hi> had
named to the Damoſell <hi>Arlencea,</hi> wherein hee left her with
her companie, and tooke his way to the Court of the Emperour
of <hi>Greece,</hi> from whence (by the ſubtill meanes you haue hearde
before) hee brought the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> of the <hi>Forreſt,</hi> whome
hée deliuered into the Caſtle, where this <hi>Arlencea</hi> the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell
Giant made her abode, and how hee was vſed there, you
haue hearde declared alreadie. Nowe come wee to the place
<pb facs="tcp:13179:273" rendition="simple:additions"/>
where wée left, giuing to vnderſtand, that the Auncient Knight
on the next morning had prouided a Coatch, wherein (with as
much ſpeede as could be) they poaſted to a Porte of the Sea, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
leaſt by the way, the Knight of the <hi>Sauadge-man</hi> would
be knowne of ſome: but after <hi>Arlencea</hi> was imbarqued with
this good Knight, the Marryners hoyſed theyr Sayles, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a pleaſant gale of winde, they committed themſelues to the
mercie of the Seas: whereon we intend a while to leaue them,
and returne to the Eſquyre of the Knight of the <hi>Sauadge-man,</hi>
who fearing leaſt the Ancient Knight would offer ſome iniurie
to his Lord and Maiſter, failed not to take which way hee iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
would bring him to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Hee trauelled all the
firſt day, and Fortune was ſo vngentle to him, as hee could not
méete any perſon to demaund his way, but on the next day as he
paſſed ouerthwart a Forreſt, he perceiued vnder a trée Knight
very richly Armed, hauing in his Shielde (which was borne by
his Eſquire) a golden <hi>Tyger</hi> in a field of <hi>Sinople:</hi> wherevpon
hee preſently rode to the Eſquyre, whome when he behelde, he
knew that it was <hi>Syluian,</hi> and the Knight before him, to be the
Noble <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> whoſe preſence gaue the Eſquire
more aſſurance then he had before; neuertheles, with the teares
trickling downe his cheekes, hee beganne to the Prince after
this manner.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, albeit the newes I haue to declare vnto you, of
my Brother and my Maiſter the Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> bee not ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to you as I would they were, yet can I not but I muſt
needs report them, being perſwaded, that it is in you to remedy
this miſfortune which is chaunced to him. Then diſcourſed he
whole circumſtance of the matter to the Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> who
commaunded the Eſquyre, to bring him preſently to the place
where his Lorde paſſed the Riuer, to goe to the Caſtle, which
ſtoode on the high Rocke: hée being very grieuouſly paſſionate,
as well for the miſfortune which had happened to his Brother,
as alſo breaking his voyage to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to which place
his earneſt affection called him.</p>
                     <p>Then hee complained greatly on Fortune, who did applye
her-ſelfe (as hee thought) to no other ende, but onely to breake
<pb facs="tcp:13179:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his determined purpoſes, in dayly preſenting him with conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
perils, wherewith he could by no meanes eſcape without
great loſſe of his blood and danger of his life: in theſe gréeuous
agonies he fellowed the Eſquire, vſing as ſpeedy diligence as
might be, leaſt ſome ſhould offer his brother diſcourteſie, and
they arriued at the Caſtle on the next day about the euening
tide, when the Eſquire ſhewed the Prince the Riuer which he
could not paſſe, ſpeaking to him in this ſort.</p>
                     <p>You may now (my Lord) behold the dangerous paſſage,
where I loſt the knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> my noble Maiſter:
to which words the Prince made this anſwer. Curſed may
they be, that were the firſt inuenters of theſe cruell enchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the extremitie whereof, hath bene the ouerthrow of
many a good and hardy Knight, and hath made wretches and

                        </gap>owards to triumph in their miſfortune.</p>
                     <p>Then came they downe to the riuer, where the Prince <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
and the Eſquire could not finde any Beate for prſſage,
nor yet the man that had conuyed the Prince ouer, by reaſon
whereof, they went along by the Riuers ſide, till they came
to a place where the water parted in twaine, and an entrance
there was into a little Iſle, whereto the Prince prepared
himſelfe to goe, as he ſounded the depth of the Foord: but a
Knight (who had couered his armour with the Skinne of a
wilde Beaſt, which he had ſlaine) cryed aloud to the Prince in
this manner.</p>
                     <p>Noble <hi>Palmerin,</hi> be not ſo hardy I deſire you as to paſſe ouer
for the water is farre more déepe then it ſéemeth, and you may
ſuddenly fall into vnrecouerable danger: which to preuent, I
counſell you to goe downe a little further along by the Riuer
ſide, and I will not faile to ſhew you the place, where you may
goouer in moſt ſecuritie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> well noting the words of the Knight that ſpake
to him, preſently ſtayed his horſe, and maruailing who this
Knight ſhould be, at laſt he knew him to be his brother the
<hi>Sage Aliart,</hi> whereupon he came to his brother <hi>Florians</hi> Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
and commanded him to goe to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſtay
there, for that his preſence did hinder him, when he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb facs="tcp:13179:274" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to conferre with <hi>Siluian</hi> about the faire <hi>Polinarda,</hi> and
he tolde him, that he ſhould ſooner heare tydings of his Maiſter
at the Court, then in any other place.</p>
                     <p>The Eſquier would haue gladly kept the Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi>
company, but he would in no wiſe ſuffer him, but commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to goe to thoſe places, where he might ſooneſt haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of his Lord, and ſo the Prince departed from him,
when, in ſmall time he came to a place of the riuer, which was
more broade and leſſe déepe, then the knight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ried againe vnto
him, that he might there venture hardly, becauſe it was the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
place of paſſage.</p>
                     <p>The Prince ſtaied not, but on the aſſurance he had in the
Knights word, he entred the Riuer, which was not ſo déepe,
but they paſſed ouer very eaſily, the rigor of the water hauing
not the power to hurt the Prince, ſo they recouered the other
ſide ſafe and ſoundly, which the Knight perceiuing, he came
and offered himſelfe to take the Princeſſe horſe, but he would
not ſuffer him, then he alighting, came &amp; embraced the Knight
with theſe words.</p>
                     <p>What ſhould I thinke my Lord and Brother, that you ſo
friendly come to ſuccour me in my greateſt néede? certainely I
may aſſure my ſelfe, that <hi>Florian</hi> my Brother, ſhall be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from his preſent danger, by your meanes, which is of ſo
great authoritie, and furniſhed with ſo high &amp; ſingular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
My gratious Lord (anſwered the <hi>Sage Aliart)</hi> is it
your cuſtome, not to make any account of any miſchance that
may happen, becauſe you imagine that your knightly proweſſe
is able to aduantage you in euery attempt, but I pray you
at this time to forſake ſuch opinion of your ſelfe, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
that <hi>Florian</hi> your brother is in great danger of looſing
his life, for which I am very hartily ſory, in that Fortune
would not ſuffer me to finde him in this place. But ſo it is (as
I haue gained the knowledge by peruſing my Bookes) that a
Knight did cauſe him to forſake the Emperors Court, to bring
him hither to this Caſtle, rendring him into the handes of a
Damoſell Giant, the Daughter of <hi>Collambra,</hi> who is mother
to the Giants, <hi>Calfurnien, Camboldam, Brocalon,</hi> &amp; <hi>Baleato,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:275" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whom you and your brother <hi>Florian</hi> haue ſlaine.</p>
                     <p>It ſéemes to me (ſaid the Prince <hi>Palmerin)</hi> that we ſhould
forſake this Caſtle, and prepare our ſelues towards the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Iſle,</hi> to embarque our ſelues, to trie if Fortune will ſo
much fauour vs, as to permit vs his recouery: but I feare me
ſome miſfortune is come to him already, the feare whereof
confoundeth me in extreame griefe: whereto the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi>
thus replyed.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, it is not neceſſary that we ſhould goe trifle the
time in the <hi>Profound Iſle,</hi> for if <hi>Florian</hi> be loſt, this will be the
greateſt hazard that can come vnto vs, wherefore I thinke it
moſt conuenient, that you doe your endeuour to ſéeke him
foorth, not ſparing day and night to trauaile: and I will take my
courſe another way, wherein I will vſe ſuch diligence, as I will
aduenture my life for him.</p>
                     <p>I beléeue wel (anſwered the Prince) that you will not ſpare
any aduice, which may in any thing profite my Brother, and
therefore I am determined to follow your counſell: wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they rid away very ſpéedily, vntill they came where two ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
wayes cauſed them to part from one another,
when they ceaſed not to trauell earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for that the loſſe of the

grieuous to
them.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thou ſéeſt well (my truſty friend and ſeruant) that Fortune

if the time do not afford me contrary ſucceſſe. But if my

and giue my Lady and Miſtreſſe <hi>Polinarda</hi> to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that I cannot make any account of my ſelfe, looſing the

                     <p>Moreouer, thou ſhalt aſſure her, that the ſum of my felicitie,

                     <p>But now that death hath depriued me of the meane, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

it is ſo, that attending this long expected honour of felicitie, I
know not how it can be poſſible for me to liue, being abſent
from her heauenly preſence. For when I remember how in
times paſt, I haue often vſed to behold her delicate Face, now
(being fo farre from that happy meane) my griefe encreaſeth ſo

Therefore I deſire thee <hi>Siluian,</hi> to preſent her my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted

                     <p>Thus breaking off his dolorous complaints, he remained
ſo gréeuouſly afflicted in his ſpirit, as the teares which aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
trickled downe his chéekes, rendered a certaine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of his troubled heart, which he being willing to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(leſt <hi>Siluian</hi> ſhould perceiue it) he gaue his horſe the ſpurs,
and without any more words departed thence, leauing <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian</hi>
ſo mightily ouercome with heauineſſe, as he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained

himſelfe, he mounted on his Maiſters horſe, which he doubted
would not bring him to the <hi>Profound Iſle,</hi> becauſe he had bene
ſo ſore trauailed already by his Lord and Maiſter.</p>
                     <p>This good Eſquire riding on very ſad and penſiuely, at laſt
ſpyed two Knights, whom he knew by their deuices in their
Shéelds and their Armor, to be the Princes, <hi>Berold,</hi> and <hi>Platir</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:277"/>
to them he called, and deſired that it might pleaſe them to ſtay
a little: whereupon, the Knight (who knew him preſently)
ſtaied, being abaſhed to ſée him ſo badly horſed, but when they
perceiued the teares run downe his chéekes, then they began
to doubt ſome further harme, which made them demand of him
for his maiſter, as alſo what happened to him, to be in that caſe.</p>
                     <p>My Lords (anſwered <hi>Siluian)</hi> I know well how to reſolue
you to your demand, though the report be not ſo agréeable to
you as I could wiſh: then he diſcouered to them the miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> and how his Lord was ridden after
him, to giue him ſuccour. But the aduenture is ſo dangerdus
(ſaid <hi>Siluian)</hi> wherein my Lord muſt aſſiſt his brother, as his
life will ſtand to extreame hazard, before he can helpe him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as he would: and beſide, it is doubtfull he ſhall come too
late, becauſe his horſe will hardly hold out: to which words <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir</hi>
thus replyed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Siluian</hi> your Lord is ſo fortunate, and hath finiſhed ſuch rare
and incredible aduentures, as I will not be perſwaded, but
that he will deliuer out of danger his brother, the hardy <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
of the <hi>Forreſt:</hi> and therefore content thy ſelfe, for he which
had the power to end ſuch noble exploits as he hath done, I
am ſure cannot faile this preſent occaſion. But for the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> truſt me, it did not a little offend
me, and being now by you aduertiſed, that (without preſent
aide) he is in danger to be loſt, both I and my companion
will not faile to follow him, becauſe it were againſt reaſon to
looſe ſo good a Knight: and go you to the place (which you tell
vs) the Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> hath commanded you, and there ſhall
you likewiſe heare tidings of vs, ſo ſoone as we ſhall poſſibly
haue the commoditie to ſend to you.</p>
                     <p>The Prince <hi>Platir</hi> vpon theſe words tooke his leaue of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uian,</hi>
when he and his companion rid away very haſtily, where
(to the ſucceſſe of their iourney) we will leaue them, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
we forget the knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> who (after he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from <hi>Siluian)</hi> made ſuch diſpatch of way, as at length he
came to a little Village by the Seacoaſt, where he entred a
<hi>Venetian</hi> Gally, to paſſe by Sea to the Iſland of <hi>Collambra,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:277" rendition="simple:additions"/>

they were, the Princes, <hi>Berolde</hi> and <hi>Platir,</hi> likewiſe arriued
there, entending to beare <hi>Palmerin</hi> and the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in their voyage. But when they vnderſtood, how the Prince
<hi>Palmerin</hi> deſired to trauaile without their company, they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued
themſelues with the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi> and ſetting forth of
the hauen together, they kept company with the ſight of one
another, vntill the darke night did ſeparate them aſunder: for
the winde riſing againe, kept them (in ſhort time) ſo farre
<pb facs="tcp:13179:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aloofe the one from the other, as they had cleane loſt the fight of
any land, yet they ſailed on couragiouſly, not dreading the furie
of any winde nor rough billowes of the water, to the mercy
whereof we intend to commit them.</p>
                     <p>The courſe of our Hiſtory willeth vs now to returne to the
redoubted Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> who was conducted to
<hi>Collambra,</hi> in the order as I haue told you before, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of <hi>Ailencea,</hi> the Damoſell Giant, who ſayled
with ſuch a ſpéedy pace on the Sea, as her pleaſure was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then I can ſpeake of, for that ſhée had in her cuſtodie the
Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> with whome ſhée (and thoſe that
bare her company) in foure dayes, and ſoure nights (being ſo
fauoured of the winde and weather) came within the ſight of
the Iſland, where the proude Gianteſſe <hi>Colambra</hi> made her
reſidence: into whoſe handes, Fortune would not ſuffer to
fall the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> but raiſed ſuddenly ſuch
a mightie tempeſt, as they were all in doubt to be caſt away,
and in little more then an houre, they were caſt ſo farre from
the Iſland, as the Pilot could not iudge into what countrey the
winde had driuen them, by reaſon whereof, both he and the
Marriners remained ſo far out of quietneſſe, as they could not
tell to what Saint they ſhould commend themſelues for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
ſuccour.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Arleneea</hi> perceiued this ſudden alteration, ſhée was
likewiſe ſo inwardly vexed, as ſhe wiſhed that ſhe had neuer
ſéene the Prince <hi>Florian,</hi> for ſhe had none in her company that
could promiſe her any ayde, except it were <hi>Alfernao,</hi> and hée
was ſo worne with age, as he could leſſe helpe then any of the
other: then ſhe beganne to encourage the Pilot to defend her in
cauſing the marriners to make expedition, but al was in vaine,
for their hearts did ſo faint, and their ſtomackes ſo failed them
(ſeeing ſo great danger and trouble towards them) as the ayde
which they ſhould haue giuen to remedy this doubtfull trouble,
was not of any account at all, and their vnderſtanding did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
them ſo amazedly, as they knew no way to helpe the perils
extant before their eyes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alfernao</hi> ſéeing the Mariners ſo out of heart, came to <hi>Arlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:278" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with theſe words. Madame, I deſire you not to abaſh your
ſelfe, for in the aſſurance of your excellency conſiſteth all our
liues: and for this miſfortune which hath come vpon vs, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to them cuſtomably which frequent the ſeas, and though
now you ſee the waters ſo rough and impatient, in a moment
you ſhall ſée them calme enough againe. Wherefore, I pray
you come forth of your Chamber, to the end the Pilot and the
Mariners may behold you, for I am perſwaded that in ſéeing
you, they will receiue a freſh encouragement.</p>
                     <p>In this order as I tell ye, <hi>Alfernao</hi> did endeuour himſelfe
by friendly counſell (as much as in him lay) to cauſe her forget
this fearefull motion, and <hi>Arlencea</hi> (at the requeſt of <hi>Alfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nao)</hi>
came preſently out of her Chamber: but when ſhe beheld
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> furiouſneſſe of the water, ſometime liſting the Ship vp, as
it were to heauen, and then throwing it downe againe to the
depth of hell, the water likewiſe beating in aboundantly, her
heart would not ſerue her, to kéepe the Mariners any longer
company, but ſhe went in againe to her Chamber, ſo full of
diſpaire and fearefull frightings, as (being not able to ſuſtaine
her ſelfe) ſhe laid her downe vpon a pillow betwéene two of
her Damoſels, when, wéeping very bitterly, ſhe entred into
theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>I ſée well <hi>Alfernao,</hi> the ſmall recompence they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
which enterpriſe ſuch déeds as are diſhonourable and far
from dutie, and I beléeue certainely, that the Diuine powers
are determined to puniſh vs, for the great iniury and diſloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
we offer, in ſéeking the death of this good and hardy knight,
who ſlue my brethren one after another in plaine fight, not
offering or taking any aduantage of them: which hautie
derds, albeit I cannot let them paſſe without great maruell,
yet do they make me verily thinke, that he fought in a good
and a lawfull cauſe, in that he deſpiſed the exceeding crueltie
and tyranny, wherein my proud and preſumptuous brethren
liued, which diſorder of life, being rightly chaſtiſed by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe

And we being forgetfull to ſift the iuſtneſſe of the cauſe, goe
<pb facs="tcp:13179:279" rendition="simple:additions"/>
about to depriue this good Knight of his life, in the reuenge of
whoſe innocencie, the wrathfull anger of the Heauens is fallen
vpon vs: wherefore, to auoyde and flie the extremitie betime,
leaſt wee fall into a woorſe inconuenience, I am reſolued to
chaunge my angrie moode, thinking it better to take the Ring
from him, which cauſed him to ſléepe ſo ſoundly, then thus to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
the ſharpe countenance of the wreakefull powers, whome
(whether I will or no) I muſt obey.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arlencea</hi> hauing ſpoken what pleaſed her, commanded the
Chamber doore to be opened, where the knight of the <hi>Sauadge-man</hi>
lay, and when ſhe had taken the Ring from him, hee was
in as good eſtate as hee was before, yet not without great mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
in himſelfe, when he perceiued he was in a ſhip on the Sea,
and ſo compaſſed about with faire Damoſells, who wept verie
grieuouſly, to ſee themſelues in ſo great daunger. The Prince
in this amazement, came foorth of his Chamber, when he ſaw
how the furious waues of the Water did toſſe and turmoyle
their Barke, and how the Pilot, the Marriners, and euery one
in the Ship, theyr harts were dead, becauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

how to helpe themſelues: Wherupon he beganne with noble
words to chéere and encourage them, but the extream feare they
had generally conceyued, cauſed them to make ſmall eſtimation
of his words.</p>
                     <p>Then was he more and more abaſhed, but eſpecially to ſée
himſelfe in ſuch a place, where it was the leaſt parte of his
thought to haue come, and how he came ſo Embarqued from the
Caſtle, where the Damoſells came and entertained him ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
friendly at the Gate thereof. This ſtrange aduenturs
made him oftentimes deſirous to demund how and after what
ſort he chanced thither, but the danger which hee ſaw imminent
before his eyes, would not affoord him ſo much leiſure, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
him to ſettle his thoughtes on that which was more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie.

Madame, I would I might intreate you to forſake thoſe
fearfull paſſions, and to regarde him who eſtéemeth maruellous
well of your diuine Beautie, the tempeſt beginneth by little and
little to looſe his force, and therefore let my perſwaſion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
appeaſe you, for theſe teares wherewith you offend your
gratious countenance, is as grieuous for me to beholde, as it is
bootleſſe for you ſo much to hurt your ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Arlencea</hi> hearing the courteous language of the Prince,
and noting withall his ſéemely countenance, reioyced that ſhee
had ſo ſpared his life at the intreatie of <hi>Alfernao,</hi> and the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reuenge which ſhe ſought before, was now changed againe
into good opinion of Loue, whereat the Knight of the <hi>Sauadge-man</hi>
was very well pleaſed, but <hi>Alfernao</hi> remained moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly
paſſionate, knowing well that his enterpriſe could come
to no good ende.</p>
                     <p>The Night being ſpent, at the breake of day the tempeſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,

in the hearing, and while he ſate vttering ſilent complaints
to himſelfe, the Pilote diſcouered the Cittie of <hi>Malaga,</hi> which
then was helde and kept by the <hi>Turkes:</hi> then the Prince tooke
<hi>Arlencea</hi> by the hand, and led her foorth on the hatches to ſhew
her the land, when cauſing her to ſit downe, he deſired her that
ſhe would report vnto him, after what manner he was brought
into the Shippe, wherein he had ſlept ſo long, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Worthie Syr (aunſwered <hi>Arlencea)</hi> ſo that it ſhall pleaſe
you to let all former angrie occaſions paſſe, and pardon what I

deſire, and therewith aſſuring you, that Loue hath brought
mee into ſuch eſtate, and hath mooued ſuch a forcible affection in

trueth from you. Then ſhée recounted at large the whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe
of <hi>Collambra,</hi> and the aged Knight <hi>Alfernao,</hi> whoſe

Madame, the deſire wherewith I came to doe you ſeruice,
did not deſerue the vnkinde dealing wherewith you haue vſed
me, but ſince it is ſo, that my trauaile hath béene imployed in
vaine, I deſire you to affoord me ſo much fauour, as to report
the guile whereby <hi>Alfarnao</hi> brought me hither, who I knowe
was perſwaded to commit me to the cruelty of your Mother,
which ſhould be ſo great towardes me, as nothing would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
her but my death. And let it not offend you, that I goe
into my chamber to arme my ſelfe, becauſe I will compell all
theſe in your company vnder my obeyſance: and this you may
perſwade your ſelfe, that I will not forget your gentleneſſe in
any trauaile whatſoeuer, but will maintaine your excellency,
being ſo bound by your good deſertes, whereto <hi>Arlencea</hi> thus
replyed.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, I deſire you to conſider, that your ſingular courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
ioyned with the vnfained good will I beare you, cauſed mee
to diſcouer this damnable treaſon intended againſt you, which
I thought too vnkind for him, to whom I could find in my hart
to ſubmit my ſelfe: in recompence whereof, I deſire you would
remember, that I ſhall not onely looſe the preſence of <hi>Collam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi>
my Mother, and likewiſe my patrimony, but alſo I ſhall
receiue ſuch a common bruite of ill report, as euery one will
wound me with malicious ſpéech, in yéelding my ſelfe into your
hands, who haue ſo cruelly ſlaine my Brethren.</p>
                     <p>Madame (anſwered <hi>Florian)</hi> I pray you forget the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of looſing your Mothers fauour, or any other ſuch opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
in regard of the good may happen to you, for if Fortune
fauour me no worſe then ſhe hath done, I wil not faile to make
a double requit all of your kindneſſe: and that you may repoſe
the better aſſurance on my words, I here proteſt my ſelfe at
your commandement.</p>
                     <p>In the meane time, while <hi>Florian</hi> ſpent the time in this
talke, he vnderſtood how they in the Shippe went about ſome
enterpriſe againſt him, by meanes whereof he left <hi>Arlencea,</hi>
but ſhe followed him into his Chamber to helpe to arme him,
and ere he had girded himſelfe in his Mayle coate, <hi>Alfernao,</hi>
with foure other in his company, came to the Chamber doore
<pb facs="tcp:13179:280" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to lay hands on him, but they miſſed of their purpoſe, for <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
comming to them, by maine ſtrength thruſt them foorth of
the Chamber, with theſe wordes. The time is now come <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernao,</hi>
wherein thy traiterous dealings ſhall be worthily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced.</p>
                     <p>Then lifting vp his ſword to haue ſmitten him, the other
fiue ſtepped before and defended him, wherewith the Prince
was ſo much mooued, and he beſturd himſelfe ſo among them,
as two of them quickly tumbled at his feete, the other two ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that, and knowing the ſmall pittie <hi>Florian</hi> would ſhewe
them, tooke heart afreſh, and came to the Prince, aſſailing him
couragiouſly, but he laying before them the treaſon of olde <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernao,</hi>
gaue them ſuch cruell and terrible ſtrokes, as he cut off
the arme of one of them hard by the ſhoulder, and the fourth (for
feare) was glad to leape into the Sea.</p>
                     <p>Then <hi>Alfernao</hi> ſeeing his life brought into ſo great danger,
came and humbled himſelfe before <hi>Arlencea,</hi> in this manner.
Madame, if the vnfained loue I haue alwayes vſed, in doing
ſeruice to your mother and your ſelfe, deſerueth any gratious
reſpect, then is it neceſſary that you affoord it me, and if that
loyaltie ought to be recompenced as it hath worthily merited,
then I deſire you to intreate for me the fauour of this Knight,
for your word (I knowe) may preuaile ſo much with him, as
his anger will be pacified, and my life ſaued.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſell Giant was ſo amazed at the noble proweſſe
of the Prince, as ſhe knew not how to addreſſe her ſelfe to him
to mooue intreatance, but being (as it were) in a quandarie,
had not power to anſwere <hi>Alfernao,</hi> nor yet to fulfill what he
had requeſted: neither would <hi>Florian</hi> deale extreamely wiſh
him, ſéeing him on his knées before <hi>Arlencea,</hi> for whoſe ſake
he thus began.</p>
                     <p>Truſt me, Madame, <hi>Alfernao</hi> had good Fortune to render
himſelfe to you, for that you haue the power to preſerue his
life, contrary to his deſerts, if I ſhould goe to the vttermoſt.
<hi>Arlencea</hi> did maruellouſly eſtéem the great humanitie, which
the Prince vſed to <hi>Alfernao,</hi> who (at her commaundement)
was put in ſure guard, fearing leaſt he ſhould practiſe any
<pb facs="tcp:13179:281" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more treaſon, and the Prince beganne to eſtéeme very well of
<hi>Arlencea</hi> (according as her honeſt and vertuous nature deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
as well for the laudable bountie of her gentle minde, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
for vſing him ſo kindly as ſhe had done: but albeit he was
ſubiect to voluptuous pleaſure, yet beholding the chaſt regard
this Damoſell had of her ſelfe, ſhe bridled her affection, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to beſtow her as wife on his great friend the Giant
ant <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> for he iudged it the part of a friend, to wiſh
ſuch an one to his friend, as hee knew to be acquainted with
vertue and chaſtitie, and to ſubdue that wicked deſire in
himſelfe, which ſhould mooue him to violate his faith to his
friend.</p>
                     <p>And for the Damoſell her ſelfe, albeit ſhe preferred the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

ſtraine of her abilitie, yet had ſhe an eſpeciall regard of

his faire company, and the firſt day, ſomewhat towards the
euening, they arriued within a faire and goodly valley, well
<pb facs="tcp:13179:282" rendition="simple:additions"/>
furniſhed with Trées, where, comming neare to a pleaſant
Fountaine, they eſpied where two ſeuerall Tents were pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and not farre from them, they beheld foure Damoſelles
walking for their recreation vnder the gréene trées, to ſhroud
themſelues from the parching heate of the Sunne: vpon which
occaſion, <hi>Arlencea</hi> thus ſpake to the Prince.</p>
                     <p>If I iudge (amiſſe good Sir) theſe Damoſels I coniecture
receine farre greater pleaſure then I, in that they are frée to
their contentation, and I haue put my libertie into his hands,
who maketh but ſmall account thereof. The prince made ſhew
as though he vnderſtood not what <hi>Arlencea</hi> ſaid, wherefore to
change her preſent fantaſie, which procéeded of the intire loue
ſhe bare to him, in other familiar talke he paſſed away the time
vntill they came ſomewhat neare to the Tents, which were as
rich and faire as could be deuiſed: and while <hi>Florian</hi> ſtood ſtill
taking pleaſure to behold them, a Damoſell came and vſed this
conference with him.</p>
                     <p>Me thinkes it is a thing very ſtrange (Sir Knight) that
one man ſhould take vpon him to conduct fiue Damoſelles, in
that it cannot chuſe but be a very great charge, whereof I will
ſomething eaſe you, if ſo be it ſhall like you to follow my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell,
which ſhall not be to your diſaduantage: wherto the prince
thus anſwered.</p>
                     <p>Albeit I cannot thinke ill of your courteous ſpéeches, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you kindly come to ſalute me, yet ſhall you not perſwade
me to any thing, except it be accompanied with vertue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie:
therefore I deſire you to ſatiſſfie mée of your opinion,
which ſtanding with reaſon, I ſhall not faile to follow, as one
that would not willingly diſobey any good counſell. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
(ſaide the Damoſell) to an were your demaund, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you ſhall vnderſtand, that we are foure Damolles, and
are garded here by foure knights, who will not be long before
they come hither, with whome (if you pleaſe, you may try the
I ouſt, and which of them ſhall happe to be vanquiſhed, muſt of
neceſſitie deliuer you his Lady, and you muſt be content to doe
the like, if Fortune denie you the fauour of victorie: but if ſhe
reſpect you with her friendly eye, and allowe you for her happy
<pb facs="tcp:13179:283" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conquerour, all we foure ſhall be deliuered to you, which cannot
be greater hinderance vnto you, in conducting nine ladies, then
theſe fiue. On the other ſide, if Fortune throwe you in diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and commit you to our knights as vanquiſhed, foure
of theſe Ladies muſt be taken from you, but the fift you ſhall be
ſuffered to enioy ſtill: thus you ſée the I ouſt cannot be any way
diſagréeable to you, for which way ſo euer it happens, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
lacke both pleaſure and profite.</p>
                     <p>Gentlewoman (anſwered the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi>
you ſéeme ſo well acquainted with gentle behauior, as to gaine
you, I will ieopard the aduenture to looſe my ſelfe: and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
you I thinke the time too long, vntill I haue made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of you: whereto the Damoſell made this anſwere. I
pray you ſir, doe not thinke you ſhall purchaſe vs ſo lightly, in
that the deſire you haue to defend thoſe Ladies which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
will hardly permit you to ſpéed ſo ſoone, ſuch hardy valour
you ſhall finde in thoſe Knights, which haue attempted to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
vs.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſell had no ſooner ended her words, but a Dwarfe
(being néere at hand vnderneath a trée) began to ſound a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
which he did with ſo high a note, as it brought a gallant
Eccho from the whole valley: then the Prince looking aſide, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpied
foure knights come prauncing along the valley, armed in
white and gréene Armour, their helmets very richly gilded, and
vpon them they had faire garlands of flowers, and in their
Shields (which their Eſquires brought after them) was por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traited
ſiluer Swannes in a field of Sinoble. When they were
come to the place, where the Damoſell talked with the Prince,
ſhe rehearſed vnto them what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication had paſſed: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
one of them thus anſwered her.</p>
                     <p>Madame, ſo it may be your pleaſure, I will not feare to
aduenture any danger, but I would be loath to be ſo vnhappy
as to looſe you, without I might expect greater profit to happen
for I would more willingly be depriued of my life, then to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
ſuch a hard and irkſome extremitie, as to be forced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
you into the cuſtodie of another, being more deſirous to
kéepe you my ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:283" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Truſt me ſir (anſwered the Damoſell) if you ſéeke thus to
excuſe your ſelfe with words, that you would not wlllingly
endure the Iouſt, then will you proue me falſe in my words
to the Knight, to whom the Ladies (which beare him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny)
are greatly beholding, in ſéeing him to aduenture the triall
ſo worthily himſelfe, againſt vs that haue each one a knight to
defend her. Madame (ſaid the knight) this Gentleman eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
it a great trouble to him, to be burdened with ſo many
Ladies, and therefore he would willingly be vanquiſhed, to the
and he might be diſcharged of them: ſo, in ſéeking to ſhun ſmall
occaſions of harme, he ſteppeth into a maze of greater danger:
whereto the Prince gaue this anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Truly ſir, you are very farre from my meaning, and ſo farre
as I giue you to vnderſtand, as I do not onely entend to guard
theſe Damoſels which are in my compnny, but that which is
more, I will diſburden you of thoſe foure Ladies which you
preſume to defend, and carrie them away with me. And if you
do not manfully behaue your ſelfe on their behalfe, truely I
ſhall be much diſpleaſed with you, for I am woont to make no
account of the victory, except I may atchieue it with great loſſe
of my blood. Well then ſir (anſwered the knight) ſeeing you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to make your valor ſeene to theſe Ladies, prepare your ſelfe
to entertaiue me: with which words he clapt downe the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
of his Helmet, and hauing couched his Lance, he fetcht
his courſe againſt the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> who welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
him very brauely: and albeit the knight brak his lance
worthily, yet ſuch was the rough charge the Prince gaue him,
as he was conſtrained to meaſure his length on the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo greatly amazed with his fall, as he lay a good ſpace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mouing himſelfe, in the meane while, the knight of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
man</hi> came to the Damoſell, with whom he had talked
before, ſpeaking to her in this manner. I perceiue Madame,
his Knight is not able to kéepe her, whom he hath enterpriſed
to defend, wherefore I pray you diſcharge your ſelfe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
which you ſaid I ſhould enioy, by reaſon of your cuſtome
here appointed: to which words the Damoſell framed this
reply. You haue done your dnty ſo well, and like an approued
<pb facs="tcp:13179:284" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knight at Armes, as I might be worthily apprehended of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
if I ſhould withhold that from you, which you haue
ſo well deſcrusd: therefore ſince the lot hath firſt fallen on me,
whom this knight did enterpriſe to defend, I ſubmit my ſelfe
to you, deſiring you, that you would entertaine me among
theſe other Ladyes, which requeſt I make in requitall of his
miſfortune, who hath thus vnluckily loſt me.</p>
                     <p>The Prince very fauourably reſpected the Damoſell, and
would haue made her anſwer, but the ſecond knight cryed to
him, that he ſhould prepare himſelfe, whereupon they ſet the
ſpurres to their horſes, and encountred with ſuch valour, as
the trunchions of their ſpeares flew vp gallantly into the aire:
then comming againe to their ſecond triall, the Prince gaue
the knight ſuch a forcible ſtroke, as he threw him to the earth,
with one of his legs broken.</p>
                     <p>The other two Knights, ſéeing the great diſhonour their
fellowes had receiued, and doubting they ſhould ſpéed no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
themſelues, they ran both together againſt the Knight of
the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> and dealt very diſcourteouſly with him, yet
had they not the power to vnhorſe him, but ſo ſoone as he could
gaine the opportunitie (béeing loath to truſt too much to their
gentlenes) he alighted from his horſe, and drawing his ſword,
he came to them with theſe words. Indeed Gentleman, you
haue gotten the aduantage of me now, in that you two ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourably
aſſaile one onely Knight: yet cannot all this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
me in purchaſing the Ladies, whom I will haue
from you before I depart, or you ſhall haue the beſt blood in my
helly: to which words, one of the Knights made him this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                     <p>I cannot tell how things may fall out, but before you haue
theſe Ladyes, you ſhall buy them at our hands ſo déerely, as
while you liue you ſhall know the price. And ſo they alighted
from their horſes, running very furiouſly on the knight of the
<hi>Sauage man,</hi> who entertained them with ſuch braue and
ingenious ſleights of fight, as in ſhort time one of the Knights
(being not able to hold out any longer) was conſtrained to fall
at the Princeſſe féete: which when the other knight perceiued,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:284" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſaw his life was brought into ſuch extremitie, put foorth
himſelf nobly to defend the ſtrokes wherwith the knight of the
<hi>Sauage man</hi> charged him, who doing his deuoire to bring him
vnder his obeyſance, the knight (which began the iouſt, and had
ſitten all this while in great anger) ſéeing his fellowes Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred,
by the proweſſe of the hardy Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi>
and the great danger wherein he was that endured the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
came with his ſword drawne to aſſiſt him.</p>
                     <p>The Prince ſéeing that, and how he which was ready to
yéeld, tooke heart a freſh by his fellowes company, redoubled
his ſtrokes vpon them, and ſayd. I would gladly that more
ſuccor would come &amp; helpe this knight, to the end that the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which I ſhall obtaine, might yéeld me the larger eſtimation
of renowne: and that I might likewiſe make knowne to theſe
Ladyes, how their beantie ought to be reſerued for thoſe
Knights who are more vertuous, and can better defend them.
In briefe, ſuch was the preweſſe of the Prince towards them,
as one of the Knights, (being very ſore wounned) fell downe
to the earth, the ſight whereof ſo grieued the other, as he ranne
and fell downe before the Ladies, deſiring them to ſhield him
from the surie of the Prince, who ſmiling to ſee the behauiour
of the knight, entred into theſe ſpeeches.</p>
                     <p>Sir knight, you haue taken vp your Hoſtage in a place of
good aſſurance, otherwiſe, I would giue thee ſuch a recompence
as thy malicious and difloyall ſtomacke deſerueth: then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Ladies, he began in this order. Faire Ladies,
I deſire that you would mount your ſelues vpon your Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frays,
for I would willingly be out of this place, leſt the remem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>brance
of the ill hap of theſe Knights cauſe you to be forgetfull
of the honeſt promiſe, which you made me before I began the
Iouſt.</p>
                     <p>In ſooth worthy Sir (anſwered one of the Damoſels) it is
very hard to put out our memory, their ſlender and vnhappy
fortune, that could not withſtand the force of one Knight, but
becauſe you haue deſerued ſo well, we ſubmit our ſelues moſt
willingly to your worthy ſelfe to diſpoſe of vs as it ſhall ſeeme
beſt in your iudgement, humbly deſiring, that vertue be not
<pb facs="tcp:13179:285" rendition="simple:additions"/>
blemiſhed by any inordinate meane, which oftentimes happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to a Ladies great diſhonour, being too late to recouer it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
when ſuch an eſpeciall iewell is loſt.</p>
                     <p>Ladies (anſwered the knight of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi> I am not
accuſtomed to vſe diſcourteſie to any your ſexe, eſpecially, not
to them of whom I make account, but ſuch is my miſfortune
as when I haue well deſerued, my due recompence is farre
enough from me. Then taking one of the horſes of the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
Knights, he rid away with the Ladies, leauing the
knights in the Tents, to remember the great loſſe they had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained:
being thus depriued of their gratious ladies, who with
their Eſquires rid on merrily, reioycing that they werein the
Cuſtody of the noble and aduenterous knight of the <hi>Sauage-man.</hi>

that they might thereby in time marry vs.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe wee ſhould not miſſe ſo great an honour as

to bée vſed to the Ladyes: ſo heare we will leaue him
and them togither, and will (as our Hiſtory willes vs) procéed
to tell you, how the knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> the fiftéene day after
he was imbarqued, came within the ſight of the <hi>Profound Iſle,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:286" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which the Pilot knew very well, and ſo gaue the Prince <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
to vnderſtand, whom he ſet a ſhoare in the moſt conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
place he could find, committing him to God and good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> rode about to vifite the <hi>Profound
Iſle,</hi> which ſeemed to him very pleſant and fertile: but the night
ſuddenly hindering him, he was conſtrained to alight at the
foote of a mountaine, where he ſuffered his horſe to refreſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and began to mourne, for lacke of the company of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued
friend <hi>Siluian,</hi> whoſe preſence was agréeable to him,
as well for the remembrance that he was nouriſhed with him,
as alſo for the fwéete and louing counſell he would giue him,
when he was in extreme grief and heauineſſe, becauſe he knew
beſt how comfort him.</p>
                     <p>Thus for want of his company, he was conſtrained to paſſe
that night among the gréene leaues, vſing his Helmet as a
pillow vnder his head, and there he toſt and tumbled very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietly
all night, vntill the cleare morning had chaſed away
the vncomfortable darkeneſſe: then he aroſe, and mounting
on horſe-backe, rode on very heauy and penſiue, yet ſomewhat
comforted by the pleaſantneſſe of the Iſle, which he iudged
more worthy to be peopled, then to ly waſt and deſolate. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the euening tide, he came where was a little Iſland,
which was compaſſed about with very ſtrong wals: into this
Iſland he entred, and tooke vp his lodging in the houſe of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Knight, who was accuſtomed to giue entertainment to
ſuch Knights, as beſtowed their time in ſéeking aduentures-and
becauſe he ſaw the Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> without an Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
attending on him, he came and tooke his horſe himſelfe,
and afterward he helped to vnarme him, vſing him with ſo
great humanity as was poſſible.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> was glad of this friendly entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and deſired to be informed by his Hoſt, of the cuſtomes
and manners of that Countrey: ſo, when he was riſen from
Supper, and had repoſed himſelfe a little, he requeſted his hoſt
to tell him, to whom ihat Iſland belonged, and what were the
maners and cuſtomes thereof, that he might report it in other
<pb facs="tcp:13179:287"/>
places where he came: to which demand, the ancient Knight
his Hoſt made this anſwer.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, you came now in good time to be reſolued of that,
which I perceiue you are ignorant in, for if it had béene your
fortune to come hither a little ſooner (being in your ſwéeteſt
times of yeares) your life would haue béene in very great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
For you ſhall vnderſtaud, that it is not long time ſince a
Giant named <hi>Brauorant</hi> the <hi>Cruell,</hi> was the Lord and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
of this Iſland, who delighted to ſet ſpies at all his Ports, to
informe him when any Knights or Damoſels did arriue in
this Iſland, and when any ſuch happened to come, he would
vſe them extreame cruelly, the Knights he would depriue of
their liues, and the Damoſels he would villanouſly force, and
afterward ſend them away ſtarke naked, diſpoyled of all their
rich and coſtly cloathing.</p>
                     <p>And for this purpoſe he kept a great company of vaſſayles,
who did nothing elſe but imploy themſelues in following his
wicked humor, and when as any Merchants (by fortune) came
to caſt Anker into this Iſle, his vaſſailes would compell them,
to ranſome themſelues with great extremitie, before they
would ſuffer them to depart hence: but if they chanced to
find fault with his tyranny, and refuſed to pay their ranſome,
which they knew to be laide on them without all right or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
then would he murther them, or put them to ſome villai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
death or other. But the heauenly powers ſeeing the great
oppreſſion and crueltie, which this bloody minded hel-hound
continually vſed, and chiefly towards them that neuer offended
him, in their diuine prouidence, they thought good to cut off
ſuch a tyrant, and ſo it fortuned this Giant died, whoſe ſoule I
thinke was carried to the place, where his vnnaturall déeds de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
to haue recompence, for that he could imploy his life no
better. He thus dying, left behind him foure ſons which he had
in iſſue, who were in all things to be compared to the Giant
their father, the two eldeſt of his ſons were named, <hi>Calfurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi>
&amp; <hi>Combaldam,</hi> who being not content to liue on ſo ſmal te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenues
as this Iſland yéelded, went to inhabit another coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
but albeit they were thus departed hence, the ſupreme au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
<pb facs="tcp:13179:287" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would not long ſuffer them, to liue in their vnſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
crueltie and tyranny, but made a diſpatch of their curſed
liues, and that by the hand of one onely knight, who was called
(as report hath here blazed) the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> ſo
named, for that he beareth figured in his ſhield a <hi>Sauage man.</hi>
It may be, you haue better knowledge of this Knight, then I
haue, for that ſuch a one as you ſéeme to be, cannot chuſe but be
acquainted with thoſe noble mindes, as imploy themſelues in
ſéeking hautie aduentures, whereby their fame is thundered
through the whole world. As for the two other Brethren, they
were nouriſhed in this Iſland vnder their mothers wing, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whoſe will (after they iudged themſelues able to endure
armor) they determined to depart hence, to reuenge the death
of their brethren, <hi>Calfurnien</hi> and <hi>Camboldam.</hi> The earneſt
deſire they had to be gone, would not ſuffer them to tary longer
here, but taking ſhipping, away they went, and after they had
ſpent a great time in the bloody and horrible life their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours
ſpent before them, and in ſéeking the aforenamed knight
of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> it ſo fell out, that the good and hardy knight
himſelfe, chanced to come where they were, with them he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
the Combate, and behaued himſelfe ſo worthily againſt
them, as he likewiſe ended the liues of the other two Giants,
whoſe death deliuered the inhabitants of the countrey (where
they dwelled) out of a great deale of feare and trouble, ſo that it
is to be iudged, that the Knight was ordained to be the onely
meane, to defend the miſerable afflicted people, out of the life of
flauiſh ſeruitude, wherein they had remained long time by their
cruel Giants. The mother of theſe merciles hell-hounds before
named, who is called <hi>Collambra,</hi> could not long endure the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
ſhe ſuffered for the death of her children, wherfore ſhe prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed,
&amp; compaſſed all deuiſes ſhe could, wherby to get the knight
of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> into her cuſtody, &amp; that ſhe might ſpéede the
better in her cloſe intent, ſhe ioyned with a Magitian a friend
of hers, one whom he loued well, named <hi>Alfernao,</hi> who is gone
to the Emperors court of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> hauing ten daies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh his intent, &amp; to worke ſo craftily (as wel
he can (y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> muſt be brought hither.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:288"/>
And becauſe no occaſion ſhal want that may helpe any way,
a Damoſell Giant named <hi>Arlencea,</hi> who is the Daughter to
this <hi>Collambra,</hi> accompanied with a certaine nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of knights
and Damoſels, is ioyned in company with this Enchauntor,
vpon whoſe promiſes ſuch aſſurance is made here, as the
Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> ſhall bée brought hither. In this
great hope which the cruell <hi>Collambra</hi> hath, to reuenge her
deuilliſh will on this good knight, ſhe is gone to a Citie foure
leagues diſtance hence, being accompanied with a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of her friends, as alſo with one of her brethren, who (though
he be young) yet is he maruailous bloody and cruell, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for an eſpeciall Knight at Armes, who is alſo a Giant, and
named <hi>Eſponuautable,</hi> who hath conuerted his countrey into
as great cruelty, as when it was gouerned by the Giant <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorant</hi>
the <hi>Cruell:</hi> and to ſpeake vprightly, <hi>Brauorant</hi> was not
altogether ſo terrible, as hee is whom I lately named to you,
wherefore I hartily pray, that the good Knight of the <hi>Sauage
man</hi> fall not into the hands of this Giant, neither that the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
may preuaile which is laide for him: the ancient Knight
knitting vp his tale with a ſigh, the Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> thus
began.</p>
                     <p>My good friend, it is hard for him to eſcape the daunger,
whom fortune hath determined to fall into it, and ſéeing it is
ſo, I could wiſh that ſhe would ſuffer the Brother to <hi>Colam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra,</hi>
to ſéeke reuenge on me for the death of his Nephews: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes
he might fall into his handes, who hath a good will to
puniſh his wicked life, and make him knowe the deſert of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
as well as his kindred hath taſted it before him. And for
the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> hée is one that I knowe very
well, and I hope he wil eſcape the hands of his enemies, as one
that is reſerued to bring to an end many worthy and hauty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures:
wherefore, in reſpect that hee is my eſpeciall good
friend, I deſire to know the certaintie of that you haue rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
for if he ſpéede ill, I cannot take it quietly, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I wil ſatiſfy my mind, I am determined to morrow mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to goe ſeeke this Giant, not doubting, but if Fortune fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
me, to repay his wicked and euill deſerts, with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb facs="tcp:13179:288" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as is méete for ſuch an offender, I ſée well Syr (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the ancient Knight) that you are ignorant of the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
force, in preſuming ſo to combate with him: alas Sir, hée
will not make any account of the enterpriſe, if ten ſuch as you
came and waged the fight with him: therefore I cannot chuſe
but miſlike your iudgement, in that any one will repute your
enterpriſe, rather for want of diſcretion, then vpon any good or
ſound aduiſe.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> tooke in good part, the councell
which his hoſt laboured to haue him follow, but yet he did not
intend to be ruled by him: ſo, after he and his hoſt had talked
an indifferent ſpace, he withdrew himſelfe into his Chamber,
where he tooke his reſt better then he had done the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and he reioyced greatly, that his brother <hi>Florian</hi> was not
as yet arriued there, as alſo that himſelfe was there ready
to helpe him, if ſo be hée were brought to this cruell <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lambra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the morning, after he had taken leaue of his courteous
Hoſte, hée departed to follow what hée had intended, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into a Forreſt, where through he ſhould trauaile to the
Citie, where <hi>Collambra</hi> made her aboade, he heard the roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
noyſe which the Sea made, whereto he would néedes goe
to ſée if he could eſpy any veſſell, wherein the knight of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
man</hi> his brother might be imbarqued: but as he rode to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Sea coaſt, hée heard a great bruit or noyſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
néere him, and riding forward to ſée what it might bée,
he eſpyed a Shippe lying at Anker, and hard by it was tenne
Knights (belonging to <hi>Collambra</hi> the Mother of <hi>Arlencea)</hi>
maintaining a firce Combate againſt thrée other Knightes,
which he (ſo ſoone as he had ſéene them (knew them to be <hi>Platir,
Berolde:</hi> &amp; the <hi>Sage Aliard</hi> of the <hi>Obſcure Valley,</hi> who had put
their liues in hazard, onely to giue ſuccour to the Knight of the
<hi>Sauage man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This ſight mooued him ſomewhat to reioyce, till ſuddenly
he was aſtoniſhed againe, beholding not paſt twentie paces
from theſe Knights that fought the Combate, a Giant of a
maruellous ſtature, and Armed in rich and coſtly Armour,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:289" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who cried to kill and murder thoſe thrée Knights, that preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to make ſuch reſiſtaunce, and ſo hacked and hewed
their enemies, as now one tumbled on this ſide, then another
on that ſide, and the moſt of them being very dangerouſly
wounded.</p>
                     <p>The Giant ſéeing this, beganne to waxe meruailous worth
with himſelfe, when, mounting on horſebacke, he came to giue
ayde to his Knights, which the Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> perceiuing,
and fearing leaſt his arriuall would be hurtful to his three deare
friends, he poaſted till he came before them, when, he ſaluted
the Giant with theſe words.</p>
                     <p>Art thou not aſhamed <hi>Eſpouuantable,</hi> to offer thy ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them whom thou ſéeſt ſore wounded, and haue ſcantly
power to defend themſelues? let them alone and addreſſe thy
ſelfe to me, who as my mortall enemy) came now to ſéeke thée,
for that I would deliuer that vnfortunate Iſle, out of thy cruell
and bloody tiranny. The Giant ſtayed a while to behold him,
who had ſummoned him to the Combat in ſuch braue manner,
and perceiuing that he bare a golden <hi>Tiger</hi> in his Shield, hée
knewe preſently that this was the Knight, whom the world
did hold in ſo great eſtimation, for he thought no other durſt be
ſo bold as to ſpeake ſo proudly: neuertheleſſe, regarding not the
preſence of the Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> but in ſéeing his Knights
ſo vanquiſhed, he fell into theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>I ſée well that the valour of theſe ſtrange knights, is far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to them of this countrey, which maketh me the more deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to hazard my Fortune, for that my happy conqueſt will
yéelde me the more contentment, then comming to the Knight
of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> he began againe thus.</p>
                     <p>I deſire you Syr Knight to doe me ſo much fauour, as to
tell mée, if any of you belong to the Emperours Court of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
or if you be the Sonnes, or of the linage, of the

if you would reſolue mée héerein, for I am perſwaded, that
you could not thus long maintain y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> fight againſt my knights,
without you be ſome of them which I haue named.</p>
                     <p>I am content (anſwered the Knight of the <hi>Tiger)</hi> to ſatiſfie
<pb facs="tcp:13179:289" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thée in that thou deſireſt, wherefore I giue thée to vnderſtand
that theſe Knights were brought vp in the Court of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in the company of my ſelfe, who am
the Sonne of the Prince <hi>Don Edward,</hi> and brother to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned

                     <p>Art thou <hi>Palmerin</hi> (ſaid the Giant) the eldeſt ſonne to the

and didſt win the Iſlle which no man elſe could, thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
all them forth which kept the ſame?</p>
                     <p>For what cauſe deſireſt thou to know (anſwered the knight
of the <hi>Tiger?)</hi> Marry for that I greatly deſire ſaid <hi>Eſpouuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>
to enter the Combat with thée in the preſence of my ſiſter
<hi>Collambra</hi> who would receiue vnſpeakeable contentment, in
ſéeing thée ſeuerely tormented, for the diſhonour thou haſt done
to her kindred: to which words the Prince replyet thus.</p>
                     <p>I am euen the ſelfe-ſame man whom thou haſt ſo great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to knew, and I am glad to ſee thée ſo willing to fight the

appointed, becauſe I will make knowne publikely to all, how
the heauenly powers haue ſent me to chaſtiſe thy wicked life,
as alſo the crueltie of thy Siſter <hi>Collambra.</hi> Well then
(ſaid the Giant) to the end thou maiſt the better folow thy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe,
faile not to prepare thy ſelfe againſt the morning, and
this night will I cauſe the Field to be prouided, wherein we
entend to fight the Combate: and if thoſe thy companions
would be likewiſe ſet to worke, I haue thrée Couzins, which
ſhall maintaine the Combat againſt them, and I will furniſh
them with Armour out of the Armoury of my brother <hi>Bravo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi>
becauſe I ſee their Armour is greatly out of order, hauing

                     <p>Thou ſhalt do vs great pleaſure, to lend vs Armour
that haue neede of it, and ſo we will not refuſe the Combate:
as well to accompany and do ſeruice to the Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:290" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as to deſtroy and aboliſh the memorie of them, who haue kept
the people here in ſuch tirannous ſeruitude. I ſée then (quoth
the knight of the <hi>Tiger)</hi> that the combate betwéene the Giant
and me, muſt be ended firſt.</p>
                     <p>Noble <hi>Palmerin</hi> (ſaid the <hi>Sage Aliart)</hi> we deſire you to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
vs the Combate firſt, for it may ſo fall out, as you hauing
obtained the victory, againſt the Giant, feare will make his
Couzins to forſake the field the day following: wherefore, to
ſhunne the miſfortune that may happen to vs, we deſire you to
cauſe the Giant to agrée to this requeſt, which if you do, you
ſhall endue your ſelfe with perpetuall renowme, and doe vs a
great pleaſure, who are your humble ſeruants at commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>Séeing it is your earneſt deſire (anſwered the Knight of the
<hi>Tiger)</hi> I am content that it ſhall be ſo, according as your ſelues
thinke beſt to order it. The Giant went away as ioyfull as
might be, for he promiſed himſelfe the victory, and did verily
make account to kill the knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> before the knight
of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> arriued there, and in this ioy he came to
his ſiſter, who ſate wéeping and wringing her hands, becauſe
her knights were ſo vanquiſhed, as alſo for the long tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of her daughter <hi>Arlencea,</hi> fearing leaſt ſome miſchance
ſhould hinder them, becauſe they ſtayed ſo long: the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
hereof, made her heart ouerwhelmed in extreame paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
yet was ſhe ſomewhat contented by her brothers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
who prouided ſuch neceſſaries for himſelfe, as he ſhould
vſe in the Combate in the day following againſt <hi>Palmerin</hi> of
<hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Giant being thus gone about his buſineſſe, the Prince
<hi>Palmerin</hi> demanded of his friend, for what cauſe the Giants
Knights did enter fight with them? whereto the <hi>Sage Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art</hi>
thus replied. My Lord, this Giant cauſeth a number of
Spies for to lucke about this Countrey, who ſeeing but any
ſtrangers to come on the land here, or that any Ship do but
once lie here at Anker, they ſet vppon them with maine force
preſently: in like manner chanced this miſfortune to vs, who
comming on land in this place, were no ſooner offering to
<pb facs="tcp:13179:290" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mount on horſeback, but we were aſſaulted with theſe knights
from the Giant, who came himſelfe to encourage and animate
them againſt vs, we being ready to fall into extreame danger,
had not you ſo happily arriued, being ſent (doubtleſſe) to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
vs, that our enterpriſe might not come to an vnfortunate
end, which could not otherwiſe be, in that the knight of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
man</hi>
is not yet brought hither.</p>
                     <p>Here making a pawſe, they went to ſéeke ſomewhat to ſup
withal, and to prouide ſomething to lay to a litle wound, which
<hi>Berolde</hi> had receiued on his arme, for which cauſe <hi>Palmerin</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him, that he would not aduenture the Combat the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
but <hi>Berolde</hi> would by no meanes be perſwaded.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sage Aliarts</hi> Eſquier, tooke the <hi>Prince Palmerins</hi> horſe,
he ſtaying there all that day in his friends company, all of them
watching very diligently for the ſight of any Shippe, wherein
the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> ſhould be brought captiue into his enemies
hands: but when the darke night would not ſuffer them to looke
any longer, they entred all into the Shippe which had brought
them thither, for that they iudged themſelues in more aſſurance
there, then to tarrie on the land all the darke night, accounting
them rather gouerned by arrogancy and folly, then any wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or diſcretion, that would truſt them, who made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their faith, eſpecially, being their profeſſed and ſworne

                        <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Leare <hi>Phebus</hi> had no ſooner ſhewed his
golden face on the earth the next morning,
but theſe foure Knights departed from the
ſhip, thrée of them being armed but badly,
by reaſon their armor had béene mangled
very cruelly the day before: but yet though
they were ſo ſlenderly prouided, they
would not forſake the Combate againſt the Giants Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins:
ſo leauing the Shippe in the cuſtodie of the Marriners,
they rid on, accompanied with their Eſquiers, who bare their
Lances and their Shields, vntill they came to the place where
the Giant remained. Being come thither, they beheld before
the Caſtle, the place appointed for the combat, which was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
round about very handſomly, &amp; ſcaffolds made of very great
height, whereon was aſſembled an innumerable company of
people, who came onely to ſée the Combat, for that they iudged
it would be the moſt famous that euer was fought in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
wherein they heartily deſired that the giant might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
of life, for that he vſed the people with ſuch extreame ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor,
and yet they durſt not ſpeake againſt him, no not the chiefe
nobles and gentlemen of the Country, but they ſtood in awe of
him for his cruell dealing, being glad to honor him to his face,
though they ſcorned and diſdained him behind his backe. And
thus he liued Lordly ouer euery one, vſing all alike as ſlauiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as might be, ſo that none durſt diſpleaſe or offend his raſcall
vaſſails, leaſt they ſhould raiſe ſuch a ſcandall among them, as
<pb facs="tcp:13179:291" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the tyrants puniſhment would be too hard for them to ſuffer, ſo
that many times they practiſed the death of the Giant, that
they might be diſcharged of his cruell oppreſſions: but let vs
come againe to the former matter.</p>
                     <p>The knights entred into this place, which they knew was
ordained for the combate, and there they ſtood attending for the
Giant, who in ſhort time after came to one of the windowes of
the caſtle, accompanied with his ſiſter <hi>Collambra,</hi> he being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as he was the day before. At laſt the Giant lifted vp the
Beuer of his Helmet, to the end the Chriſtian knights might
be diſmaied, beholding his ſterne and vigorous countenance,
and I aſſure you, albeit he was yong, yet was he ſo mighty and
tall of ſtature, hauing ſuch an vgly and fearefull face, as was
ſufficient to terrifie the hearts of them, who were not accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to ſée ſuch a hideous proportion. For his face was alwayes
bitterly frowning, the ſkin whereof ſwart and wrinkled, his
lips bigge and boyſterous, and gaping ſo farre aſunder, as his
téeth were ſéene very monſtrouſly, ſo that the Anatomie agréed
well with his name, he being called the <hi>Fearefull Giant.</hi> The
Giant ſtood leaning on a Cuſhion of blacke Veluet in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and ſhewed to his ſiſter the Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> deſiring
her to comfort her ſelfe, for that he intended to reuenge y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> death
of her ſonnes on him, becauſe he that had ſlaine them was not
as yet come: this he ſpake becauſe he would not let her know
what talke had paſſed on the day before, betwéene him and the
knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> leſt ſhe ſhould chance to diſcorage her ſelfe,
or doubt of the ſufficiency of his ſtrength, which both he and ſhe
eſtéemed equall to deale with ten good and hardy Knights. In
the meane while the Giant ſtaied in the window, there came
an Eſquire of his, with men with him laden with armor, into
the place where the Combate ſhould be fought, and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
before the prince and his company, after that the Eſquire
had ſaluted them, he entred into theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>Gentlemen, my Lord the giant willed me to let you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that he is not accuſtomed to make a conqueſt of thoſe
knights, who ſhal afterward excuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, that their miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
was for want of armor: and becauſe he will auoid ſuch an
<pb facs="tcp:13179:292" rendition="simple:additions"/>
impeachment, he hath ſent you here choice of armour, willing
you to take them, which you ſhall thinke moſt conuenient for
you. And he willed me to bring him word, whether you will
rather yéeld to the mercy of his Siſter <hi>Collambra,</hi> or abide the
triall of himſelfe and his Couzins: the Prince <hi>Platir</hi> anſwered
the Eſquire thus.</p>
                     <p>Truſt me (my friend) I cannot thinke it méete to receiue
thy Maiſters armor, which we thanke him for, that he would
ſo courteouſly ſend vs, becauſe I carry this mind with me, that
it is better for vs to looſe our liues without his aid, them hauing
his armour to fall into his hands vanquiſhed, for our armour
his not ſo much ſpoyled, but we may very well endure the triall
of this Combate: wherefore, we will trie our Fortune in this
armor we haue, conſidering, ſkill muſt be vſed as well as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
which if we imploy as we ought, there is no doubt but
we ſhall haue the victory.</p>
                     <p>I am content to follow the aduiſe of <hi>Platir</hi> (ſaid <hi>Berolde.)</hi>
And ſince you find it ſo conuenient (quoth the <hi>Sage Aliart)</hi> me
thinkt it were good the meſſenger returned backe to his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and let him vnderſtand, that he may come when pleaſe
him into the field. I reioyce greatly (ſaide the Eſquire) in the
counſell of this young knight, that you will not take this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,
which my Lord the Giant ſendeth you: therefore let him
that hath the aduantagr boaſt of his winning in the end.</p>
                     <p>Thus the Eſquire departed into the Caſtle of <hi>Collam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi>
againe, giuing the Giant to vnderſtand, what the
Knights had ſaid, whereat he fumed and fretted greaely, to
ſée what diſdaine theſe Chriſtian knights made of him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon,
he tooke his leaue of his Siſter in this maner. Madame,
I pray you abide at this window all the while the Combate
endureth, for I ſhall be greatly iniuried if I want your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>So departing, he went vnto his Couzins, who were all in
blacke armor, conformable to their griefe and ſorrow, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
for their deuices in their ſhéelds, the portraitures of <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calon</hi>
and <hi>Baleato,</hi> their Couzins, figured in a field of Sable
they promiſing neuer to change their deuiſes, vntill they had
<pb facs="tcp:13179:292" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reuenged the death of the Giants the ſons of <hi>Collambra,</hi> who
were déerely beloued of their vnckle the Giant <hi>Eſpouuanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
With them he tooke his way to the place appointed for the
combate, the people reioycing when they ſaw him comming
with his Couzins, who were in ſtature able to deale with ſixe
ſuch as the thrée knights were: which made the Giant to ride
very merily, perſwading himſelfe, that the knight of the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
and his companions, ſhould looſe their liues in the field that
day: then comming ſomwhat néere them, he began to vſe theſe
words. In ſooth my friends, it were better for you to yéeld your
ſelues, then to abide the terrour of my combate. Not ſo ſir (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Knight of the <hi>Tiger)</hi> but albeit thy arcogant pride
ſhould ſéeme to fray vs, in theſe peoples iudgements, we are
content to abide the vttermoſt: not doubting (God aiding vs)
but to bring downe thy haughty ſtomacke, and theſe likewiſe
that beare thée company.</p>
                     <p>Vpon theſe words the Giant ran againſt the knight of the
<hi>Tiger</hi> and his Cozins againſt the other knights, that the tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
of the horſes made the earth to groane, and they were not
ſo quicke and ſpéedy in their courſe, but the knight of the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
and his companions were as nimble as they, méeting ſo
brauely in the middeſt of the Carrire, where the Giant broke
his lance on the Prince <hi>Palmerins</hi> ſhéeld with ſo great force,
as he was conſtrained to catch hold on the mane of his horſe,
otherwiſe he had fallen beſide him: neuertheleſſe the Giant
was caſt out of his Saddle with great violence againſt the
ground, whereat he was maruailouſly offended, but the knight
of the <hi>Tiger</hi> reioyced that he had broken his lance ſo well.</p>
                     <p>The other ſix knights were all likewiſe diſmounted, except
the Prince <hi>Flatir,</hi> who kept his Saddle ſtill: yet was the
charge ſo rough vpon him, as he had almoſt borne his fellowes
company, but that he recouered himſelfe gallantly, hauing loſt
both his ſtirreps. The knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> ſéeing the Giant
comming towards him, caſt himſelfe beſide his horſe quickly,
becauſe he feared the Giant would haue kiled his horſe: then
being on his féete, he ſpake to the Giant thus.</p>
                     <p>Content thy ſelfe a while thou counterfeit Monſter, and let
<pb facs="tcp:13179:293" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thy Cozins procéede in that they haue enterpriſed, for they that
deale with him are ſuch, as they ſhall find ſufficient to abate
their lofty minds: and after they haue tried their fortune (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we will not hinder them, neither do they the like to vs)
thou and I will quickly decide our controuerſie, when, do not
doubt but thou ſhalt perceiue, the little regard I haue of thée,
and the vttermoſt thou canſt doe.</p>
                     <p>I ſée well (anſwered the Giant) that becauſe thou hadſt ſo
good fortune to diſmount me, it makes thee ſo bold to ſpeake
thus brauely: but I receiue greater contentment the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou canſt
deuiſe, to ſee thee here in this place, where at mine owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
I ſhall giue thee puniſhment, and with my ſword repay the
ſhame of my fall. Then drew he his ſword forth of the ſcab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,
ſaying to the Prince, that he had cauſed that weapon to
be made, onely to take reuenge therewithall, for the death of
his Couzins <hi>Brocalon,</hi> and <hi>Baleato:</hi> with theſe words he ran
fiercely on the Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> and gaue him ſuch cruell
and forcible ſtroakes, as had he not defended them worthily,
his life would haue bene in great danger.</p>
                     <p>Verie rigorous was the blowes the Giant gaue the prince,
ſo that moſt part of his ſhield was cut in peeces, and he had
very little left to award his enemy, and a great while it was
before he could wound the Giant, yet at length he gained ſuch
opportunitie, as he wounded him grieuouſly in three or foure
places: which made the Giant to faint and waxe ſomewhat
wearie, both with the great loſſe of his blood, and alſo with his
extreame ſweating and chafing, to ſee himſelfe ſo hardly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
by one knight, but all his fretting the prince regarded not,
he followed his intent ſo worthily, and redoubled ſtroake after
ſtroake ſo roughly vpon him, as the Giant was conſtrained to
retire, to take breathing awhile.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> was not ſorry therat, for that he as
gladly deſired reſt of the giant, though not by any ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame
occaſion, conſidering alſo, he deſired to ſee how his
three friends continued the fight, with the giants three Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins,
who in ſooth were brought to ſuch a narrow point, as
they had not the power to defend their enemies, for they both
<pb facs="tcp:13179:293" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had and did charge them ſo worthily, as the Prince did much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
himſelfe in beholding them, they being ſo couragious, nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and quicke, as they were at the beginning of the Combate.
But the Prince <hi>Platir</hi> dealt ſo gallantly with him that was his
enemy, as he had the general praiſe, and was iudged worthy the
honour of that day, aboue his other two companions.</p>
                     <p>The Giant beholding his Couzins in ſuch danger, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to haue loſt the moſt part of his blood, likewiſe that he had
ſuch a ſtrong and puiſſant enemy: his heart began to faint, but
becauſe he would not haue them know, in what great feare and
debilitie he was, he came againe as luſtily (as he could) to the
Combate.</p>
                     <p>As for the Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> he was ready and willing to
entertaine him, which was more rough and ſharpely giuen to
the Giant, then the firſt encounter was: and in the meane
time they tried thus hardly together, the Knight which fought
againſt <hi>Platir</hi> was ſo faint and féeble, as hee fell downe to the
ground before him, when <hi>Platir</hi> taking his Helmet from him,
ſtrooke off his head, and ſhewed it to <hi>Collambra,</hi> as ſhe ſate in
the window.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe ſawe that Fortune was thus fully bent againſt
her, ſhe preſentle ſhut the window, and wéeping bitterly for
this pittious ſight, ſhee pulled and rent her haire very cruelly,
which the Giant beholding, that ſhe diſpaired of his victorie,
and would not vouchſafe him any longer her countenance, he
determined to ſell his life as déerely as he could, to him that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to take it from him, and then beganne to aſſaile the
Prince very furiouſly: but he perceiuing the Giants force
could not endure long, ſo hackte and hewed his Armour in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as at laſt hée cutte out great collops of his fleſh, and
dyed all the graſſe with the blood of the Giant <hi>Eſpouuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And the Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> looking aſide, eſpied the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins
of the Giants all ſubdued, and their heads preſented (as
the firſt was) by the other two Knightes, euery one then
expecting the ende of the Combate, betwéene him and the
Giant: and truely hée maruelled much that the Giant helde
<pb facs="tcp:13179:294" rendition="simple:additions"/>
out ſo long, wherefore he layde ſuch cruell ſtroakes vpon him,
as at the length he (being not able to ſuſtaine himſelfe) fell
downe flat to the ground vpon his backe, committing his ſoule
into the hands of them, who ſtrengthened him in his wicked
and abhominable déedes.</p>
                     <p>Then the Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> tooke off his Helmet, to ſée
whether he were aliue or dead, but when he ſaw no life was
left in him, he tooke his ſword by the point, and beate him with
the hils ſo about his head, as he made his eyes and his téeth to
fall out, and then he cut off his legs by the knées, which being
done, he thanked God of his happy victory, &amp; the people for ioy
gaue ſuch a generall ſhoute, as the earth did ſéeme to tremble
there withall, they were ſo glad of their deliuery from the
monſtrous cruelty, wherin theſe Giants had ſo long time kept
them.</p>
                     <p>And in this great ioy, they concluded altogether to goe and
beſet the Caſtle where <hi>Collambra</hi> was, that none of that bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
linnage might be left aliue: for except ſhe were likewiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatched,
the people feared their former ſeruitude. In the meane
while <hi>Collambras</hi> knightes guarded the peoples entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Caſtle, one of her Damoſels came and humbled herſelfe
at the Prince <hi>Palmerins</hi> feete, with theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>I deſire you Sir Knight, that you would take pittie on my
Lady <hi>Collambra,</hi> and on vs that are her Damoſels attedant
on her, for we haue no other defence for our ſelues, then the thrée
Knights, who labour to kéepe the people foorth of the Caſtle, in
that they would put my Lady to death, whom I pray you
vouchſafe to defend from their exueltie: for more willingly
would ſhe receiue chaſtiſement at your hands for her offences,
then to fall into the peoples power, who are voide of reaſon in
their reuenge.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> (fearing hée ſhould not come time
enough to giue her ſuccour) ſpake to his thrée friends in this
manner. I deſire you my brethren and friendes, to goe and
aſſiſt <hi>Collambra,</hi> becauſe the people ſéeke to put her to death.
Theſe thrée knights willing to ſatiſfie the Princes requeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to thruſt through the preaſſe, and preuailed ſo much by
<pb facs="tcp:13179:294" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their ſtrength, that at laſt they attained the Caſtle, gate, which
was defended by <hi>Collambraes</hi> Knights, one of them being
ſlaine, and the other two ready to yeeld themſelues, at what
time the Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> and his companions, were come
to the place where this great hurly burly was: which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſirous to pacifie, thruſt into the Caſtle <hi>Collambraes</hi>
knights, and turning his face to the people, deſired them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
to their houſes, and to aſſure themſelues, that he would
not faile to ſet them in ſuch a ſure ſtate of libertie, as they
ſhould not be moleſted with ſuch cruell tiranny, as they had bin
too long a time.</p>
                     <p>The people conceiued ſuch contentment by the words of the
Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> as they preſently departed thence, crying all
in this manner: that the Iſland ought to be giuen to the knight
of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> for that it was his owne by right, and they did
heartily deſire that he would accept it, they being content to
humble themſelues as his vaſſailes and ſubiects, ſo that he
would not be perſwaded by the flattering words of <hi>Collambra</hi>
whoſe mallice was not inferiour to the cruell Giants.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> made them promiſe to deale in ſuch ſort, as they
ſhould be all contented to their owne willes: ſo, giuing them
a courteous farewell, he went into the great Hall to reſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
a while, and afterward he came to <hi>Collambra,</hi> who ſate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
her Damoſels, her haire all diſperſed about her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
hanging her head downe to the ground, and making ſuch
pittifull lamentation, as her Damoſels could not chuſe but
bedeaw their chéekes with teares, beholding the extreame
heauineſſe of their Lady and Miſtreſſe, who at this inſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
the death of her huſband, the loſſe of her Sonnes,
and deſtruction of her houſe, and the death of her Brother, who
came onely for her ſake thither, as well to defend her, as alſo to
ſée the death of the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> but now, being
paſt all hope to haue him, and fearing leſt by him, ſhe had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
loſt her daughter <hi>Arlencea,</hi> of whom ſhe made moſt high
and eſpeciall account: all thoſe occaſſions conſidered together,
compelled her to immoderate mourning.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:295" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> hearing the great complaints of
<hi>Collambra,</hi> was diuers times to offering comfort her, but he
iudging his words would rather more vexe her, then pacifie
her, let her alone to comfort her ſelfe to well as ſhe could: but
the prince <hi>Platir</hi> ſéeing how <hi>Collambra</hi> howled and made ſuch
a pittifull and heauy noyſe, beganne thus to ſpeake vn to the
knight of the <hi>Tiger.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I thinke it good, and ſo do my two friends and companions
that this Caſtle remaine vnto vs as our owne for euer, and to
chaſe hence this cruell woman, or cauſe her to be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſome ſuch place, where her mallice may haue no power to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
vs, or put any other good mind in feare. Friend <hi>Platir</hi>
(anſwered <hi>Palmerin)</hi> I will agrée to whatſoeuer you thinke
expedient, but I pray you do not prouoke me to do <hi>Collam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra</hi>
any outrage, nor yet to brinn her into my company, for I
cannot endure to behold one ſo full of griefe as ſhe is.</p>
                     <p>Theſe thrée knights perceiuing that the ſight of this cruell
Giantneſſe, did much offend the Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to haue her brought where their ſhip lay at Anchor, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
her with them to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> becauſe the Emperour
ſhould diſpoſe of her as he thought méete: and they ſtayed not
long to put their intent in execution, but cauſed her to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied
in a Chariot, to the Port where their ſhip rode, leauing
her there in the company of the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi> vntill they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined

the name of this ancient Knight) that the people here, will
admit any other gouernor then your ſelfe? Yea truely (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Palmerin)</hi> for that he which is the Lord hereof, is my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to whom this Iſland doth appertaine by duty. I feare me
<pb facs="tcp:13179:297"/>
my Lord (ſaide <hi>Argentao)</hi> that ſome harme hath happened to
him, by them of the ſtocke and Image of the Giant <hi>Brauorant,</hi>
but ſince it ſtandeth ſo with your gracious pleaſure, to call mée
(vnworthy wretch) to ſo great credite and honour (which I
knowe it is your will I ſhould not refuſe,) I eſtéeme my ſelfe
the moſt happieſt man aliue, deſiring you to vnderſtand the
will of the people, for if they doe not imagine well of me prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it were better for me to content my ſelfe with mine own
poore houſe, where it liked you to accept a lodging, and whereof
I pray you to diſpoſe, as your owne alwayes at commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and to thinke of me, who (during my life time) vowe my
ſelfe your humble vaſſaile and obedient Subiect.</p>
                     <p>The people hearing the wordes of <hi>Argentao,</hi> who was a
Chriſtian Knight, one of very good life, and alwaies a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to the Giants, did very well allow to accept him for their
gouernour, promiſing generatly before the Prince, that they
would honour him with dutifull loue and obedience.</p>
                     <p>The Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſent to call the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding
<hi>Siluian</hi> to ſtay the meane while in the Shippe, who
being come thither, and entred into the Ship, he was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken with exceeding feare, when he beheld the ougly frow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
countenaunce of <hi>Collambra,</hi> which he iudged as ill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured,
as the report went of <hi>Eſpouuantable</hi> her Brother,
whom the people of that countrey thought to be inuincible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſaw him ſo nobly conquered by the valiant <hi>Palmerin</hi>
of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Siluian</hi> hauing declared the pleaſure of his Lord, the <hi>Sage
Aliart</hi> preſently departed to the Citie, and being come to the
Princes his friendes, hee found them determining to ſend to
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> the Eſqurer of the Prince <hi>Berolde,</hi> who was
named <hi>Albanis,</hi> willing him to depart thence with the Ship,
and to preſent the Emperour of <hi>Greece</hi> with the newes of this
happy victory in that Iſland, alſo to deliuer to his Maieſty the
Gianteſſe <hi>Collambra.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When they had concluded on the Eſquiers meſſage, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from them to the Ship to <hi>Collambra,</hi> when, the Pilot
hoyſing his Sayles, and the winde ſeruing them very gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:297" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they rode on at pleaſure, and cut the Seas with maruellous
expedition. But the Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> peceiuing, that his thrée
friends had written their mindes to them they beſt thought
on, he was ſorry that he had done as much, neuertheleſſe, he
thought it not fit he ſhould venture ſo boldly, to commit his
ſecrets to any one elſe, ſauing his friend <hi>Siluian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then to driue fancies out of his mind, he deſired his friends
to beare him company in viſiting the Iſle, whereto they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
conſented, and <hi>Argentao</hi> cauſed two of the Giants
Foiſts to be put in a readineſſe, wherein he and the principall
Lords of the Iſland bare them company, in riding about the
Iſland.</p>
                     <p>After they had ſéene the moſt part of the <hi>Profound Iſle,</hi> they
came to another, which was called the <hi>Perillous Iſle,</hi> being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well peopled, and fortified with a number of goodly Towers
and Caſtles of no ſmall riches, that the nobleſt Prince in the
world could not wiſh for a more ſtately gouernment. <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tao,</hi>
who was very well acquainted with the cuſtomes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of that Iſland, gaue them to vnderſtand the rare ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
thereof, deſiring them not to thinke it ſtrange, that they
ſaw the people ſo ſcant, and they that were there, ſo fearefull, for
it was the extreame cruelty of the Giant <hi>Brauorant,</hi> that made
them forſake their houſes, looking euery houre when they ſhold
be put to the Sword.</p>
                     <p>Theſe knights receiued great pleaſure in beholding theſe
two Iſlandes, and ſo they rowed about vntill it was the next
day in the morning, when, then came they to the place (as you
may reade in the firſt part of this Hiſtory) where <hi>Palmerin</hi>
went on ſhore to end a ſtrange aduenture, there they landed,
and mounted on their Horſes to get vp on the high Rocke, but
the way was ſo narrow, and the Rocke ſo ſteepe, as they were
faine to alight againe, and giuing their horſes to their Eſquires
they went vp the Rocke on foote after one another.</p>
                     <p>But before they were come to the place where <hi>Palmerin</hi>
found the Monument, with theſe letters engrauen thereon.
<hi>Take heed thou paſſe no further:</hi> they were ſo weary, as they
were glad to mount on their Horſes againe, and ſo in ſhort
<pb facs="tcp:13179:298"/>
time they attained the top of the rocke, where they reſted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
being abaſhed to ſee ſuch a huge mountaine. But when
<hi>Argentao</hi> and the thrée knights were come to the Fountaine,
they had then a greater cauſe of aſtoniſhment, then any they
had ſéene as yet, for their they ſaw monſtrous huge Beaſtes,
like vnto them which <hi>Palmerin</hi> flew, when they would not
ſuffer him to drinke of the water: and I aſſure you, that theſe
Beaſts were ſo cunningly and artificially framed, as one wold
haue iudged them to be aliue, they made ſuch a vigorons and
fearefull ſhew, being chained by the neckes with the ſelfe ſame
chaines as they were, whom <hi>Palmerin</hi> (by his noble valour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited.
This rare and ingenious figure declared, what great
ſtudy and practiſe <hi>Vrganda</hi> compaſſed, to leaue ſuch a ſtrange
edifice in remembrance of her knowledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſeeing this rare monument to ſurpaſſe all that euer
he had ſéene before, ſuſpected that the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> had done it by
his Art, to cauſe them wonder at it. Wherefore he deſired that
he would ſatiſfie him whether it be ſo or no, the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi>
made this anſwer.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, ſhe which inuented the aduenture of this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
did will, that he which was ſo happy to atchieue the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
thereof, ſhould be recompeuced according to his worthy
deſerts: and to leaue to all poſtericies a perpetual remembrance
of him, ſhe ordained that theſe cruell beaſts, which are framed
in the naturall ſhapes of them which you ſlew, ſhould remaine
ſtill in this place, to the end that they which chance to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this Iſland, may render continual laude and commendation
to your worthy proweſſe. Yet thinking this not ſufficient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to your prayſe, ſhe cauſed to be erected the portraitures
of thoſe knights which belonged to the Enchantneſſe <hi>Eutropa,</hi>
and whom you worthily brought vnder your obeyſance, they
being liuely carued in marble, of the ſame height and proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
as they were: and here they are figured defending their ſhields
which you may yet ſée hanging on their ſeuerall Pillers, euen
in the ſame manner as they were, when you fought for them
before this Iſland was conquered.</p>
                     <p>And for the Iſle it ſelfe, it ſometime belonged to the <hi>Sage</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:298" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Vrganda,</hi> to whom you muſt thinke your ſelfe greatly behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
ſéeing that by her meanes, your noble déedes remaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred
for perpetuall memorie.</p>
                     <p>Certainely (anſwered <hi>Berolde)</hi> I cannot deny, but he muſt
néedes iudge himſelfe well fauoured of her, yet ought we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
him the more, who had the power to end ſuch a perillous
aduenture: and I may ſay to you, that ſome would make them
as fearefull as theſe Beaſtes made by Arte, becauſe they giue
ſhewe of ſuch rauenous crueltie, as they would of them which
were one here aliue.</p>
                     <p>Doe you not ſée (ſaid <hi>Platir)</hi> the poeſie engrauen on this Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
which doth inuite vs to drinke at this Fountaine: And then
the letters which are within, commaundeth vs to defend our
ſelues? truſt me, ſince the danger is awarranted by the Prince
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> I will yet ſée further into this aduenture. With theſe
words he approached to the Fountaine, and hauing drunke of
the water, commended the ſwéeteneſſe thereof aboue all other
waters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Argentao,</hi> and they of the <hi>Profound Iſle,</hi> did greatly maruel
to ſée ſtrange ſights: in like manner did <hi>Platir,</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolde,</hi>
albeit they were good and hardy knights, yet did they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
with the other for company, extolling his hauty and noble
proweſſe, who (by his famous conqueſt) brought the Iſland to
be inhabited.</p>
                     <p>After they had a long time diſcourſed on the ſingularitie of
this Fountaine, they tooke their way to the Caſtle, where hard
by the riuers ſide, ſtood foure faire Iaſper pillars, whereon han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
foure ſhieldes, like vnto them which <hi>Palmerin</hi> won from
the foure Knights, and there ſtood the images of the Knights in
Columbs of Marble, hauing the like Armor and Shields as the
liuing knights had, and ſtanding as though they vſed regard to
their ſhéeldes, whereon their ſeuerall names were written in
letters of Gold.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> was as greatly amazed at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fight hereof, as he was
the ſame day he approoued the aduenture, &amp; while the kuights
tooke pleaſure to behold this ſtrange monument, he perceiued
to come ouer the Bridge an Eſquire, who was ſent thither by
<pb facs="tcp:13179:299" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Satrafort</hi> the gouernor of the Caſtle: the Eſquire had no ſooner
ſéen the knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> but he preſently returned into the
Caſtle, to giue his Maiſter to vnderſtand, that the Lord of the
Iſland was arriued there: wherevpon, <hi>Satrafort</hi> come forth to
receiue him, and with humilitie conducted him into the Caſtle,
wherein they were no ſooner entred, but <hi>Platir</hi> began after this
manner.</p>
                     <p>Me thinkes the ſtrange fights of this Countrey, is farre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to them in all other parts of the world, in that theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſhew the great danger of the aduentures paſſed, and the
brauery of this caſtle doth euidently witneſſe, that the ſkull and
knowledge of the <hi>Sage Vrganda,</hi> ought to be eſtéemed aboue
all other. The Prince <hi>Platir</hi> could not chuſe but maruell very
much, ſéeing the ſundry rare monuments, which the <hi>Sage Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda</hi>
had erected in that place, where ſhe made her continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
abyding, becauſe ſhe would alwayes ayde thoſe whom ſhe
made account of for her ſo ſpeciall friends, as you may reade at
large in the booke of the valiant <hi>Amadis</hi> of <hi>Gaule.</hi> But to come
againe to our former purpoſe, theſe Knightes hauing ſéene the
lower parts of the Caſtle, at laſt came to the place where <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> (in times paſt) found the Giant <hi>Demetail,</hi> the
fight hereof cauſed them to paſſe on further, and after they came
to the blacke riuer, wherein the malicious <hi>Eutropa</hi> caſt her
ſelfe, when the Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> tooke her by the hand, being ou
the plancke, which was ſo dangerous, the ſight of this perillous
aduenture, made them forget all the brauery they had ſéene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<hi>Siluian</hi> began to thinke on his maſters fortunate ſucceſſe,
in atchieuing ſuch a worthy &amp; famous aduenture, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the manifold troubles he had paſſed, was of ſuch force in
the gentle Eſquiers minde, as he began to ſhed teares: but the
Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> perceiuing how <hi>Siluian</hi> wept, while his
other friends were buſied in beholding the occaſions there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
he came and embraced <hi>Siluian,</hi> vſing theſe words.</p>
                     <p>I would haue thée thinke (my good friend <hi>Siluian)</hi> that the
knight, who hath the rare beauty of the princeſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
in his heart, could not faile to accompliſh theſe aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
how dangerous ſo euer they were at firſt to him, and I
<pb facs="tcp:13179:299" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aſſure thée, that the vnfained leue I beare to her, made me to
trie the hazard of this vncouth place, from whence (in the ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie
of her name) I returned victor: wherefore, I pray thée
refraine thy teares, and perſwade thy ſelfe aſſuredly, that the
earneſt deſire I haue to do ſeruice to my Lady, encouraged me
in all my trauailes.</p>
                     <p>Then he left <hi>Siluian,</hi> and came againe to his friends and
companions, ſpeaking to them in this order I pray you my
friends to forſake this place, which doth nothing elſe but trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
your thoughts with ſilent vexations of griefe, thinking on
things of ſo ſmall importance: for me thinks <hi>Satrafort</hi> ſaith, it
is time that we go to ſupper. At theſe words the knights depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
thence,
commending highly the valour of the knight of the
<hi>Tiger,</hi> and <hi>Satrafort</hi> brought them into a faire great chamber,
the windowes thereof being ouer a faire Garden very thicke
beſet with trées, and a prettie ſmall riuer taking his courſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
it. In this place the knights were ſet to ſupper, being
ſerued with ſuch great pompe and ſtate, as there wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that could be deuiſed, and <hi>Satrafort</hi> being deſirous to
witneſſe their great welcome into the <hi>Perillous Iſle,</hi> ſhewed
himſelf ſurpaſſing bountifull, and beſide, he was ſo glad of the
preſence of the noble <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as he ſpared no tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
to purchaſe thoſe things that might yéeld him contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>All Supper time, they delighted themſelues in pleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes,
vntill the tables being withdrawne, they aroſe, with
courteſie one to another, and then <hi>Satrafort</hi> brought ech of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
into his chamber, which were hanged with rich cloathes of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtrie,
that the Enchantreſſe <hi>Eutropa,</hi> and the Giant <hi>Dramu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiande</hi>
had left there, becauſe the houſe ſhould be decked at all
times, that when any of his friends came, they might haue the
better entertainment: as for them whom he thought not well
on, they durſt not be ſo bold as to preſume thither, becauſe as
he vſed his friends with courteſie, ſo did he his enemies with
crueltie.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe foure knights were no ſooner riſen on
the next morning, but they walked into
fields about the Caſtle, which were very
faire and fragrant to behold, in that the
<hi>Sage Vrganda</hi> did take great delight in her
life time to be very buſie there, during the
time the Spring laſhed, in planting and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
yong and tender grafts, which were done in the manner
of walks and Arbours, hauing kept ſuch iuſt proportion and
meaſure in ſetting them, as ſurely they would content any
friendly eye. The walkes were paued with large ſtones, of
colour of white and gréene, and the trées about them were ſo
brauely branched, as in the Summer time the Sunne could
not offend any with heate, there was ſuch a delicate ſhaddow,
and in the winter, the cold and ſharpe winde could not come at
them, by reaſon the trées were ſo thicke and high. In the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
there ſtood a goodly Ceſterne, to receiue the water that fell
when it rained, and from it by pipes and other deuiſes, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was ronueyed into all the neceſſary roomes in the Caſtle:
this ceſtern was incloſed round about with Chriſtal, and bound
with barres of ſiluer maruailous beautifully. Theſe knights
could not ſufficiently content their eyes, with the diuerſitie of
braue deuiſes about the Caſtle, and ſo long they walked till a
meſſenger came and called them to dinner, when, though they
were loath to go ſo ſoone in againe, yet (remembring their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Hoſte) they went preſently. The reſt of the day they
ſpent in their former exerciſe, vntill the night came ſtealing
<pb facs="tcp:13179:300" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on them, and euery man being in his loding, could not entend
to ſléepe, they were ſo buſie in praiſing the deeds of the <hi>Sage
Vrganda.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When <hi>Aurora</hi> had ſaluted the knights with her amiable
countenance at their windowes, <hi>Satrafort</hi> came into their
chambers, to giue them the mornings courteſie, and comming
to the Prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> ſhe began to vſe theſe ſpeeches. As it
ſéemeth to me (worthy Sir) the nouelties of this Iſland is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
chaunging, and they appeare more ſtrange euerie
houre then other, for in the Gareen where you were yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
at this inſtant is ſtanding a goodly Lodging, inuented
and builded (me thinks) very ingeniouſly, and as it cometh to
paſſe, it excéedeth all the occaſions you haue yet ſéene: for as I
made an offer to enter into it, I was forcibly kept backe by
two monſtrous Giants, who will not ſuffer any to come in at
the doore. Wherefore I thinke it good that you trie their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie,
for I am perſwaded, that the reward which is due to your
Knightly trauailes, beſtowed in the conquering of this Iſle,
vndoubtedly is within that place.</p>
                     <p>Theſe news did ſo greatly amaze the Knights, as they ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vp preſently, and armed themſelues, and comming into
the Garden, they found in the middeſt thereof, the ſtately
Lodging which <hi>Satrafort</hi> had declared to them. The worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
whereof, ſéemed miraculous ſtrange, the walles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Marble, and ſo ingeniouſly built, as it is vnpoſſible to
finde the like.</p>
                     <p>The couerture of the houſe was of Azure ſtone, which with
the glimpſe of the Sunne did ſhine ſo brauely, as it greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
the Knights to behold. On the top of all the houſe, ſtood
a Piller of Siluer of a great bigneſſe, and there leaned againſt
it a faire Table, compaſſed with exquiſite deuiſes of Arte:
on the higheſt part thereof was figured the heauens, and the
ſeauen Planets in liuely Images pictured therein, <hi>Mercurie</hi>
being Lord as then, who was attired in the ancient habite,
which they of ancient time did report him to weare: in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of the table was pictured <hi>Hercules,</hi> tearing in peeces the
théefe <hi>Cacus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:301" rendition="simple:additions"/>
At the foure corners of this houſe was foure goodly trées,
who were iuſt of the height of the houſe, and their branches
ſpreading brauely all abroad: and round about the houſe was
glaſſe windowes of maruailous coſtlineſſe, which gaue light
plentifully into all places of the ſame, the glaſſe hauing ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Hiſtories figured in gold on it, as the Knights could not
looke ſo much as they liked: which made <hi>Platir</hi> to ſpeake thus.
It ſhould ſéeme if <hi>Vrganda</hi> made this her Study, and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to decke it ſo brauely without, no doubt but ſhe would make
it farre more ſumptuous within, wherefore, I thinke it good
that we trie the crueltie of the Giants: and if fortune doe accept
vs in her fauour, we ſhall ſpéed of the treaſure incloſed within
this houſe, and I deſire that I may be the firſt in prouing the
aduenture, if ſo be the Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> like well of it, for I
would be loth to go againſt his will in any thing.</p>
                     <p>Why do you not procéede in your determination? (anſwered
<hi>Palmerin)</hi> I promiſe you I cannot miſlike of any thing you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and therefore I pray you get vs libertie of the gaints to
enter: but if it be ſo, that you cannot ſpéed as you would, we
will aſſiſt you if we ſée any danger. The Prince <hi>Platir</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the words of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> would not trifie any longer time,
but haulng drawne his ſword, and buckled on his ſhéeld, he
went on nobly againſt the Giants, who taking their Maces
in their hands prepared themſelues to receiue the Prince <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir:</hi>
and when he had ſet his ſéete on the firſt ſtep, which was
not paſt the height of one Cubite, one of the Giants caſt his
Mace to the ground: and comming two paces froward (as
though he had bene a liuing body (he tooke the Prince <hi>Platir</hi> in
his armes, and hauing throwne him downe the two ſteps to
the groued, returued againe to his companion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Platir</hi> being greatly offended to ſée himſelfe ſo vſed, came and
made a ſecond aſſault: but he was ſerued againe as he was
before. Which when the Prince <hi>Berolde</hi> perceiued, hée
went and tried his fortune: but hee ſped according as <hi>Platir</hi>
did.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> being agréeued to ſée his friends ſo abuſed, deſired
to reuenge this ſpightfull iniurie, and ſo aduanced himſelfe to
<pb facs="tcp:13179:301" rendition="simple:additions"/>
trie the aduenture, not knowing whether the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> wold
hazard himſelfe or no: but becauſe he would be one, he ſtepped
before the Prince, knowing the aduenture was not reſerued for
him, and making no account to beare his friends company in
their foyle, therfore he went to it ſmyling, but the giants ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him ſo much fauour, as they did but thruſt him foorth againe,
becauſe an Image of golde (which ſtood at the doore within)
cried out aloude thus: <hi>Take heede you ſuffer not the Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to enter the Chamber, where my Treaſure lyes, becauſe he
is not worthy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then ſuddenly theſe two Giants tooke <hi>Palmerin</hi> by the
arme, and thruſt him downe one of the ſtaires, which made
<hi>Palmerin</hi> haue an ill opinion of this aduenture, and then he
remembred all his good fortunes paſſed, thinking now he ſhould
make a concluſion of all, ſéeing he could not atchieue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of this, which ſéemed to him leſſe then any other he had
attempted.</p>
                     <p>In the meane while his thoughts were occupied in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi> (who knew well his inward afflictions)
came to the gate againe, more to be partaker with his friendes
in their foyle, then for any opinion he had himſelfe to ende the
aduenture, and he no ſooner offered to charge the Giants, but
without making any ſhewe of reſiſtance, they humbled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
at his féete, granting him frée libertie to enter at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>The ſight hereof pleaſed well the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi> and as hée
ſtood beholding the workemanſhip of the doore, the Image of
gold (which ſtood thereas the watchman) opened in the preſence
of them all, a little Cheſt, which ſhe held vpon her knées, and
hauing taken a key of gold out of it, threwe it downe before
them on the ground.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> ſtouped and tooke it vppe, and without any
further delay opened the doore, when, <hi>Palmerin, Platir,</hi> and
<hi>Berolde,</hi> comming to him, did all enter with him, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
the cauſe of their repulſe as thus, that <hi>Vrganda</hi> had
not left the aduenture to be diſcouered by them, in that her
wiſedome was diſcouered by ſo ſtraunge a meane, this firſt
<pb facs="tcp:13179:302" rendition="simple:additions"/>
chamber being her library, and wherin ſhe was alwayes woont
to ſtudy: the ſight hereof did very much delight their eyes, more
then any thing elſe they had ſeene in the whole Iſland. This
Library was round about garniſhed with bookes, which this
<hi>Sage</hi> Lady was alwayes woont to contemplate on, the bookes
lying vpon very ſumptuous Deſkes of Gold, and the Deſkes
being ſupported with beaſts of Antique worke, being all of the
ſelfe mettall. The couerings of theſe bookes were of cloath of
Gold, hauing at euery corner placed pretious ſtones of incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
value: but the riches of this Chamber might not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
with the next to it, the walles whereof was round about
decked with coſtly pictures of ladies, manifeſting moſt rare and
ſingular beauty, they being all in ſuch rich Robes and deuiſes of
apparell, as one would haue iudged them liuing creatures, ſuch
was the rare inuention of erte, beſtowed on theſe Images of
Goddeſſes, and diuers other beautifull Ladies. The Princes
gazing on theſe delicate figures, attributed to them maruellous
commendation, wiſhing that their ladies were there preſent, to
ſée ſuch braue and ſumptuous monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: and they iudged that
the ſight of theſe beautifull Pictures did as well content their
eyes, as though they had ſéene their beſt beloued Ladies, being
the bett rupt in minde of them by theſe ſéemely ſhadowes. All
along one part of this chamber, was the portraits of ſuch kings
and Queenes, as liued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of this <hi>Sage</hi> Magitian <hi>Vrgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
her owne picture likewiſe being in the middeſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhe ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in a chaire of gold, hauing her booke lying before her, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhe made ſemblance as though ſhe read. On the right ſide of
her counterfeit was placed <hi>Oriana,</hi> the daughter of king <hi>Liſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art,</hi>
king of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and on the other ſide was <hi>Briolani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a,</hi>
the Quéene of <hi>Sobradiſa:</hi> then <hi>Leonorina,</hi> the Princeſſe of
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and with her the two faire princeſſes <hi>Melicia,</hi>
and <hi>Olenda,</hi> each of them hauing their names impozed vnder
them in letters of gold. And ſuch was the rare beauty of theſe
ladies which I haue here named, as not one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was etalted
aboue the other, but all of them equall together: which maketh
me to think, that they which raigned, &amp; had the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of
beautie in the time of the valiant King <hi>Amadis,</hi> had worthily
<pb facs="tcp:13179:302" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the praiſe is vſed of them, and their knights gained immortall
renowne in aduenturing for them. In another place was to be
ſéen <hi>Yſeul</hi> the faire, <hi>Geneuera</hi> the Quéene to king <hi>Arthur,</hi> and
friend to ſir <hi>Launcelot du Lake: Yſeul</hi> with the white hands,
was accompanied with many beautiful ladies, which ſomtime
floriſhed in great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and of her <hi>Bracando</hi> was ſtudious
to leaue moſt worthy report, becauſe ſhe was highly eſtéemed
of him. In another place ſtood the Empreſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griola</hi>
the Empreſſe of <hi>Allemain, Gridonia, Flerida,</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celina,</hi>
figured ſo néere their iuſt proportions, as there wanted
nothing but life it ſelfe: all of them worthy high praiſe for their
delicate ſwéete faces, but <hi>Flerida</hi> was ſuppoſed to excéed them
all. In another place of the Chamber was placed their ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes,
who (in the court of the Emperor of <hi>Greece)</hi> cauſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
knights to take aduenturous trauails on them: the firſt
was <hi>Polinarda,</hi> the Daughter of the vertuous and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
prince <hi>Primaleon,</hi> acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with the faire <hi>Miragarda,
Leonarda</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princeſſe of <hi>Thrace, Altea, Sidelia,</hi> daughter to the
king <hi>Tarnaes</hi> of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Arnalte</hi> the princeſſe of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarre:</hi>
as chiefeſt of theſe was placed the Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda</hi>
who ſéemed in beauty to be aduantaged aboue the other. And
there was the prince <hi>Florendos</hi> pointed, to ſée if fortune wold
reſpect him any more in that place, and to ſpeake indifferently,
ſuch was the workmanſhip beſtowed like wiſe on <hi>Miragarda,</hi>
as one could hardly iudge whether <hi>Polinarda</hi> did excell her or
no. <hi>Oriana</hi> and <hi>Briolania</hi> were of ſuch equalitie together, as it
would haue tried a ſharpe wit to ſay, which of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was faireſt:
but yet the portrait of the faire <hi>Oriana,</hi> was ſet forth with more
ſhew of grauity, as wel beſéemed the daughter of ſuch a famous
king, aſſuring you that her ciuill and gratious countenance,
was able to haue woone the victory of the preciſeſt eye.</p>
                     <p>But what if vpon theſe beautifull motions, each one of theſe
knights ſhould haue fallen from affecting his beſt beloued? for
I promiſe you, that nether <hi>Oriana, Briolania, Polinarda, Fleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
nor <hi>Miragarda,</hi> was not to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to <hi>Yſeul</hi> the faire: yet
notwithſtanding, no one of them could be moued to that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for each of them was ſo deceitfull in regard to his Saint, as
<pb facs="tcp:13179:303"/>
all other beſide did but offend their eyes. For thus they perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themſelues, that true and faithfull hope being grounded
in the heart, and firmely fixed in the eyes of any man, could
not be remoued by any ſiniſter occaſion, in that their thoughts
were ſetled, and their liking ſatiſfied: but they that are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
with euery countenance, and euery face liketh them, but
none contenteth them, they are ſuch recreants from Loue, as
they are not worthy to come within his court.</p>
                     <p>The Princes commended the beauty of <hi>Yſeul,</hi> as it worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſcrued, but yet they thought their owne Ladies fairer
then ſhe, and ſo they ſtood maruailing at theſe delectable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions,
whereon they could not gaze ſufficient, their deſires
were courſing in ſuch an endleſſe Laborinth. Beyond them
all, the Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> was rauiſhed in affection, ſéeing the
counterfeite of her that did ſo much torment him, ſhe being
attired in the ſame manner, as ſhe was when he took his
farewell of her: whereupon he fell into ſuch an arrogant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite,
as though it were his Lady <hi>Polinarda</hi> indéed, and fearing
he had moued her to any offence, he began in this manner to
ſpeake to the Picture.</p>
                     <p>Madame, I know you are ſhe who onely hath the power to
command me, but what profite do I receiue in vſing ſuch ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to her, who maketh her ſelfe deafe, and will not heare me?
And yet do I couet y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> you would but reſpect my words, which
fauour would but ſtrengthen my loue, and lengthen my life.
But I ſée wel madam, you make no accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the words which
may and can preuent my vnhappy deſtinie: wherefore, by how
much I vtter them to my great detriment and grief, by ſo much
the ſooner ſhall I knit vp my ſmall lamentations, and this I
aſſure you, that I am he who onely liues to die for your ſake.
<hi>Platir</hi> vſed the like language towards <hi>Sidelia,</hi> the Daughter
to king <hi>Tarnaes</hi> of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> to whom he was ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
eſpouſed. <hi>Berolde</hi> the Prince of <hi>Spaine</hi> finding not his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Miſtres in this place, failed not to praiſe her, as though
ſhe had bene in preſence: for it is the cuſtome of a true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
louer, who delighteth in her he made his choiſe of, whether
ſhe be abſent or preſent, yet to commend &amp; extoll his only felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:303" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſo did the Prince <hi>Berolde</hi> thinke it a great iniurie,
that any ſhould commend their Ladies, aboue his beſt beloued
<hi>Oniſtalda,</hi> who in ſooth did well deſerue her place among the
other.</p>
                     <p>And if the <hi>Sage Vrganda</hi> forgot to place her in her Study, it
was for no other occaſion, then becauſe the place was ſo furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with them, who were eſteemed the moſt ſoueraigne in
beautie through the whole world, When they had ſufficiently
contented their eyes with theſe braue ſhowes, the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi>
ſpake vnto them in this manner. I perceiue my Lordes, that
theſe images haue depriued you of naturall vnderſtanding, in
that they cauſe you to forget them, whom your duty comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
you to vſe with honour: wherefore, I pray you doe not
ſéeme ſo fond in prayſing theſe figures, which are no other but
ſhapes without ſubſtance, for in the beholding theſe, you do but
miſpend your time, looking for that recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which they haue
not the power to giue you. And therefore it ſhall be more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for you, to goe to them whom the Pictures repreſent, who
in time will more ſufficiently content your hearts, then your
eyes receiue pleaſure in looking on theſe toyes, which <hi>Vrganda</hi>
giueth you to ſee at this prefent, by her Enchauntment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> hearing the words of his Brother the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi>
returned to him with this anſwere. Doe you maruaile (Syr
<hi>Aliart)</hi> if they which behold the liuely preſentations, of ſo
faire and beautifull Goddeſſes, finde good cauſe to buſie their
braines, and receiue their memories? Credite me, I thinke no
man but would be rauiſhed in delight, to ſée things of ſo rare
and excellent importance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſpake in this manner, becauſe he would not haue
his friends ſuſpect his amorous thoughts, ſo departing thence,
they went againe to the Caſtle, where (prouiſion being made)
they ſate downe to dinner, which being ended, they concluded
to depart from the Iſland: wherevpon, <hi>Palmerin</hi> cauſed <hi>Satra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
to be called into his preſence, with the other Gentlemen
that came in his company, when, <hi>Palmerin</hi> ſpeaking to his
Brother the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi> began to vſe his ſpéeches thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:304" rendition="simple:additions"/>
If I ſhould not conſider with my ſelfe (my noble friend
and Brother) which way Fortune might aduance me to ſuch
eſtate, as I ſhould be able to recompence the manifold courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
I haue receiued at your handes, you might repute mée of
a moſt baſe and ignoble minde: wherefore to witneſſe to you
the great feare I haue, leaſt I ſhould be condemned amongſt
the vnthankefull, I here frankely and fréely giue you the <hi>Peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Iſle,</hi> which I haue conquered with great trauaile and loſſe
of my blood, deſiring that you would accept thereof, in that it
ought rather to be vnder your gouernment, then any other that
I know.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, I pray you not refuſe my gentle gift, and I
would it were of ſuch eſtimation, as I could finde in my heart
to beſtow vpon you, for I perſwade my ſelfe, that it was the
will of <hi>Vrganda,</hi> it ſhould be reſerued for you. And for <hi>Satra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi>
I perceiue he is as willing hereto as my ſelfe, deſiring you,
that you would account of him as his nobleneſſe and vertue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
that you may diſcharge the duty wherein I am greatly
bound to him.</p>
                     <p>My Lord (anſwered the <hi>Sage Aliart)</hi> they of this Iſland
haue good occaſion to be offended, ſéeing you will commit it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the handes of him, who is not worthy to come within it: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe,
the earneſt deſire I haue to doe you ſeruice, willeth
me not to make refuſall of your gratious offer, and I accept
<hi>Satrafort,</hi> not as my fubiect, but as my louing friend and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
as well for the valour of his perſon, as likewiſe to let
you perfectly vnderſtand, that I am he who vowes himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

                     <p>Thus concluding his ſpéeches, he offered to take ſhe Prince
<hi>Palmerins</hi> hande to kiſſe it, but the courteous Prince would
not permitte him, then taking the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> in his armes,
he beganne againe as followeth. My louing Brother, if For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

The Prince <hi>Berolde</hi> and <hi>Platir,</hi> commended marueilouſly
the liberalitie of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> whoſe preſence was more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

diſpleaſure of his new Lord, to whom he aduaunced himſelfe
to giue him his faith for his dutifull obedience, praying the
Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> that he would continue him in his woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
noble fauour. <hi>Palmerin</hi> vſed ſuch friendly behauiour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

left the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> to giue order about the cuſtoms of the Iſle,

                     <p>Illuſtrious and moſt gratious Emperour, I humbly deſire
your maieſty, that you would thinke of me in your woonted fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
&amp; clemency, not remembring my paſſed tranſgreſſions,
for if your Grace looke into the depth of them, I ſhall be found
worthy of moſt grieuous puniſhment, which your royall cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
hath power to moderate, in that you are accuſtomed to
vſe mercy to them, whoſe offences deſerue rigorous intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
I am (dread Prince) that ancient man, who came and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
your highneſſe aſſiſtance, and diſſembling with teares
and faint ſpéeches, (which were nothing elſe but méere deceite)
that I had great néede of the ayde of one of your Knightes:
wherevpon you granted licence to your noble Nephew, that
he ſhould leaue your Court and goe in my company, but I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
deceit, was deceiued my ſelfe, and could not execute on
him what I had determined.</p>
                     <p>Then began <hi>Alfernao</hi> to diſcourſe to the emperor, the whole
ſucceſſe of his Nephewe <hi>Florian</hi> of the <hi>Forreſt,</hi> who had ſent
<pb facs="tcp:13179:305" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him to informe his Maieſtie of all that hapned to him, that the
report of the Eſquire might be the better belieued: whereto the
Emperour thus anſwered.</p>
                     <p>Certainly <hi>Alfernao,</hi> you haue brought my déere Friend and
Nephew, into the greateſt danger that euer could happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him,
and albeit I haue good reaſon to the contrarie, yet not for thine
owne deſerts I pardon thée, but for bringing me ſo good tydings
of him, whome the Heauens would not ſuffer to fall into the
hands of the cruell <hi>Collambra:</hi> but truſt mee <hi>Alfernao,</hi> your
dealing ſhall remaine to me for a ſufficient example, how I giue
credit hereafter, either to teares or faire ſpéeches, eſpecially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
from ſuch a one as you ſéeme to be. As for <hi>Arlencea,</hi> I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéeme
maruellous well of her courteous dealings towards my

my good will to requite her honeſt and vertuous deſerts:
in the meane time you may goe to your Chamber, and reſt your

<hi>Arlencea,</hi> you ſhall beare record of their entertainment, in hope
of which, I remit all that is paſt.</p>
                     <p>I would gladly (anſwered <hi>Alfernao)</hi> go where the Empreſſe
is, that the feare which ſhee hath conceyued by the Knight of the
<hi>Sauadge-ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> Eſquire, may be perſwaded in hearing the truth.
While he was thus ſpeaking, the Empreſſe (accompanied with
her Ladyes, came to the Emperours preſence, whereof he was
very glad, which made him beginne thus.</p>
                     <p>Madame, I perceiue that the deſire you haue to vnderſtand

The Prince <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſéeing the great choller of the Ladies
began very pleaſantly to ſmile at them, all the Princes in the
Hall likewiſe bearing him company: and in the meanetime
this laughter laſted, they heard a great noyſe without in the

the Eſquire to the Prince <hi>Berolde</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> to come lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by the hand the Gianteſſe <hi>Collambra,</hi> the ſight of whom,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Albanis</hi> entred the great hall holding <hi>Collambra</hi> by the
hand, her face being ſo fearefull, as moued the Emperour to
ſtart ſuddenly. <hi>Alfarnao</hi> had no ſooner eſpyed her, but his heart
came in a manner dead, neuertheleſſe, he couered his gréefe ſo
cunningly as he could, and hauing embraced her, began in this
manner.</p>
                     <p>Madame, it ſhould appeare, that the ſame miſfortune which
hath brought me hither, hath had the like authority ouer you:
wherefore I deſire you to take all patiently, and commit our
vnhappines to Fortunes vnſtedineſſe. When the cruell <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lambra,</hi>
(who had all this while eyed the Emperor) heard the
words of <hi>Alfernao,</hi> ſhe began to cry aloud, (ſuſpecting that
ſhe was betrayed) as though with her voyce, ſhe would haue
ſhaken the Hall in péeces: and after ſhe had wept bitterly a
pretty ſpace, ſhe ſpake as followeth.</p>
                     <p>O <hi>Alfernao,</hi> I ſée at this inſtant, thy monſtrous and diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
dealing, in that thou haſt forgotten the good and kind affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which my huſband <hi>Brauorant</hi> in his life time did alwaies
beare thee, in that thou haſt deliuered me into their hands, to
whom thou haſt alſo betrayed my daughter, thou hauing vſed
the matter ſo, as I ſhall neuer ſée her againe.</p>
                     <p>Madame (ſaid <hi>Alfernao)</hi> I know well the doubt you make
of my loyalty, and I ſée I muſt be conſtrained to ſatiſfie you,
by rehearſing my manifold and extreame mifortunes, as well
to qualifie your anger towardes me, as to cauſe you ſée
how equall our vnhappineſſe is, in that one vnhappy Planet
hath ſtroken vs both. Then he began to rip vp the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
of that which had happened ſince his departure
<pb facs="tcp:13179:306" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from her, and at the end of his diſcourſe, he gaue her to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,

of her children, and the enuie ſhee bare to him that had killed
them, which if ſhe did not agrée vnto, ſhe ſhould be in daunger

Credite me <hi>Alfernao,</hi> I am not ſo much offended at my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

the matter, I giue thée this aſſurance, that I die, in thinking
<hi>Arlencea</hi> my daughter is ſo forgetfull of her ſelfe, as to endure
the courteſie of him that hath murthered her brethren, and the
death of them is the more yrkeſome vnto me, in that ſhe hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

                     <p>Madame (anſwered <hi>Leonarda)</hi> I am not able to iudge how

would ſo greatly honour her, as ſhe ſhould quickely forget the

could not ſuffer him to declare what the Emperor had aſſigned

With theſe words ſhe ran to one of the great open win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes

her, ſhe threw her ſelfe headlong downe into the Court, and
<hi>Alfernao</hi> comming (as though he would haue hindered her)

forth of the Hall ſo rauiſhed inwardly with ioy and gladneſſe,
as he could not tell (for a prettie while) whither to goe: in like

where he ſate downe in a chaire, vntill he might ſée them come
in at the gates: in the meane while, many knights of his Court
came to tell him of the arriuall of his ſonne <hi>Polendos,</hi> but he
did not make them any anſwer, for that his minde was buſied,
in remembring how many miſfortunes had come to him one in
another necke, and yet (notwithſtanding) they haue all come
to a proſperous end, whereupon he humbly deſired the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Powers to continue him ſtill in their woonted fauourable
protection, for it is the nature of men of good iudgement, to
doubt of danger after they haue once receiued good ſucceſſe, for
that it hath bene euermore ſéene, that felicitie and miſerie doe
not equally happen, but a dram of pleaſure, hath commonly a
pound of paine. In this maner the good Emperour diſcourſed
ſecretly with himſelfe, and comparing euery cauſe ioyntly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the teares did plentifully run downe his white beard,
thinking how Fortune fauoured him in his Age, when hee was

two extreames to be ſuddenly rapt away.</p>
                     <p>While the Emperor was thus winding vp the endleſſe bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom

might the better welcom them, he alighted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Horſe, being

As he continued this fauorable vſage to <hi>Belcar, Oniſtalde,</hi> ſon

them on foote towards the pallace, refuſing to mount on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe,

                     <p>The Princes were conducted into the Emperors chamber,
according as it was the cuſtome for thoſe whom he eſtéemed, at
their arriuall, and they were ſcant out of the great hall, when,

                     <p>Certainely my friend (anſwered the Emperour) I am ſorry
that I did not make more remembrance of him, but let him
commit the fault to my knights with whom I will enioyne in
making amends againe to morrow, becauſe I ſhall ſée him to

The eſquire departed with this courteous anſwere of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
who taking the Empreſſe by the hand, withdrew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
into their chamber, where they paſſed the night with
greater contentment, then they had done of many daies before.</p>
                     <p>But when faire <hi>Phoebus</hi> in the morning had diſplayed his
golden face on the earth, the Empreſſe walked to the Chappell
to heare ſeruice, the Emperour and the knights being farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind

in her chamber, for that ſhe had determined to feaſt <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendos,
Belcar, Oniſtalde,</hi> and the other Princes, who were

                     <p>The Tables being withdrawne, the Emperor commanded
the principall knights of his court, to goe welcome on land the

would not haue him thinke, that they had forgotten the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

                        <hi>Polendos</hi> with his company being come to the Port, (hée
with ſuch as he thought good (tooke a Barge, and went aboord
the Galley to the Ambaſſador, and brought them on ſhore with
them very nobly, with ſuch a noiſe of drums, phifes, trumpets, &amp;

The Ambaſſador nothing the great courteſie of <hi>Polendos,</hi> who
was diligent in ſhewing him the greateſt honour might be,
knew very well, that this excéeding humanitie came from him
that was their Lord and gouernor: wherevpon he conſidered,
that a Prince ſo wel beloued of all, as the Emperour <hi>Palmerin</hi>
was, ſhould finde more friends to aid him in his neceſſity, then
enemies to moleſt him.</p>
                     <p>All this while, the Emperor attended the Ambaſſadors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Empreſſe chamber, accompanied with his ſonne
<hi>Primaleon,</hi> and many Princes and Knights of his Court, and
the Ambaſſador (who was the ſame man that came before, to
requeſt in the great <hi>Turks</hi> name, the fréedome of <hi>Albayzar,</hi> in
change of thoſe Princes that were priſoners in <hi>Turkie)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Preſence of the Emperour, made him ſuch humble
reuerence as his Maieſtie well deſerued, and not vſing any
ſuch proude behauiour, as he did at his firſt comming to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The emperor welcommed him very gratiouſly, deſiring him
not to be offended, becauſe he did not accept of him y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> day before
according as willingly he would haue done. Moſt worthy Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
(ſayd the Ambaſſadour) I am not of ſo ſmall diſcretion,
but I knew well how buſie you were yeſterſtay, in receiuing
home them, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue ſo long looked for: but letting theſe
néedleſſe matters paſſe, I muſt requeſt to know your highnes
minde, as concerning the libertie of the prince <hi>Albayzar,</hi> whom
you would not ſende to the great <hi>Turke</hi> my Lord, for that you
doubted he would not ſende home them, whom he kept as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.
As touching the deliuerance of them, my Lord hath
bin ſo hardy as to truſt to your gentlenes, onely at the intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of his daughter <hi>Targiana,</hi> hée hauing no aſſurance for the
Prince <hi>Albayzar</hi> his daughters huſband, but onely the word
of her who is your great friend: &amp; deſireth that you would now
<pb facs="tcp:13179:310" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſend home her beloued Lord <hi>Albayzar,</hi> of whom the great
<hi>Turke</hi> himſelfe willed not me to vſe any ſpéech, hauing ioyned
me to ſpeake of thoſe things, which will but little pleaſe you in
the hearing them: the Emperour returned him this anſwer.</p>
                     <p>I know not what the great <hi>Turke</hi> your Lord hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to make me acquainted withal, but I am ſo accuſtomed to
doubtfull occaſions, as let his mallice ſtretch neuer ſo far, and
his deuiſes purchaſe what ſcope he can, yet haue they no power
to make me feare. But for the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana,</hi> I am to
thinke my ſelfe highly in her debt, in that her earneſt intreatie
wonne the libertie of knights, and ſurely it gréeueth me, that
her father would be ſo enuious towards me, who would with
all my heart, haue his daughter againe in my Court, that I
might recompence ſome part of her gentleneſſe ſhe hath vſed to
me, and for that ſhe would ſo kindly pledge her ſelfe vpon the
aſſurance ſhe repoſeth in my fidelitie.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, I promiſe you Sir, I haue written to the King
<hi>Recinde,</hi> that he ſhould not faile to ſend me the Prince <hi>Albay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi>
and I beléeue certainly it will not belong before he come
hither: wherefore, I pray you to ſtay here till he come, and in
the meane time I will vſe the matter ſo, as the <hi>Turke</hi> your
Lord ſhall be rid of his doubt, and the Princeſſe <hi>Targian</hi> a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied
to her owne contentment.</p>
                     <p>I am of the opinion (ſaid the Ambaſſadour) that the Prince
<hi>Albayzar</hi> will be here, and that quickly, for the Damoſel (who
was ſometime ſent in ſecret to your miſtreſſe, was diſpatched
with her meſſage twenty dayes before my ſetting forth, that
ſhe ſhould let the King <hi>Recinde</hi> and the Prince <hi>Albayzar</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
of my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, and certifie them likewiſe of the liberty
of our knights: by meanes whereof, they will not faile to come
hither to your Court, vntill which time I am determined (by
your licence) to ſoiourne here, but I will not declare my Lord
the <hi>Turkes</hi> minde, before I ſée the Prince <hi>Albayzar,</hi> neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,

willed him to giue faithfull credit to what the Ambaſſador ſaid,
he deſired him to report the cauſe of his arriuall: whereto the
Ambaſſador thus replyed.</p>
                     <p>My gracious Lorde, I knowe you haue not forgotten the
day, when the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana</hi> came vnto your Court, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the ſubtiltie wherewith ſhe was entiſed, and brought forth
of her Fathers Courte, by the guilefull dealings of your Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew,
the Knight of the <hi>Sauadge-man,</hi> who was hindered in
ſuch ſort in his iourney, as he could not bring the Princeſſe <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana</hi>
vnto your Court: but ſhe being here, was entertained by
your Excellencie, the Empreſſe, and the Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi>
in ſuch gratious manner, as ſhe eſtéemeth her ſelfe (during life)
bound to you for your manifolde courteſies. And my Lorde the
<hi>Turke</hi> (in regard of your Noble fauour toward his Daughter)
would gladly (in any thing hee could) witneſſe his beneuolent
minde to you, forgetting all iniuryes paſt, for his faire Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Targianaes</hi> ſake: but with this condition by the way, that
your Maieſtie offer him nothing againſt right or reaſon, for if
you do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And for the ſubſtance of his minde, it is thus in briefe, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth
you to ſend vnto him the Knight your Nephew, becauſe he
would chaſtiſe him for his haynous offence. And if you refuſe to
ſatiſfie his requeſt, he commaundeth me to let you vnderſtand,
he is your enemie, and will ſo reuenge that Knights abuſe, as
all the world ſhall take example by him.</p>
                     <p>I cannot belieue (ſaid the Emperor) that the <hi>Turke</hi> your lord
will ſeem to threaten him, at whoſe hands he requireth nothing
but Iuſtice, the which I being very willing to doo, cannot thinke
well of your preſent procéedings, for that in ſooth you demaund
no Iuſtice. Beſides, it is not reaſonable to graunt what your
<pb facs="tcp:13179:311" rendition="simple:additions"/>
lorde requireth, for if <hi>Florian</hi> be accuſed for bringing away his
Daughter, I anſwer, that he did it at the earneſt intreatie and
deſire of her ſelfe: So that your lorde (I perceyue trauelleth in
vain after my Nephew, the Knight of the <hi>Sauadge-man</hi> whom
I will not ſend vnto him, if I wiſt he ſhould be as welcome to
him as to my ſelfe. And if I ſhould ſeeme to content the will of
your lord, I cannot ſend my Nephew except he pleaſe himſelfe,
and I am perſwaded he will not conſent vnto it, much leſſe his
Father, who is a Prince of great authoritie.</p>
                     <p>If this reaſon I haue made you, will not content the will of
your lorde the <hi>Turke,</hi> I am willing to receyue whatſoeuer he
pleaſe, eyther to bring or ſend me, but I am ſorie I am ſo farre
ſpent with yéeres, that I cannot ſhewe him what I haue beene
ſometime. Neuertheleſſe, for a ſufficient witneſſe of my ſelfe,
I will ſende him the Knight whome hee demaundeth, that hee
may tell him what I would doo my ſelfe, and let him be bolde,
that Knight will doo his errand to the vttermoſt. As for other
aunſwere I wiſh you not to looke for at my handes, wherefore
I thinke it good you goe to reſt your ſelfe, and when the Prince

the cauſe of the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> for the loue of whom

anger of his ſtomacke, in ſacrificing the good and hardy Knight

                     <p>The ſudden dumps of this yong Princeſſe, was well percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by her ſwéete friend <hi>Polinarda,</hi> who hid her knowledge
thereof for the preſent time, vntill they had brought the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

                     <p>When the Princeſſe had herein ſatiſfied her minde, ſhée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained

of the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> ſo that at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
ſhe reputed him as a man without faith, loue, or regard of
loyaltie, and ſhe would gladly haue deuiſed the meane, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to baniſh the remembrance of him forth of her heart. Which
the Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda</hi> perceiuing, and willing to preuent
any miſchance, that ſhould happen to her Couzin, ſhe began to
vſe her talke in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Madame, thinke you the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> will be the ſame
man to you, as he was to the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana?</hi> You muſt
not thinke ſo, for their loue (as it was then) was not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
among perſons of honour, and that which made him ſo
ready to thinke well on her, was for no other occaſion, but that
he might finde the meanes to get out of the hands of the great
<hi>Turke</hi> her Father: and from that Court he could neuer haue
eſcaped, had it not béene by the aide of the princeſſe <hi>Targiana,</hi> ſo
that to ſatiſfie her will, &amp; helpe his own neceſſity, he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

<pb facs="tcp:13179:312" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is not for you to ground your iudgement on that which
is done and paſt, for that your beauty farre excelleth the blacke
hew of the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana,</hi> and you being accounted as one
of the moſt renowned Ladies through the whole world, muſt
iudge thus with your ſelfe, that he will not a little boaſt of his
good fortune, being entertained into your gratious ſeruice.</p>
                     <p>And on my word you may aſſuredly build, the Knight of the
<hi>Sauage man</hi> is onely yours, and he would not follow the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures
he hath enterpriſed, but onely in hope to gaine your
fauourable acceptation: wherefore I pray you let the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that I haue ſpoken, cauſe you to forſake the conceit you
haue of my Couzin.</p>
                     <p>Madame, (anſwered <hi>Leonarda)</hi> you haue woon ſuch power
ouer me by your friendly words, as I am forced to forget my

will be inueigled, ſéeing be hath the conducting of ſo many
Ladies through the Realme of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Good ſwéete Lady (ſaide <hi>Polinarda)</hi> I pray you let not your
ſpirits be troubled with theſe ſuſpitious paſſions, for your
Knight is not of ſo weake iudgement, as any other ſhould

Damoſelles, the company of whom maketh them to haue the
better remembrance of thoſe, who ruleth their thoughts by the

may aſſure your ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſpéeches that <hi>Polinarda</hi> vſed, did ſo perſwade the yong

the requeſt of certaine Ladies he hath brought in his company,
which preuaileth ſo much with this good knight, as (if your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie

Knights of your Court, who wil maintaine the beauty of their
Ladies, to excell them he hath brought with him. And that he
might procéede in his enterpriſe, he rather intended to aſke
leaue of you then of the King, becauſe he knowes he ſhall not
any way offend his excellency. The King and the Quéene were
verie glad of theſe newes, in that Fortune had ſent them the
tryall of thoſe matters they moſt deſired, which was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
very dainty there, for that the Emperours Court of <hi>Greece</hi>
carryed ſuch a braue report, as all the noble Knights in the

                     <p>The greateſt reſt or quiet (anſwered the Eſquier) which the

but ſince your Maieſty hath ſo fréely granted him the Iouſt
I will not faile to let him vnderſtand your gracious pleaſure: in

                     <p>The Eſquier was no ſooner departed, but the King went
and looked foorth at one of the windows, and ſeeing the Knight
in the fielde, among ſo many Ladies, hée ſaide to the Quéene:
Madame, come hither, and you ſhal ſee the ſtrangeſt aduenture,
that euer you did in all your life. Certainely (ſaid the Quéene,
when ſhee had well beheld the Knight and the Damoſelles) it
ſhould ſéeme they haue a good opinion of the Knight, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
themſelues ſo amiably in his company, and one of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
appeareth in ſtature, as it were a Gianteſſe. Indéede ſaid
the King, her ſtrangeneſſe makes me to eye her the more, and
for the Knight, I iudge either he is very fooliſh, or elſe he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
by the commandement of ſome great Princeſſe, to leade
about with him theſe Damoſels.</p>
                     <p>While the King and the Quéene ſtood thus ieaſting on the
Knight and the Damoſels, the Prince <hi>Albayzar</hi> (who was
giuen to vnderſtand of this aduenture) came foorth of his
Chamber, and when he came to the Pallace gate, he mounted
on Horſebacke, and came to the window where the King and
Queene looked foorth, and hauing giuen them the ſalutation of
the day, and queſtioned ſomewhat about the enterpriſe of the
Knight, he determined to trie the Combate with him. But his
haſty intent was ſtaied at this time, for that a Knight very
well armed came into the fielde, monnted on a luſty Courſar,
and bearing for his deuiſe in his Shielde, a white Hart, in a
<pb facs="tcp:13179:314" rendition="simple:additions"/>
field of Sable. The knight being in the place where the Iouſt
was determined, the Eſquire (who had béene before ſent with
the meſſage to the Quéene) ſpake vnto him in this order.</p>
                     <p>Sir, the Damoſels knight, ſaith that he is not accuſtomed
to Iouſt, without that which ſhall be his recompence if hée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
victor.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore I pray you let him vnderſtand, what ſhall bée
his deſert if he chance to conquer you: for if the victory fall on
your ſide, he will yeeld the Damoſell vnto you, which you ſhall
thinke beſt on in all the company: the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Knight replyed
thus.</p>
                     <p>The knight (my friend) as it ſéemes to me, is farre beyond
the ſcope of my minde, in that he would trouble other folkes,
with them that he would be gladly rid of himſelfe: wherefore
you may ſay vnto him, that I am ſuch a Ladies ſeruant, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
whom I haue dot yet ſo well deſerued, as (if I were
vanquiſhed) to yeeld her vp into his cuſtodie. And I come for
no other cauſe into this place, but to let him well and truely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that the beauty of thoſe Damoſels, may not compare
with the heauenly face of my Lady. And if my fortune proue ſo
good, as my triall will preuaile. I ſhall content my ſelfe without
expecting any other recompence at the Knights hands: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
till him I would gladly know, for whom he preſumeth to
hazard the Iouſt.</p>
                     <p>The Eſquire hauing brought the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Knights anſwere
to his Lord, hée did content himſelfe very well therewith:
Marry tell him (quoth he) that I haue not the leiſure to name
the Lady, in whoſe cauſe I fight, but if hée be ſo happie as to
conquer me, I will withall my heart ſatiſfie his requeſt. The
Eſquire went to him againe with his Maiſters minde, which
when the <hi>Spaniard</hi> heard, hée preſently entred into theſe
words. I perceiue that thy maiſters proud and hauty ſtomack,
which made him ſo bold to enter the fielde, cauſeth him now
to be ſo braue in ſpéeches: wherefore I muſt take paines to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage
his courage, becauſe I will helpe him away with one of
his Damoſels.</p>
                     <p>The King <hi>Recinde</hi> and <hi>Albayzar,</hi> who marked well their
<pb facs="tcp:13179:315" rendition="simple:additions"/>
large language, deſired to ſée if their déedes would counteruaile
their wordes, eſpecially if the Damoſels knight were ſuch a
one as he made himſelfe to be. At laſt they broached their horſes
with their ſpurs, and ran together with ſo great force, as the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> knight, who was the ſeruant to <hi>Policia,</hi> the daughter
to Duke <hi>Ladiſlart,</hi> receiued ſuch a pleaſant ſtroke, (the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell
Knight hauing broken his ſtaffe ſo iuſt vpon him) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>as
his Shield was rared thorow the midſt, and himſelfe throwne
to the ground with his heeles vpward: but hee recouered
himſelfe quickly like a good Knight, and drawing his ſword,
came to reuenge the foyle hee ſuſtained in the Iouſt, which
the Damoſelles Knight beholding, he ſtayed him with theſe
ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>Sir knight, I came not to craue licence for the combat with
the ſword, wherefore I pray you pacifie your ſelfe, and let me
Iouſt with theſe fiue Knights, who I ſee attend for me, and if
I be ſo happy to eſcape out of their hands not diſaduantaged, I
ſhall be content to pleaſure you in your owne deſire.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> knight was ſo offended at this miſhap, as he
cared not if he had dyed there preſently, but that the king com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to auoyd the place.</p>
                     <p>Then one of the fiue knights entred the field, but he was
welcommed like the firſt, and ſo in briefe did they all beare
one another company: which <hi>Albayzar</hi> ſeeing, ſaid, that the
Damoſeles might not be woon without good paines were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowne,
they hauing ſuch a good and hardy Knight to defend
them. The Damoſels Knight hauing broken foure Launces,
withdrewe himſelfe, attending when his Eſquire ſhould
bring him another. Then <hi>Albayzar</hi> (ſeeing the Knights ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie)
ſent him one of his owne Launces, which was blacke,
and the head was of pure Gold, but the Damoſelles Knight
would not receiue it, ſpeaking to him that brought it in this
manner.</p>
                     <p>Thou mayeſt ſay vnto <hi>Albayzar,</hi> that the little loue and
good will I beare him, maketh mee diſdaine to receyue any
thing hee ſendeth. Aduauncing himſelfe towards, hee tooke a
Launce that was ſent him by the King, wherewith he charged
<pb facs="tcp:13179:315" rendition="simple:additions"/>
another knight that came againſt him, in ſuch ſort, as he was
caſt out of his Saddle ſo boiſterouſly, that for a good while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
ſenſleſſe. In the meane while the Damoſells Knight
gallopped on to the end of the courſe, becauſe he could hardly
ſtay his horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the vanquiſhed Knight aroſe and departed out
of the field and then the Prince returned backe againe to the

tooke him by the arme, vſing theſe ſpéeches to him. Sir knight,
I iudge that the little knowledge you haue of me, hath made
you to deſpiſe and contemne the Lance I ſent you, but yet I
parden your folly in ſo doing.</p>
                     <p>I deſire (ſaid the Damoſels Knight) to beléeue the words
I ſent you by your Eſquire, and perſwade your ſelfe, that I

I would willingly enter the Combat: <hi>Albayzar</hi> hearing theſe

                     <p>I would with all my heart, aunſwered the Damoſelles

firſt that ſhe hath receiued of me as yet: <hi>Albayzar</hi> in a rage
made this anſwere.</p>
                     <p>I will not faile in kéeping my promiſe to thée, and if the gods
vouchſafe me liue ſo long, I will preſent thy head to my Lady
the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana,</hi> in reuenge of the ſhame I haue this
day receiued at thy hands. I would be ſory (ſaid the Damoſels
Knight) that thou ſhouldeſt die in this minde: then returning
his face to the King <hi>Recinde,</hi> he ſaid. I deſire your Grace that
you would ſuffer me to depart, and that you would not be offen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
becauſe I declare not who I am: but this you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
your ſelfe, that there is no one Knight in the world, that
doth more wiſh your good, and is readier to doe you ſeruice then
my ſelfe: to which words the King thus replyed.</p>
                     <p>Since it is not your will (Sir Knight) then you would be
knowne, I will not be he that ſhall moue you to the contrary:
but if at any time you paſſe this way, I deſire you to viſit me,
for in ſooth you ſhall be welcome. I thanke your Grace moſt
humbly (anſwered the Damoſels Knight) and the great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and courteſie I haue found at your hands, ſhall not be
forgotten ſo long as I liue. Then taking one of the Launces
that were left, he gaue a reuerent ſhewe of obeyſance to the
King, the Quéene, and all the Ladies (who tooke great delight
in him, beholding his knightly behauiour) and ſo he departed
with his company.</p>
                     <p>The King returned into his Caſtle, accompanied with the
Prince <hi>Albayzar,</hi> whoſe heart was ſo intruailouſly ouercome
with griefe, as he would not ſpeake to any, nor ſuffer any to
ſpeake to him. The quéene and her ladies were ſorrie, they had
no further knowledge of the Damoſels Knight, and beſide they
were offended at the Prince <hi>Albayzars</hi> foile, as well becauſe
his gentle behauiour was ſuch, as for the reputation he gained
when he carried away the Princes <hi>Miragardaes</hi> Shield.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſels Knight was not very farre from the Citie,
but the darke night drew on, and they being in a Forreſt, and
néere to a faire Fountaine, concluded there to reſt themſelues
<pb facs="tcp:13179:319" rendition="simple:additions"/>
for that night: ſo, after they had refreſhed themſelues, they
laid them down among the gréene leaues: the Prince himſelfe,
he went and lay a pretty ſpace from the Damoſels, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his head on the roote of a Trée, the beautie of <hi>Leonarda</hi> the
Princeſſe of <hi>Thrace,</hi> preſented it ſelf in his amorous thoughts,
charging him with ſo many contrary Paſſions, as all that
night he could not lay his eye lids together, yet was his loue ſo
irreſolute, as the leſt thing in the world could haue made him
forget all quite.</p>
                     <p>While the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> lay thus buſied with a thouſand
imaginations, <hi>Arlencea,</hi> who was marnailouſly affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, ſeeing her companions were all faſt aſleepe, went
to the place where the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> was laid, where, ſitting
downe by his ſide, ſhe began to fall into theſe ſpéeches. It ſéems
to me (moſt worthie knight of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi> that the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which I heretofore haue done you, doth as yet remain freſh
in your memory, in that you make no account of her, who
liueth and dieth onely for your loue. And that I ſpeake the
truth, you may be perfectly reſolued, in that (without regard of
mine owne honour) I come to ſéeke you out, the cauſe being
this, that my intreatie might moue you pittie her, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
the loue of none aliue but you: which courteſie, if you
ſhall ſeeme to refuſe, my conceite of griefe will be ſo extreame,
as I muſt needs giue entertainment to my lateſt enemy, who
will ſet both ſoule and body in quietneſſe, when you (that
might haue comfort of both) remaine deaſe, and will make no
account of me.</p>
                     <p>So breaking off, ſhe laid her head, on the Princes breaſt, fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
ſo many grieuous ſighes and groanes, as though the life
would haue forſaken her body, whereupon the Prince tooke
her in his armes, and with very amiable ſpeeches (though not
ſuch as ſhe gladly looked for, he began to comfort her thus.</p>
                     <p>Madame <hi>Arlencea,</hi> I do not ſo little eſteeme of you, that I
would willingly conſent to doe the thing, which ſhould ſeeme
diſpleaſant or offenſiue to your honour, deſiring you to thinke,
that before I was ſo much bound to you as now I am, I inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

<pb facs="tcp:13179:319" rendition="simple:additions"/>
time that your great fauour, deliuered me out of the daunger
whereinto <hi>Alfernao</hi> brought me, I forſooke altogether the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of ſo vaine a humor, being loath to reward her ſo vngently,
whoſe courteſie, neither time nor death can make me forget.
And thus perſwade your ſelfe, that I haue prouided a huſband
for you, according as your noble bountie doth well deſerue: yea,
he is ſo good a Knight, as you will refuſe to make choyſe of the
Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> whom you may at all times vſe, as
your friend and ſeruant.</p>
                     <p>There pauſing, he kiſſed her hand, and brought her again to
the place where the other Ladies ſleyt, and he departing againe
to his owne lodging, ſhe began to be aſhamed of her folly, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
well the wittie words of the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man:</hi>
for whoſe loue ſhe was ſo extreamely paſſioned, as ſhe was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to diſcouer the flame that did ſo torment her, to one of
her Damoſelles, the very ſame that gaue the fatall ring to the
prince. To her ſhe ripped vp her whole diſcourſe of the words
which had paſſed that night, deſiring her earneſtly, with the
teares trickling down her chéekes, that ſhe would giue her ſuch
aſſiſtance, as ſhe might enioy the loue of the Knight of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
man:</hi> the Damoſell anſwered her Lady thus.</p>
                     <p>Truſt me Madame, you haue not any occaſion to finde your
ſelfe agréeued, for by good reaſon the Knight ought not to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
your will, in that ſuch a Prince as he is, ought not to trauell
himſelfe for Damoſelles, and then to receiue ſhame and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
by them: but yet to content your minde, and becauſe you
thinke me willing to doe you what pleaſure I can, I will goe
to the knight, and vſe ſuch friendly perſwaſions with him, as I
will vnderſtand the depth of his intent. <hi>Arlencea</hi> imbraced the
Damoſell for this genile anſwere, and ſpake to her againe in
this manner.</p>
                     <p>I know well, my ſwéete wench, that if I ſhall haue any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie
in this caſe, I muſt enioy it by thy meanes, wherefore I
pray thée goe, and fortune be with thée. But if it come ſo to
paſſe, as neither perſwaſion, nor any thing elſe will mooue him
to loue me, I pray thee intreate him, that he would pardon the
fault I committed, in diſturbing him of his quiet eaſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:320" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Madame (ſaid the Damoſell) repoſe yourſelfe altogether on
me, and ſo ſhe went to the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> whom
ſhe found in a ſlumber, when ſitting downe by him, ſhe began
in this manner. Me thinkes that he which enforceth Ladies
to liue in ſorrow, becauſe he wil vſe no more regard vnto them,
ought not ſo eaſily to take his reſt. The Knight of the <hi>Sauage
man</hi> hearing the voyce of a woman, opened his eyes, and ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was not <hi>Arlencea,</hi> but the Damoſell whom he loued beſt
amongſt them all, he beganne friendly to embrace her, giuing
her better words then he did to the Gianteſſe her Lady: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon,
the Damoſell beganne to him thus againe. Syr Knight,
I deſire that you would vouchſafe to tell me, what is the cauſe
you make no more account of my Ladies loue, ſéeing ſhe hath
(for your ſake) forſaken her mother, forgotten the cruell mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
her Brother, and likewiſe hath loſt the libertie of her
ſelfe?</p>
                     <p>Madame (anſwered the prince) I feare I ſhall not haue time
enough to diſcourſe the whole matter to you, becauſe it is now
vpon this point of day, wherefore I intend to ſet Madame <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencea</hi>
a part a while, and demaund of you, for what occaſion
you haue forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, ſéeing I remaine yours in affection, ſince
the day that <hi>Alfernao</hi> deliuered me into the power of your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Arlencea?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I pray you Syr (ſaid the Damoſel) that you would not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
at my niceneſſe all this while, it was but onely to auoid
the malice of my Lady: in her abſcence, I pray you thinke ſo
wel on me, as you may be pleaſed for my diſpleaſing you, and I
haue the better will to come to mooue my Ladies ſute againe.
The Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> hearing her courteous anſwer,
and that he might now breake a Launce in the face of <hi>Venus,</hi>
he tooke her in his armes: but becauſe the day came on apace,
and they vnwilling that any ſhould ſée their ſecret pleaſure, I
durſt not ſée what they did, for feare I ſhould be ſhent for my

the prince ſéeing the Ladies walking, came

                     <p>The Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> knewe well by the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

the regard of her honour commaunded her to kéepe ſecret, what
had paſſed betwéene the Prince and her: but hée making as
though he ſaw her not, continued on his pleaſure with the other
Damoſels. And when for recreations ſake, they tooke delight

                     </p>
                     <p>It chanced fiue dayes after their departure from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Court, that they came into a faire gréene field, which was gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly
decked with Natures tapiſtry, &amp; there the Ladies tooke
delight to ſtay a while, becauſe they would make them Noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayes
and garlands of the flowers: when they had diſported
themſelues ſo long as they thought méete, they put their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
on their heads, &amp; mounted on their horſes againe, being
very merry and pleaſantly diſpoſed. But to change their io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund
humor, they beheld to come from a ranke of trees, a bigge
tall Knight, in manner of a Giant, mounted on a horſe meete to
carry ſuch a mightie perſon: his Armour was all azure colour,
ſpotted very thicke with little ſiluer flowers, and in his Shield
he caried for his deuiſe, <hi>Hidra</hi> the ſerpent with ſeuen heads, in
a fielde of Sinople. This big knight had two Eſquiers atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on him, one of them carried his Lance, &amp; the other a battel-Axe,
the knife there of being of gold: and when he was come to
the place where the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> and the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
ſtayd, he began his language in this manner.</p>
                     <p>I aduertiſe thée (knight) that it is a long time ſince I deſired
to goe to the caſtle of <hi>Almarol,</hi> where my heart became affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to the faire Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> and in ſuch good lyking
did I growe of her, as I determined to try my fortune againſt
the Knight that kéepes her ſhielde, being in good hope to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
him, that I might afterward take both his office, and his
place. But it hapned to me farre contrary to my deſire, &amp; I am
<pb facs="tcp:13179:321" rendition="simple:additions"/>
perſwaded, that her fauour makes him more victorious, then
his owne force is able: the conſideration hereof doth not a little
offend me, ſo that I am determined to reuenge my ſelfe by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
means. Wherfore aduiſe thee wel of theſe two conditions
I ſhall put to thée, which of them thou ſhalt beſt like of, either
to enter combat with me, or to ſurrender theſe damoſels which
beare thée company.</p>
                     <p>My friend (anſwered the knight of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi> I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thée, that I am not the man thou thinkeſt me, neither
ſhalt thou find ſuch a one, as is wont to be vanquiſhed by thy
hauty words: and becauſe thou ſhalt not be deceiued in me,
I giue thée to vnderſtand, that I am not accuſtomed to feare
ſuch fellowes, as ſpeake with ſuch a glorious pride in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
neither can the huge ſtature of a Giant diſmay me, for
if thou durſt preſume to take the worſt Garland from any of
theſe Ladies heads, I would ſel thee my life, but I would make
thée reſtore it againe.</p>
                     <p>The affection (ſaid the knight) which thou beareſt to ſome
of theſe, maketh thee not to eſtéeme the danger wherein thou
maiſt fall: but ſéeing thou wilt be ſo luſtie, I am content, for
courteſies ſake, to offer thee this condition, that he which ſhall
be diſmounted of vs ſwaine, may haue for his paines foure of
theſe Damoſelles, as for the other foure, they ſhall ſtill at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
vppon their Lady, whom I ſee likewiſe in thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:
to which wordes the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> thus
replyed.</p>
                     <p>I could wiſh thou hadſt as many Damoſels in thy power, as
thou ſéeſt here in name, to the end that either thou mightſt win
theſe which I conduct, or I might be the maiſter of thine. But
except thou intendeſt to take theſe ladies from me by force, for
otherwiſe thou ſhalt not haue them, I pray thée get thee going
about thy buſineſſe. I ſee well, ſaid the knight, that our conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
cannot be ended without laying hands to our weapons, &amp;
ſo to try the concluſion: then he called his eſquire, who brought
him his Lance, which when he had couched, he ranne couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
againſt the Damoſels knight, who met him brauely in
the mid way, &amp; encountred with him ſo worthily, as the pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:13179:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of their lances flew whiſtling in the ayre, and in this encounter
the knight loſt both his ſtirrops, &amp; meeting together with their
bodies, their horſes began fiercely to fight one with another, ſo
that the ſtrange knight was caſt to the ground, and the damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
knight had almoſt borne him company, becauſe his horſe
was ſlaine by the other knights horſe. <hi>Arlencea</hi> and the Ladies
did greatly feare, leaſt the knight would ouercome the Prince
<hi>Florian,</hi> who leaping from his horſe, that tumbled with him on
the ground, drew his ſword, and ſtood ſtill to heare what the
knight would ſay: but he ſeeing the Damoſels knight ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to the combate, began to be ſomwhat offended with himſelf
for the rough ſtroke of the Lance, made him more to feare the
knight then he did before. When he had ſtood a pretty ſpace, he
buckled his Shield, and drew his ſword out of the ſheath,
comming to the Prince with theſe words. If thou art (Knight)
ſo much a friend to thine owne life, as to agrée to the condition
I made ſhée before we iouſted, thou ſhalt ſée that I will kéepe
my promiſe to thée. I pray thee (ſaid the Damoſels knight) vſe
no ſuch friuolous ſpéeches to me, for I am thus determined, to
make thée beare me co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany on foote, becauſe thou ſeeſt my horſe
is ſlaine: and ſo without waſting any more time in words, he
began to charge the Knight very fiercely, which when the
Knight both ſaw and felt, he likewiſe laid on with huge and
waighty ſtrokes, till in the end he receiued ſo many wounds, as
what with the loſſe of his blood, and faintneſſe of his body, he
was conſtrained to fall downe to the ground: when, the damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
knight ſet his foote on him, and taking off his helmet, made
ſhow as though he would haue ſmitten off his head, but the
Knight yéelded himſelfe to his mercy, deſiring that it might
pleaſe him to ſaue dis life: whereto the damoſels knight thus
anſwered.</p>
                     <p>I am content to giue thée thy life, on condition thou wilt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
what I command thée. I know no aduenture (ſayd the
Knight) ſo perillous, which I would make any account off, for
ſauegard of my life. Thou ſhalt firſt then (quoth the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
Knight) tell me what and who thou art, and afterward,
thou ſhalt take one of the Horſes, whereon thy Eſquires rides,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:322" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and take thy way preſently to the Court of the King <hi>Recinde,</hi>
and there (before the Quéene) thou ſhalt ſay on my behalfe, that
the Damoſels knight, who Iouſted in their preſence againſt
the prince <hi>Albayzar,</hi> ſaluteth them with his humble duty, and
deſireth ſuch fauour at the kings hands, that he will thinke no
ill becauſe I made not my ſelfe knowne to him, but thou maiſt
aſſure his Highneſſe, that I will not faile to make my ſelfe
knowne, at my returne from the Caſtle of the Giant <hi>Almarol.</hi>
And becauſe I may get thither the ſooner, I will take thy horſe,
in recompence of mine which I haue loſt in iouſting againſt
thée: the knight aroſe, and made this anſwere.</p>
                     <p>Worthy Sir, ſince Fortunes great vnkindes hath brought
me iato this extremitie, I ſhall not faile to obey whatſoeuer
you commaund me, and for my name, I am called <hi>Trofolant</hi>
the <hi>Feareful,</hi> of whom you haue heard ſometime, if you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
Very true (quoth the damoſels knight) but I pray you not
to make me knowne in any caſe, but declare what I haue ſaid
to you, and ſo you may now depart on your way to accompliſh
your promiſe.</p>
                     <p>Then the Prince mounted on <hi>Trofolants</hi> horſe, &amp; ſo tooke his
leaue of him, ſetting forward on his iourney with the damoſels,
till he came to the end of his pleaſant Valley, where he leaned
himſelfe againſt the ſtump of a trée, becauſe he eſpied before him
thrée knights very richly Armed, and one of them cryed aloude
to him, that he ſhould ſtay till they came to him. The Damoſels
knight hearing theſe words, would goe no further, but ſtaied to
heare what they had to ſay to him. When they were come née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
the ſame knight ſpake againe in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Sir knight, I would gladly haue one of the ladies which are
in your company, wherefore, I pray you beſtowe her on me, to
whom you beare moſt affection your ſelfe. Truſt me Sir (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the Damoſels knight) they doe all like me ſo well, as
he which dare be ſo bolde to take one of them from me, I iudge
will put his life in great daunger. My fancy (ſaide the ſecond
knight) doth beſt eſtéeme her that excéedeth them all in ſtature
(meaning <hi>Arlencea.)</hi> And I will content my ſelfe (quoth the
third knight) with her that rideth next the tall Lady (meaning
<pb facs="tcp:13179:323" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Polyphemia)</hi> becauſe me thinkes her beautie excéedeth all the
other: wherefore I pray you ſir knight, content your ſelfe with
the other Ladies, and ſticke not with vs for theſe three, for we
will ſo well behaue our ſelues to them, as they ſhall haue no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to complaine on vs.</p>
                     <p>I perceiue then (anſwered the Damoſels Knight) that you
would gladly haue theſe Ladies, whom I am determined to
defend againſt you: if any of you therefore haue ſuch minde to
them, there is but a little Riuer betweene vs, which you may
eaſily paſſe, and if your Fortune be ſo good, you ſhall carry them
with you when you go backe againe. With a good will (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the firſt knight) and ſéeing your ſtomacke ſerues you ſo wel,
I will ſhewe you the ſmall aduantage you ſhall get in dealing

his Launce in his reſt, ran valiantly againſt the Damoſelles
knight, who entertained him with ſuch a puiſſant ſtroake, as
he was compeld to fetch an errant in the duſt, being ſo greatly
amazed with the fall, as he had not the power to ſtir himſelfe a

foyled, they came ouer the riuer together, and being abaſhed at
the valour of the Damoſels knight, they durſt not venter to try
it one after another, but ranne both together againſt him, who
(though they offered him wrong) would not refuſe them: but
breaking his ſtaffe nobly vpon one of them, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the firſt knight company, hauing his arme broken by the force
of his fall. Then drew he foorth his ſwoord, and welcommed
the third ſo friendly, as in a little while he tumbles downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     <p>The Damoſels Knight after this victorie, commaunded his

take aire, and when they were all before him, he commaunded
them to ſhew obeyſance to the three Damoſelles, whome they
would néeds haue had, before they knew the price of them and
if they did not as he willed them, he ſware they ſhould all looſe
their liues.</p>

Hoſte, promiſed they would not doe any thing contrary to his

                     <p>I haue ſo little neede (ſaide <hi>Arlencea)</hi> of your ſeruice, as it
would gréeue me to vſe your aſſiſtance in any thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer:
neuertheleſſe, that you may be an example to ſuch, who
(following your qualities) commit many outragious facts to
Damoſels, and to encreaſe his renowne who hath now nobly
vanquiſhed you, and deliuered me and my company from you,
I command you to go to the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Court, and there
on my behalfe, let all the Ladies vnderſtand, what deſert is
come to you for your wretched dealing: and ſay, that I aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
them, no one of them preſume to trauaile abroad, without
the company of ſome ſuch knight, as is able to defend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
all vnlawfull actions.</p>
                     <p>And you Madame (ſaid the ſecond knight to <hi>Polyphemia)</hi>
what ſhall it like you for to command me? Marie (quoth ſhe)
that you take the ſame courſe that your commpanion doth, not
forgetting to tell the Ladies, that I pray they may liue in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
without hauing affiance in any Knight whatſoeuer: for
that ſuch as enterpriſe to conduct them in their trauails, whom
they put in truſt with their honourable loue, and euen bow
their ſoules to them in loyall affection, yet haue they moſt
néede to ſhunne their company, rather then any other, and let
them not doubt of it, for if they proue they ſhall find my words
true.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſels knight vnderſtood well enough, the couert
ſpeeches of <hi>Polyphemia,</hi> but yet he diſſembled, as though he
knew not what they meant.</p>
                     <p>And you Lady, ſaid the third knight, will you be ſo cruell, as
to commit a greater taſke to me, then theſe two Ladies before
you haue done to my companion? I am (quoth ſhe) ſo cruell, as
I would haue thée baniſhed the company of thy very deareſt
friends: then the Damoſelles Knight himſelfe began thus to

Since it is the will of theſe thrée Ladies, that you ſhall carry
theſe meſſages of the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Court. I pray you tell
the Ladies there, that I deſire them to repoſe their truſt in me,
if they ſhall imagine themſelues in any danger, and let them be
well aſſured, that I will aduenture what hazard ſoeuer, if my
helpe may yéeld them any aſſiſtance: notwithſtanding, one of
theſe thrée Ladies is deſirous to haue them thinke the contrary
but as for her counſell, I deſire them humbly to make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

you tell me your names before you depart, for that I may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
another day, whether you haue fulfilled your promiſes or
no. My Lord (quoth the firſt Knight) we are all thrée of the

grieue more to go ſhew our miſfortunes there, then in any
court whatſoeuer it might like you to ſend vs. And for our
names, you ſhall vnderſtand, that I am called <hi>Grouanell,</hi> and
this other knight is my brother named <hi>Braboſan,</hi> we twaine
being the ſonnes of the Countie <hi>Loban,</hi> and the third knight
(who is our Couzin) he is called <hi>Claribard,</hi> a knight greatly
renowmed in the Court of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truely Gentlemen (ſaid the Damoſels knight) you ought
not to thruſt your ſelues into ſuch diſhonourable actions: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe,

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was long before the Damoſeis Knight

becauſe he was hindered in his

themſelues to take the Damoſels from
him, which he had taken charge of, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting
them. But it chanced as the King
<hi>Recinde</hi> ſtood pleaſantly talking in his window with the

he beheld to enter a goodly tall Knight, his face being couered
with his Helmet, his armour broken in many places, and ſo
beſprent with blood, as the fine deuiſes thereon could hardly

was ſhiuered in the ſelfe ſame manner, and becauſe his

                     <p>Madame, I haue Combatted with a Knight, who not long

he hath in his company nine Damoſels, and I deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

would he take mine from me, beare his Ladyes company

but in great danger to looſe my life, had not this vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and redoubted knight granted me mercy, vpon condition I
ſhould performe what he did command me. But ſuch was
his great humanitie, as he would adioyne me no other pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
then this, that I ſhould come and preſent my ſelfe
to your maieſtie, to craue pardon (on his behalfe) that he would
not let himſelfe to be knowne when he was in your court, but
at his returne, he will not faile to come in better acquaintance
with your highneſſe: in the meane while, he craueth that you
would pardon him for his offence paſt.</p>
                     <p>I know not (ſaid the king) how I ſhould remit this iniury,
in that he hid himſelf from me, who moſt of all deſired to know
him, and more earneſt I am now, ſéeing your Armour ſo
much defaced. My good Lord (anſwered the Quéene) I deſire
you would not be offended at that which is paſt, for I cannot
thinke that ſuch a Knight as he is, would deſire to paſſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
to your grace, without he were compelled ſo to do by
ſome earneſt occaſion.</p>
                     <p>Then ſaid the King to the knight, I pray you Sir tell me
who you are? Thoſe that know me (ſaid the Knight) call me
<hi>Trofalont</hi> the <hi>Fearefull.</hi> I haue (anſwered the King) often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
heard much talke of you, and the Knightly déedes which
you haue atchieued: and for this cauſe would I the more glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
haue knowledge of the Damoſelles Knight, wherefore I

ſhould be?</p>
                     <p>My Lord ſaid <hi>Trofolant,</hi> I promiſe you I neuer ſaw him in

                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:325" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Quoth the Quéene, I giue you licence to depart at your own
leiſure. And I would no other thing with you, ſaide the King,
but that you would take a better Armour at my handes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
your own is not in caſe to doe you ſeruice: beſide, I would
not that any of the Knights which ſerue the Emperour ſhould
depart my court deſtitute of horſe or Armour.</p>
                     <p>My Lord, anſwered <hi>Trofolant,</hi> I thinke my ſelfe highly
bound to your maieſtie, for the Princely offer you haue made
me: but I am determined to goe euen as you ſée me, becauſe I
will deride Fortune to her face, and ſo he departed. The King
gaue the Queene to vnderſtand, that <hi>Trofolant</hi> was reputed
as good a Knight as any other: but he would not beléeue, that
any of the Sonnes of the Prince <hi>Don Edward</hi> would come
into his Court, and depart againe without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                     <p>While the King was commending the valour of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſelles

that which the Damoſelles Knight and <hi>Poliphemia</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

                     <p>The Ladies knew well that <hi>Poliphemia</hi> had receiued ſome
iniury by the knight, whoſe noblenes made the king to ſpeake
thus. Gentlemen, I promiſe you I greatly deſire to know
the knight who hath thus vanquiſhed you, and I intend to ſend
ſome of my knights after him, that they may bring him hither
once more.</p>
                     <p>If it ſhall like your highneſſe (anſwered one of the Knights)
he, whoſe good fortune ſerued him to ouercome vs, your grace
muſt well thinke, that it will be hard to bring him hither, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

                     <p>Truſt me (ſaid the King) it makes me maruell very much,
that he is accompanied with ſo many Damoſels, in that one
Knight cannot long endure to be patient, being in the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of but one woman.</p>
                     <p>With theſe wordes the King departed from them, and the
<pb facs="tcp:13179:326" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knightes withdrew themſelues into their chambers, being not
offended that the Damoſels knight had vanquiſhed them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

now arriued at the place (faire Ladies) where it is conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to diſplay the force of your beautie, in fauouring him that
will enterpriſe the Combatte on your behalfe, for I aſſure
you, the picture of the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda</hi> is here at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
which is of ſuch excellency, as the knight who hath the
kéeping thereof, cannot (as yet) be vanquiſhed, the cauſe is
(as I iudge) rather by the ſingularitie of this faire Princeſſe,
then the force or valour that is in the knight, againſt whom
I intend to try my ſelfe. Wherefore I pray you (faire Ladies)
to ſeperate your ſelues aſunder, and bethinke your ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whoſe name I ſhall enter the Combate, and be you all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
by, for I know I ſhall purchaſe ſome aduantage by your
company.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Poliphemia</hi> (who had the greateſt opinion of beauty in her
ſelfe amongſt them all) ſpake to the Prince in this order. I
know very wel (Sir knight) that the victory which they gaine,
that enter the Combate for the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
of their force and loyall friendſhip, which truely is very far
off from you: wherfore, if Fortune chance to forſake you in the
Combate, ſhe doth no more then you deſerue, ſéeing the great
inconſtancy of you towards them, on whoſe behalfe you ſéeme
to enter the Combate.</p>
                     <p>The other Damoſelles were ſomewhat abaſhed, hearing
<hi>Poliphemia</hi> ſpake ſo plainely, wherevpon the Prince <hi>Florian</hi>
returned her this anſwere. I perceiue Lady, that you are very
iniurious towards me, without any great occaſion, and you
offer truly great diſcourteſie, to conceiue ſo bad an opinion of
me: wherefore, to put you out of ſuch an ill ſuſpition, I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb facs="tcp:13179:326" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to enter the Combate, vnder the fauor of your beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
when you ſhall well perceiue, that you were in a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
iudgement.</p>
                     <p>So riding on, they came at laſt to the Caſtle, at what time
<hi>Miragarda</hi> and her Ladies came forth, to recreate her ſelfe
vpon the water, being accompanied with the Giant <hi>Almoral.</hi>
The Damoſels knight no ſooner beheld the beautie of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

while they were before him.</p>
                     <p>After that <hi>Miragarda</hi> was gone a pretty diſtance off, he ſaid
to the Damoſels: What ſay you to the beautie of this gallant
Princeſſe? We ſay (anſwered <hi>Poliphemia)</hi> that you ſhould
not diſmay your ſelfe any iote: in that each of vs conceiueth this
opinion of our ſelues, that we may equall her in beautie. <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garda</hi>
was no ſooner returned againe, but ſhee ſate downe a

                     <p>
                        <hi>Florendos</hi> (who was not farre off) being Armed for all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes,

him Combat with ſtrange Knights, called to him with theſe
words. Sir <hi>Florendos,</hi> doe that which your dutie comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

the Knight prepare himſelfe to the iouſt, he preſently moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                     <p>I promiſe you Sir <hi>Florendos</hi> (anſwered the Damoſelles

                     <p>I cannot tell (ſaid <hi>Florendos)</hi> what anſwer I ſhould make

fall out, that the iouſt be more hindrance to the one then to the

                     <p>Sir <hi>Florendos,</hi> I would be loth to Combat againſt you, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

breake two Lances with Sir <hi>Almaroll</hi> himſelfe, and force not
greatly to enter the Combate with him afterward. I know
very well (ſaid <hi>Florendos)</hi> that the aſſurance you haue in your

that may happen to you, you witnes ſo well your knightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour,
wherefore I pray you do not forſake me in this order,
before you tell me of whence and what you are. To tell you my
name, ſaide the Damoſels Knight, and afterward to Iouſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you, is much againſt my will, ſo that I cannot reſolue
my ſelfe, vpon which of theſe two points I ſhould reſt: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe,
becauſe I would gladly content you, I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:328" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Then theſe two Princes ranne together with ſuch force, as
they burſt their ſtaues to their hands, wherevpon, their horſes
hurt each other ſo cruelly, as both they and their Maiſters fell
to the ground: the Damoſels Knight hauing the ſhoulder of
his horſe broken, but <hi>Florendos</hi> his horſe was ſlaine outright,
which did ſo greatly vexe him, as he drew foorth his ſword, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very willing to enter the Combate, which the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
Knight perceiuing, hée ſtayed him with this friendly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                     <p>Sir Knight, I would gladly intreate you to forbeare ſo
much reſiſtance againſt your friend, who deſireth (in any
thing he may to doe you ſeruice, I beare ſo much good will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, and loath I am to enter the Combate with you, not
for any feare I haue of your valor, but becauſe the duty of frien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
forbiddeth mée ſuch vngentleneſſe. And this perſwade
your ſelfe, that I am of no leſſe courage then your ſelfe, and
could make as good aſſurance of the victorie, but that it would
grieue me to ſée you iniured: wherefore, that no diſcourteſie
may happen on either ſide, I pray you ſheath your Swoord
againe, and reſerue the triall therewith, till ſuch a one
come, as ſhall ſéeke you with a more mallicious intent, then
I doe.</p>
                     <p>The Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> who had heard the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
that paſſed the Damoſels Knight, could haue béene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
(for the boldneſſe ſhe ſaw in him) to ſée the Combate tried
betwéene them: then <hi>Florendos</hi> ſpake to him againe in this
manner. I can very hardly content my ſelfe (ſir knight) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
I might ſée the one of vs diſmounted, or elſe that you would
tell me who yoe are: to which words <hi>Arteſia</hi> (one of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels)
made this anſwere.</p>
                     <p>I will tell ye Sir Knight, this order was he woont to vſe
with ſuch knights, as he knewe to be leſſe gouerned by diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then himſelfe, with them would he neuer ende the fight,
making his excuſe by vs, as your ſelfe may behold at this time:
for ſéeing the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda</hi> doth not fauour him, he is
content to knit vp thus, without paſſing any further triall,
thinking vs vnworthy of his good will.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:328" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Truly my friend (anſwered <hi>Poliphemia)</hi> you haue ſaide that
which is moſt certaine, and I belieue our knight is of the ſame
opinion himſelfe: <hi>Florian</hi> ſmiling, made him this anſwere. I
ſee very well now (faire Ladies) that the paines I haue taken
in conducting you, is made of no account at all: neuertheleſſe, I
haue this aduantage, that your entiſing words want power to
deceiue me, for I am, and will be maiſter of my ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe wordes albeit he ſpake them ſomewhat ſoftly, yet the
Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda</hi> did well vnderſtande them, by reaſon
whereof, ſhe tooke him preſently to be one of ſlender fidelitie:
but ſhe iudged <hi>Florendos</hi> to be one at libertie, and that loue had
no power ouer him. But he himſelfe deſired not to liue in ſuch
libertie, if he could haue compaſſed any remedy for ſo great a
torment, as the beautie of his faire Miſtreſſe enforced him to
endure.</p>
                     <p>And now to returne to <hi>Florendos</hi> he could not be ſo wel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
by the Damoſels Knight, but that he deſired to enter
the Combate with him, which the giant <hi>Almaroll</hi> perceiuing,
he cauſed to be brought foorth a goodly bay Courſer, and ſent it
to the Damoſels knight, with this requeſt. That he would put
himſelfe in a readineſſe, to the ende they two might trie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
together, which would giue ſome delight to the princeſſe
<hi>Miragarda:</hi> and becauſe ſhe ſhould haue the better will to the
Combate, he was content ſome reward ſhould be ordained, in
requitall of his paines that remained the conquerour: vppon
which motion the Damoſels knight made this reply.</p>
                     <p>Looke (Sir <hi>Almaroll)</hi> what it ſhall pleaſe you to appoint, you
ſhall not finde me contrary thereto. If ſo be then (quoth <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll)</hi>
that the victory happen on your ſide, I pray you to giue me
(as my reward) this Lady named <hi>Arlence<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> whom I will not
faile to eſtéeme as chiefe miſtreſſe of my affection: and if it come
to paſſe that Fortune make her choyſe of you, you ſhall receiue
for your recompence, the horſe wheron you are mounted, which
I warrant will be as good as any in the world.</p>
                     <p>Truſt me (ſaid the Damoſels Knight) I haue already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
with my ſelfe, to beſtow her vpon ſuch a Knight as I
make good account of: yet will I accept this horſe, if ſo be the
<pb facs="tcp:13179:329" rendition="simple:additions"/>
victorie fall on my ſide: and if it come to paſſe that I am van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed,
if the Lady her ſelfe can finde in her heart to ſatiſfie
your requeſt, you ſhall not finde me to hinder it any thing. I
am content (anſwered <hi>Almaroll)</hi> hearing you ſpeake ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably,
for I preſume, that ſhe will not refuſe the knight who
is ſo willing to doe her ſeruice.</p>
                     <p>So (without any more words) they placed their Lances in
their reſtes, and being couered with their Shieldes, gaue their
horſes the Spurs, and encountred together ſo brauely, as the
Damoſels Knight forſooke both his Stirrops, but <hi>Almaroll</hi>
was caſt to the ground with his Sable betwéene his legs, who
was not a little offended to haue ſuch a diſgrace, eſpecially in
the preſence of his new choſen friend.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſelles commended greatly this gallant begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but chiefely they whom <hi>Florian</hi> woon from the Knightes
that kept the Valley. <hi>Almaroll</hi> hauing recouered his feete, drew
foorth his ſword, and came marching towards the Damoſels
Knight, who preſently alighted, left the Giant ſhould offer any
harme to his horſe: and then they charged one another with
ſuch cruell ſtrokes, as moued great admiration to all there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
And the more couragious was the prince <hi>Florian,</hi> as well
to delight the Damoſels, as to declare his nobleneſſe in fight
to the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> not forgetting withall, that <hi>Miragar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
ſhould well perceiue, he ſtood in no feare of her knight, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
the Combate.</p>
                     <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Almarol</hi> behaued himſelfe very gallantly,
for the deſire he had to gaine <hi>Arlencea,</hi> and ſuch was the regard
of her loue with him, as in all his life he neuer fought more
brauely.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two champions continued ſuch notable courage, as in
ſhort time their armour was broken in many places, and their
bodies ſo grieuouſly wounded, that the blood ranne from them
very pitifully: but <hi>Almaroll</hi> (being not ſo nimble and quicke
as his aduerſarie) was brought into the greateſt danger, by
meanes whereof, he was glad to breake ſquare a little, to take
breathing.</p>
                     <p>But the damoſels knight would not to ſuffer him, for he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb facs="tcp:13179:329" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his intent ſo faſt vpon him, as he was conſtrained to fall
to the earth, ſéeming rather to be dead then aliue: the ſight
whereof did gréeue the Prince <hi>Florendos</hi> out of meaſure, and
was ſo much offenſiue to the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from the window, commanding that <hi>Almaroll</hi> ſhould
be brought into the Caſtle, which was preſently done, and <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendos</hi>
went with him into his Chamber, to ſée ſome prouiſion
might be made for his wounds, which in ſooth were very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                     <p>Then was the Damoſels knight brought ſomewhat aſide,
where the damoſels vnarmed him to dreſſe his wounds, which
were not in any great danger, whereupon he cauſed himſelfe to
be armed againe, and mounted on horſebacke, intending to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
thence. But as he was about to ſet forward on the way,
two Knights of ſome ſtrange countrey) arriued at the Caſtle,
who came deſirous to try the aduenture. One of theſe knights
was in Carnation colloured Armour, very thicke beſet with
<hi>Griffins</hi> of ſiluer, and in his ſheeld was figured a white Hart,
in a field of Sinople: the other knight was in blacke armour,
and bearing in his ſhield the ſame deuiſe his fellow had.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two Knights no ſooner beheld the Damoſels knight,
but he in the carnation Armour ſpake thus to his Companion.
It ſeemeth to me Sir, that we are come vnto the place, where
we ſhall haue no accaſion to vſe our armor, if he which kéepeth
the ſhield of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> be not in caſe to endure the Combate:
this knight ſhould ſéeme to be he, wherfore, becauſe it ſhall not
be ſayd, we came hither in vaine, I will goe diſburden him of
one of his Ladyes, ſhe will be as méete for my company, as for
his.</p>
                     <p>Certainely (anſwered the other knight) I cannot content
my ſelfe with things of ſo baſe eſtimation, hauing before mine
eyes the Shield, wherein is pictured the beautie of the faire
Princeſſe, the regard whereof, maketh me account nothing
more worthy. At theſe words, his companion caſt his eyes
on the Image of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> which hung in the ſeemelieſt
place of the Pillar, whereuppon he entred into theſe ſpée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:330" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I ſée now (my good friend) that they which haue aduentured
to this place, haue not beſtowed their labour in vaine: for more
willingly would I looſe my life for her, whoſe heauenly viſage
this Shield repreſents, then to content my ſelfe with hope of
any further glory. I aſſure you (ſayd the firſt knight) I intend
not to depart from this place, without I carry this Shield with
me: yet would I (if it were poſſible) firſt make tryall of my
worthineſſe, againſt him that durſt deny me to take it hence.
So, aduancing himſelf to the trée where the Shields were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
he offered to take downe the Shield.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſels knight perceiuing his intent, and knowing
that <hi>Florendos</hi> was buſie about the hurts of the Giant <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll,</hi>
he would not ſuffer that in his preſence any one ſhould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
ſo great wrong to the Prince <hi>Florendos:</hi> wherefore in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the good will he bare him, he broched his horſe with the
ſpurs, and when he came to the place where the Shield of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragarda</hi>
hanged, he looke the knight <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ell beſide his Horſe
headlong to the ground, and withall ſpake to him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
I may well perſwade my ſelfe (ſir knight) that you deſire
not to trie your fortune in this aduenture, being ſo forgetfull
of your honour, as to procéede ſo cowardly, not attending the
preſence of him, who hath the authoritie to defend this Shield:

he came betwéene them with theſe words.</p>
                     <p>I pray you Sir to amount vpon your horſe, and in the mean
time, I will trie if the valour of this knight, may anſwer the
proude attempt he made to you. Vpon this, he adua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:13179:330" rendition="simple:additions"/>
himſelfe againſt the Damoſelles Knight, who for the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
he had, to witneſſe his courage to the princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi>
prepared himſelfe brauely to méete his aduerſarie, which hée
diſcharged ſo nobly (hauing his full deſire at him) as neither
his ſhielde, armour, nor maile-coat could defend the puſh of the
Lance, but it paſſed cleane thorow his body, ſo that the ſtrange
knight tumbled beſide his horſe to the ground, being altogether
depriued of his life.</p>
                     <p>When the Damoſels Knight had gotten his Launce out of
the Knights body, he praunced till he came vnder the window
where the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda</hi> ſtood, expecting the comming
of the other Knight, who méeting him in the middeſt of the
courſe, brake his Launce on the Prince: but when they came
together, the Damoſelles Knight caught hold on his enemies
Shielde, which hée pulde from him with ſo great force, as he
brought his head on the necke of his horſe, where (not permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
him the leiſure to recouer himſelfe) he gaue him with his
owne Shield ſuch a cruell ſtroke on the Creſt of his Helmet,
as the knight was ſo giddy therewith, he could hardly tell how
to recouer himſelfe. In the meane while the knight was thus
amazed, the prince tooke off his helmet, and gaue him ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
heauie ſtroke, as hee fell beſide his Horſe, foming forth
blood out of his mouth aboundantly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Florendos</hi> (being in the Chamber with the Giant <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll)</hi>
was greatly abaſhed, ſéeing a combate fought at his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies

and went preſently thither, where (hauing well viewed
the two Knights) he receiued no ſmall admiration at this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture,
which when the Damoſels knight perceiued, he ſpake
to him in this order.</p>
                     <p>Sir <hi>Florendos,</hi> ſée here the deedes wherein I haue imployed
my ſelfe, onely becauſe I would doe you ſeruice, I am as yet

You ſhall Sir <hi>Florendos</hi> (ſaide the Damoſelles knight) be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
<pb facs="tcp:13179:331" rendition="simple:additions"/>

that a thing of ſo high eſtimation, might not be woonne
without ſome labour.</p>
                     <p>Thus in regard of the offence they were about to offer you,
and to witneſſe the good will I vnfeinedly beare you, I tooke

                     <p>I pray you Sir (quoth <hi>Florendos)</hi> tell me who you are for I

wherefore I aduertiſe you, that I am <hi>Florian</hi> of the <hi>Forreſt,</hi>
your Couzin and obedient ſeruice, who will not ſuffer you to

                     <p>Now is my minde (which hath béene troubled a good while)

                     <p>I doe not thinke (anſwered the Damoſels Knight) that you
would wiſh me to tarrie here, in that I haue promiſed to viſit
other places, which if I ſhould faile to doe, I ſhould gaine the
ill reports of a number: wherefore I deſire you ſuffer me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part

which I conquered, that he ſhall make you faithfull promiſe
(after you haue knowledge of his name) to trauell to the court
of the King <hi>Recinde,</hi> where he ſhall declare to the Quéene for
what occaſion I did combate with his fellow and himſelfe, and

he would by no meanes be mooued from his determination:
wherefore, after a friendly embracing, he ſet forward on his

Azure colour, very richly wrought all ouer with little fillets

field, and at his feete he held a Damoſell by the haire of the
head, whoſe beautie deſerued not ſuch deſpightfull vſage, as the

that he was ready to fall in a ſowne, beholding what hard ſhift
the Damoſell made to helpe her ſelfe: and after he had laughed
a good while, he ſpake theſe words. It doth me good to ſée
that fortune enforceth you to take ſuch great pains, for by this

not faile but come to thée, when thou ſhalt well vnderſtand,
that thou méeteſt with ſuch a knight, as will ſoone allay thy
brauery. I pray you my companion (ſayd the other knight that
lay by) doe not offend your ſelfe with fretting, or raging, for I
iudge it beſt that we go to this Knight, who hath ſo many Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels
in his company, where we may take our choyce, and
that without trouble.</p>
                     <p>I deſire you my friends (anſwered the Damoſels Knight)
that you would tell me where the ford for paſſage is, to the end
I may make triall of your valours. If you haue ſo great deſire
to come to vs (ſaid the firſt knight) you muſt ſwim ouer, for I
<pb facs="tcp:13179:332" rendition="simple:additions"/>
know no other way for you. Then began he againe to pull and
hale the Damoſell very cruelly, becauſe he would mooue the
Damoſels knight to more anger: who being earneſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenging
great ſhame and villany, and making no account of
the danger in paſſage, he alighted from his horſe and lept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the riuer, which he paſſed very well, and recouering the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſide, the knight that lay among the gréene leaues ſaid to his
companion. Doe not trouble your ſelfe from your determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for I will quickly quaile the luſtineſſe of this Knight:
whereto the Prince thus anſwered. It is hard for me to ſay
how things may come to paſſe, but I intend to hinder the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you make ſuch account of.</p>
                     <p>So, without any more words, he ſetled himſelfe cloſe to the
knight, and gaue him ſuch friendly entertainment, as he tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to the ground, with his left arme broken in ſhiuers. The
other knight ſéeing the miſfortune of his fellow, left the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell
to defend himſelfe from the waightie ſtrokes of the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels
Knight: who handled him in ſuch ſort, as he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to craue aid at her hands, whom he ſought to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed,
with theſe word. I beſéech you faire Damoſell, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the iniury I haue done you, and intreate this knight to
ſaue my life. The Damoſels knight held his hand and would
not ſtrike, becauſe he expected what the Damoſell would ſay:
then ſhe (beholding the amiable countenance of him that would
haue forced her) was ſuppriſed with exceeding gréefe, ſo that ſhe
pittied more to ſée him ſo neare his death, then ſhe required re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
for his diſhoneſt enterpriſe: whereupon ſhe ſpake to the
Damoſels knight in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Let me intreate you (my Lord) to ſaue the life of this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
man, it may be, hereafter he will be warned from falling
in the like offence. I promiſe you faire Damoſell (ſayd <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian)</hi>
you cannot command me the thing that I would not
willingly conſent vnto, but becauſe the knight hath deſerued
greater puniſhment, then as yet he hath ſuffered, I giue
him his life vpon this condition: that he ſhall take his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with him in the beſt manner he can deuiſe, and they both
ſhall trauaile to the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Court, where they ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:13179:333" rendition="simple:additions"/>
declare to the Ladies, what ſhame they would haue offered
you, and they ſhall promiſe neuer to weare armour againe,
without it be their pleaſures to ſuffer them.</p>
                     <p>The Knights promiſed in all reſpects to accompliſh his
will: whereupon, their Eſquires prouided a knighly Béere,
whereon the Knight was layd, that had his arme broken, and
ſo he was carryed with his companion to the court of the king
<hi>Recinde.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Damoſels knight walked along by the Riuers ſide,
holding the Damoſell by the hand, who by reaſon of her exrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ſeare, had forgotten her Eſquire, whom the knights that
would haue rauiſhed her, had bound faſt to a trée, and they had
put a gagge of wood in his mouth, becauſe they would not bee
preuented of their purpoſe by his crying.</p>
                     <p>But it was not long before the Damoſell embraced him,
when ſhe deſired the Prince that he would returne againe,
to deliuer the Eſquire out of this miſerable vexation: and when
they came to him, there they found their two Palfrayes, vpon
on of them, the Prince cauſed the Eſquire to mount, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding
him to ride along the Riuers ſide, till he could
finde ſome place to get ouer on the other ſide, to bring him his
horſe.</p>
                     <p>In the meane while, the Eſquire went about that he was
comanded, the Prince vnarmed himſelfe, to drie his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which were full of water, and then he queſtioned with
the Damoſell, how ſhe happened into that place, and vppon
what occaſion the Knights ſo ſought to diſtdneſt her: to which
words ſhe made this anſwer,</p>
                     <p>You ſhall vnderſtand (ſir Knight) that I was borne in
this Countrey, and do belong to the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> I
know not whether you haue heard of her before or no. Yes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede

much renowmed through the whole world, as many Knights
(by meanes of her beautie) haue wrought themſelues much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour.</p>
                     <p>So it is then (ſaid the Damoſell) that I tooke occaſion to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
<pb facs="tcp:13179:333" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a little the Countrey, but Fortune was ſo vnhappie to
me, as I chaunced to méete with theſe two Knights, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
of me, into what place my iourney lay: I then miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubting
no harme, becauſe their behauiour ſeemed very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
to me, declared vnto them the whole ſtate of my iourney,
whereupon, one of theſe Knights ſpake thus vnto his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                     <p>I thinke it good, in reuenge of the ſhame we haue receiued

Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda:</hi> in reſpect that her beautie will render vs
ſufficient pleaſure, to forget the foyle we tooke at the puſh of the
Launce.</p>
                     <p>The other Knight being equall with his fellow in this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious
intent, did preſently allow of the others iudgement:
So they caſt lots which of them ſhould abuſe me firſt, and it
fortuned to fall on him, whom you ſaw pulling me ſo cruelly
by the haire of the head. Then becauſe my Eſquire (grieuing
to ſée me ſo ill intreated) cryed aldude that ſome might come
ſuccour me, they dealt with him ſo diſcourteouſly as you haue
ſéene: and had it not béene for your gratious aſſiſtaunce,
God knowes the ſorrow that I poore ſoule ſhould haue endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>Truely Madame, (anſwered the Prince) I reioyce that it

                     <p>The Damoſell noting his words, regarding his ſwéet coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
remembring his noble behauiour and Princely

willeth me to let them alone, and hearken to the Damoſelles
Eſquire, who being returned, cried to the prince, that he ſhould
preſently mount on his horſe, to giue aſſiſtance to the other Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels,
who a Knight in blacke Armour ſought to leade away
perforce.</p>
                     <p>The Prince hearing the words of the Eſquire, was incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with ſuch a ſudden fury, as not tarrying till he was all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
he ranne to the riuer, and did ſwimme ouer in very great
haſt, willing the Damoſell to come after him, and paſſe ouer
the Foord, which the Eſquire could ſhew her, and bring her like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
into the company of the other Damoſels. So ſoone as <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
had paſſed the riuer, he perceiued <hi>Poliphemia</hi> come riding
towards him, crying and tearing her haire very pittifully, that
he ſhould make haſt to ſuccour her miſtreſſe: which he being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deſirous to doe, was glad to follow after her on foote, becauſe
the knight that carried her away, had grieuouſly wounded the
legges of his horſe.</p>
                     <p>But Fortune ſo much fauoured <hi>Arlencea,</hi> as ſhe ſpied the
Damoſels Knight comming, who ouer-tooke them before they
had gotten halfe a miles diſtance from the riuer: and then hée
perceiued how the knight had ſet vp <hi>Arlencea</hi> behinde him, and
his Eſquire could very hardly cauſe her to ſit ſtill on the horſe,
ſhe ſtroue ſo often to get the ground, wherfore he rid by, to hold
her on the horſe.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſels knight, ſéeing the knight in blacke Armour
had clapt his Helmet on his head, and would haue diſmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to defend himſelfe, he aduanced himſelfe towards him, and
<hi>Arlencea</hi> held him faſt on his horſe, till the Damoſelles knight
had ſtroken him ſuch a blow betwéene the necke and the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as he fell to the ground like a dead man: and taking off
his helmet, he would haue parted his head from his ſhoulders,
but yet he pacified his furie, becauſe he would ſend him likewiſe
to the Ladies in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court.</p>
                     <p>Then he cauſed the Eſquire to be vnarmed, who held <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencea</hi>
on the horſe behinde his Maiſter, but he wept very bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly,
deſiring the Prince to haue compaſſion on him: and
comming againe to the knight (who was all this while on his
<pb facs="tcp:13179:334" rendition="simple:additions"/>
knées) he commanded him to declare what was his name. I
am called <hi>Rocamor</hi> (ſayd the knight) a friend to thoſe two
Knights which you did lately vanquiſh, and in reuengement of
their iniurie, I intended to carry away this Lady.</p>
                     <p>Well then (quoth the Damoſels knight) this is my will,
that you faile not to accompliſh the charge I ſhall commit to
you, for if you do, I ſweare you ſhall preſently looſe your life:
the Knight anſwered thus. Good Sir, to the end I may eſcape
ſo great danger, I vow my ſelfe obedient to whatſouer you
command me.</p>
                     <p>I will then (ſayd the Damoſels knight) that you preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take your way to the king of <hi>Spaines</hi> Court, and there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
your ſelfe to the Ladies attendant on the Quéene, repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to them what hath paſſed betweene you and me, beſide
you ſhall neuer while you liue beare armes againe, without
it ſhall pleaſe them to licence you. The like charge I haue giuen
thy two companions, and they haue promiſed me they will
fulfill it.</p>
                     <p>I beſéech you Sir (anſwered the knight) to tell me who
you are, to the end I may declare his name, that command me
thus to ſubmit my ſelfe in the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Court. You
ſhall ſay (quoth the Prince) that the Damoſels knight enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
you this pennance, and I will ſo bold as to borrow your
Horſe, becauſe you haue dealt ſo diſcourteouſly with mine. So
cauſing <hi>Arlencea</hi> to mount on horſebacke, he left the knight,
and returned to the place where the other Damoſell ſtayd his

                     <p>And when he was come to the reſt of his company, he ſaw

                     <p>The night drew on a pace, and there thiy concluded to paſſe

afterward they layde them downe to their reſt: but <hi>Siluiana</hi>
could no ſuffer any ſléepe to enter her eyes, ſuch was her good

that it might ſtand with her pleaſure to command her Ladies,
to entertaine them into their fauorable iudgements: and they
would ſo witneſſe their good affections towardes them, that
ſo long as they liued, they would be ready to ſpend their liues
for them.</p>
                     <p>The Quéene had not the leiſure to make them any anſwere,
becauſe the Knight that would haue carried away <hi>Arlencea,</hi>
came and humbled himſelfe on his knées before the Ladies,
declaring to them how the Damoſelles knight had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him, to come and render himſelfe to their mercy, without
which, he would not permit that he ſhould weare armour any
<pb facs="tcp:13179:337" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more, the conceit thereof was ſo grieuous to him, as he tooke
the hardineſſe to intreate the Quéene to aſſiſt him in his ſute:
whereto ſhe returned this anſwere.</p>
                     <p>It ſéemeth to me, that the Ladies of my Court remaine
greatly indebted to the Damoſels Knight, for whoſe ſake I wil
not ſeeme to hinder you, but commit you all thrée to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions,
to whom you are ſent. The knight which had laſt of
all deliuered his meſſage, no ſooner beheld the other two, but he
preſently knewe them: the one was called <hi>Ferrobreque,</hi> and
the other <hi>Gentafort,</hi> they being both diſcended of a giants race,
the ſight of them cauſed him not to take his miſfortune ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily,
as he did all the while before.</p>
                     <p>The Ladies vnderſtanding the pleaſure of the Quéene, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to giue them leaue to weare their Armor, warning them
on perill of their liues, not to vſe them in any places, where
Ladies or Damoſels ſhould be iniured, but to paſſe on and let
them alone, whether the cauſe were iuſt or vniuſt, they ſhould
not intermeddle withall.</p>
                     <p>This charge ſeemed very vnfriendly to the knights, but they
durſt not ſéeme to diſlike thereof: wherevpon they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to allow of their ſentence, afterward they tooke leaue
and departed from the Court.</p>
                     <p>A good ſpace it was, before any more tydings came to the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Court of the Damoſelles Knight, but at length thrée
Knights armed very brauely, arriued at the Pallace, about
the Euening tide, the King, the Queene, and the Ladies, being
walking in a faire Gallerie, the proſpect whereof was out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Court, where they might beholde theſe three Knights,
who ſent an Eſquire, to declare their willes to the King
<hi>Recinde.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The arriuall of the Eſquire, cauſed many to aſſemble into
the Gallery, where the Eſquire being come before the King,
he humbled himſelfe on his knees with theſe words. Renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Prince, theſe three ſtraunge Knights, commaunded mée
to let your Highneſſe vnderſtand, that they haue trauailed a
long time, in the ſeruice of the thrée Daughters of <hi>Galiaſter,</hi>
Duke of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who were iudged faire in the eyes of theſe
<pb facs="tcp:13179:337" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thrée Knightes, albeit they were found verie falſe in their
loue. For they (after they had long time entertayned theſe
Knightes as chiefe of their affections) were married vnto thrée
other Gentlemen, who were brought vppe in their fathers
Court, and with theſe receiued great contentment, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the offence they haue committed, in beiug ſo forgetfull
of their owne honour, as to marrie with ſuch as beſéemed not
their degrees.</p>
                     <p>Theſe thrée Knights are ſo highly offended hereat, as they
haue concluded neuer to eſpouſe any other Damoſels, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch, as being wearie of their owne ſeruants, will vouchſaf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to admit them entertainment. But if any ſuch as are foreſaken
of their Ladies, ſhall alledge, that this change is not equall,
theſe thrée knights will iuſtifie the triall thereof againſt them
by Combate.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe theſe Ladyes may fauour them in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
without any preiudice to the renowme: I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to you the eſtates of theſe knights. The firſt is named
<hi>Luſtramar,</hi> the eldeſt ſonne to the Marqueſſe <hi>Aſtramor.</hi> The
ſecond is called <hi>Arpian,</hi> ſonne to the Duke of <hi>Archeſte.</hi> The
third is <hi>Gradian,</hi> the County of <hi>Artaſia:</hi> who doe altogether
humbly deſire theſe Ladies (by your Highneſſe licence) that
they would ſhew their good willes vnto them, becauſe they are
ſo deſirous to make knowne to them, the hauty valour of their
inuincible ſtomackes: for here will they abide all this day, in
the ſame manner as you ſee, to make proofe of Armes againſt
their amourous ſeruants.</p>
                     <p>But if it ſo fall out, that they find the Ladies of this Court
more deſirous to keepe their old Seruants, then to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
theſe ſo newly come, they will be content to depart
hence, euen as they came hither, and being once gone from
hence, they will viſite moſt of the Princes Courts in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome,
to trie if Fortune will be ſo fauourable to them,
as to knit vp their earneſt deſires to their contentment. The
king <hi>Recinde</hi> was greatly abaſhed at theſe ſudden newes, and
the knights were moued much at this aduenture, eſpecially,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:338" rendition="simple:additions"/>
regarding the eſtates of them that would Combate for their
Ladyes: and for them thus much I can ſay, that there were
many among them, who would gladly haue forſaken their old
fauoured ſeruants, on condition they might marrie with theſe
three noble Princes.</p>
                     <p>The King and the Quéene allowing well their worthy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe,
they ſtayed a great while, looking when ſome one
knight or other of the court, would be ſo venterous as to deale
with them: but ſéeing none would come, they prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to depart, at the very inſtant as the Damoſels Knight
arriued there.</p>
                     <p>This valiant and renowmed Knight was no ſooner eſpyed,
but they that knew him, came and met him, letting him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the enterpriſe of the thrée ſtrange Knights: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rehearſed to him, the Damoſels receiued very much ioy
thereat, for that they being wearie of him, and hope to depart
with theſe thrée knights, and the Prince vnderſtanding their

imagine expedient, and I will recempence my ſelfe by theſe

taken dayly in your ſeruice. I haue béene ſo greatly deceiued

the Ladies of the Court perceiuing, they could not chuſe but
maruell thereat, knowing very wel the proweſſe of the knight
that had conducted them. Some iudged the occaſion, to be the
Damoſels deſire of themſelues, that they might be at their

                        <hi>Gradian</hi> ſéeing the day waſt apace, tooke the hardineſſe to
aduance himſelfe foorth firſt, making ſhow of the Iouſt: which
the Damoſels Knight beholding, he gaue his horſe the ſpurs,
and encountred <hi>Gradian</hi> with ſo great force, as he made him
fetch an errand on the ground: then hee came to <hi>Arteſia</hi> with
theſe words.</p>
                     <p>It is neceſſarie that once againe you come and obey that I
ſhall command you. Then he receiued another Launce, which
one of the Kings Pages brought him, and with it he vnhorſed
<hi>Arpian,</hi> becauſe he had not learned to ſit faſt in his Sadle. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtramar</hi>
was very angry at the miſfortune of his friends wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he encountred the Damoſels Knight ſo nobly, as he cauſed
him to forſake one of his Stirrops, but himſelfe was ſent to
kéepe his fellowes company.</p>
                     <p>Theſe thrée knights, ſéeing the diſhonour they had receiued
in the Iouſt, offered to trie the Combate with the Sword, and
chiefly <hi>Luſtramar</hi> did ſéeme moſt deſirous of it: but the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels

and the darke night ready to ouercharge them, yet would not
<hi>Luſtramar</hi> be content with his anſwere, which when <hi>Poliphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi>

                     <p>While theſe two knights prepared themſelues to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,

The Damoſelles Knight humbly ſaluted the Quéene, and
hauing taken off his Helmet, hée kneeled downe to kiſſe her
hand: but the King (who knew him preſently) imbraced him
very louingly, ſpeaking thus to the Queene. Madame, I pray
you to make good account of the deedes of honour you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
by this Knight, for he hath finiſhed as rare aduentures
as euer did any: aſſuring you that he is the prince <hi>Florian</hi> of the
<hi>Forreſt,</hi> otherwiſe called the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> Sonne
to the Prince <hi>Don Edward,</hi> and the Princeſſe <hi>Flerida</hi> your
great friends. The Queene hearing theſe wordes, tooke him vp
in her armes, and imbracing him very gratiouſly, charged him
with his great diſcourteſie, when he paſſed by the Court, and
would not ſuffer himſelfe to be knowne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Luſtramar</hi> and his companions, knowing that he which had
vanquiſhed them, was the noble knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi>
they made no account of the foyle they had receiued: but on the
next morning when they had departed thence, they deſired the
Prince to eſteeme of them as his vnfeined friends.</p>
                     <p>Two dayes after, the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to leaue the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> whervpon he tooke his leaue
of the King and the Quéene, leauing <hi>Siluian</hi> there in the court,
becauſe ſhe was well knowne, as alſo <hi>Arteſia,</hi> and her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
who wept at their parting, for the loſſe of that they could
not recouer againe. The Queene tooke her leaue friendly of the
Gianteſſe <hi>Arlencea,</hi> becauſe the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> did make ſo
good account of her, and the King <hi>Recinde</hi> brought them foorth
of the Citie, where taking a courteous farewell on all ſides,
with charging him to doe his commendations to the Emperor,
and his children in the Emperours Court, the King returned
againe into the Citie, and the Prince rode on his iourney.</p>

take new armour, when he departed from
the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Court, yet kéeping his
deuiſe in his ſhield of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> ſtill,
becauſe he had greater delight therein, then
in any other: in this manner he trauelled,
atchieuing many rare and ſingular aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which (for breuities ſake) I let paſſe, becauſe they were
not of ſuch importance, as to be placed among his other knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
déeds. After he had coaſted along through diuers Countries,
it was his fortune at length to arriue in a very pleaſant valley,
euen there where the Caſtle of the Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte</hi> ſtood: ſhe
being rid abroad on hunting, as alſo to ſée a Combate fought
betweene <hi>Dragonlat,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Drapos,</hi> and another
Knight, who would not confeſſe the Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte</hi> to be
the faireſt Lady on the earth. And I aſſure you, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of <hi>Arnalte</hi> gaue ſuch encouragement to <hi>Dragonalt,</hi> as
he vanquiſhed his aduerſary, without any great endamage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

where he left the honour of the day, and vppon which
occaſion <hi>Arnalte</hi> did greatly ſtomacke him. But the Knight
being beautifull, gratious, and often fortunate in triall of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures,
continued in ſuch earneſt affection of ſeruice to her,
as ſhe in the end began to fauour his courteous deeds, with
more regard then ſhe had done before.</p>

But returning to the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> whom
the Princeſſe (being in company with her Damoſels) had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpyed
comming a far off: whereupon ſhe came to <hi>Draganolt,</hi>
and after ſhe had very graciouſly ſaluted him, ſhe ſaid, Behold,
here comes the onely man in the world, who is my cruell ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and of whom I deſire to be ſeuerely reuenged: wherefore,
(my eſpeciall good friend) I deſire now to ſée the very vttermoſt
of your redoubted behauiour. And if fortune regard you with
ſuch happineſſe, as you enioy no danger in the fight, I wil not
faile to recompence you in ſuch ſort, as you ſhall be thorowly
ſatiſfied and contented.</p>
                     <p>The promiſe which you make me (anſwered <hi>Dragonalt)</hi>
is of ſuch eſtimation in my thoughts, as your words is onely
able to aſſure me the victorie, albeit fortune ſhould ſéene to

for me to be vanquiſhed, if you continue me in your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable

Combate with the Knight (for the deſire I haue to reuenge
your wrong) but I will likewiſe depriue him of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes,
yea, and of his life, if it ſhall like you ſo to command
me.</p>
                     <p>While <hi>Dragonalt</hi> ſpent other amorous ſpéeches, with the
Ladie and Miſtreſſe of his conquered thoughts, the Knight of
the <hi>Sauage man</hi> and his company, came to the place where
they ſtayed: then <hi>Dragonalt</hi> (to content the honor of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
aduanced himſelfe forward with theſe words.</p>
                     <p>Sir Knight, I am to let you know, how you arre arriued in
the place, where it is thought méete that you make triall of my
valour, which you ſhall finde of ſuch authoritie, as will enforce
you to obey the commandement of this Princeſſe: whom I
will cauſe you to confeſſe, that ſhe is the faireſt Lady liuing
on the earth, and is beſt worthy of knightly ſeruice. And when
I haue diſpoyled you of your armour, you ſhall goe and ſubmit
yourſelfe to this my Lady and Miſtreſſe <hi>Arnalte,</hi> the Princeſſe
of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> who ſhall accept into her ſeruice thoſe Damoſels
in your company, becauſe we pittie to ſee you ſo ouercharged:

If the Princeſſe of <hi>Nauarre</hi> (my friend) be ſo deſirous to be
ſerued with my Damoſelles, it is very great ſhame to you,
that you haue not ſought me before this preſent, for you might
haue found me better acquainted with Damoſelles, then I
am now, and by whom the Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte</hi> might haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
far more honoour: but as for thoſe which are with me, I
thinke I ſhall defend them well enough from comming in her
ſeruice. Moreouer, if I ſhould be ſo impudent, as to confeſſe
the large title you haue made of her, I ſhould imagine my ſelfe
depriued of my wittes: for I am (my ſelfe) the ſeruant of ſuch
a gratious Ladie, as the Princeſſe <hi>Arnalte</hi> may no way e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall

depart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dragonalt</hi> being offended to heare the words of the knight
of the <hi>Sanage men,</hi> tooke a ſtrong Launce from his Eſquire,
and bowing himſelfe to the Princeſſe to aſſiſt him with her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
he broched his horſe againſt the prince, who likewiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
himſelfe to the Iouſt: and they encountred together ſo
valiantly, as <hi>Dragonalt</hi> breaking his Launce on the Knight
of the <hi>Sauage mans</hi> Shéelde, lifted him vppon the croupher of
his horſe, but <hi>Dragonalt</hi> himſelfe was caſt forth of his Saddle.
Vpon this the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> caſt himſelfe from his horſe, and
<hi>Dragonalt</hi> hauing recouered his feete, they beganne to charge
one another very furiouſly, for <hi>Dragonalt</hi> intended to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
his promiſe, or he would fight till the Knight of the <hi>Sauage
man</hi> were depriued of his life.</p>
                     <p>But he found himſelfe greatly deceiued, for the noble <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
handled him in ſuch ſort, as the Prindeſſe <hi>Arnalte</hi> well
perceiued, that the ſtrength of her knight began to faile, and
no maruaile, for he was gréeuouſly wounded in many places:
whereat the knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> was greatly offended.
And fearing he ſhould kill him outright, he pauſed awhile,
becauſe he would ſuffer him to take breath, when, he deſired
him to giue ouer the Combat, &amp; returne to the Paſſage which
he had enterpriſed to guard: but <hi>Dragonalt</hi> gaue him this
anſwer. Your counſell (S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

followed, if I made more account of my life, then the honour of
<pb facs="tcp:13179:341"/>

giue ouer the Combat. Then began they the Combat a freſh,
wounding one another ſo cruelly, as <hi>Arnalte</hi> and the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
did greatly pittie to ſée the Knight ſo cruelly bent, that their
blood altered the colour of the graſſe where they fought: in the
end <hi>Dragonalt</hi> not able to endure any longer, fell downe at
the knight of the <hi>Sauage mans</hi> féete, to whom the Princeſſe
preſently, and fearing he would cut off the head of her friend, ſhe
ſpake to him in this manner.</p>
                     <p>I pray you (ſir knight) do not take his life from him, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
the victorie is ſufficient for an honorable mind. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

I wil not hold my hands, without he recant his former words,
or you promiſe me a gift that I intend to demand of you. I
pray you (ſaid <hi>Arnalte)</hi> let him riſe, for I am content to grant
what euer you requeſt, prouided alwayes, that you ſeeme not

                     <p>Madame, if you were as firme and conſtant, as you are
both kinde and beautifull (which is a thing moſt neceſſarie in
you) I durſt awarrant you, that your Knights could not
be conuicted in this manner: beſide, there is no knight, but
would willingly ioyne with them in doing you ſeruice: and
I aſſure you, that had you not offred to compell me againſt my

I am to doe faire Ladies ſeruice, remembring alwayes,
that ſuch as you are, ought to be well eſtéemed and not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
And you ſhall vnderſtand, that I haue béene both in the
Court of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> which are not a little renowned
by the beauty of the faire Ladies, that there are nouriſhed. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
I haue ſéene <hi>Florenda,</hi> daughter to <hi>Arnedes</hi> the king of
<hi>Fraunce,</hi> whoſe beautie is honoured of a great many: but ſhée
whom your Champion named, and thoſe that I haue rehearſed
to you my ſelfe, may not compare with the Ladies of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Palmerins</hi> Court.</p>
                     <p>There haue I ſéene <hi>Gridonia, Polinarda, Leonarda</hi> the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and <hi>Sidelia,</hi> Daughter to the King <hi>Tarnaes,</hi> of
<hi>Lacedemonia.</hi> I haue ſéene alſo the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the great <hi>Turke,</hi> for whoſe loue, <hi>Albayzar</hi> the <hi>Soldane</hi>
of <hi>Babilon,</hi> hath ſuffered very dangerous trauailes: all theſe
(in my iudgement) are highly aduanced in beauty beyond you,
and ſo it will be granted of any, that is not wedded in affection
towards you.</p>
                     <p>But let it not offend you that I ſpeake more plainely, it is
your crueltie and pride together, that doeth much deface your
title of beautie, which you cannot deny your ſelfe, making ſo
light account as you doe of ſir <hi>Dragonalt,</hi> not remembring that
he is a worthy Knight, and Sonne to one of the moſt valiant
Princes on the earth.</p>
                     <p>And if this triall is not ſufficient to cauſe you loue him faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
truſt me I muſt needes ſay, that he hath put himſelfe in
danger for an vnfaithfull perſon, whom neither knightly boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
nor regard of her owne duty hath power to mooue. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
therefore that you made me promiſe to grant what I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted,
my deſire is, that in recompence of his noble deſerts,
you would accept of him as your Lord and Huſband: ſo ſhall
you both fulfill your promiſe to me, and accompliſh the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
which the King your Father charged you ſhould
fulfill: I now reſpect your anſwere, to ſee if a man ſhould build
any aſſurance of your word. Sir Knight (anſwered <hi>Arnalte)</hi> do
me the fauour to tel me firſt who you are, and afterward I will
doe my good will to ſatiſfie your requeſt.</p>

                     <p>I feare me (Sir knight) that we ſhall be hindered by the
night which draweth faſt vpon vs, before we can make an end
of our Combate, whereto I ſée you prepare your ſelfe, onely to
witneſſe your ſeruice to the Damoſell in the window. What
is that materiall to you Sir? (anſwered the Knight of the
<hi>Bull)</hi> if for her ſake I enterpriſe the fight, doubt you not but I
will be as good as my promiſe.</p>
                     <p>So without any more words, they ranne together very
couragiouſly, and after they had broken their Lances, they
met ſo fiercely with their bodies, as they fell both beſide their
horſes, to the ground.</p>
                     <p>When they had recouered themſelues, they drew their
ſwordes, wherewith they fought a very doubtfull and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Combate, the aduantage whereof fell to the Knight
of the <hi>Bull,</hi> yet not ſo eaſily, but he was glad for to reſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
as his enemie: which when he perceiued, he leaned
himſelfe againſt the wall, giuing theſe ſpéeches to the ſtrange
knight.</p>
                     <p>How ſay you now Sir? doe you not perſwade your ſelfe
now, that I haue power ſufficiently to accompliſh what I
haue promiſed? Wherefore I would counſell you to reſerue
your manhood for other occaſions, better then to loſe your
life here, and therefore bee ruled by my aduiſe, goe ſubmitte
your ſelfe to the Princeſſe <hi>Armiſia,</hi> who will not deale diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteouſly
with them, that will ſo render their ſeruice vnto
her willingly: the ſtraunge Knight returned him this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                     <p>Sir knight, I know as well as you, what profite or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
can come to me, if I ſhould doe as you perſwade mée,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:346" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therefore I pray you let this talke paſſe and let vs end what we
haue begun.</p>
                     <p>And ſo without attending any anſwer, he began to charge
the Knight of the <hi>Bull</hi> againe, who entertained him in ſuch
ſort, as in ſhort time he felt himſelfe to feeble, to re reſiſt the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſtrokes his enemy gaue him, ſo that in the end, being vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to continue any longer, he had loſt ſo much blood, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he fell
downe before the knight of the <hi>Bull,</hi> who taking off his helmet
ſpake vnto him in this manner.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall vnderſtand now (Sir knight) that be cauſe you
ſcorned to follow my counſell, you ſhall now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether you will
or no) goe ſubmit your ſelfe to the Princeſſe <hi>Armiſia,</hi> and if
you refuſe to doe it, I will not fayle to part your head from
your ſhoulders. I know not Sir (anſwered the ſtraunge
Knight) which of theſe two conditions I ſhould chuſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you preſent me, ſo dangerous they both ſeeme to me, for
I would more willingly receiue my death at your hand, then
goe ſubmit my ſelfe to her, who can be pleaſed with nothing
elſe, but adioyning me a moſt ſhamefull death.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Bull</hi> being ignorant of the reaſon, why
he feared ſo much to goe render himſelfe to the Princeſſe <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſia,</hi>
deſired that he would tell him his name. Truely Sir
(ſaid the ſtrange knight) I intend not ſo much to ſatiſfie your
will: for it is yet ſome contentment to him that is vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
when the conquerour hath no knowledge of him.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Bull</hi> ſéeing him ſo obſtinate, ſent his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
to the Princeſſe <hi>Armiſia,</hi> deſiring her, (if ſo it were her
pleaſure) to grant this Knight his life. <hi>Armiſia,</hi> who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
very courteous to them that had any preferment in her
fauour, commanded one of her Damoſelles to goe to the
knight of the <hi>Bull,</hi> and tell him that he ſhould giue the knight
his life, after he had knowledge who he was.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſell was no ſooner come to the Bridge, but ſhe
preſently knew the vanquiſhed knight to be <hi>Adraſpe,</hi> ſonne
to the duke of <hi>Sizana,</hi> who had ſlaine the Prince <hi>Doriell,</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to her Lady and Miſtreſſe <hi>Armiſia,</hi> for the reuenge of
whoſe death, the guarding of that paſſage was firſt ordained.
<pb facs="tcp:13179:346" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Vpon this, the Damoſell began to crie aloude and teare her
haire very pittifully, ſaying he was now come that had ſlaine
the Prince <hi>Doriell,</hi> which her Lady hearing, ſhe came downe
immediatly, with her Damoſels waiting on her, both ſhée and
they wéeping very bitterly, when ſhe ſpake to the Knight of
the <hi>Bull</hi> in this manner.</p>
                     <p>I pray you Sir Knight let me haue your aſſiſtance, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
out of the grieuous paſſions wherein I haue long time
remained: for you ſhall vnderſtand, that the Knight whom you
haue conquered, is the very ſame that flew my brother <hi>Dori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,</hi>
for whoſe death the King my father liueth in extreame
heauineſſe.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> marking her words, ſpake in this
order to his friend <hi>Siluian:</hi> I ſée wel it is more dangerous to fall
into the hands of a woman, who is deſirous of vengeance, then
to deale with a hundred good and hardy knights. Wherefore I
pray thée take my horſe a while, and I will goe ſée, if by my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatance
his life may be ſaued. Then came he to the Bridge,
and deſired the Knight of the <hi>Bull,</hi> that would not offer the
knight any more cruelty: and turning to the Princeſſe <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
he ſaluted her with theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>Madame, if any anciant enmitie cauſeth you to deſire the
death of this Knight, I pray you admit to memorie, that a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of ſo great calling as you are, ought not to be void of lenitie
and pittie, and chiefely at ſuch a time, when you haue moſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to execute the extremitie of your will. And if my reaſons be
not ſufficient to appeaſe your anger. I pray you yet conſider
with your ſelfe, that no perſons vſe crueltie where they may
ſhew pittie, but they repent themſelues afterward when their
collericke moode is ouerblowne and paſt.</p>
                     <p>The honeſt and vertuous language of the knight of the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
had not the power to mooue any pittie in the Princeſſe <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſia:</hi>
but ſhe commanded the knight of the <hi>Bull,</hi> that he ſhould
cut off the head of her enemie, then the Prince gaue her theſe
wordes. I promiſe you Madame, if neither pittie nor perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
may preuaile with you, I will ſtand ſuch an eye-ſore in
your way my ſelfe, as you ſhall not execute your malicious
<pb facs="tcp:13179:347" rendition="simple:additions"/>
humour. I would with all my heart (ſaid the Knight of the
<hi>Bull)</hi> that it might pleaſe the Princeſſe to grant this knight
his life: but ſince you preſume ſo boldly to defend him, I will
not refuſe (albeit I am ſo ſore wounded) to let you vnderſtand
that you neither can nor ſhall hinder me, in fulfilling what my
Lady hath commanded.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> did not vſe theſe wordes, to the end
that hee would enter the Combate with <hi>Pompides,</hi> but onely
to change the rigorous humour of <hi>Armiſia,</hi> and becauſe he saw
the Knight in ſuch danger. But ſuch was the cruell minde of
the Princeſſe, as ſhée continued ſtill in one ſong, calling for
the head of the vanquiſhed knight <hi>Adraſpe,</hi> who with the
great expence of his blood, and griefe to ſée the wreakefull will
of <hi>Armiſia,</hi> ended his life while the knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> and
<hi>Pompides</hi> were preparing themſelues to the Combat: <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi>
ſéeing <hi>Adraſpes</hi> was dead, could not be yet contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
becauſe his head was not ſmitten off as ſhe commanded.
Wherefore, becauſe <hi>Pompides</hi> did not accompliſh what ſhe
willed him, ſhée flang away in a furie, and went into her
Chamber.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pompides,</hi> who was brought into great extremitie for her
loue, did ſo grieue at her departure, as he was conſtrained to
ſet him downe vpon the bridge: but the knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi>
perceiuing his heauines, tooke pitty on him, and came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
him, which <hi>Pompides</hi> ſéemed to diſdaine, becauſe he iudged
that his preſence procured his miſfortune. <hi>Siluian</hi> ſéeing his
maiſter not returne, came walking with his horſe before the
bridge, whom <hi>Pompides</hi> hauing eſpied, he knew preſently that
the knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> was the renowed <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in which perſwaſion, for the great ioy hee conceiued, he
came to him with theſe words.</p>
                     <p>I am well aſſured my gratious Lord, that the comfort I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
at this preſent inſtant, will deface and extinguiſh all my
former miſhaps. <hi>Palmerin</hi> tooke off his Helmet, and hauing
imbraced <hi>Pompides,</hi> beganne to perſwade him in good hope of
his Lady, who had no ſooner forgotten her anger, but ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued
her ſelfe of great vnkindneſſe, and then ſhee ſent to
<pb facs="tcp:13179:347" rendition="simple:additions"/>
intreate <hi>Pompides</hi> that he would pardon her, and if ſo it were
his pleaſure, to bring the knight into her houſe with him, whoo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſhe ſaw ſo familiar with him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pompides</hi> vnderſtanding the will of the Princeſſe, took his
brother by the hand and walked into his Chamber, where,
when they were vnarmed, the Princeſſe came her ſelfe to viſit
them, entring into theſe ſpéeches to the knight of the <hi>Tiger.</hi>
I beſéech you Sir knight to excuſe me, in that I made no more
account of your honeſt and courteous words: for I aſſure you,
the great danger wherein I was at that inſtant, would not
ſuffer me to regard any perſwaſion whatſoeuer, but onely to
reuenge my ſelfe on my cruell enemy. And becauſe you ſhal not
conceiue any ill opinion of me, I will tell you for what cauſe I
enuied the Knight ſo much.</p>
                     <p>You ſhall vnderſtand Sir, that I am the daughter of <hi>Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adus</hi>
the king of <hi>Scots,</hi> in whoſe Court <hi>Adraſpe</hi> the eldeſt ſon
to the Duke of <hi>Sizana</hi> (whom <hi>Pompides</hi> hath ſlaine)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beganne
to waxe very amourous of me, but becauſe I knew him to bée
one of very bad conditions, I made no regard of his earneſt
ſuite. Neuertheleſſe he was ſo importunate and voyde of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
as he would not be anſwered. Wherupon I was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to complaine to the Prince <hi>Doriell</hi> my Brother, of whom
when <hi>Adraſpe</hi> perceiued himſelfe to bee hated and deſpiſed,
he practiſed which way he might beſt be reuenged on him, and
following his ſecret trayterous intent, it was not long after
before he had the opportunitie for to execute his mallicious ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke.</p>
                     <p>It ſo chanced, that one day my brother and he had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to walke abroade together, when, <hi>Adraſpe</hi> being priuily
armed, and hauing at hand ſuch as prouided for his purpoſe, he
ſlew my Brother, whoſe death the King my father could not
accompliſh to reuenge, becauſe hée ſhould then deale with
one of the chéefeſt Princes of his Realme, and his beſt aſſured
friend.</p>
                     <p>Yet was not his heart frée from continuall vexation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
that nature could not otherwiſe chuſe, which I pittying,
and willing to aſſiſt my father to the vttermoſt I could,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:348" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I left the Court, and cauſed this houſe to be erected in this
place, which being the chiefeſt paſſage in all this Realme, I
enterpriſed to haue ſome valiant Knight defend this Birdge,
promiſing to marry with him, if he could be ſo happie as to
kill <hi>Adraſpe.</hi> And he (as he was alwayes accuſtomed) bearing
a proude and loftie minde, would oftentimes come to ſhow
himſelfe here, onely to vexe me with the remembrance of my
Brothers death: and ſtill hee would Combatte with my
Knights, being euermore ſo fortunate as to vanquiſh and kill
them.</p>
                     <p>But after the knight of the <hi>Bull</hi> tooke this charge vpon him,
<hi>Adraſpe</hi> (who had heard of his noble proweſſe) remained two
moneths before he could come hither againe: yet at the laſt,
came to trie his Fortune againſt the Knight of the <hi>Bull,</hi> who
hath depriued him of his life as you ſée, and ſatiſfied my wil that
made me to ordaine this cuſtome,</p>
                     <p>Madamy (anſwered the knight of the <hi>Tiger)</hi> you ſhould haue
had my helpe in taking his life from him, if you had told me
at the firſt what great wrong he had done you, for the very
earth will open to ſwallow thoſe, that intend or practiſe any
treaſon againſt their Prince, yea and the Prince himſelfe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be frée from ſuch ſecret conſpirators, when fauour ſhall
ſtand in ſtéede of Iuſtice to ſuch wicked offendors: wherefore,
if they be ſharpely puniſhed, the reſt will be the better warned
by their tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And I aſſure you Madame, you haue done as well beſéemed
a vertuous Princeſſe, in cutting off that branch, when fortune
made the inſtrument of your vnhappineſſe: beſide, the duetie
wherein you are bound to the knight your father, did command
you ſhould ſée ſo good a déede executed.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore let me humbly intreate you, that you would
kéepe your promiſe to Sir <hi>Pompides,</hi> who is my Brother, the
nephew to king <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and ſonne to the prince
<hi>Don Edward,</hi> who is father to him and me, and friend to
you.</p>
                     <p>I ſée well (ſayde <hi>Armiſia)</hi> that I haue wrought the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Knight my father, and taken vengeance for the
<pb facs="tcp:13179:348" rendition="simple:additions"/>
death of the Prince <hi>Doriel</hi> my brother, by the proweſſe of him,
whoſe preſence is no ſmall honour to me: neuertheleſſe, I may
thinke my ſelfe little beholding to him, in that he hath concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
himſelfe ſo long from me, who would haue allowed him
more honourable entertainment. And I pray you Sir, let it
not offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d you, that I deſire to know, whether yon be the prince
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> or <hi>Florian</hi> of the <hi>Forreſt,</hi> his Brother: not that I
am affectioned more to the one then the other, but becauſe I
would know, which of them Fortune hath made me ſo happy
to ſée: the Prince returned her this anſwer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Florian</hi> of the <hi>Forreſt</hi> (Madame) is ſo farre off this place, as
very hardly can one tell where to meete with him: wherefore,
you may perſwade your ſelfe that I am <hi>Palmerin,</hi> whom (if
you pleaſe) you may command as your ſeruant. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<hi>Armiſia</hi> embraced him very gratiouſly, reioycing that
ſhe might any way accompliſh the meanes to honour him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

of <hi>England,</hi> the Prince <hi>Don Edwards</hi> mother.</p>
                     <p>The death of the proude <hi>Adraſpe,</hi> was reported the ſame day
in the king of <hi>Scots</hi> Court (which was but foure leagues from
this place) and the name of the Knight that had ſlaine him:
whereupon the king vpon the next meaning tooke his Coatch,
and being accompanied with many worthy knights, he came
to ſée the Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> and hauing giuen him
many gratious ſalutations, he tooke <hi>Pompides</hi> by the hand,
promiſing to make as good eſtimation of him, as he did of the
Prince his ſonne while he liued. While the aged king ſate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly
talking with <hi>Armiſia</hi> his Daughter, the Archbiſhop
of <hi>Esbreque</hi> arriued there, by whom, <hi>Pompides</hi> and <hi>Armiſia,</hi>
were preſently married together, and then departing thence,
they went very ſtrongly to ſeeke to the Duke of <hi>Sizana,</hi> Father
to the proud <hi>Adraſpe,</hi> whom the king vowed to put to death,

                     <p>After many ſuch like ſpéeches had paſt betwéene them, they
imbraced one another, <hi>Pompides</hi> returning to the Citie, and
<hi>Palmerin</hi> entring the Shippe, cauſed the ſayles to be hoyſed,
when the winde ſeruing them ſo well, as (after they had ſpent
ſuch time as is méete for ſo great a iourney) the Prince tooke
landing in <hi>Hungaria.</hi> When he had paſt through diuerſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Countrey, it was his chaunce to arriue in a goodly
Forreſt, where at length he came to a very faire Fountaine,
which was couered with an Arke of maruellous ingenious
workemanſhip: and becauſe the weather was excéeding hot, he
alighted to refreſh himſelfe at this Fountaine. In the meane
while <hi>Siluian</hi> ſuffered the horſes to graſe in the paſture, and
when the Prince had waſhed his hands and his face, he eſpyed
a little from him downe further in the Forreſt, a Damoſel run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
very ſpéedily, with her haire hanging about her ſhoulders,
and tearing her faire viſage with her nailes, crying and wéeping
out of meaſure: at laſt ſhe eſpyed the Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> to
whom ſhe came running a great pace, and caſting her ſelfe at
his féete, ſhe remained fearefully looking about her a good while,
hauing not the power to ſpeake one word.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> ſéeing her perplexed caſe, began to
pittie her very much, and doubted leſt he that had feared her,
would make purſuite after her, he called for his Helmet, which
he had no ſooner claſped on his head, but he beheld comming
the way that the Damoſell came, a giant very ſtrongly armed,
carying in his hand a huge Mace, who ſéeing the Damoſell, had
demaunded ſuccour of the Knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> ſpake vnto her
in this manner. Truſt me Damoſell, you betake your ſelfe

So without any more words, he ſtrooke at the Prince with
his Mace, who put his Shield before him to reſiſt the ſtroke,
which was ſo rigorous, as his Shield flewe in two pieces: the
Prince was ſomewhat offended hereat, wherefore (drawing
his ſword) he gaue the Giant ſuch a blowe on the arme, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward

remaining ſtill in extreame feare, by the cruell intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

came vnto her, and counſelled her to ſee the end of the Combat,
wherevpon ſhe gaue him theſe words. I pray you gentle eſquier
and my friend, that you would not ſéeme to hinder me, for this
Giant, nay rather a Deuill (whoſe force none is found able to
reſiſt) will aſſuredly put me to death, after that he hath ſlaine
your maiſter. I would yet (ſaid <hi>Siluian)</hi> that you would ſtay to
ſée the ende of the fight: for peraduenture it may happen other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
then you expect.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> (who was deſtitute of a Shield, to
auoid the cruell ſtrokes of his ſtrong enemy) behaued himſelfe
ſo politiquely and nimbly, as hee lent the Giant many ſore
blowes, who was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained becauſe he could not lift his mace
in his right hand) to vſe his left, thinking yet to deale well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
with the Knight of the <hi>Tiger:</hi> but the Prince was ſo
fierce vpon him (hauing giuen him many grieuous and mortall
wounds) as his heart began to faile him, ſo that he retired, not
able to reſiſt ſo many waighty ſtrokes, neuertheles, the prince
ſéeing he had almoſt brought him to buy, let flie ſtill ſo fiercely
on him, as he could not haue the meane to charge him againe.
The Giant perceiuing himſelfe in ſuch extremitie, leaned his
backe againſt a Trée, when he defended himſelfe a great while
ſo well, that the Prince could hardly reach to hurt him, hee
waged fight euery way ſo preciſely with his Mace, which hee
held in both his hands, watching the time when he might giue
the Prince ſuch a ſtroke as he willingly would.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> he might not preuaile againſt the
Giant, without hazarding his perſon in great danger, he went
<pb facs="tcp:13179:350" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and reſted himſelfe againſt a Trée like wiſe, which when the
Giant beheld, he ſpake vnto him in this order. I pray thee Sir
Knight, let me find ſo much friendſhip at thy hands, as to let
me vnderſtand what is thy name, becauſe I haue euermore
thought that no ten of the beſt knights on the earth, could not
do as much as thou haſt done, neither that they could haue bene
able to reſiſt me halfe this while.</p>
                     <p>I am content (anſwered the knight of the <hi>Tiger)</hi> to ſatiſfie
thy will ſo much, on condition thou wilt promiſe to tell me thy
name, and the cauſe why thou doeſt purſue this Damoſell. So
much (quoth the Giant) thou ſhalt commaund at my handes,
wherefore, thou ſhalt vnderſtand that I am called <hi>Vaſcalion</hi>
of <hi>Ocrance,</hi> Sonne to the Giant <hi>Lucran,</hi> who was ſlaine at
<hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by the hands of <hi>Primaleon,</hi> with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was
ſo hardy as to enter the Combate, to reuenge the death of <hi>Don
Perrequin</hi>
of <hi>Duas,</hi> and to haue in marriage <hi>Gridonia,</hi> the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſſe
of <hi>Ormeda,</hi> who was afterward eſpouſed to <hi>Primaleon.</hi>
At what time my father was ſlaine, he left me in the kéeping
of one of my Brethren, named <hi>Dramoque,</hi> who is likewiſe
ſlaine be one of the ſonnes of the Prince <hi>Don Edward</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and this Knight is yet in the ſearch of Knightly aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
But I aſſure you, I am not a little agréeued to ſée my
ſelfe in this caſe, becanſe I am almoſt depriued of any hope,
to reuenge the Death of my Father and his Brother, before I
dye.</p>
                     <p>And for this Damoſell, it is ſo, that fortune cauſed me to méet
with her to day, and as I vnderſtood by her, ſhe is going to the
Court of the Emperor <hi>Palmerin,</hi> to viſite <hi>Leonarda</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of <hi>Thrace:</hi> now, for that I am deſirous to do all the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
that I may, to any of that Emperours Court, I endeuored
my ſelfe to rauiſh this Damoſell. But at the time I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to fulfill my pleaſure on her, an Eſquire of hers (who had
eſcaped my hands) came and hindered me with the ayd of fiue
Knights, whom I haue left to hold Combat with ten of my
Knights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe I would follow this Damoſel, who tooke her
ſelfe to flight, ſo ſoone as the fiue Knights began to charge me.
Thus haue I told you the whole circumſtance of my minde,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:351" rendition="simple:additions"/>
now it remaineth that you reueale your ſelfe to me, according
as at firſt you promiſed.</p>
                     <p>Beléeue me <hi>Vaſcalion</hi> (anſwered the Knight of the <hi>Tiger)</hi>
it is neceſſary that thou ſhouldeſt receiue ſharpe chaſtiſement,
for vſing thy life in ſuch wicked actions, the proofe hereof thou
mayſt now behold thy ſelfe: for thou being not content with
the death of thy Father and his Brother, ſéekeſt to reuenge thy
villainous will on this innocent Damoſell. I let thée know
therefore, that I am a kinſeman to <hi>Primaleon,</hi> and the ſame
man that ſlew thy Fathers Brother, which made me be called
<hi>Palmeran</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> Sonne to prince <hi>Edward</hi> and faire <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida</hi>
the Siſter of <hi>Primaleon,</hi> for whoſe ſake, I intend to take
thy life from thée before I depart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Vaſcalion</hi> (at theſe words) began greatly to diſmay himſelf,
for he knew well that his ſtrength was not ſufficient to hold
out long againſt him, but yet he preſently aduanced himſelfe,
to ſhew what deſire he had to be reuenged on him that had
ſlaine his Vuckle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> being very glad, when he perceiued the Gianc had
forſaken the Trée, which ſerued him all the while as a Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
of defence, aſſayled him with ſuch furious ſtrokes, as the
Giant would gladly haue reſted himſelfe againe: but the
Prince followed him ſtill ſo earneſtly, as at length he tumbled
on the ground before him, when (not content to ſée him ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered)
he ſet his foote vpon him, and when he had taken off his
Helmet, he preſently parted his head from his ſhoulders. The
ſight hereof made the Damoſell ſo glad, as ſhe had now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
the feare wherein ſhe was when the Giant purſued
her, and then came the Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> to her with theſe
words.</p>
                     <p>Faire Damoſell, I iudge that the fiue Knights who are in
Combate for your occaſion, cannot otherwiſe chuſe but be in
great daunger: wherefore, I will goe ſéeke them foorth to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
them, in the meane while you may come faire and ſoftly
after with my Eſquire, who (for your better eaſe) ſhall take you
vp behinde him on his horſe. Then tooke he that way which
he ſaw the Giant come, when he purſued the Damoſell, and
<pb facs="tcp:13179:351" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it was not long before he heard the clanching of the Swordes,
wherevpon he gaue his horſe the ſpurs, and neuer left gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
till he came to them, where he ſawe they had ſlaine foure
of the Giants knights, and of the other ſixe, there were but two
that could defend themſelues to any purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> knew <hi>Dramian</hi> the king <hi>Recind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſonne, by his Armour and the deuiſe he bare in his Shield, then
alighting from his horſe, he put himſelfe among his friendes,
charging one of them that fought ſo ſtoutly, as he tumbled rée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to the ground: which the other fiue perceiuing, they were ſo
greatly diſmayed, as in ſhort time, the knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> and
his companions made an ende of their wretched liues.</p>
                     <p>The Damoſell arriued there very ſoone after, when the ſight
of <hi>Siluian</hi> made the knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> preſently knowne to
theſe fiue knights, who were not a little glad of his company,
being all his knowne and approoued friends.</p>
                     <p>The firſt was <hi>Dramian,</hi> ſonne to the king <hi>Recinde,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

knights were conducted by their Eſquers, to a little village not
farre from the Forreſt, where they were carefully attended till
their wounds were healed.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> kept them company two or thrée
dayes, when afterward he tooke his leaue of them, ſetting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the next way he could deuiſe, to bring him to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi>
where the Emperor was preſently giuen to vnderſtand,
of the death of <hi>Vaſcalion</hi> and his tenne knights, which newes
were highly welcome to all in the Emperours Court.</p>

in trauaile, as at length he came into the

for I aſſure you the deuiſe of the <hi>Tiger</hi> he bare in his

or none would willingly meddle with him. But the néerer the
Prince approched to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the more he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
paſſioned for the loue of his Lady, remembring her vnkind
ſpeeches, &amp; the ſharpe entreatance ſhe vſed to him, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from the Court, which were now ſo earneſt in his
thoughts, as he durſt hardly now offer to come again in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
<hi>Siluian</hi> labouring as much as he could poſſible, to cauſe
him forſake that fond humor, perſwading him that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
furie could not chuſe but be now thorowly forgotten, and
he durſt awarrant, that ſhe had repented her ſelfe many times
ſince that ſhe had vſed him ſo vngently.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> hearing the wordes of <hi>Siluian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to comfort himſelfe indifferently, and riding on, they came
at laſt to haue the citie in their ſight, which the Prince ſtood and
and beheld a great while, with the teares running downe his
cheekes, and many a ſcalding ſigh ſent from his hart, beholding
the Chamber wherein his Lady and Miſtreſſe lay.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:352" rendition="simple:additions"/>
When he had paſſed this cogitation ſo well as he could, hée
claſped on his Helmet, and taking his Shield and his Launce,
hee commaunded <hi>Siluian</hi> to goe before into the cittie, and
prouide ſome place where he might alight, becauſe he would
come vnknowne, if ſo be any aduenture might be preſented to
him when hee arriued at the Court. And ſo it came to paſſe,
that a knight came to the Emperors Court, the day before the
arriuall of <hi>Palmerin,</hi> hauing two Eſquires attending on him,
who carried his Helmet, Shield, and Launce: and comming
very proudly into the Emperors preſence, he vſed his language
in this manner.</p>
                     <p>I giue thée to vnderſtand (moſt redoubted and famous Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour)
that I <hi>Arnolte,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Aſtronomicall Iſle,</hi> and the
giant <hi>Brauorant,</hi> were very great friends together, for that our
gouernments were ſomewhat néere one another, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
this friendſhip long continued betweene them, my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
concluded, that I ſhould marry with <hi>Arlencea,</hi> Daughter
to the Giant <hi>Brauorant:</hi> but becauſe both my yeares and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
ſerued not as then, they prolonged our marriage for
the ſpace of fiue yeeres. In which time <hi>Brauorant</hi> departed
this life, ſo likewiſe <hi>Camboldam, Calfurnien, Brocalont,</hi> and
<hi>Baleato,</hi> who were ſlaine by the two ſonnes of prince <hi>Edward</hi>
of <hi>England,</hi> your nephews. And to aboliſh altogether the houſe
of <hi>Brauorant, Collambra</hi> his wife (by the counſell of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
<hi>Alfernao)</hi> ſent Lady <hi>Arlencea</hi> her Daughter into this
Countrey, to the end that by their deceit, they might cauſe the
Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> to forſake this Court, that reuenge
might be taken on him for the death of her Sonnes, which
would remedie her inward ſorrowes, ſeeing him brought into

                     <p>But now it is thought vnpoſſible to helpe this miſfortune,
for <hi>Alfernao</hi> is ſlaine by <hi>Collambraes</hi> meanes, who threw her

the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> and not doubting but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

I am not a little offended, for if Fortune refuſe mee, I
ſhall not account it any iniurie to be vanquiſhed at his handes,
who is daily woont to remaine victor in all places where hée

                     <p>Beſide, if I be depriued of my life, I ſhall make an ende of
thoſe careful thoughts, which maketh me deſirous to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
and for this purpoſe I intend to waite his comming.
Now if in the meane will, your Maieſtie will giue me leaue
to make ſome triall at Armes, againſt the Knightes of your

returned him this anſwere.</p>
                     <p>Truſt me (my friend) you haue enterpriſed to ſéeke your

if in the time you expect their comming, you be ſo deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to make knowne your valour, I grant you the libertie
of the field, where the Knights of my Court ſhall not ſaile to

                     <p>I deſire nothing more (anſwered <hi>Arnolfe:)</hi> And ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any more wordes he entred the Field, where he Iouſted
againſt three Knightes, two of them being vnhorſed, and the
third vanquiſhed in the Combat with the ſword: then the day
declining, they gaue ouer for that time.</p>
                     <p>On the next morning he entred the Field againe, being in
blacke Armour and hauing painted in his Shield little flames
of fire in a Field of Sable. The Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> ſtayed
not long, before hee came and ſhewed himſelfe in the Field,
armed as he was woont to be, but very much diſguiſed with
ſhadowes, leaſt hee ſhould be knowne, and his deuiſe of the
<hi>Tiger</hi> was ſo defaced, as one could not iudge what proportion
it ſhould be.</p>
                     <p>As he paſſed along by the Empreſſe Chamber windowe,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:353" rendition="simple:additions"/>

abaſhed: but ſéeing that <hi>Arnolfe</hi> was ſo ready to Iouſt,
he let paſſe all fond conceits, and praunced into the Liſts to
know the ſtate of the enterpriſe, which was preſently declared
to him by one of the Iudges of the Feeld, whereupon the prince
aduanced himſelfe to the Giant <hi>Arnolfe,</hi> ſpeaking vnto him in
this manner.</p>
                     <p>Thou ſhalt vnderſtand <hi>Arnolfe,</hi> that thou art now to deale
with a kinſeman to the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> wherefore
if thou haſt any thing to ſay vnto him, reuenge it on me, who
is one of his linage. <hi>Arnolfe</hi> was ſo iocound when he heard
theſe words, as he preſently gaue his horſe the ſpurs againſt
the knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> they encountred together with ſo great
force, as the Prince forſooke one of his Stirrups, but <hi>Arnolfe</hi>
was ſent to the earth with his héeles vpward.</p>
                     <p>This braue beginning cauſed the Emperor and <hi>Primaleon</hi>
to reioyce, they iudging the ſtrength of <hi>Arnolfe</hi> vnequall to be
compared with the knight of the <hi>Tiger,</hi> who alighting from
his horſe, came and receiued <hi>Arnolfe</hi> at the point of the ſword,
he being not a little mooued at his ſore fall, eſpecially, hauing
receiued ſuch a foyle at his hands, who was allied to the knight
of the <hi>Sauage man.</hi> The Combate beganne and continued
with great fury, which moued the Emperour to theſe wordes.
I perceiue now, that <hi>Arnolfe</hi> might haue vſed leſſe boaſting
of his prowes, becauſe he ſéemeth far vnable to make reſiſtance
againſt the knight that fighteth with him. It is reaſon good
Father (aunſwered <hi>Primaleon)</hi> that euill perſons ſhould be
puniſhed, that example may remaine to others, to beware how
they meddle in ſuch vnduttfull attempts. <hi>Arnolfe</hi> and the
Knight of the <hi>Tiger</hi> ſo hacked one another, as their Armour
witneſſed their cruell rage and furie, eſpecially the Gyant,
whoſe fleſh was ſo cut and mangled in many places<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the
blood tricked apace downe his armour, the great loſſe whereof
cauſed him giue ouer to take breath awhile, when he deſired the

to ſpeake a word or two with her: and ſo well did <hi>Siluian</hi>
handle the matter, that <hi>Dramaciana</hi> came to ſpeake with the
prince <hi>Palmerin,</hi> at her chamber window, which was vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
her Ladies Chamber, and ſo ſhadowed by the Arches of
ſtone towards the Garden, that one might very hardly perceiue
him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> receiued no leſſe contentment, in ſpeaking with
<hi>Dramaciana,</hi> then he would if it had béene to his owne Lady, who
made her Gentlewoman acquainted with all her ſecrete
paſſions: wherevpon he iudging that the houre of his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
could neuer come to paſſe, without the aſſiſtance of his
Damoſell, opened his whole minde vnto her, whereon when
ſhe had ſufficiently ſcanned, very modeſtly ſhe gaue him this
anſwere.</p>
                     <p>You may well thinks (moſt famous and renowned Prince)
that ſhe who is ſo willing (as you perceiue me) to doe you ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
would be loth to hide any thing from you, which might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb facs="tcp:13179:355" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your benefite: and this you may perſwade your ſelfe, that
the dutifull good will I beare you, maketh me ſo hardy at this
time, not knowing whether I ſhal be deceiued, or if you intend
otherwiſe then I make account of. It is not méete my friend
<hi>Dramaciana</hi> (anſwered <hi>Palmerin)</hi> neither doth the time ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
that I ſhould be ſuch a ſhameleſſe perſon, as to render in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turie
for courteſie, neither would I wiſh you to iudge me ſuch
a one: wherefore (ſetting all ſuch doubts aſide) I deſire you to
certefie me, what end (as you thinke) will my long ſeruice come
vnto: for the hope I haue receiued by your meanes, hath euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
ſuſtained me vntill this preſent, from the cruell extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which elſe had beene ſufficient to kill me.</p>
                     <p>He that knowes ſo well (ſaid <hi>Dramaciana)</hi> how to declare
his griefe, ſhall neuer make me beléeue that he can be depriued
of good hape, conſidered alſo, that your noble behauiour cannot
be blemiſhed by fogetfulneſſe. And this you may build vpon,
that the Princeſſe <hi>Polinarda,</hi> hath béene as grieuouſly paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
during the time of your long abſence, as you haue béene
daily tormented with fearefull and diſpleaſant thoughts, as
you ſay you haue ſuffered. If theſe newes (anſwered <hi>Palmerin)</hi>
ought to be ſufficient to content me, that I pray you to waſt no
more time, but acquite your ſelfe of the promiſe it hath pleaſed
you oftentimes to make me: for it is not conuenient that theſe
words (whereby you doe ſo highly pleaſe me) ſhould be changed
into flattery and deceite, which might growe to ſuch a ſeuere
cauſe, as might be both the loſſe of me and my Lady: Well then
<hi>(quoth Dramaciana)</hi> I haue already prouided the place where
you may ſpeake your minde to the Princeſſe my Ladd, which
ſhalbe at a cloſe and ſecret window, whereto you may come, as
you enter the chamber by the Princeſſe <hi>Fleridaes</hi> garden. And
I pray you behaue to your ſelfe in ſuch order, as you ſhall not
neede to ſpeake together againe ſo ſecretly, becauſe the place
and the honor of the Princeſſe cannot agrée together, without
occaſion of your great danger. I may now perfectly behold (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Palmorin)</hi> of what account your good will hath béene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
to me, which when I call to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, it cauſeth me to
abandon all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnhappy occaſions, wherwith I haue bin too long
<pb facs="tcp:13179:355" rendition="simple:additions"/>
acquainted, and enuious deſpite can no more moleſt me, hauing
your fauorable furtherance on my ſide. But when I conſider y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ſwéet contentation I ſhall receiue, hauing the meanes to ſpeak
with my gracious miſtreſſe, I find my ſelfe thrown into many
doubtfull perplexities, in reſpect of my vnworthines &amp; her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
dignity: ſo that I ſhall be abaſhed, and feare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
will withhold me, from diſcourſing my long and ted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
trauailes for her ſake. Certainly ſir <hi>Palmerin</hi> (aunſwered
<hi>Dramaciana)</hi> it were fond you ſhould conceale the Princely
déeds, wherwith ſo many renowmed Potentates haue bin ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted:
for if you haue bene ſo valiant and hardy, as to ſpend
your time hitherto in trauailes of excéeding danger, &amp; yet haue
finiſhed them all worthily, it is néedleſſe you ſhold now diſmay
your ſelf, preſenting your perſon in the place, which is frée from
any hazard or miſfortune, And if you wil tel me, how this feare
&amp; affliction was ſo coupled together, I will tel you what remedy
I can for it, but I would haue you to ſtriue with your ſelfe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all
feare may be out of your mind, when you come to reueale your
ſecret thoughts to my Lady and miſtres. <hi>Palmerin</hi> well noting
the friendly words of <hi>Dramaciana,</hi> made knowne vnto her the
very depth of his amorous afflictions: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight drawing on
a pace, &amp; the talk of the prince (in a maner endles), they brake off
their conference at that time, ſhe ſhewing him the place, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
him the houre to ſpeake with his Lady. <hi>Palmerin</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
leaue of <hi>Dramaciana,</hi> went to his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, where he ſpent
the night in thinking on the talk had paſſed betwéen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
and himſelf: ſo the good hope he had through her means
made his hart not ſo ſorrowfull as it was wont to be, but ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
he behaued himſelfe pleaſantly remembring the heure of
his felicitie drew néere. The time being come, which <hi>Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciana</hi>
had charged him to reſpect, he took his way to the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
place, and paſſing ſo couertly as he could through the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
he entered the princeſſe <hi>Fleridaes</hi> chamber, leauing <hi>Siluian</hi>
without, to giue him knowledge if any came to trouble him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Palmerin</hi> walking vp and downe the chamber alone, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
many cogitations to his preſent attempt, he began to
thinke on the greateſt detriment that might happen to him,
for he knew very well, that he came to Combate amorouſly
<pb facs="tcp:13179:356" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with him, who had the power to depriue him of his wonted
courage, and could driue him to ſo ſtraite a point, as no refuge
he might haue to flie vnto, but her Princely and fauourable
bountie, which if he did not afford him, he could not make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of any conqueſt. Then offering to approach the window,
he eſpyed the Princeſſe coming, whoſe ſight abaſhed him with
ſuch ſudden feare, as he found his voyce too faint to ſpeake, and
the iudgement wherewith he had béene alwayes acquainted,
was now ſo weake and ſimple, as one would haue taken him
rather for a Ghoſt then a liuing man: the which ſhe perceiuing
and greatly pittying, withdrew her ſelfe a little from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
remembring the good counſell that <hi>Dramaciana</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
him. At laſt he ſtepped to the window, which the princeſſe
ſeeing, aduanced her ſelfe to him, when, after a little pauſing, he
entred into theſe ſpeeches.</p>
                     <p>Madame, if this houre of good fortune would allow me the
recompence, to end my long and laborſome trauailes, I ſhould
haue no occaſion to find my ſelfe agréeued, for well I aſſure my

the paines I haue ſuffered, during the time I haue borne the
yoake of loue, to whom I haue alwayes remained faithfull and
ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>dient, in regard of her fauour that brought me to this place,
where I receiue vnſpeakeable content, in requitall of my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
afflictions in trauaile, which I eſteeme of no importance,
in compariſon of the dignity now preſent before mine eyes,
which is of ſo high and honourable authoritie, as I eſtéeme my
fortune to excéede all others. But I could wiſh, that his gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
face of beautie, which is ſo ſplendant to my drouping
thoughts might neuer be ſhadowed with any cloud of miſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
in that my ioy, honour, and felicitie hath euermore bene,
in making eſpeciall account of my excellencie, who I iudge
will pitte to ſée me liue in continuall ſeruitude. And ſince the
extremitie of gréefe hath compelled me to take this bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
on me, I would deſire you to thinke, I come yet with
this regard: as well to auoyde any impeachment that might
happen to blemiſh your renowme, as for the deſire I haue that
<pb facs="tcp:13179:356" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your gratious fauor might end my carefull and continuall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
which you muſt iudge to be great, if you conſider all
things paſt aduiſedly. For ſuch hath bene my dutifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membraunce
of you, as my conceite did imagine any thing
to your honour, I neither forſooke griefe, danger, trouble, or
any miſfortune whatſoeuer, (theſe hauing bene alwaies the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars
of my life) that I might eternize your name for time
of memory, repoſing ſo good hope in your noble ſelfe, that
the eud of my trauailes ſhall agrée with your gentle accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
which I am enforced earneſtly to requeſt. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
my labours haue bene great and gréeuons in your ſeruice,
yet am I not ſo forgetfull of my ſelfe, but I repute this preſent
gratious fauour of your excellencie, to be farre beyond that I
haue done, and the rather, becauſe I know your ſwéete and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable
nature, will not ſeeme altogether left vnrewarded.
Then if it come paſſe, that you make a friendly account of
me, I ſhall finde my ſelfe ſo dutifull towards you, and my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
will be ſo comformable to yours, as looke what liketh you,
will content me, and how you diſpoſe of me, I caunot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
gratefully, ſuch and ſo great is the content I receiue in
the trauailes I haue done for your ſake, as no winde can blaſt
mee, if your bounty ſhaddowe me, nor any feare foyle me, if
your fauour ſtand by me: to which wordes the Princeſſe thus
anſwered.</p>
                     <p>I did not thinke (Sir <hi>Palmerin)</hi> that you would cauſe me
to come into this place, to hold me with theſe friuolous &amp; néede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
words, and I promiſe you but for reaſon, I ſhould thinke
my ſelfe ſo deceiued, as I could hardly withhold my ſelfe from
leauing your company. The firſt is, becauſe you were nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
and brought vp in this Court, being likewiſe my kinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
friend, which hath made me the more willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
your trauailes. The other to ſatiſfie the earneſt intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>Dramaciana,</hi> to whom I perceiue you are a greater
friend then to me: but ſeeing the fault is in mee, I will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
blame mine owne timeritie then you, though you ſéeke to
ſatiſfie your deſire, without any conſideration of my honour,
whereby you let me ſufficiently vnderſtand, what ſmal regard
<pb facs="tcp:13179:357" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you haue of the danger, wherein you may fall ſooner then you
thinke for, only through your vnaduiſedneſſe. I cannot deny,
but I am greatly indebted to you, yet in no ſuch déepe ſumme,
but I can eaſily come forth of it, without any preiudice to my
renowme: for I do not eſtéeme it reaſonable, to recompence
your noble ſeruice with mine owne diſaduantage, becauſe the
good fame and commendation you haue gotten, may content
you, if you haue no other reward. But if your good will be ſo
great towards me, as by your ſpéeches you ſéeme to make it, it
is méet for you to make it known to the Emperor your Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father
and mine, as alſo to the Prince <hi>Primaleon</hi> my Father,
not doubting but they will be very willing to match vs both
together, as for me, I ſhall eſtéeme it the greateſt good fortune
that may happen to me, hauing gained the loue and liking of
you, whoſe proweſſe and Princely deſertes, are worthy moſt
gratious eſtimation. Thus if conſent knit vp the long deſire
of vs both, we may ioyne in one agréement of gladneſſe: and
this I prgy you to accept as my anſwer, for without their good
wils, I neither may nor can accord vnto you.</p>
                     <p>I promiſe you Madame (aunſwered <hi>Palmerin)</hi> it is very
hard for me to receiue contentment in their commending my
déedes, whom I cannot regard or make any account off, and if
I ſhould ſéeme to refuſe to go to the Emperour and the Prince
<hi>Primaleon,</hi> I might be thought very vnwiſe: but firſt I would
be perſwaded thorowly of your good will, which is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
in this action. And if it ſo fall out, that they will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
vpon the words I ſhall vſe to them: yet when I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued
of your acceptation, I ſhall take the boldneſſe on me (ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <p>And albeit my fond timeritie vſed towardes you, may

                        </gap>dacitie
in this cauſe, I would haue you yet this to thinke on me now
that the faithfull affection, wherewith I haue continually ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
you, will compell me enter in this boldneſſe to them, as
tell you. And if they doe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by ſuch laudable recompence as I may receiue at others

handes, it is the regard they haue of my trauailes and aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
daily vſed in the honour of your name, and no other, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
me thinke to deſerue this great fauour. But if your nature
cannot then agrée, when they would be loth I ſhould be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
rewarded, I muſt and will content my ſelfe to obey
your pleaſure, yet ſhall I finde my ſelfe deceiued in the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I haue hitherto conceiued, in that to be depriued of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of his Lady, is the chiefeſt miſfortune that can happen to
a faithfull Louer.</p>
                     <p>What then is left to comfort ſuch a carefull minde? None
but this, that the abſent friend hath this commoditie, to fit and
rip vp many ſad and ſorrowfull diſcourſes, wherewith he may
chaſe away the remembrace of their deceytes, whoſe preſence
was dearer to him then life it ſelfe. But yet ſuch is the cuſtome
of Loue, to mingle among the ſharpeſt conflicts ſome hope: If
it be but onely to ſwéeten their mouthes a little with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
taſte, who waſte their time in ieaſt and dalliance, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his amorous Enſigne. And with this gay foyle, he graceth
his Copper for curant Gold, being the only meane to ſhaddow
his deceitfull dealings: yet a number that ſpend their liues in
his ſeruice, gaine ſuch knowledge of his trumperie, as in the end
they are glad to forſake him. Which I dare not take the
hardineſſe on me to doe, for that I am ſo ſurely bound to him
as when I ſhall leaue him, I deſire to be loued of none but you,
in regard of whoſe good will, I haue thruſt my ſelfe into all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
whatſoeuer returning victor rather by the aide of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable

in my ſelfe: there pauſing, ſhe replied in this manner. I did nor
thinke (Syr <hi>Palmerin)</hi> to receiue any ſuch anſwere for the
words I gaue you, wherefore you make me iudge that they are
of no eſtimation at all with you.</p>
                     <p>But ſince I perceiue that loue hath ſo fondly blinded you,
as he will not ſuffer you to ſée, the more then modeſt readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

a further and greater aſſurance of me: for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would not

<pb facs="tcp:13179:358" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you will not ſéeme to enterpriſe any thing, whereby but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

did, I ſhould thinke very hardly of the diligent ſeruice you haue
done to me all this while.</p>
                     <p>Therefore once againe I humbly intreate you, to ſpeake to
the Emperour, and <hi>Primaleon</hi> my Father, to knowe the eſtate
of their good willes, whereof if you ſhould faile, I giue you
perfect aſſurance of mine: if this anſwere (which truely du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
accounteth but bad obedience to my ſuperiours) wil not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

ſéeme to beare me, is rather to diſgrace, then preſerue my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                     <p>If now ſwéete Madame (anſwered <hi>Palmerin)</hi> I refuſe to

proweſſe of the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> who guarded the
ſhéeld of the <hi>Palme Tree,</hi> in the forreſt of the <hi>Cleere Fountain</hi>
which the Damoſell from the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> brought to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Palmerin,</hi> that he might deliuer it to the Knight his
Nephew, who had woone the honour of the day in the Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament.</p>
                     <p>It was likewiſe his fortune after, when he trauailed to
the Caſtle of the Giant <hi>Almaroll,</hi> to be vanquiſhed there by
the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> who guarded the ſhéeld of the faire <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragarda:</hi>
and returning thence, he met with the Damoſelles
Knight, when, offering to take one of his Ladies from him,
they fell to the Combate, and in the end was likewiſe vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.
The conceit of his ſo many and ſundry foyles, and all
by the Knights of the Emperours Court, cauſed him to deuiſe
by what meanes he might worke ſome iniurie to them that
belonged to the Emperour, in reſpect he was ſo ſeuerely bent
againſt them, as he would take vpon him to reuenge the death
of <hi>Calfurnien</hi> and his brethren.</p>

But to the ende he might the better execute his treacherous
enterpriſe, hée tooke his way to the <hi>Profound Iſle,</hi> thinking
there to inuent ſome treaſon by the aide of <hi>Collambra:</hi> but his
intent was there diſapointed, for it was told him, that ſhe was
brought to the Emperours Court of <hi>Greece.</hi> Then he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to goe viſit the <hi>Perillous Iſle,</hi> being accompanied with
two Knights that were his kinſemen, with whom he knewe
well how to diſſemble the treaſon on his ſtomacke: and <hi>Satra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
thinking them to be of the Emperours Court of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
entertained them very louingly into his Caſtle, where
when they had ſoiourned for certaine daies, they murthered <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trafort</hi>
and all his houſhold.</p>
                     <p>But the pleaſure of this victorie was very ſhort to them, for
<hi>Argentao</hi> the gouernour of the <hi>Profound Iſle,</hi> came by a ſecret
wile ſuddenly on them with his power, and taking <hi>Trofolant</hi>
in the Forreſt, ſent him preſently to the Emperours Court:
where was no little ioy of his comming, in that he ſaued <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
a iourney, who was taking his leaue of his friendes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he would goe to take the Traitors that had done ſuch

                     <p>
                        <hi>Trofolant</hi> was condemned by the lawe, and publiely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
according as his trecherous dealings deſerued: and
<hi>Argentao</hi> was honourably recompenced, that he might haue
the better occaſion to be carefull and circumſpect in his office.
So ſoone as <hi>Trofolant</hi> was put to death, the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Leonarda</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi>
(whoſe beauties defaced greatly the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in all other Countries) began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
very much on the <hi>French</hi> knightes,
that either by the want of courage, or their little regard of loue,
their beauties remained vnknowne in other Realmes, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and Prouinces.</p>
                     <p>Vpon this occaſion they found themſelues ſomewhat agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and to the end they would remedie the cauſe, foure La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the king of <hi>France</hi> his Court (thinking to excell
all other in beauties) enterpriſed to eſtabliſh an aduenture,
to mooue the mindes of many Knights to come endure
their triall, againſt ſuch as would maintaine their beauties.
<pb facs="tcp:13179:360" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The firſt of theſe Ladies was called <hi>Manſia,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanfia,</hi>
the third <hi>Latrania,</hi> and tge fourth <hi>Torſia,</hi> each of them
hauing a Caſtle called after their owne names, to the end that
thoſe knights who deſired to ſée them, ſhould come to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
where they remained.</p>
                     <p>Many and ſundry ſtrange knights trauailed to theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
and ſhewed ſuch rare and incredible proweſſe, that the
renowme of theſe foure Caſtles ſhall neuer be forgotten: as
you may at this day yet behold in <hi>France,</hi> where the Caſtles
of theſe foure Ladies are yet honoured with moſt ſpeciall eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
                     <p>Theſe foure Ladies being couetous of their owne glory,
would know which of them was aduantaged in beautie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the other. <hi>Telanſia</hi> ſerued the Princeſſe <hi>Graciana,</hi> the
ſecond, daughter to <hi>Arnedes</hi> king of <hi>France,</hi> hauing ſuch an
opinion in her ſelfe, as ſhe thought ſhe excéeded all the Ladies
in the world in beautie, <hi>Manſia, Latrania,</hi> and <hi>Torſia,</hi> who ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the Quéene, were forged in the ſame ſtampe with <hi>Telan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia:</hi>
but <hi>Manſia</hi> held her ſelfe of greater reputation then all
the other, becauſe ſhe was higher in the kings fauour.</p>
                     <p>It came ſo to paſſe, that thrée of theſe Ladies were married
ſo ſoone as they beganne this aduenture, which neuertheleſſe,
they would haue continue ſtill, fearing leaſt any other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
ſhould take the preheminence aboue them. <hi>Torſia,</hi> who
remained vnmarried, perſwaded her ſelfe to excéede the other
thrée: in briefe, theſe Ladies were ſo earneſt in their intents,
and ſo willing to ſée the iſſue thereof, as they concluded to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
no knight into their ſeruice, before his fortune ſerued
him to ſée them all, for then afterward he might the better ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himſelfe in obeyſance to her, whom he iudged the cheefeſt
in his affection.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, they ordained that the knight ſhould firſt of all
binde himſelfe, to endure the Combatte againſt foure ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
to any other Ladie, the one after the other: and if hée
proued ſo fortunate as to vanquiſh them, he ſhould then bée
called her Knight, for whom he had fought the combate. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
this knight ſhould not be licenced to goe ſéeke aduentures
<pb facs="tcp:13179:361" rendition="simple:additions"/>
afterward in any ſtrange Countrey, becauſe his Lady remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the victoreſſe, carrying the true title of ſupreame beautie.
Theſe foure Ladies were agréed to eſtabliſh this aduenture,
in the ſame manner I haue told you, that their beauty might
purchaſe like commendation as the princeſſe <hi>Miragardaes</hi> did,
by the noble triall of her ſhield, which was kept at the Caſtle
of <hi>Almaroll.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> his Sonnes (who were accounted the
moſt puiſſant at Armes in all that realme) becauſe their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were placed elſe where, made no account of this aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
neither <hi>Germaine</hi> of <hi>Orleance,</hi> becauſe his minde was
likewiſe at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The other <hi>French</hi> knights remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
doubtfull to proue this aduenture, remembring with what
conditions theſe Ladies would be ſerued. As for them that
were ſo hardy to venture, they hauing ſeene the beautie of the
firſt, were ſo caught captiue, that they promiſed to endure the
hardeſt perill in obtaining her loue. But when they had ſéene
the ſecond Lady, they preſently committed the firſt to forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,
making the ſame promiſe, that they would looſe them
ſelues to purchaſe her: then looking on the third, their wittes
were ſo buſied, and their thoughts were ſo laboured, as then
none but ſhe was faire in their iudgements. At length, when
they came to ſee the fourth ſwéete and delicate face, all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thrée were counterfeit in reſpect of her, and they ſerued
but as foyles to ſet her beauties out to ſale: ſo that from the firſt
to the laſt, their opinions were ſo variable, and their mindes ſo
rauiſhed in contemplating them all, as not forcing what might
happen to them, either trouble, miſerie, daunger, or death it
ſelfe, they threwe themſelues into the face of Fortune. And
many Knightes that had béene vanquiſhed by his proweſſe,
who defended ſo nobly the Shield of <hi>Miragarda,</hi> did yet aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
boldly to trie this enterpriſe: but they could not vanquiſh
the foure Knights theſe Ladies preſented them, who tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them to be the ſeruants of any Lady, ſo that this aduenture
continued a long time, before that any of theſe Ladies could
vaunt of the conqueſt.</p>
                     <p>And I aſſure you, the renowne of this famous enterpriſe,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:361" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was ſo blazed abroad in all places, as the Knights trauailed to
this place early, and laboured very earneſtly to deſerue the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of theſe foure Ladies.</p>
                     <p>The Prince <hi>Floraman</hi> of <hi>Sardignia</hi> trauailing through the
Realme of <hi>France,</hi> intending to goe offer his aide to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> met with a damoſel, as he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Forreſt, ſhe hauing in her company two other Damoſels,
and becauſe ſhe was deſirous, that the Prince of <hi>Sardignia,</hi>
ſhould behold her beautie, ſhe tooke off her maſke, and gaue it
to one of the Damoſelles. <hi>Floroman</hi> who trauailed continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
mourning in his ſpirit, for the loſſe of faire <hi>Altea,</hi> his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
paſſed on giuing them no ſalutation: which when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
one of them followed him, and ſpake vnto him in this
manner.</p>
                     <p>I would know (ſir knight) what you meane, to paſſe ſo by
theſe Ladies, offering no ſigne of courteſie or ſalutation? per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
you did not ſée my Lady as you paſſed by, which may at
this time well ſerue to excuſe you. And becauſe your ſadneſſe
maketh my Lady to think, that your heart is paſſioned or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by ſome occaſion, ſhe deſireth you to take your lodging <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this night: in one of her Caſtles not far hence, where ſhe will
not faile to entertaine you, in the moſt gratious manner ſhée
can deuiſe: to which words the Prince <hi>Floraman</hi> thus anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Faire Damoſell, if I haue bin any thing forgetfull towards
your Lady, I humbly deſire her to pardon me: for ſhe may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
her ſelfe, that not ſeeing her, I paſſed by, without vſing
any courteſie, rather then by any other occaſion.</p>
                     <p>So turning his horſe, he ridde with the Damoſell after her
Lady, who was entred into her Caſtle, before <hi>Floraman</hi> had
the power to ouertake her, whereat he was greatly agréeued:
and comming to the Damoſell that brought him thither, he
preſently entred into theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>I pray you (faire Gentlewoman) tell mée the name
of this Caſtle, which in my iudgement ſéemeth one of the
fayreſt that I haue ſeene in all my li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

what Lady was that, which entered in ere I could ſhew her
my dutie?</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:362" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Caſtle (anſwered the Damoſell) is farre more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
within, then this ſumptuous building which you ſée with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and I aſſure you, the knight hath good occaſion to reioyce,
that can paſſe by here without ſome aduenture happen to him.
But becauſe you may account my words of truth, and that it is
impoſſible for you to depart hence without triall of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe,
I eſpie thrée knights vnder the gréene trées on your left
hand, who will not preſume ſo néere this Caſtle, but they haue
ſome further meaning. As for the Caſtle, it is called the Caſtle
of <hi>Latrinia,</hi> which is the Ladies name whom you ſaw to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
on whoſe behalfe many knights put themſelues in danger,

                        </gap>end thrée other Ladyes of the <hi>French</hi>
Court, onely being in contention for their beauttie. But to the
end you may giue the ſounder iudgement in this caſe, and be
the more earneſt in trying the Combate, on the behalfe of the
beautie of my Ladie <hi>Latriana,</hi> I will worke the meanes that
you ſhall ſée her: and if it come to paſſe that you be afterward
vanquiſhed, you may the better know, whether it be by your
owne imbecilitie, or the imperfection of her beautie for whom
you enter the Combate: <hi>Floraman</hi> returned her this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</p>
                     <p>I haue bene alwayes ſo vnfortunate (faire Damoſell) in
maintaining the like enterpriſes, that I will not now make it
daintie inhazarding the inconſtance of flattering Fortune. I
haue often heard of Madame <hi>Latrinia,</hi> and I take her to be
one of the foure Ladies of this Realme, who excéede all the
other in ſoueraigntie of beautie: I could wiſh (i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

gratious ſeruice, but the greater part who are giuen on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, maketh me to be doubtfull herein, according as it is
permitted to the fréedome of a mans will.</p>
                     <p>As the Damoſell and <hi>Floraman</hi> continued this talke, they
came before the Caſtle, an as they offred to paſſe on, theſe thrée
knights ſtepped before them, vſing theſe words to the Prince
<hi>Floraman.</hi> We would know Sir knight, if you be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to imploy your ſelfe on the behalfe of any of the foure
<hi>French</hi> Ladies, becauſe that each of vs, being no ſeruant to
<pb facs="tcp:13179:362" rendition="simple:additions"/>
her whoſe cauſe you maintaine, ſhall then be conſtrained to
enter the Combate with you. Sir (anſwered <hi>Floraman)</hi> I
may not lawfully refuſe the Combate, becauſe I haue not ſéene
any of theſe foure Ladies: one of the thrée Knights replied to
him againe thus.</p>
                     <p>If it be ſo Sir, that as yet you haue not ſéene theſe Ladies,
you ſhall be ſuffered to enter the Caſtle, where you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
the beauty of <hi>Latrania:</hi> and if it chaunce you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
affectionate to her, as many other haue done before you,
we deſire you not to enter her ſeruice, becauſe you may ſo ſhun
the danger of the Combate. The Knight laying his hand vpon
one of his companions, ſpake thus to <hi>Floraman.</hi> Her whom
I hold my honour by, they that haue the ſight of them all foure,
would chuſe my Lady <hi>Manſia</hi> for his Miſtreſſe: then another
of them ſaide. And my ſelfe with this Knight, wee are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
addicted to the ſeruice of <hi>Telanſia,</hi> and for this cauſe
we abide in this place, to ſée if any Knight that holdeth on the
other part, dare be ſo bold as to come into this place, that wée
may try our fortunes, in gaining the recompence the Ladies
haue ordained for him, who ſhall be ſo happy as to remaine
victor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Floraman</hi> (who was greatly enflamed towards theſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
remembring ſtill the loſſe of his fuire <hi>Altea)</hi> entred the
caſtle, where <hi>Latrania</hi> receiued him very gratiouſly, he excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
himſelfe towards her, becauſe he did not his dutie to her
as ſhe paſſed by him in the Forreſt: and I aſſure you, <hi>Flora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
iudged the Lady of the Caſtle ſo faire, as hee could wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
haue offered himſelfe to ſuſtaine her quarrell, but that

                     </p>
                     <p>There he ſtayed in the Caſtle till the morning, when hée
would haue departed thence, the Lady vnwilling to ſee him,
ſhe was ſo much offended that he had not offered to maintaine
her beautie. Vpon this, <hi>Floraman</hi> went foorth to the thrée
Knights, when one of them came vnto him, and demanded if
the beauty of Madame <hi>Latrania,</hi> had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:363" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Certainly, ſaid the Knight, I greatly deſire to deale with
thée, that I may giue due correction to thy proud ingratitude.
Gentlemen (anſwere <hi>Floraman)</hi> I pray you put your ſelues
in a readines, to reuenge the ſhame, which you ſay I haue done
to Madame <hi>Latrania,</hi> whom I may as well ſerue as you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I haue better knowledge of her deſerts then you haue: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe,
ſuch is my humor at this preſent, as I dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
my ſelfe on her behalfe.</p>
                     <p>Then I entend (ſaide the Knight) to make you knowe the
offence you haue done vnto her. And ſo he gaue his horſe the
ſpurres againſt <hi>Floraman,</hi> who (albeit in the Iouſt he loſt one
of his Stirroppes) encountred the Knight ſo valiantly, as hee
ſent him to the ground headlong, ſo aſtoniſhed, as he could not
tell where he was. Which the other two perceiuing, they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him likewiſe to runne with them: Since my Lance is yet
whole and ſound (anſwered <hi>Floraman)</hi> I am content to doe
you ſo much fauour. Then he ran againſt the ſecond Knight,
ſeruing him like as he had done the firſt, and the third came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to kéepe them company.</p>
                     <p>The firſt knight being offended that hee was ſo vnhorſed,
deſired <hi>Floraman</hi> to ſtrike halfe a dozen blowes with him, to
the end he might amend the foile he receiued in the Iouſt. The
Prince of <hi>Sardignia</hi> ſéeing no excuſe would perſwade the
knight, alighted from his horſe, and hauing drawn his ſword, he
dealt ſo nobly with him, as in ſhort time he perceiued what
great diſhonr he gained, in prouing his valour againſt him: for
he continued ſo roughly in the fight, as the knight was compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to ſtep aſide to take a breathing, which made <hi>Floraman</hi>
giue him theſe words.</p>
                     <p>I beléeue ſir knight, you iudge me as ſufficient to ſerue <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trania</hi>
as your ſelfe is. No truely (ſaide the Knight) for it is
not your force, but the beautie of the other, to whom ſhe may
no way equall her ſelfe, that hath brought me into this daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
eſtate. I am very well content (anſwered <hi>Floraman)</hi>
to heare you ſay ſo much, but the greater aduantage ſhould I
haue, if your Lady were preſent to heare you: and I aſſure
you, ſhe hath good occaſion to accept well of you, for that you

                     <p>Then beginning afreſh againe, the Knight (though very
faintly) defended himſelfe ſo well as he could. <hi>Latrania</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in one of the windowes of the Caſtle, ſeeing the great
daunger whereinto the Knight was brought, came downe to
the place where they fought the Combate: and being come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Prince <hi>Floraman,</hi> ſhe deſired him to ſaue the Knightes
life, whereto (at her requeſt) he willingly conſented, ſpeaking
to her in this manner.</p>
                     <p>I would gladly to honour you the more, end the Combate,
but becauſe you thinke it not ſo conuenient, the Knight may
thinke himſelfe highly beholding to you, for that you haue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
his life, which I was thorowly intended hee ſhould looſe,
ſéeing the ſmall regard he made of you, as your ſelfe did heare,
when I let him reſt himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Latrania</hi> gaue him very honourable thanks, and returning
into her Caſtle, ſhe grieued excéedingly, that this good and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

                     <p>
                        <hi>Floraman</hi> willed the Knight to tell him his name. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
you (anſwered the Knight) I entend nothing leſſe, for our
Combate was hindred by the Lady, to whom you haue giuen
greater aduantage thereof then to me. Thou haſt reaſon (ſaid
<hi>Floraman)</hi> to vſe thy ſelfe thus, for that one ought not to be
knowne in theſe affaires, eſpecially, hauing receiued his ſhame
in the preſence of one of theſe Ladies. So, taking his leaue of
the other Knights, he rid away preſently, they being very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

who loued <hi>Manſia,</hi> and the Countie <hi>Brialte,</hi> the affectionate

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pomdides</hi> and <hi>Blandidon</hi> came no ſooner into the Parke,
but they entred both together, becauſe <hi>Torſia</hi> had not declared
which of them ſhould enter firſt, to maintaine her beautie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the other Knights: therefore they deſired the Quéene,
that it might pleaſe her to vnderſtand the will of <hi>Torſia,</hi> who
ordained that he which was firſt diſcloſed to his companion,
ſhould enter firſt into the field. Then <hi>Blandidon</hi> (who was
diſcouered at the beginning to <hi>Pompides)</hi> had the meane to
trie himſelfe firſt: wherefore, without any more tarying, he
entred the middeſt of the field, at the entrance whereof, the
Ladies were placed very ſtately. <hi>Florenda</hi> and <hi>Graciana</hi> ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
themſelues maruellous rich in beautie: but they were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
pleaſant, becauſe neuer a knight would eſtéeme of them
in his proweſſe. <hi>Brician</hi> of <hi>Rochfort,</hi> who prepared himſelfe

he iudged worthy of the chiefeſt victorie (ſpake ſomewhat an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angrily

                     <p>Faire miſtres, I may thinke this enterpriſe not worthy to be

preſented before you: yet ſomewhat doe I content my ſelfe,
who remaining victor, you will not diſdaine to call me your
ſeruant: <hi>Blandidon</hi> who earneſtly deſired to witneſſe his

                     <p>I doe not demand (Madome) any fauour at your hands for
receiuing now ſuch a benefit of you, I ſhall not purchaſe any
glory in conquering my enemy. Then ran he couragiouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Brician</hi> of <hi>Rochfort,</hi> and encounted with him ſo braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as their Launces flew vp in pieces, yet neither of them in
danger to be vnhorſed: which <hi>Brician</hi> perceiuig (who was
reputed for a good Knight at armes, hée deſired <hi>Blandidon</hi> to
breake once more with him, to which requeſt he made no refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall,
but ran the ſecond time, and met <hi>Brician</hi> with ſuch force,
as he was conſtrained to forſake his ſtirrops, &amp; caſt his armes
about the necke of his horſe, to ſaue himſelfe from falling to
the ground, and <hi>Blandidon</hi> was caſt on the croupper of his
horſe. After theſe two knights had taken their ſeates againe,
they prepared themſelues with the third Staffe, which was
diſcharged by <hi>Brician</hi> ſo ſtrongly, as his horſe and himſelfe
tumbled on the ground and <hi>Blandidon</hi> was in danger to haue
borne him company. But he ſéeing his enemy had drawne his
ſword, alighted from his horſe to receiue him: and I aſſure you
their Combate was eſtéemed one of the moſt dangerous that
euer was ſéene in that Countrey.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Brician</hi> of <hi>Rochfort,</hi> deſirous that his miſtreſſe <hi>Manſia</hi> ſhold
perceiue how willing he was to purchaſe her loue, and <hi>Blandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
vanquiſhed with the beauty of her, who cauſed him to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
ſo great danger: redoubled their ſtrokes ſo fiercely vpon
one another, as at length <hi>Brician,</hi> ſore weakened in fight, and
depriued of the beauty of his Lady, fell downe to the ground.
<hi>Blandidon</hi> preſently tooke off his Helet, and made offer to
part his head from his ſhoulders, except he would confeſſe <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi>
to excell the other three in beauty: but while <hi>Brician</hi> lay in
this extremity, one of the Maidens of honour cried to <hi>Blandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
that the Ladies adiudged him the victory euer <hi>Brician</hi> of
<hi>Rochfort,</hi> who was caried to his lodging, &amp; <hi>Blandidon</hi> hauing
<pb facs="tcp:13179:366" rendition="simple:additions"/>
loſt very much blood by the wounds he receiued, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to withdraw himſelfe, hauing not the power to endure
what he had attempted. For he that ſhould remaine victor,
ought to maintaine the combat for the ſpace of one day, againſt
the other knight that came, and the vanquiſher (if they were
ſo fortunate) they ſhould be bound (being in any likely diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
to beginne the Combate afreſh againſt the other three
Knights whom he ſhould ſubdue, before he might haue the
praiſe of the victorie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Pompides</hi> being ſorry to ſée <hi>Blandidon</hi> ſo wounded, was
(neuertheleſſe) glad, that the honour of the day happened to his
ſide, and vpon this he perſwaded himſelfe, that the Ladies ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
would fall to his ſhare. The next day following, he fayled
not to preſent himſelfe in the field, where he had not long
ſtayed, before <hi>Rupert Raſſelin</hi> entered, being in blacke armour
croſſe ſtrickt with little fillets of Gold, and his Shield (which
was of the <hi>Indian</hi> colour) the God was figured, who brought
all other vnder his obeyſance. This knight was mounted on
a goodly roane Courſer, and ſo ſoone as he heheld <hi>Telanſia,</hi> who
was very faire, and of whom he was greatly affectionate, he
ſpake to himſelfe in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Who is hee that either can or may iniurie mée, hauing your
ſéemely ſelfe before me? Therefore I pray you good Madame,
that you would vouchſafe to accept his loyal heart, who wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
reefuſe to doo you ſeruice, eſpecially, if he may know in what
to pleaſure you: and perſwade your ſelfe, that I will ſoone diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance
this Knight, who maintained the beautie of <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi>
to excell yours. <hi>Pompides</hi> knowing well by the behauiour
of <hi>Rupert Roſſelin,</hi> the little content this poore Louer receyued
beholding the beautie of <hi>Telanſia:</hi> but he was ſomewhat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
that <hi>Torſia</hi> was not as yet come to the place where
the combate ſhould be fought, and being paſſioned for this
cauſe, he ſpake to <hi>Roſſelin</hi> in this order</p>
                     <p>Thou muſt remember knight, that thou art not come hither
to waſte the time in conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plating of her beautie, who tranſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
thée from all ſenſe and reaſon. I perceiue well (anſwered
<hi>Roſſelin)</hi> that <hi>Torſia</hi> repoſeth but little hope in your valour,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:367" rendition="simple:additions"/>
becauſe ſhe diſdaineth to honour you with his preſence. You
are ſo full of words (ſaid <hi>Pompides)</hi> that if I ſhould ſpend the
time in giuing eare to you, the day would ſoone be gone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
trying either the Iouſt or combate. So, without any more
words, he ran againſt <hi>Roſſelin,</hi> encountring him in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of the carrire, ſo worthily, and very hardly he recouered
himſelfe from falling, <hi>Pompides</hi> being nothing at all mooued.
<hi>Roſſelin</hi> tooke a new ſtaffe, wherewith he tryed his Fortune
the ſecond time, when, <hi>Pompides</hi> méeting him directly, brake
his ſtaffe nobly on him, and comming together, their Horſes
fought ſo one with another, as <hi>Pompides</hi> Horſe (which was
not of ſuch ſtrength as the other) fel down in vnder his maſter:
which <hi>Roſſelin</hi> perceiuing, aduanced himſelfe to him, but he
had recouered himſelfe, and ſtood ready to receiue him at the
point of the ſword. Then they buckled together, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
was ſo cruell betwéen them, as in ſhort time the fleſh was
ſéene through <hi>Roſſelins</hi> armour: but he made ſemblance as
though he were nothing moued, becauſe he would not haue
his Ladies make any doubt of his proweſſe, and ſo earneſtly
he followed his intent, that <hi>Pompides</hi> had as ſmall aduantage
as himſelfe. Neuertheleſſe, his heart was more liuely, and
himſelfe more nimble and quicke then <hi>Roſſolin,</hi> who had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
ſo many ſharpe ſtrokes, and was ſo weake and wearie,
as he was enforced to intreate <hi>Pompides</hi> to let him take a
little reſt, I am content (anſwered <hi>Pompides)</hi> to let you pauſe
a while, to the end you may the better trauaile your ſelfe, in
beholding the beautie of <hi>Telanſia:</hi> conſidered alſo, the ſmall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
that <hi>Torſia</hi> beſtowes on me, cannot hinder me from van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing
of you. It is moreouer ſéene (ſaid <hi>Roſſelin)</hi> that it
is great danger to fight againſt men depriued of hope, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
one remaineth conqueror ouer ſuch perſons, the honour of the
victory giueth them the larger contentment. When he had
ſpoken what pleaſed him, <hi>Pompides</hi> and he beganne to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
againe, hacking and hewing one another ſo cruelly, as
within a while <hi>Roſſelin</hi> was ſo ſore laboured, as he was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vnable to harme his enemy. <hi>Pompides</hi> ſeeing himſelfe
in but little better eſtate then <hi>Roſſelin,</hi> and doubting leaſt the
<pb facs="tcp:13179:367" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Combate would endure too long, he caught him in his armes,
and threw him violently againſt the ground, being hardly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſuſtaine himſelfe from falling on him: but the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of the victory made him take the more courage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
he made proffer to cut off the head of <hi>Roſſelin,</hi> which the
Ladies would not agrée vnto. Then was <hi>Roſſelin</hi> caried foorth
of the fielde very dangerouſly wounded, and <hi>Pompides</hi> (for the
greater honour) was conducted to the Chamber where <hi>Blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didon</hi>
lay, where Chirugions looked dillingently to their
wounds, they being now as great friendes as euer they were,
hauing the one of them as good aſſurance of <hi>Torſiaes</hi> fauour, as
the other.</p>
                     <p>The King himſelfe came very louingly to viſite them, and
after he had knowledge of them, he was greatly offended that
they had not béene knowne before him in his Court: but the
Knights excuſed themſelues by their Ladies, whoſe beauties
cauſed them to trauaile thither, alwayes deſiring to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne:
The Queene was very carefull to haue them well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
during the time they remained there in the Court: but
after they were in good ſtate of health, they humbly tooke their
leaue of the King, the Queene, and Madame <hi>Torſia, Blandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
taking his way to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and <hi>Pompides</hi> into
<hi>Scotland,</hi> where he eſpouſed the Princeſſe <hi>Armiſia,</hi> according
as I haue declared already to you. For you ſhall vnderſtand
that this <hi>French</hi> aduenture continued, from the time that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayzar</hi>

                     <p>When he had ſo ſaid, he eſpied néere him an ancient Knight,
of whom he requeſted to know, what honourable perſonages
they were that recreated themſelues in that place: Sir (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered

to ſollace her ſelfe with the King, hée being ſomewhat
higher in the Forreſt with his Courtly attendants, hunting
the wilde Hart. I pray you then tell me (quoth the Knight

                     <p>I ſée well (quoth the knight of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi> that I muſt

not be knowne, he commanded the Eſquire to couer his ſhield
with ſomewhat, and in the meane while he ranne his horſe vp

Shield was couered, he rode on toward the Tetes: but when
the Ladies ſaw him come, and a Damoſell of ſuch a ſtreat ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

the <hi>Sauage man</hi> had no ſooner beheld them, but not willing to

the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi> to let mee knowe
the conditions which theſe Knightes obſerue in garding this

one of thoſe Knights, who caries their Armor rather to make
a ſhowe, then to hazard your perſon in any doubtfull aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
neuertheleſſe, I will let you vnderſtand the cuſtome v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in this place. It is ſo Syr, that the Queene of <hi>Fraunce,</hi>
(who is within theſe Tentes) hath foure Ladies in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:369" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who are reputed to excell all others in Beauty, and they
are deſtrous to know, which of them may beſt make claime of
this Title aboue the other thrée. For the tryall heereof they
haue ordained, that the Knight, who will ieopard himſelfe in the
Aduenture, ſhall take a viewe of them one after another, and
hauing made his choyſe of one of theſe foure, he muſt enter the
Combate with the thrée Knights, who are ſeruants to the other
Ladyes: if ſo be his Fortune be ſo good to conquere them, hee
ſhall be called her Knight, on whoſe behalfe he entred the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate:
which honor (I tell you) is highly eſtéemed in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
becauſe each of the ladies deſerue moſt eſpeciall preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
Now Syr, if your ſtomacke be ſo good, you may haue libertie to
ſee them, and they will not diſdain to behold the proweſſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
you are accompanyed. I promiſe you Damoſell (ſaid the
knight of the <hi>Sauadge-man)</hi> I would not hazard my perſon for
theſe 4. onely, but as well for all the reſt that are in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Quéenes
companie: Marry firſt I will goe doo my dutie to her Maieſty,
and after I haue ſéene the Ladyes, I will ſo behaue my ſelfe, as
I doubt not but to be well eſtéemed of all before I depart. Then
hée alighted from his Horſe, and ſhewed himſelfe ſo reuerent to
the Quéene, and her Ladyes, as they remained greatly conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
Then the Damoſell ſhewed him the foure Ladies, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had well viewed them all, ſhee deſired him to tell her his
minde. The Knight of the <hi>Sauadge man</hi> caſting his eyes firſt
on <hi>Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſia,</hi> her Beautie ſo well contented him, as he thought to
reſt there, but the Decrée of the Aduenture commaunded him to
paſſe further, and looke on <hi>Telanſia,</hi> whoſe preſence did ſo abaſh
him, that he knew not to which of thoſe twaine be ſhuld ſubmit
himſelfe. When <hi>Latrania</hi> came before him, his affection did
ſo iuggle with his iudgement, as he could not tell well what to
ſay, yet were th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her beautie ſo enflamed him in euery vaine, that he gaue her the
title of Beauty aboue them all. But hee had ſuch ſlender ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
in his Loue, as looke how forgetfull he was of them, one
after another, euen ſo he failed not to be the like in iudgement:
ſo, hauing bene a long while ere hee made his anſwere, at laſt
he ſpake to the Damoſell in this manner.</p>

Faire Damoſell, you haue brought mee into ſo great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie,
as I am almoſt willing to forſake an aduenture ſo
dangerous: neuertheleſſe, I am content to enter the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
for the honour of <hi>Manſia,</hi> and if Fortune fauour me with
the victory, I will attend other thrée on the behalfe of <hi>Telanſia,</hi>
with whoſe fauour I will enterpriſe with three more, for <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trania:</hi>
then turning to <hi>Torſia,</hi> he ſaid.</p>
                     <p>And if I eſcape the danger for all theſe on your iuſt quarrell
I will approoue my ſelfe, not onely againſt thrée, but againſt all
that dare come againſt me, to let you vnderſtand, what little
account I make of my life, being thus honoured, to imploy my
ſelfe in your ſeruice.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Ladies were greatly abaſhed, hearing the braue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> had made, and ſuch bruite
was preſently ſpread here of abroade, as the king left the Chaſe,
and returned to the Tents, where the Ladies rehearſed to him
the intent of the knight. <hi>Arnodes,</hi> who was a very wiſe and
diſcrete Prince, knowing the enterpriſe to be very dangerous,
laboured to haue him performe the promiſe he had made to the
Ladies.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> made his humble reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the king, afterward he mounted on horſebacke, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thus againe to the Damoſell that brought him thither.
If theſe foure Ladies be contented that I ſhall ſerue them, I
will let them ſée, how willingly I will venture my life for
their ſakes, but ſince you haue tolde the recompence for him,
that ſhall be ſo happy to ende the aduenture, I will not paſſe
any further before I declare to you, with what condition I
will enter the Combate againſt their ſeruants, which is, that
they ſhall grant me but one gift, if ſo be the victory happen on
my ſide.</p>
                     <p>And to the end you ſhall not bee ignorant of my intent,
I will take the paines to diſcourſe it to you. You ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that I am determined to guard the paſſage in this
Valley, againſt all knights that dare preſume to paſſe by,
during the ſpace of eight dayes, and if Fortune allowe me fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable
countenance in the victorie againſt their Knighes,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:370" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that none of the Ladies ſhall depart hence, but if my miſhappe
chance otherwiſe, they may depart at their owne pleaſure:
<hi>Latrania</hi> vpon this, ſpake thns to the other Ladyes.</p>
                     <p>This Knight (me thinkes) is deſirous to deale as the knight
of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> did, who not long ſince conducted nine La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
in his company through the Realme of <hi>Spalne.</hi> By my
faith (ſaid <hi>Telanſia)</hi> we ought to grant what he demaundeth,
becauſe we ſhall haue the better knowledge of his valour. I
am content (anſwered <hi>Manſia)</hi> vpon this condition, that he
bring vs to the Caſtle of <hi>Almaroll,</hi> and enter the Combate
with him that kéepes the princeſſe <hi>Miragardaes</hi> Shield, on the

                     <p>Truely it contenteth me very much (anſwered the Knight
of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi> that you know my minde ſo well, but me

and conquered the Knight that k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>pt her Shielde? Surely La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
(anſwered the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man)</hi> I haue ſeene
<hi>Miragarda,</hi> and Combated againſt the Knight that kept her
Shield, but I was not ſo fortunate in power, as to ouercome
him. How then (ſaide the Damoſell) dare you take the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
vpon you, to make ſuch a large promiſe to theſe Ladies,
that you would not faile to vanquiſh their Knights, and could
not preuaile againſt that one knight? Marcy (quoth he) for that
the preſence of theſe Ladies, and the affection I beare them,
ſhall be ſufficient for me to enter the Combate, and conquer
all the Knights that dare meddle with me. I ſee well (ſaide the
Damoſell) your loue is too full of incertaintie: then turning to
the Ladies, ſhe ſaid, they might well agrée to his requeſt, and for
the great deſire ſhe had to ſee the knight of the <hi>Sauage mans</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour,
ſhe deſired the king to giue his conſent.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Manſia</hi> was ſo highly fauoured of the King <hi>Arnedes,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:13179:370" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he, beſide, ſo willing to ſée the paſtime, gaue them all franke
and frée licence: whereupon the foure Ladyes graunted him
to kéepe the paſſage, and they would accompany him during the
eight dayes: then came the Damoſell to the knight of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
man,</hi> with theſe words. I haue ſo much preuailed, Sir
knight, as theſe foure Ladies haue giuen conſent fo your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt:
wherefore, I greatly deſire to ſee, if your déeds will proue
conformable to your braue words.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> hearing what the Damoſell
ſaid, came <hi>Arlencea,</hi> deſiring her not to reueale who he was,
and comming backe againe, he ſet downe his order thus. The
firſt Iouſt, quoth he, ſhall be for <hi>Manſia:</hi> the ſecond for <hi>Telan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia:</hi>
the third for <hi>Latrania:</hi> and the fourth ſhall be for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Torſia.</hi> I perceiue then, ſaid the king <hi>Arnedes,</hi> the
knight is willing to accompliſh his promiſe. Then the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<hi>Girarde,</hi> deſirous to make knowne the good will he bare
<hi>Telanſia,</hi> would néeds take the field firſt, and encountring the
knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> he met him with ſuch force, as he
was ſent to the earth with his héeles vpward, ſo farre out of
remembrance with himſelfe, as he was faine to be caried forth
of the field: at which ſight the king was maruellouſly aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
in that the Countie <hi>Gerard</hi> was reputed on of the beſt
Knights of his Court. <hi>Manſia</hi> beganne to thinke, that in her
name all the thrée knights ſhould be vanquiſhed, and the honor
of the day ſhould be adiudged to her, becauſe the Prince would
be ſo ouerlaboured, as he could not haue the power to vanquiſh
the other thrée knights that came after.</p>
                     <p>The Countie <hi>Gerard</hi> was no ſooner carried out of the field,
but <hi>Brialte</hi> the ſeruant of <hi>Latrania,</hi> gaue his horſe the ſpurres,
and burſt his Launce brauely one the Prince, but he gaue him
ſuch a friendly welcome, as he was conſtrained to fall to the
ground, with one of his armes broken, whereupon, he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
forth of the field to the Countie of <hi>Gerard. Manſia</hi> was ſo
glad of this, as ſhe could not hide it, but they that ſate againſt
her did eaſily perceiue her ſecret reioycing: but the King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedes</hi>
ſeeing the dangerous hurt <hi>Brialte</hi> had receiued, beganne
to doubt, that the ſtraunge knight would iniurie all the other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:371" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Then <hi>Aliart</hi> of <hi>Normandie</hi> (being ſeruant to <hi>Torſia)</hi> ran and
brake his Lance gallantly on the ſtrange knights Shield, but
he was ſent to keepe his fellow company: whereas he was ſo
offended, as he ſtarted vp againe preſently, and drawing his
ſword, came marching to his enemy, who fearing leaſt the
knight would haue ſlaine his horſe, lept beſide him, caſting his
eyes vpon <hi>Torſia,</hi> making ſhow that he was very ſorie for the
foile the knight had receiued vnder her name. But yet to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
himſelfe of his promiſe, he charged <hi>Aliart</hi> ſo roughly, as in
ſhort time he tumbled at his feet, yet would not he offer to take
his life from him: when the Damoſell came to him, granting
him the victory for the thrée dayes.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorie (ſaide the ſtrange Knight) that you ſhould take
ſuch paines Lady. I ſée well (anſwered the Damoſell) that you
witneſſe in your déedes, what you promiſed in words at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.
The knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> (who counted himſelfe
to be called the ſtrange knight) mounted on his horſe againe,
and taking a Launce, he came to the place where the Ladies
ſate, entring into theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>You ſée me now ready Ladies, to enter the Field vnder the
name of Madame <hi>Telanſia,</hi> whoſe beautie is ſufficient to make
me remaine victor ouer all the Knightes that dare ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
her: and you Lady <hi>Manſia,</hi> doe not you forget what you
haue promiſed mee, ſince you ſée me willing to diſcharge the
bond wherein I haue tyed my ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The king <hi>Arnedes,</hi> well noting the valour of the ſtrange
knight, deuiſed how he might haue knowledge of him: for he
did not thinke him to bee one of the Prince <hi>Don Edwardes</hi>
Sonnes, becauſe then he iudged, he would not haue concealed
himſelfe from the Quéene: beſide, he was aduertiſed, that <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
of <hi>England</hi> had giuen ouer following ſuch aduentures,
and that the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> was in the realme of
<hi>Spaine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>While he was thus imagining who this ſtraunge knight
ſhould be, <hi>Brian</hi> of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> ſeruant to <hi>Manſia,</hi> came into
the field, very gallantly armed, and bearing for his deuiſe
in his ſhield, <hi>Hope</hi> crowned with a garland of flowers, in a

Field of Azure: he pauſing a little, and looking ſtedfaſtly on
his Lady <hi>Manſia,</hi> parled to himſelfe in this manner. I pray
you Madame, not to make any doubt of the great proweſſe
of this ſtrange knight, in that he could not faile of the victory,
maintaining your ſingular and heauenly beautie, but now that
he preſumeth to change you for another, I doubt not to make
him looſe, what he ſéekes ſo gladly to purchaſe, ſo that the victory
ſhall be adiudged onely to you, and he that hath the power to
winne it, will remaine yours in dutie while he liueth: the
ſtrange knight came to him with theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>Haue you done ſir knight your ſecret fancies? I perceiue you

be: ſo couching his Lance, add giuing a ſigne to the ſtrange
Knight, they ranne together couragiouſly, and brake their
Lances with ſuch force, as <hi>Brian</hi> of <hi>Burgundie</hi> was vnhorſed,
and very ſors hurt, yet would he haue diſſembled it, and entred
the combat with the ſword, but the foure Ladies were ſo afraid
that the ſtrange knight would haue ſlaine him, as they cauſed
him to procéede no further.</p>
                     <p>The king was very much diſpleaſed, ſéeing the knights of
his court ſo handled, yet were they themſelues willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the Iouſt: whereupon <hi>Monſier</hi> of <hi>Artois</hi> ſeruant to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trania,</hi>
(who would not waſt the time in néedleſſe words) cald
to the ſtrange knight to defend himſelfe. I would iudge, ſayd
the ſtrange knight, that the beautie of your Lady ſhould cauſe
you to regard her ſomewhat: but ſince I ſée you repoſe more
aſſurance in your owne ſtrength, then her beautie, whereby
you might enioy moſt hope, come on and welcome. Then ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their lances in their reſts, they encountred together braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and albeit they failed for to breake their ſtaues, <hi>Monſieuer</hi> of
<hi>Artois;</hi> receiued ſuch a forcible arrant, as he was throwne in

as he would not ſpeake: which the ſtrange knight perceyuing,
he ſpake to him as followeth.</p>
                     <p>I pray you Sir to contemplate her beautie a little, for whoſe
ſake you are ſo bold to enter the Combate: to the end her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance

that you would gladly ſee in mée ſome ſhew of feare or fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
becauſe you would thereby magnifie your déeds the more:
but prouide your ſelfe for mee, and aſſure your ſelfe, that ſuch is
the hope I repoſe in my Ladies fauour, as I doubt not ere I go,
but to vnhorſe you.</p>
                     <p>Vpon this, theſe two Knights met together with ſuch force,
as <hi>Briſar</hi> of <hi>Gennes</hi> brake his ſtaffe, though not able to remoue
his aduerſary, who encountred him ſo brauely, as he was ſent to
the ground with his Saddle betweene his legges: and as he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to ſtrike him with his Sworde, the Damoſell came and
ſtepped betwéene them, ſo that the ſtrange knight could not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his intent.</p>
                     <p>The King <hi>Arnedes</hi> was extreamely grieued, ſéeing the
victorie come ſo faſt to the diſaduantage of his Knights, and the
ſtraunge Knight beeing very glad, to ſee Fortune fauour him
ſo well, praunced till he came before <hi>Latiania,</hi> to whome he
vſed this Language. Hee that hath the power to performe
what hee promiſeth to your Companions, hath no leſſe force to

                     <p>The ſtrange knight humbly thanking the King for his gift,
mounting on his backe, attending the knight that ſhould next
enter, which was <hi>Benteier</hi> of <hi>Berlande,</hi> the ſeruant of <hi>Manſia:</hi>
but ſuch was his miſfortune, as he was vnhorſed likewiſe, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                     <p>Then came <hi>Arlencea</hi> to him, and willed him to remember

haue done me a great pleaſure madame (anſwered the ſtrange

                     <p>I beſéech your grace humbly (anſwered the ſtrange Knight)
that you would not bee offended, conſidering I am loth to

the king ſet forward on his way to <hi>Digeon,</hi> thinking the ſtrang

(which was néere at hand in the valley) the Abbateſſe brought
them into a faire Chamber, the windowes whereof ouer a

lodged, and there he laboured his thoughts ſo extremely all the

The ſtrange Knight deſiring to delight them, whoſe kindneſſe

me, albeit you ſée me ſore wounded: yet will I giue you to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that the fauour of this Lady is reſerued for him, that
hath ſuffered thus much in her ſeruice, and thinketh himſelfe
worthy of her gracious recompence. I perceiue Sir (ſaid the K.
of the <hi>Speare)</hi> that you are ignorant of me, who could wiſh (for
the loue I beare this Lady) and you were in good eſtate, end ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
double againſt me: for as you be now, I iudge you farre
vnable to make reſiaſtance againſt me. The ſtrange knight
hearing the proud words of the knight of the <hi>Speare,</hi> mounted
on horſebacke, and taking a Lance from his Eſquire, came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him with theſes words.</p>
                     <p>Sir Knight, I haue promiſed theſe foure Ladies, to guarde
the paſſage of this Valley for eight dayes ſpace: the two firſt
dayes in the ſeruice of <hi>Manſia,</hi> the Lady that ſitteth on your
left hand: the third and fourth for <hi>Telanſia:</hi> the fift and ſixt
for the Lady whom you like, called <hi>Latrania:</hi> and the two laſt
dayes ſhall be altogether imployed, in the honourable ſeruice
of Madame <hi>Torſia.</hi> And I aſſure you, I am as greatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
to the one as the other, except the eſpeciall opinion
<pb facs="tcp:13179:376" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I haue of <hi>Torſia,</hi> for that I ſaw her wéepe for the harme of
her knight, yet will ſhe not pitty the ceaſleſſe gréefe I endure
for her ſake. Notwithſtanding all this (ſir knight) if you can
thinke ſo well of your ſelfe as to trie the Aduenture, you ſhall
finde me verie willing to entertaine you.</p>
                     <p>It is ten dayes ſince (aunſwered the knight of the <hi>Sphere)</hi>
that I did arriue in any place, where I could be more deſirous
to trye my valour then I am this preſent: but ſéeing theſe daies
are limitted by courſe, I will awaite till they come, which are
appointed for the honor of <hi>Latrania,</hi> for on her behalfe I meane
to aduenture my ſelfe. In troth (ſayde <hi>Clermont,)</hi> I ſée the
Knight beginneth to diſmay himſelfe, and can finde no better
meanes to excuſe himſelfe, then to put off the triall of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
If you thinke ſo (anſwered the Knight of the <hi>Sphere,)</hi>
make your returne hither at the appointed time, and I will
not fayle to let you know what ſmall account I make of your
Choller.</p>
                     <p>So leauing <hi>Clermont,</hi> he approched to the Ladyes, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of him, if he had bene at the Caſtle of the Gyant <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maroll.</hi>
He being willing to ſhewe himſelfe obedient to them,
courteouſly ſhaped them this aunſwere. I haue bene not long
ſince (fayre Ladyes) at the aforenamed Caſtle, and I haue ſéene
the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda,</hi> yet not entring the Combate with
him that kéepes the Shielde, for that <hi>Albayzar</hi> ſet himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

more beautie to conſiſt in <hi>Miragarda,</hi> then in Madam <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trania?</hi>
You driue me to a harde point Lady (quoth the Knight

reproue them abſent, to content the humours of them preſent:
and I thinke it expedient, that eache of you ſhould be content

ſuſpected, that it ſhould be the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon

intending to lodge not farre from the Forreſt, vntill the dayes
came for him to aduenture with the ſtrange knight, on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe

was not of force ſufficient to cauſe him giue his mind to reſt: for

                     <p>I know well that loue is enuious at my libertie, for that I

now being in <hi>Fraunce,</hi> I am ſuddenly inneigled by foure
Ladyes, who onely delight to depriue me of life. And that
which tormenteth me moſt, is this, I loue them all, and am as
much affected to one of them, as I am to all the other thrée: for
when I regard the one, my heart biddeth me forſake all to yéeld

which maketh me thinke it cannot be true loue, that doth toſſe

                        <hi>Alter</hi> of <hi>Amiens,</hi> and <hi>Gualter</hi> of <hi>Amboyſe,</hi> notwithſtanding
the death of their Friend and companion, determined to hazard
their honour in this Aduenture: but <hi>Gualter</hi> of <hi>Amboyſe</hi> was
the firſt that preſented himſelfe to Iouſt, vſing this Language
towards his Ladie. I deſire you heartily (good Madame) that
you would not ſuffer him to dye at a ſtrangers hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who onely
liueth to doe you ſeruice: but ſo well I deſire you to thinke of
mée, as in the extreameſt occaſion you will not forſake mee.
Theſe words vttered by <hi>Gualter</hi> of <hi>Amboyſe,</hi> were ſpoken af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuch manner, as the Knight of the <hi>Sphere</hi> eaſily vnderſtood
them, wherevpon he ſpake to Madame <hi>Latrania,</hi> in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
This Knight in my iudgement (faire Miſtris) is vnwoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the Loue of any gracious Lady, that diſdaineth of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
before he begin it.</p>
                     <p>While hee ſtoode thus communing with his Ladie, the two
Knights encountred together, but <hi>Gualter</hi> of <hi>Amboyſe</hi> was
caſt foorth of his Saddle, béeing vnable to mooue the Straunge
Knight: hée hauing broken his Launce, addreſſed himſelfe to
<hi>Alter</hi> of <hi>Amiens,</hi> who being very timerous and fearefull, yet to
ſhewe ſome good countenance to his Ladie, gaue his Horſe the
ſpurres againſt the ſtraunge Knight, who could not méete with
him according as he would. Neuertheleſſe, <hi>Alter</hi> of <hi>Amiens</hi>
brake his Launce in ſuch ſorte, as the péeces flewe about the
<pb facs="tcp:13179:381" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtrange Knights horſe head, whereat the horſe ſo fumed as he
gallopped with his maiſter violently through the field, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
the ſtrange Knight caſt himſelfe beſide him, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his Eſquire to ride after, to take him againe. <hi>Alter</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miens,</hi>
ſéeing that Fortune more faudured him then his other
companions, was very deſirous to enter the combat with the
ſword, for which cauſe he alighted from his horſe, then <hi>Gualter</hi>
put himſelfe before him, becauſe he had Iouſted firſt: but the
ſtrange knight handled him in ſuch order, as in ſhort time his
companion was glad to come helpe him, whereupon, the
ſtrange knight entred into theſe words.</p>
                     <p>You come (ſir) euen as well as heart can wiſh, for I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to lay claime to your horſe, becauſe mine is runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from me. Then he charged him ſo furiouſly, as the knight
of the <hi>Sphere</hi> was conſtraided (pittying the eſtate wherin they
were brought) to deſire <hi>Manſia</hi> to giue them ſome ſuccour: but
before ſhe could well perſwade her ſelfe to doe ſo, theſe two
knights came and rendred themſelues at her féet, deſiring her
to pitty their preſent caſe, not doubting but they would apply
their liues many other wayes in her ſeruice. The ſtraunge
knight deſirous to ſée what eſtimation <hi>Manſia</hi> would make
of them, came vnto them with theſe words. You ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
(ſir knights) that I am not determined to giue you ouer,
without the Lady intreate on your behalfe her ſelfe: or elſe
ſhe ſhall promiſe to graunt me one requeſt, which I entend to
vtter to her.</p>
                     <p>I aſſure you ſir knight (aunſwered <hi>Manſia)</hi> I doe not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
to make you any ſuch promiſe, giuing you to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that you ought to beware how you paſſe any further
your ſelfe, for the hope which you haue in me, who by this
meanes ſhall haue perfect knowledge, of the loue and good will
you ſéeme to beare me. I ſée well (quoth the ſtrange knight)
that you are deſirous to let me know, how your nature is bent
towardes them, that aduenture themſelues in your ſeruice:
which is: that they ſhall receiue better entertainment, then
that which you vſe towards me: whereat, I haue ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to gréeue, for I would be he, that ſhould onely receyue
<pb facs="tcp:13179:381" rendition="simple:additions"/>
your fauour: in that I practiſe all meanes poſſible to pleaſe
you. But I ſée your intent is to vſe me with rigour, which I
would wiſh you ſhould vſe to theſe knights, whoſe liues are
of ſo little profite to you, ſo that I count my ſelfe happy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
my life is farre from your power.</p>
                     <p>When he had thus ſayd, he offered to mount on <hi>Gualters</hi>
horſe, but the Ladies gaue him to vnderſtand, that he did much
abuſe the knight to offer him ſuch iniurie, by which meanes,
theſe two knights rid preſently away to the King of <hi>France</hi>
his Court, where they made knowne the miſfortune that had
happened vnto them.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Sphere,</hi> tooke his way vnto his lodging,
and the Ladies to their Monaſtery: <hi>Manſia</hi> being greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
that the ſtrange knight had ſo well acquitted himſelfe
towards her, as the other thrée did very much maruell, at the
noble behauiour of this braue Champion.</p>

what things happen to you in our abſence: whereto the ſtrange
knight thus replied.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words (good Madame) which you vſe to me, cannot
be thought welcome to me, and I am perſwaded that the lawe
which theſe Ladies of <hi>France</hi> hath ſet downe, being firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun

warrant you: as for vs we will not breake our promiſe to you,
till the eight dayes be fully compleate, except ſome other knight

I cannot chuſe but take it heauily, fearing you will allow
the like ingratitude, which I perceiue you vſe to him: To theſe
words <hi>Latrania</hi> replyed thus:</p>
                     <p>Your ſpéech (Syr Knight) is farre different from the offer you
made me, when you firſt arriued in this place, when you were
ſo liberall in promiſe, that you would not ſticke (for my ſake) to
conquer the whole World. The ſtrange Knight being deſirous
to make one with them, offered to aduaunce himſelfe to them:
but he was hindred by a Damoſell, who arriued there at that
very inſtant, who deſired him to ſhow her the knight that guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Paſſage of the Valley: Then diſcloſing himſelfe to the
Damoſell, ſhe ſaluted him with theſe ſpéeches;</p>
                     <p>Hauing vnderſtood (Sir Knight) how you are of the opinion,
that theſe foure Ladyes are the faireſt in all the World, I was
ſomewhat deſirous to trauell hither, accompanyed with theſe
foure Knights, which you ſée vnder this Trée: and they (to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
me with theyr ſeruice) haue concluded to Iouſt with you,
not doubting but theyr paines will returne greater profite vnto
them on my behalfe, then that which you beſtow for theſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes.
And this you muſt vnderſtand beſide, that theſe knights
come not to enter the Combat with the ſword, in that I reſerue
them for eſpeciall affaires, which are to mee of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
then this.</p>
                     <p>When the ſtrange Knight had well aduiſed himſelfe on the

                     <p>In ſooth (Sir) her beautie is ſufficient for you to enterpriſe
great matters, yet I imagine, my knights ſhall not be any

Damoſell was the very ſame, that came to ſuccour the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
Knights, which were conquered by the ſtrange Knight
in the King and Quéenes preſence: and becauſe the ſtraunge
Knight ſped alwayes ſo fortunately, many knights ſought ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely
to iniurie him: which the Quéene would preuent as
much as ſhe could, cauſing this Damoſell to entice them
to trie their valour againſt the ſtraunge Knight, for her

                     <p>Thereto they willingly conſented, neuertheleſſe, the King
had forbidden them to enter the Combate with the Sword:
for which cauſe the Damoſell entreated the ſtraunge Knight,
that he would hazard the breaking of one Launce, againſt one
of her champions. After that the damoſell had thus concluded,
theſe foure Knights (who bare for their ſeuerall deuiſes in
their ſhéelds, the Globe of the world, figured in a ſiluer field)
beganne to aduance themſelues forward, which the ſtrange
knight perceiuing, he coaſted <hi>Telanſia</hi> with theſe ſpéeches. If
the world (faire Madam) were of no bigger quantity then this
which the Knight beareth in his ſhéeld, I iudge I might with
eaſie trauaile ouercome it, &amp; make you the onely Quéene of the
world. Without any more words, he ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

horſe, and encountred the knight in the midſt of the carréer, ſo
brauely, as both horſe and man went to the ground: then tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the Damoſell that conducted them thither, he ſpake to
her as followeth. You cannot denie now faire Damoſel, but
you haue ſeene me throw the world to the ground, onely by the
fauour of Madame <hi>Telanſia.</hi> Oh Syr (anſwered the Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell)
you doe but as yet beginne, theſe other thrée knights knew
very well the proweſſe of this knight, to be farre greater then
they thought for: but ſince ſuch great miſfortune hath befallen
<pb facs="tcp:13179:383" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him, you ſée the ſecond Knight deſireth to reuenge his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
wrong, and if he faile likewiſe, theſe other two Knightes
will beare them company. But I perceiue well (ſaide the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell)
they muſt be tried knights, which ſhall liue in hope to
conquer you: yet may I ſay thus much without offence, that
your courage is the more emboldened by the preſence of theſe
foure Ladies. Then taking off her maſke, the ſtrange <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>night
preſently knew her, which made him beginne in this manner.
I am very glad (faire Damoſell) that you can now witnes my
iuſtneſſe and ſtabilitie: but I doe greatly abaſh my ſelfe, of the
hope you repoſed in theſe foure knights, who (for any thing I
can ſée) beare no greater affection to you, then to me. Theſe
knights deſired the Damoſell to ſuffer them to depart, for they
were afraide, leaſt they ſhould be ſo handled as their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was. The king <hi>Arnedes</hi> commaunded that night, that a
great dancing ſhould be kept in the Quéenes Chamber, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
he was aduertiſed of the ſundry and high good hope of the
ſtrange knights: which moued many Ladies to intreate their
amorous ſeruants, that they would bring them to the place
where this knight kept the paſſage.</p>
                     <p>Theſe foure ladies entred the field, accompanied with their
champion, and the knight of the <hi>Sphere,</hi> whom the Ladies
deſired that the king ſhould not be offended, by his entring the
Combate with the ſtrange knight: As for the reſidue of their
ſeruants that were in the Tentes, to encourage them to be
earneſt in deſiring to enter the Iouſt, each of them promiſed
vnto her knight a garland of flowers, if the victory chanced
on his ſide. <hi>Baldwin</hi> of <hi>Nainnis,</hi> who was the affectionate ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant
to the faire <hi>Albania,</hi> was the firſt that preſented himſelfe
to Iuſt againſt the ſtrange knight, who would not ſuffer him
to run before he had firſt craued leaue of the ladies, that it might
be their wils to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rowne him with the garlands of flowers that
remained victor: the ladies contented themſelues greatly with
this requeſt, wherevpon the ſtrange knight ſpake thus to <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanſia.</hi>
Madame, for that it is pitty your golden lockes, ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly

and doubt not but I will haue more companions to them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.
So ſaying, he ran againſt <hi>Baldwin</hi> with ſuch force, as
he ſent both horſe and man to the ground on a heape. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Albanis</hi> garland was preſently ſent to the ſtrange knight,
which he immediatly preſented to <hi>Telanſia,</hi> vſing this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.
If (ſwéete Miſtreſſe) you will doe me ſo much honour,
as to receiue in worth this preſent I offer vnto you: I will not
faile to enterpriſe in your gratious ſeruice, to decke this trée
with flowers of ſurpaſſing beautie.</p>
                     <p>Next to <hi>Baldwin,</hi> was diſmounted <hi>Bameran,</hi> the amorous
ſeruant of Lady <hi>Briſa:</hi> whoſe garland of flowers was ſet next

being diſcomfited, her garland was a companion to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>Briſaes.</hi> The fourth was called <hi>Luſaman,</hi> ſeruant to Lady

of <hi>Bayonne,</hi> ſeruant to <hi>Mananſina,</hi> who ſéeking to reuenge his

                     <p>Theſe garlands were hanged on the bowes of the trée, the
ſight whereof, yeelded no ſmall contentment to <hi>Telanſia:</hi> but
the other Ladies found themſelues greatly diſcontented, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

<hi>Latrania</hi> and <hi>Torſia,</hi> were out of hope to attaine ſuch honour
as <hi>Telanſia</hi> had done: ſo theſe vanquiſhed knights departed
preſently thence to the Court at <hi>Digeon.</hi> The knight of the

his Eſquyre came, and told him his Supper was ready:
remembring him alſo, that on the next day hee muſt enter the

Theſe worde gaue occaſion of <hi>Latrania,</hi> to take him at the

which way hee might exclude her out of his remembrance:
but ſo great was the affection hee had vowed to her, and the

would not ſuffer him to forget her, but did ſo vehemently vexe

The Iudges of the Fielde cauſed Tables to be ſet vp in the
Valley, which were couered with cloathes of maruellous eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and there the King and Quéene refreſhed themſelues,
inuyting into their companie the foure Ladyes, who were ſo
ſtately Apparelled this day, as their beautie ſeemed to excell all
the Ladyes that were come with the Queene. The straunge
Knight went foorth of his Tent, that he might the better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
this ſudden aſſemblie, and ſitting downe at the roote of a
Trée, his Eſquyre brought him victuals to breake his faſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
After that the King was riſen from the Table, theſe foure
Ladyes (according to their woont) mounted on theyr Stéedes,
and tooke theyr way to the place where the ſtraunge knight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,

expecting who ſhould firſt beginne the Iouſte. And the King
himſelfe, was greatly delighted in beholding the Garlandes,
which for that they were the fauours of the Ladyes, and loſt
by the Knights that were foyled, he began highly to commend
the Proweſſe of the ſtrange knight: who being ieaſting with

it might bee placed among the other vanquiſhed. But if the
victorie happen on his ſide, he would not ſeeke any other recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence

Of this requeſt <hi>Latrania</hi> was very glad, and deſirous to
reach ſo high felicitie, where of throughly perſwading her ſelfe,
and likewiſe to ſatiſfie the knight of the <hi>Spheres</hi> will, ſhe put
the garland on her head: then earneſtly beholding the ſtrange
knight, ſhe entred into theſe ſpéeches. You ſée (Sir) the day,
when I haue the meane to make known your knightly déedes,
as alſo the deſire you haue to doe me ſeruice. I will Madame
ſo behaue my ſelfe (aunſwered the ſtraunge Knight) as you
ſhall be perſwaded no other knight can iniurie me, ſo great is
my deſire to accompliſh ſuch ſeruice, as may be agreeable to
your gratious nature. And if afterward you make ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of me, as you doe of thoſe whom you are woont to thruſt
into forgetfulnes, I muſt then comfort my ſelfe with this, that
I am not alone in miſfortune, but beare my croſſe with others
for company.</p>
                     <p>The knight of the <hi>Sphere</hi> hauing vnderſtood, how <hi>Latrania</hi>
made no more regard of them that did her ſeruice, and ſéeing
the Dice Fortunes hand, either to his continuall honour, or
preſent diſgrace, yet ignorant which of them ſhould be his
chance, ranne couragiouſly againſt ſhe ſtraunge Knight,
they encountering together ſo worthily, as they were both
compelled to forſake their ſtirrops. Vpon this gallant begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
they tooke new ſtaues, wherewith they met againe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſo ſtrongly, as the pieces flew whiſtling in the ayre: and
paſſing forward, theſe Knightes met ſo furiouſly with their
bodies, as they were conſtrained to tumble to the ground. At
this ſight the King was greatly abaſhed: but <hi>Latrania</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
her ſelfe very well, ſéeing the noble and valiant beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour
of her Knight, who ſhée thought as good in all points
as the ſtranger. Theſe two Knights had no ſooner recouered
themſelues, but they drew their ſwords, wherewith they hac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and hewed one another very pittifully. The ſtraunge
knight being deſirous vs to paſſe this day, with as great renowne
as he had all the other before, followed his intent with ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
agillitie: and the knight of the <hi>Sphere,</hi> to witneſſe his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
affection to Madame <hi>Latrania,</hi> did behaue himſelfe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſo worthily, as each allowed him the name of a good and
<pb facs="tcp:13179:387"/>
hardie Knight. And ſuch was the difficultie of this Combate,
promiſing hope to neither ſide, but very doubtfull on both: as
the King eſteemed it of no leſſe danger, then that betwéene
<hi>Don Edward</hi> of <hi>England</hi> his ſonne, end <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> and his
Giants, when he was priſoner in the cuſtody of the Enchaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe
<hi>Eutropa.</hi> And the King was extreamely paſſioned, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
leaſt two ſuch noble champions ſhould die in his preſence:
ſo fiercely they continued the fight, as they were both conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to withdrawe themſelues to breath a while. The Knight
of the <hi>Sphere,</hi> ſeeing his arme ſo mangled, began to thinke his
eſtate in ſome hazard: but afterwards remembring the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of her, for whoſe ſake he thruſt himſelfe into danger, hée
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>muned thus priuately with himſelfe. What greater good can
happen to me in all the world, then to be allowed in her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
whoſe beautie none in all the <hi>French</hi> Court may match?
In the meane while theſe two knights thus pauſed, the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſell

helde betweene them a long while: but when they perceiued
their Armor defaced, their fleſh martyred, and themſelues very
greatly feebled, they once againe withdrewe themſelues to reſt
a little.</p>
                     <p>The King <hi>Arnedes</hi> was loth two ſuch hardy knights ſhould
end their liues in ſo deſperate maner, the quarrell being of ſo
ſmall eſtimation, there he would haue had them them parted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder.
And the ſtrange Knight, thinking on the diſcourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

looke on her: but the Knight of the <hi>Sphere</hi> made ſuch account
of her beauty, as in his ſilent thoughts he vttered theſe words.
I would I were as fortunate, and my déedes as worthy, as I
ſée you coye in accepting of thoſe, who render their very ſoules

                     <p>So breaking off, he cloſed againe with the ſtrange Knight,

my earneſt deſire to purchaſe the loue of Madame <hi>Latrania,</hi>

made ſome aſſurance thereof in your owne conceit. Indéede
(anſwered the ſtrange Knight) I ſée it is very hard for a man
to get any aduantage of you, without putting his owne life in
great danger: for I aſſure, your ſtroakes haue béene ſo
well laid on me, as they haue made me to conceiue ſo good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion

doth not a little pleaſe me, that ſo good a knight ſhall goe in this

very ſory that his ſuddaine departure, would not ſuffer him
to regard him as he willingly would. And hee would not let
him part, before he had made him knowne to the Quéene and
and the other Ladies, who declare to the king, what a benefite
the knowledge of the ſtrange knight would be to them. Alaſſe
(quoth the King) I would as willingly knowe him as any of

Gold.</p>

The ſtrange knight was ſuppriſed with ſuch excéeding ioy,
as he could not poſſibly make her any anſwer, for the beautie
of <hi>Manſia</hi> had ſo rauiſhed his vnderſtanding, as he was not
mindfull in vſing any gracious language, wherewith he ought
to haue entertained her: but after this ſodaine ioy was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
calmed, he then failed not to account of her maruellous
honourably, wherewith ſhe remained verie well contented,
and to giue her further occaſſon of ſpéech, he began to court her
in this manner.</p>
                     <p>Madame, I know wel that your good nature is: to ſée the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts
of doubtfull trauailes requited, and he that ſhould iudge
otherwiſe, were vnworthie the gracious viſitation you haue
afforded me: aſſuring you, that this is the moſt eſpeciall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
can happen to me, hauing the meanes to contemplate
your excellent beauty, which no other may preſume to paragon.
And if you your ſelfe haue not the ſame opinion, truſt me, you
ſhew your ſelfe very ingratefull to Nature, who hath framed
you ſuch an one, as may iuſtly be called the <hi>Phoenix</hi> of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
whom I haue ſo déepely imprinted in my heart, as I ſhall
be extreamely tormented, when I ſhall be depriued of your

ſpéeches to <hi>Latrania</hi> or no? Truſt me Lady (quoth he) her curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
was ſo much, as I did not make any great account of her
when ſhe was with me, and then perhaps I might be forgetful
of many things, eſpecially, to her whom ſo many Knights are

                        <hi>Manſia</hi> being not able to withhold her ſelfe, from giuing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
to the ſtrange knights golden words, and not thinking
how he had vſed <hi>Latrania</hi> in the ſame manner: ſhe beganne to
come more néere him, and laying her hand on his ſhoulder, ſhe
ſhaped him this anſwer. If this matter be ſo (Sir) as you
ſéeme to make it, I humbly deſire you to tell me who you are:
to the end I may with the greater aſſurance ioyne my beléefe
to your perſwaſions. I perceiue then (anſwered the ſtrange
knight) the ſmall aſſurance you repoſe in me: ſo ſaying, he
tooke her by the hand, which ſhe ſuffered very quietly. And ſo
amorous he was in words, as at laſt he bewrayed himſelfe
vnto her: and perſwaded her, that the griping one another by
the hand, was a certaine beginning of loue. So that this little
fauour made him ſomewhat more bold, and furder he would
haue procéeded, but the Lady left him and departed: being as
glad that ſhe knew who he was, as ſhe had left him without
hope to purchaſe his intent.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrange knight was extreamely paſſioned, ſéeing that
her quicknes, and the light regard of loue wherewith ſhe was
accompanyed, made him ſo ſcornefully entertained: yet could
he not blame her alone, for that he was ſo vſed of them all. In
many ſad conceits he paſſed away the night, ripping vp the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
ſorrowes he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>as bound to ſuffer: but when the day
appeared, he mounted on horſebacke, vowing to reuenge the
iniurie he had receiued that night, on any Knight he ſhould
happen to deale withall. But he found himſelfe farre decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in his intent, for the knights of the <hi>French</hi> Court had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ouer, for comming any more to trouble him, whereat he
was ſomewhat offended: neuertheleſſe he diſſembled his gréefe
that the Ladies might behold his wonted paſſions.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Latrania</hi> was very much diſpleaſed, becauſe the Iouſts
were not continued as they were woont: againe, ſhe doubted
leaſt the Knight of the <hi>Sphere</hi> had ſuſtained the foyle in the

before he went. The which ſhe would be very ſorry

ſhould ſo fall out, for that by his proweſſe he had giuen the

the aduenture he followed, the hiſtory maketh no

the <hi>Sage Aliarts</hi> meanes, onely to ſuccour the liues of theſe
two knights, to be imployed in ayding the Emperour of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi>
to which place the Damoſell had cauſed <hi>Dramuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ande</hi>
to take his way, albeit he was very loath to forſake <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>After that theſe ſixe dayes were thus paſt, which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to the honor of <hi>Manſia, Telanſia</hi> and <hi>Latrania,</hi> the two
dayes reſerued for <hi>Torſia</hi> were come at laſt: whereof the
ſtrange knight was glad, in that he intended to doe more for
her, then he had done for all the reſt. All the firſt day it was
not his chance to haue any aduenture, becauſe no one knight
preſented himſelfe in the Valley, wherefore he paſſed away
the time till night, when hee went to his accuſtomed place,
where he had not ſtaied long, but <hi>Telanſia</hi> came to him, being
in a Taffata waſtcoate of <hi>Indian</hi> collour, very richly ſpangled
ouer the bodie, and on her head were Iewells of great eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thus ſhe came to the ſtrange Knight, deſiring him to
certifie her who he was: whereto hée made her this aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                     <p>I perceiue Madame, how Loue altogether entendeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
them of life, who are deſirous to doe him ſeruice, and the
more extreamely to plague and puniſh me, that the paines of
the other oppreſſed ſoules may not compare with mine: for he
hath made me thus to vnderſtand, that your ſeuerall viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are to no other end, but onely to gaine the knowledge of
me, without any will or deſire in you, to pittie my continuall
dying ſpirit, or to regard my dangerous trauailes, wherein
you ſeeke to prolong my loathed life, though I dayly deſire to
breathe my laſt.</p>
                     <p>If you iudge my words to ſauour of any forgerie, you may

as they had not done the like to any of the King <hi>Arnedes</hi> court:
whereat the ſtrange knight was ſo mooued, as he preſently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

                     <p>Which the other <hi>Italian</hi> perceiuing, who was named <hi>Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi>

behauiour, as <hi>Alemant</hi> found he dealt with one ſtronger then
himſelfe. Yet was he of this mind, that he rather deſired to die
at his hands, then to demand any ſuccour of the Ladies: who
were ſo greatly mooued with pittie, fearing to ſee him die before

tooke their leaue of him, and went againe to the Monaſterie,

beare you, that I deſire my life may be prolonged onely to

where he eſpied a number of Knights,
Ladies and Damoſels, which made him
preſently ſuſpect the Emperor to be in their
company, as he was indéede: for he had béen
abroad with them to ſée his falcons flie, and for that age would
not ſuffer him to ride on horſebacke, he was in a Coach, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied

                     <p>Then came they togither to méete him in ſuch a troupe, as
the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> was very ioyfull to ſee himſelfe
ſo welcome to his friends: amongſt them was his Brother

at which tidings he was ſo heauy, as he was enforced
to forſake their company, and rode into the Citie before them.
And after he was come to the Pallace, he conſumed certaine
dayes in mournings, vntill the time compelled him to goe viſit
the Princeſſe <hi>Leonarda</hi> his Lady.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour cauſed <hi>Arlencea</hi> to be mounted on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe
againe, making very eſpeciall eſtimation of her, for as
ſhe was endued with exquiſite beautie, ſo was ſhe adorned
with very gratious maners, which liked euery one well that
beheld her: eſpecially <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> who was now ſo farre in
loue with her, as he had quite forgotten <hi>Latrania.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the Emperour was about to returne into the Cittie, he
eſpyed come riding along the Forreſt diuers Ladyes and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſels,
accompanyed with diuers knights, who were offered

                     <p>Afterward with another Lance, which one of the Knights

Knights of the Emperours Court to the ground, whereat the
Emperour maruelled, and noting the braue behauiour of this
Knight, he cauſed to be ſent him certaine Lances, but before
they could be receiued, a Damoſell came and ſaluted the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror

<hi>Dragonalt</hi> the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> being deſirous to content the

                     <p>The Emperour and the Empreſſe hearing the Damoſelles
words, were ſuppriſed with vnſpeakeable pleaſure, enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

the affection of his Queene <hi>Arnalte,</hi> in more ample maner to

Which when <hi>Dragonalt</hi> and the Queene <hi>Arnalte</hi> beheld, they
alighted from their horſes, and holding one another by the
hand, went to meete the Empreſſe: who likewiſe to do them
the greater honour, came on feete accompanied with <hi>Gridonia
Polinarda, Leonarda,</hi> &amp; diuers other Ladies, each of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing

<hi>Dragonalt</hi> and <hi>Arnalte</hi> mounted on horſebacke: but <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merin</hi>
alighted, and taking the bridle of <hi>Arnaltes</hi> horſe in his
hand, ſo walked on til he came to the pallace, wherat the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<hi>Polinarda</hi> beganne to waxe ſomewhat iealous. <hi>Arnalte</hi>
well noting the beautie of the two Princeſſes, <hi>Polinarda,</hi> and
the faire <hi>Leonarda</hi> of <hi>Thrace,</hi> began to thinke, that they which
enterpriſed the Combate in <hi>Spaine</hi> for the faireſt in the world,
did witneſſe their manhood in a iuſt occaſion: albeit, next to
theſe two, her ſelfe was eſteemed the third for beautie in the
Emperours Court, but when the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda</hi> came
thither, ſhe was conſtrained to be the fourth in number. <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonalt,</hi>
and the Quéene <hi>Arnalte</hi> were lodged verie neere the
Empreſſe Chamber, and <hi>Arlencea</hi> and her Damoſels, were

Empreſſe.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour cauſed dayly Iouſts and Tournements, to
witneſſe the Quéene <hi>Arnalte,</hi> that her preſence was very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable

the intreatie of <hi>Pompides</hi> and her ſelfe very often to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
                     <p>The Quéene of <hi>Scottes</hi> was lodged with the princeſſe <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narda,</hi>
who held her ſelfe greatly contented, becauſe ſhee was

<hi>Pomp des</hi> went to comfort the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> in
his chamber, where he kept, and would not as yet goe abroad,
ſo heauily he tooke the death of King <hi>Fredericke,</hi> his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Court of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was in ſhort time ſo well
furniſhed with Princes and noble Knights, as they were iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

with great ioy, where they might behold the King of <hi>France</hi>
in a ſumptuous Galley, couered with cloath of Golde of
great value, wherein was himſelfe, his Quéene, <hi>Florenda</hi>

Before them in another Galion, was the faireſt Princeſſe
<hi>Miragarda,</hi> the Giant <hi>Almaroll,</hi> the Prince <hi>Florendos,</hi> and

they were all contented, eſpecially the Knights, who aduanced
themſelues one after another to kiſſe the Emperours hand: the

                     <p>After theſe ioyfull motions, both on the one ſide &amp; the other,
were ſomewhat pacified, the Emperor returned to counſell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,

and the other Kings, letting them vnderſtand, that he did not
<pb facs="tcp:13179:401" rendition="simple:additions"/>
intend to forget the Ladie <hi>Pandritia:</hi> whereupon the <hi>Soldane
Bellagris</hi> was called, to whome King <hi>Edward</hi> bewrayed all

Chamber, and begot of her Syr <hi>Blandidon,</hi> whom euery

as you may reade in the firſt Volume of this Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Soldane Bellagris</hi> knowing thy great error of his faith,
and being aſſured withall, that <hi>Blandidon</hi> was his ſonne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued
his Turkiſh opiuion, wherein he had liued ſo long time:
and to remaine in the friendſhip of theſe worthy Princes, hée
concluded to eſpouſe <hi>Pandritia,</hi> to the great contentment of
many Princes his friends, who likewiſe (by his conuerſion)
came to know the lawe of the liuing God. Of this good hap,
the Emperor and all the other Chriſtian Princes were very
glad, and to continue <hi>Bellagris</hi> in this good mind, the Emperor
preſently aroſe from counſell, &amp; went into the princeſſe cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
accompanied with King <hi>Edward,</hi> where his Maieſtie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to <hi>Pandritia,</hi> what had paſſed betwéene them and the
<hi>Solean Bellagris,</hi> cauſing her to forget her former opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that
<hi>Blandidon</hi> was the ſonne of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and certifying her
likewiſe, how the <hi>Soldan</hi> had receiued his Heatheniſh faith,
to make her amends by marriage, which ſhe ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe,
as well conſidering the valour and riches of the <hi>Soldane,</hi>
who was a mighty and renowmed Prince, as alſo that her
ſon might know his noble father. <hi>Pandritia</hi> heauily looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
her, was ſo ſore troubled, as it was a great while ere ſhe
ſpake a word: but after ſhe had better remembred her ſelfe, ſhee
earneſtly beheld king <hi>Edward,</hi> ſpeaking to him in this maner.
My hard deſtiny (worthy Prince) hath concealed this ſo long,
which you at laſt haue vouchſafed to bewray, that my life may
be heereafter more pleaſant then it hath beene: and this you
may aſſure your ſelfe, that if I had knowne of this before, I
had giuen due chaſtiſement to my ignorant miſfortune. But
ſince it is come to light at this time, both the loue of my ſonne,
the ſaluation of the <hi>Soldane</hi> and his Subiects, compelleth me
to forget all matters paſt, conſidered alſo, that the force of loue
made him deceiue in this manner.</p>

The Emperour liked well of that ſhe had ſaid, and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
embraced hee many times, being ſo glad as could be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
that all things came to ſuch a happy end. <hi>Blandidon</hi> was
then called into preſence, who was very ſorry when he knew
king <hi>Edward</hi> was not his father: but the hope to be preferred
by the <hi>Soldanes</hi> dignitie, made him to forget all former occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,

                     <p>After hee had embarbued himſelfe, putting himſelfe euen
vnto the mercy of the Seas, and ſo trauailing to any place
where the Marriners could wiſh him for his beſt auayle,
one day aboue all other, hée was aſſayled with an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
tempeſt, the waues toſſing the veſſell in ſuch ſort, as
ſometime one would haue iudged it had touched the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and afterwards would fall downe as it were to Hell:
in which trouble, both the Pilot and Marriners were ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraughted
of memory, as they could not deuiſe in what
<pb facs="tcp:13179:405" rendition="simple:additions"/>
partes, they ſhould be, but euen run which way Fortune plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
for the ſpace of three dayes, at the end whereof, they came
to a mighty huge mountaine, the top thereof ſeeming to touch
the clouds.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> deſirous to know what
Countrey this was, cauſed the Marriners to ſet him on ſhore,
and for that the Mountaine was not to be trauelled on Horſe
back, he went vp on foot, comming at laſt to the other ſide of the
Mountaine, where he entred a goodly fayre Field, which was
incloſed round about with huge Rocks, like to that he paſſed at
the entrance.</p>
                     <p>In the middeſt of this field was a ſtrong and admirable Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
both for the beauty as alſo the height, beeing founded of
the ſame Rockes as were about it, at the gate of this Caſtle
was hanged a Garland of Tryumphe, wherein letters of
Golde was written thus. <hi>This is the Pallace of the Queene
Melia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> ſeeing the gate open, tooke
the boldnes on him to enter in: but when he beheld the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailous
height of the Halls and Chambers, in this Caſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Queene <hi>Melia,</hi> he iudged it to be the moſt ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Manſion that euer he came in.</p>
                     <p>For I aſſure you, the Towers, Galleries, and other buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
were ſo ingenuouſly carued out of the ſame Rocke, as
one would haue thought the whole Caſtle to haue conſiſted of
one péece, whereupon the knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> was much
abaſhed, that this Fortreſſe was vnknowne to the Knights of
the Emperours Court of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At length he thought good to viſit this Caſtle further, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hée ſaw at the foure corners thereof foure gates, and
the entrance into them was not forbidden him by any: but
he eſpied an other Gate, which was made faſt with two great
ſtroug Chaines of Iron, vppon the Gate béeing engraued
many auncient Hiſtories, which were vnknowen to the
knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> and long hée ſtayed not to beholde
this Gate, for that he perceiued he trauelled iu vain, if he ſhould
offer to enter in therat. Theu paſſed he through one of the other
<pb facs="tcp:13179:406" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Gates, and came into a goodly great Hall, in the middeſt wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was chaſed in Gold the picture of an ancient woman, who
had deuiſed and cauſed that Caſtle to be builded: this Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was garniſhed on either ſide with goodly marble pillars,
and when he had behold this ſufficiently, he paſſed to viewe the
reſt of the Caſtle.</p>
                     <p>But turning him about to goe forward, hée eſpied hard by
him a mightie Serpent of Braſſe, faſhioned and made ſo arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially,
as it was a thing moſt ſtrange to behold, in that it was
of ſuch a monſtrous highneſſe, as it reached to the very rafters
that held vp the couerture of the Hall.</p>
                     <p>This Serpent held his necke stretched out along, with his
countenaunce ſo vigorous and fearefull, as (being made by
very ſingular workemanſhip and cunning) it was able to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
them that did behold it. But the Knight of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
man</hi> (whoſe heart no terrour or fearefull motion could
diſmay) approached to this Serpent, and hauing viewed very
circumſpectly, eſpied a key tied about his necke with a Chaine
of Gold, the Chaine being wound about his necke in a great
many foldes, wherevpon he preſently imagined, that in this
key conſiſted the principall aduenture of this Caſtle, which
when he had viſited in many places, he returned againe to the
brazen Serpent, to marke if this key would ſerue to further
him in his intent.</p>
                     <p>And as he came to take off the Chaine with the key, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
in the Serpents necke a little chinke or creuiſe, at which
ſight he began ſomewhat to comfort himſelfe, ſo that he tooke
the key, and hauing the meanes to vſe it at his owne pleaſure,
he opened therewith a little window, which was made in the
Serpents necke, and looking in, he might diſcerne the hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Serpent round about.</p>
                     <p>Then did he behold foure Tapers of waxe, which ſtood on
foure Candleſtickes of Siluer, two of them placed towards
the Eaſt, and the other two to the Weſt, and burning with a
maruellous ſpendant brightneſſe, yet the waxe ſéemed not to
diminiſh any thing at all. Betwéene theſe foure lights was
couched on a pallad, the faire <hi>Leonarda</hi> Quéene of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:13179:406" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his wife, and ouer her head hung a fayre Cannapy of gréene
Veluet: at this ſight the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhed,
as he doubted whether he might giue credit to this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before his eyes or no.</p>
                     <p>But when he had taken good view of her apparell, knowing
it to be the very ſame ſhe had on when ſhe was carried forth of
the Forreſt, he perſwaded himſelfe that it was ſhe, wherevpon
he called aloud to her, deſiring her to vſe more regard vnto him:
but he was neuer a iote the néerer his purpoſe, for ſhe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunted
into ſuch a ſound ſléepe, as ſhe had not the power to
vnderſtand him, which when the knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
and being earneſt in the good will he bare her, he ſpake
to her after this manner.</p>
                     <p>Madame, what glory or contentment can my victories yéeld
me, or the manifold perillous aduentures which I haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
finiſhed, if you ſéeme now to forſake me in this preſent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie,
whereon both my honour and life dependeth.</p>
                     <p>Let this (good Madame) enter your courteous minde, how
ſince your ſtraunge departure from the Emperour of <hi>Greece.</hi>
I haue not failed to viſite many Prouinces to finde you out,
and euen at the very time when I was out of all hope to finde
you, I chanced to the place where I may behold you, but yet
to my no ſmall griefe, in that I cannot come to you, neither wil
you vouchſafe to heare me, in this extreame affliction of my
poore heart.</p>
                     <p>Here pauſing a while, he began to waxe maruellous angry,
when, ſetting his ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d to his Swoord, and ſnatching it furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
foorth of the ſheath, he layde many violent ſtrokes on the
Serpent, thinking to deſtroy it in pieces that he might come
to his Lady: but hee was fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re deceiued in his intent, for the
Serpent was conuerted into a flame of fire, and paſſed ſo sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
away, as the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> loſt the ſight of
it cleane.</p>
                     <p>Then fearing leaſt his Lady ſhould abide any cruell torment,
becauſe the Serpent was ſo changed away into fier, he ſate
downe on the ground in great heauineſſe, curſſing his ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
very bitterly, and intending neuer to depart from this
<pb facs="tcp:13179:407" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Caſtle, without he might haue the company of his lady again.
But while he was in this perplexitie, his Brother and friend
the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi> (who would not forſake him in ſo great neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie)
entred the Hall, attired after the Engliſh manner, not
hauing any Armour on him, for that he had not the leyſure to
arme himſelfe, ſo greatly he pittied the miſfortune of his brother
<hi>Florian</hi> of the <hi>Forreſt:</hi> the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> was no ſooner come
vnto him, but he ſaluted him with theſe ſpeeches.</p>
                     <p>I perceiue (Sir Knight) you haue altogether forgotten me,
and eſpecially in the place where you haue moſt néede of my
helpe.</p>
                     <p>At theſe words the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> preſently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe,
and embracing the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> in his armes, he returned
him this anſwer. My Lord and Brother, I am ſure it is not
vnknown vnto you, that one occaſion of gréefe thorowly ſetled
in the minde, cauſeth the party ſo vexed to commit all things
elſe to forgetfulneſſe: therefore me thinks you ſhould not be
offended, though you were not in my remembrance, I being
in ſuch a ſharpe extremity, from which I deſire to be deliuered
by your ayde.</p>
                     <p>Woorthy ſir (anſwered <hi>Aliart)</hi> he whoſe knowledge ſerued
him to bring the Quéene <hi>Leonarda</hi> in this place, hath done it
by ſuch a maruellous means, as it is impoſſible to recouer her
hence ſo ſpéedily: but Fortune reſeruing you to employ your
valour, in aduentures worthy moſt high renowne, will not
ſuffer his intent that brought her hither, to be fully executed,
but hath ordained it in ſuch ſort, as by my Arte I ſhall end this
cruell Enchantment: neuertheleſſe, it ſhall be neceſſary, that
you kéep me company, becauſe your courage and ſtrength may
much helpe in this caſe.</p>
                     <p>When hée had thus ſaid, hée commaunded the knight of
the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> to ſhut the window, and hang the key in
the place whence hee tooke it, but firſt hée looked in to ſee
the eſtate of the Quéene <hi>Leonarda:</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d <hi>Florian,</hi> hee labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
very buſtly to extinguiſh the light of the Tapers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
hée coulde not ſuffer that their extreame ſhyninge
<pb facs="tcp:13179:407" rendition="simple:additions"/>
brightnes, ſhould dazell his eyes when he looked on his ſwéete
Quéene and wife, ſo that the light was ſome hinderance to him
when he thought to guard her excellent beautie: wherevpon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liart</hi>
ſpake thus vnto him.</p>
                     <p>I perceiue well (my Lord) that you are ignorant of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of theſe Tapers, whoſe light onely maintaineth the life of
your Quéene <hi>Leonarda:</hi> for looke how ſoone they ſhall be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
or conſumed, euen ſo ſoone ſhall her life be fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate
and ended.</p>
                     <p>After this communication, theſe two Knights went foorth
of the Caſtle, and ſo ſoone as they were come into the open
Field, the Ayre began to be excéeding troubled, ſo that for a time
a maruellous darkeneſſe ouer-ſhadowed them: yet at laſt it
cleared againe, when the Knight of the <hi>Sauage-man</hi> was
greatly abaſhed, ſéeing himſelfe depriued of the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi>
and no company with him but a huge and monſterous Bull,
who ſéemed as hee had come to the top of the Rockes, vppon
this Bulles necke the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and he brought him immediately into a darke and obſcure
Caue, where the Bull left him and vaniſhed away. All theſe
fearefull motions could not diſmay this hardy knight, for he did
imagine them to be but only illuſions, ſent of purpoſe to hinder
him in his determination, therefore he would make no further
account of them: but looking about this Caue (the light ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
increaſing) he beheld the figures and pictures of the moſt
renowned knights that carried arms in the time of the famous
King <hi>Amadis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There hee might diſcerne <hi>Eſplandian</hi> among the <hi>Moores,</hi> a
ſpectacle that delighted him very much, and in the moſt honon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
place of all, ſtood <hi>Armato</hi> the noble King of the <hi>Perſians,</hi>
hauing letters of Golde on his left ſhoulder, which declared
his name and famous progenie. While the Knight of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
man,</hi> earneſtly beheld theſe gallant Images, he perc,yued
to enter the caue a very aged woman, ſo weake and feeble with
extremity of age, as ſhe ſeemed ready to fal to the earth, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
ſhée looked on the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> ſhe ſtarted backe
in a great amazement, and crying out aloude, very pittifully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<pb facs="tcp:13179:408" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aide and ſuccour of the grauen pictures, that they
would helpe her to conquer the Knight, that was come to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
and deface her Pallace.</p>
                     <p>At the cry of the olde Encauntreſſe, the Images began to
ſtirre themſelues, and lay holde on theyr Swoordes and
Speares: but when the Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> made of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to defend himſelfe, they ſtood ſilent in their former eſtate,
and the old woman vaniſhed out of ſight. Wherevppon the
Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> departed thence, comming to the
Hall where the Serpent was, and there he beheld the ſame old
woman ſtanding by the windowe, where he looked in and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the Quéene of <hi>Thrace</hi> his wife, which made him preſently
to coniecture, how in that place was incloſed the remedy of his
trauailes, whereto he would very gladly attaine, but it grieued
him to ſhewe his force againſt a woman, who thruſt with her
ſhoulderſ ſo ſtrongly againſt the window, as at length it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and ſhe went in: then turning to cloſe the window againe,
it was made faſt againe ſo ingeniouſly, as one could not iudge
by which way ſhe made her entrance.</p>
                     <p>The Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> could not chuſe but laugh,
to ſee with what a grace this olde woman maintained her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntment,
and comming to the windowe where hée iudged
the entered, he knockt and kept ſuch a bounſing thereat, as the
olde woman came and opened the windowe preſenting her
ſelfe before him, accompanied with foure Knights, who were
clad in Armour very coſtly and ſumptuous and to them ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
how the knight of the <hi>Deſart</hi> ſought to deſtroy her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Pallace.</p>
                     <p>Theſe foure Knights lifted vp their Maces: but when the
Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> ſeemed to defend himſelfe, both
they and the olde woman vaniſhed away incontinent. At theſe
ſtraunge motions hée could not chuſe but wonder, and ſitting
downe to viewe the brauery of the houſe, hee perceiued in the
middeſt of the Hall a Candleſticke of Golde ſet on a Braſen
pillar of very coſtly workemanſhip, and in the Candleſticke
burned a goodly white waxe Taper, whoſe light ſhewed after
ſuch a ſtraunge manner, as many wonderfull occaſions was
<pb facs="tcp:13179:408" rendition="simple:additions"/>
preſented before his eyes, wherevpon he imagined, how that
Caſtle had not béene founded, but onely to ſome maruellous
and eſpeciall cauſe. When he had more narrowly and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly
looked about the place, he beheld a number of Cofers
round about him, euery Cofer hauing a key of Gold hanging
at it, which made him to open them one after another: where
he found the Library of the Queene <hi>Melia,</hi> and very gorgeous
apparell belonging to a woman, which <hi>Melia</hi> had cauſed to be
made to giue to her Couzin, the daughter of King <hi>Armato</hi> her
brother, as the knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> found it ſet downe in
writing in the Library, which when he gad read, he beganne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
his woonted griefe, ſeeing himſelfe out of hope to recouer
the Queene of <hi>Thrace</hi> his wife, in which affliction the <hi>Sage A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liart</hi>
preſented himſelfe before him againe, entring into theſe
ſpéeches. My Lord and brother, ſince you haue done that which
was ordained for you, referre the reſt behind to me, for in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight
of the perſon that delighteth to torment you thus, I will
recouer her whom you loue ſo dearely. I know very well (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered

Aliart</hi> the candle into one of the ſerpents noſtrels, which made
him to lespe, and caſt fire foorth of his mouth ſo abundantly, as
one would haue thought the Hall would haue ſhaken in pieces,
ſo great was the noyſe the ſerpent made. The Queene <hi>Leonar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
was ſo amazed with this fearefull motion, as ſhe was
brought againe into her former perpletitie, at which ſight the
Knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> was mooued excéedingly, ſo that hee
came &amp; embraced the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi> humbly deſiring him to helpe
now or neuer. Then <hi>Aliart</hi> approched to the ſerpent, and thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
his arme in at the litle doore, he quenched the light of the
Tapers, which being done, the ſerpent ſtood indifferently quiet,
but the knight of the <hi>Sauage man</hi> was not pleaſed with all this
wherefore he began afreſh to intreat his brother, that he would
pittie the diſtreſſed caſe of his Quéene and wife: It is not to be
ſaid how well pleaſed the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> was, ſeeing his Brother
<hi>Florian</hi> ſo earneſtly affected to the Queene of <hi>Thrace,</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the ſmall eſtimation he was woont to make of women,
and now that he was become ſuch a faithfull and reuerent ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
to the God of loue. After that he had thorowly recounted all
theſe matters to himſelfe, he fell to reading on his looke ahaine
ſo deuoutly, as at length the Quéene of <hi>Thrace</hi> came foorth of
the Serpent, ſo rauiſhed inwardly in delight when ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
her louing lord &amp; huſband before her, as ſhe ran and caught
him in her armes maruellous ioyfully, thinking thus with
<pb facs="tcp:13179:410" rendition="simple:additions"/>
her ſelfe, that his valour was ſufficient to end any aduenture
whatſoeuer: and ſo pleaſant was the Knight of the <hi>Sauage
man,</hi> hauing his ſweete wife and Quéene in his armes, as he
thought himſelfe the onely happy man of the World. After
they had delighted themſelues thus ſo long as they pleaſed, the
Prince and the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> went to ſhew the ſingularities of
this Caſtle to the Quéene <hi>Leonarda,</hi> bringing her where the
ſtately Pillars of Marble were, and likewiſe the gallant Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
of the Queene <hi>Melia,</hi> where the rich robes and ſtately
apparell were preſented to her view, which ſhe deſired as her
owne immediately, thinking that ſo ſhe ſhould be fully recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
for her paſſed miſfortunes, if ſo be theſe ſumptuous gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
might be beſtowed on her, that ſhe might carry them
with her to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This earneſt motion of hers, prouoked the two Knights to
depart this place, the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> giuing her to vnderſtand; that
it was not ueceſſary her minde ſhould be fulfilled in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
neyther could ſhe carry any thing thence, albeit we liked
it neuer ſo well, by reaſon that theſe rich veſtures were reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for one of the Queene <hi>Meliaes</hi> Daughters, who in beautie
ſhould excell all of her time. The knight of the <hi>Sauage Man,</hi>
was ſomewhat moued with theſe wordes, fearing hee ſhould
not long enioy his Queene and Wife: but the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe two Louers reſtored to their liberty, tooke his leaue
of them to trauell to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where his preſence was
long deſired and looked for, and he gaue charge to the knight
of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> that he would come thither with all ſpeede
poſſible, becauſe his friends might be greatly furthered by his
company.</p>
                     <p>But to let you vnderſtand by what occaſion the Quéene of
<hi>Thrace</hi> was thus enchanted, the Hiſtory diſcourſeth, how the
Princeſſe <hi>Targiana</hi> could not forget her anger and heauy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
towards the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> but dayly
thyrſting and deſiring for reuengement, entertained as part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in her purpoſe an Enchantreſſe, whoſe dwelling was in
the Realme of <hi>Perſia,</hi> named <hi>Druſia Velonna. Targiana</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the time when ſhe might open her intent to this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntreſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:13179:410" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                        <hi>Druſia</hi> at length conſented to fulfill her mind, and
one day when the Princeſſe was bathing her ſelfe at a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
<hi>Druſia</hi> came ſuddainly to her thorow the window of an
high Tower, and preſenting her ſelfe ſo ſtraungely before her,
the Princeſſe <hi>Targiana</hi> was ſo amazed and frighted thereat, as
ſhe called to her ſeruants to come and helpe her. But <hi>Druſia</hi>
reuealing her ſelfe, the Princeſſe was quickly remooued from
this feare: whereupon, ſhe rehearſed her earneſt deſire to be
reuenged on the knight of the <hi>Sauage man,</hi> requeſting her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
and furderaunce in the cauſe. The Enchauntreſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one that loued the Princeſſe well, and was glad to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
any thing that might yeeld her content, ſpake vnto her in
this manner.</p>

King <hi>Edward</hi> and the other Princes with him, did highly
commend the courage of the ſtrange knight: and but for that

deſired the knight to reſt himſelfe a while, to which wordes the
knight thus anſwered.</p>
                     <p>You ſee Sir, I haue two Launces yet left, and I am very

                     <p>The Giant was ſo glad to doe any thing that might content
<hi>Albayzar,</hi> as he armed himſelfe immediately, and giuing his

as they were going foorth of the Chamber, the Giant <hi>Framu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi>
(who had all this while well viewed <hi>Arlencea)</hi> was ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed
in affection towards her, as hee challenged the Combate
againſt <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> on the morrow: and becauſe they would
not dally on either ſide, they threw downe theyr Gages, which
the Emperour cauſed to be taken vp, aſſuring them the Fielde
on his behalfe, and the <hi>Soldane Albayzar</hi> made them the ſame
promiſe. In this maner they tooke their leaue one of another,
euery one wiſhing that the Night were paſt, becauſe they had
good hope to ſee a notable Combat, and this you ſhall vnderſtand

luſty Courſer, which made <hi>Albayzar</hi> and his Friends imagine
that the victory would happen on his ſide: but they that were
acquainted with the noble proweſſe of <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> iudged
the contrarie.</p>
                     <p>Certaine words were vttered on eyther ſide, but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
not long, for <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> beeing very earneſt in deſire,
to chaſtiſe the proude behauiour of <hi>Framuſtant,</hi> gaue his horſe

                     <p>But they immediately recouered their Saddles againe, and
drawing theyr Swordes out of their ſcabbards, they began to
charge one an other with ſuch Furious ſtroakes, as ſurely the

not méete ſo cloſely together on Horſebacke as they would, they
both alighted, and <hi>Dramuſiande</hi> behaued himſelfe with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert

very few ſtroakes on him, but hee layd on loade on his Enemy,
and ſuch was the eagerneſſe of theyr Quarrell on eyther ſide,
as it could hardly bee iudged to whome the aduantage would
happen.</p>
                     <p>So long endured the Combate, as their ſhields were ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

and theyr Armour was ſo cruelly cut and mangled, as theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
were wounded in many places: which made all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardants

                     <p>In briefe, the doubtfulnes of this Combat was ſuch, as Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
was not to be hoped for on eyther ſide, for Fortune (who
reſerued theſe Champyons for Actions of greater moment)
would not ſuffer that Combate to endure any longer: for, at
that very inſtant time, there arriued in the Fielde the Princeſſe
<hi>Targiana,</hi> accompanyed with the Princeſſe of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:13179:426"/>
diuers worthy Knights, who being aduertiſed that the famous

to ſée the Prince <hi>Albayzar:</hi> but before they came foorth of

                     </p>

                     <p>On the next morning ſhe rode brauely to the Cittie, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied

the like he did to the Princeſſe of <hi>Armenia,</hi> the <hi>Soldane</hi> of

to her: but after ſhe had knowledge of <hi>Miragarda</hi> and <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narda,</hi>
ſhe perceiued verie well that her beautie might not
compare with theirs, and gréeuing that <hi>Leonarda</hi> had eſcaped
ſo well from the place where ſhe cauſed her to be enchaunted,
ſhe came to the Princeſſe <hi>Miragarda</hi> with theſe ſpéeches.</p>
                     <p>I cannot chuſe (Madame) but eſtéeme meruailous well of
their paines, that aduenture their honour in the field in the
defence of your beautie: which is the cauſe that I muſt take in
very good part, the labour that the Prince <hi>Albayzar</hi> beſtowed
on your behalfe. To the Quéen <hi>Leonarda</hi> ſhe would not ſpeak
one word, becauſe ſhe was married to the Prince <hi>Florian,</hi>
whome ſhe condemned as her mortall enemie. The Princeſſe
of <hi>Armenia,</hi> ſitting betwéene <hi>Miragarda</hi> and <hi>Leonarda,</hi> was
very much abaſhed, in that ſhe was not acquainted with any
of the Ladies of the Emperors Court, who (notwithſtanding)
entertained her very honourablie: thus they continued their
Princelie courteſies one to another, till the night drawing
on, <hi>Targiana</hi> tooke her leaue of the Emperor, deſiring his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
to excuſe her for the warre, which was commenced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary

                     <p>The Empreſſe and the Ladies brought them to the Pallace

The Prince <hi>Floraman</hi> of <hi>Sardignia,</hi> and the Kinght of the

they carryed for theyr Deuiſes in theyr Shielees, <hi>Sifiphus</hi> tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

very thicke beſet with precious ſtones of incredible eſtimation,
and about the ſkyrts of his Baſes were framed diuerſitie of fine

ſtood two Letters of <hi>P. P.</hi> which he had cauſed to be placed there,
onely for that they were the firſt Letters of the Name of the

and he was in good hope to be rewarded with her, if

The king of <hi>Gaſpia</hi> was in Tawny Armour, ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

Birds, hauing their wings ſpread abroad, in manner as they
were flying, and carryed the picture of god <hi>Mars</hi> in his Shielde,
with the <hi>Minotaurs</hi>-head, that he conquered in <hi>Creete:</hi> this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe

becauſe he had torne a Lion himſelf, when he was in his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

The king of <hi>Armenia</hi> was in Azured Armour, wrought all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

in a fielde of Azure: whereby his meaning was, that his Ladie
was the onely <hi>Phoenix</hi> of beauty in the world, to whome no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

in gréen Armour, croſſe-ſtreaked with bonds of ſiluer, coupling
in manner of knots: and in his ſhield he caried a golden <hi>Tiger</hi>

Without any more words they layd about them luſtily, and

accompanied with a hundred knights of great authoritie and
valour, they being all on foote.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſaw his friends without their horſes he
alighted likewiſe, and ſo did the Prince <hi>Palmerin:</hi> but when the
other Chriſtian knights heard that <hi>Primaleon</hi> fought on foote,
they forſooke their horſes, and came haſtily running to defend
him, and now beganne ſuch a cruell and fierce battell, as on all
ſides it remained very doubtfull and dangerous, <hi>Dramuſiande</hi>
and <hi>Framuſtant</hi> ſo layde vpon each other with their pommils
of their ſwords, as they were at length ſo ſore trauailed, as
their ſtroakes could but little hurt them. <hi>Primaleon</hi> and the
king of <hi>Trebiſonde</hi> buckled together, but ſuch was the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of their fight, as in the end they were conſtrained to pauſe
a while: the like happened to <hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and the

two Knights, who came traiterouſly and ſtrooke him behinde
his back, and <hi>Florendos</hi> with the reſt of his companions ſtuck
ſo cloſely to their tackling, as many of the enemies ranne like

                     <p>But <hi>Maiortes</hi> was ſo compaſſed in with his enemies, as
none of his friends might come to helpe him, ſo that he had

                        <hi>Florian</hi> of the <hi>Forreſt,</hi> was ſo grieued when he ſaw him
fall, as the teares trickled downe his cheeks, and albeit he was
in extreame heauineſſe, yet he followed on them that had kilde
<hi>Maiortes,</hi> and reuenged his death nobly, becauſe the death of
ſo braue a noble man, was much lamented of them that knew
his valiaunt minde, but moſt eſpeciallie of his Sonne <hi>Dridan,</hi>
who with anguiſh of mind caſt himſelfe amongſt his enemies,
and within a while he behaued himſelfe ſo well, as the <hi>Turkes</hi>
knew to their coſt his extreame griefe for the death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
yet ſuch was his vnhappie fortune in the end, as (being
beſet among the thickeſt of his enimies, &amp; many cruell wounds
giuen in diuerſe places of his body) he fell to the ground, his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
ſpirite forſaking him, and made him follow his Fathers

                     <p>And becauſe he iudged, that fighting thus on foote would be

<hi>Framuſtant</hi> were ſo daungerouſly wounded, as they were not
able to hold out the fight any longer: wherefore, they were
conueied thence, the one to the <hi>Turkes</hi> Tentes, and the other
to the Cittie to be tendered with preſent regard, according as
their dangerous eſtates required. When the conflict was thus
broken, diuers that had entred with the firſt ſquadron, retired
to take breathing: but <hi>Primaleon, Palmerin,</hi> nor many of the
Emperors Court beſide, were any of them, for it was a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to them to endure the trauaile of Armes, ſuch ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
they made of their hurts and their enemies.</p>

The Empreſſe and the Ladies ſéeing ſo great cruelty, and the
loſſe of ſo many noble Gentlemen, withdrew themſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their chambers, where they lamented in ſuch gréeuous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as if they had ſeene the enimie entred into the Citie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon,
many Ladies of great authorite (hearing their pittifull
lamentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s) came vnto the Pallace, repoſing altogither their
hope in the aged Emperor, if the knightes in the Field ſhould
fayle of the victorie.</p>
                     <p>The king <hi>Tarnaes</hi> would haue denied the Ladies entraunce
into the Pallace, but it was more then he could well doo: for
hardlie can any man gouerne the common people, eſpeciallie,
when a generall feare of their liues is threatned before their
eyes.</p>
                     <p>The Emperour himſelf, whoſe debilitie in yéeres and griefe
of minde (conceyued by this vnlooked for ſtratageme) depriued
him of his woonted good iudgement, and pollitique meanes to
preuent ſo great miſchéefe, as he could not imagine with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
how to remedie this ſuddaine miſfortune: but euen with
a Womans ſtomacke, rather then the inuincible minde he had
alwayes borne héeretofore, fel into puſillanimitie and doubtful
feare with himſelfe, vtterlie forgetting the auncient Adage:
<hi>Audaces Fortuna iuuat;</hi> and <hi>Targiana,</hi> the Princeſſe of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>
and all the Ladies in the <hi>Turkes</hi> Campe, were ſo fearefull
and doubtfull of the victorie, as the Ladies in the Emperours
Court.</p>
                     <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> being Generall of the Chriſtian Armie, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to witneſſe his noble valour in the fielde (hauing reſted
himſelfe a pretie ſpace) diſmounted thrée knights one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
with one Launce: afterward drawing his ſworde, he
charged the enimes on all ſides about him ſo valiauntlie, as
they were glad to auoide and giue him place. And the Prince
<hi>Albayzar</hi> likewiſe, ſéeking to honour himſelfe this day with
the renowme of the field, came vppon the Chriſtians with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
proweſſe: and ſuch reſiſtaunce he made with his freſh
company, as the Battaile endured a long time very blody and
cruell, ſo that a man could not iudge which ſide had the moſt
aduantage.</p>

But then came a newe aſſault vpon the Chriſtians, by a
great number of <hi>Turkes</hi> on the left wing, among whome were
ſixe monſtrous and terrible Giants, which Aſſault was ſo hote
for the time, as the Chriſtians were enforced to retyre. The
Giant <hi>Almaroll</hi> (who had all this while kept companie with
the King <hi>Recinde</hi> his Lorde (ſéeing the Chriſtians withdrawe
themſelues, addreſſed himſelfe to one of the Giants called <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morant,</hi>
and with a mighty Mace that hee had gotten in the
Battell, hee kept him ſuch rough playe, as he could not paſſe on

ſéeing another Giant named <hi>Trafamor,</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to ſtrike
at <hi>Almaroll</hi> behinde his backe, ſtepped before him to hinder his

                     </p>
                     <p>Which when the Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> perceyued, hée was very

                     <p>

                     <p>And the Prince <hi>Floraman</hi> of <hi>Sardignia</hi> followed cloſe after

his earneſt deſire to reuenge the death of his déere Friends. So
that this Battell may be reputed for the moſte cruell and peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
that euer was ſéene, in that ſo many grieuous and tragicall
Spectacles were to be ſéene that diſmall Day, with the loſſe of
a number of famous Princes and moſt renowmed Knightes:
for there you might haue ſéene <hi>Don Roſuell</hi> and <hi>Bellizart</hi> to
breake hardily through the preaſſe of theyr Enemyes, without
eyther feare or regarde of theyr owne liues, to looke for theyr no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Father the Prince <hi>Belcar:</hi> and <hi>Francian</hi> on the other ſide,
came to ſearche for his Father, the King <hi>Polendos:</hi> which the
Enemies perceyuing, and knowing them to be néere allyed to
the Emperor, followed fiercely after them, to ſée who could firſt
murther them.</p>
                     <p>The Prince <hi>Berolde</hi> was no ſooner come to the place, where
his Father lay ſlayne, but hee ſawe how the Giant <hi>Almaroll</hi>
had loſt his Helmet, and his face ſo pittifully beſmiered with his
blood, as it was a great griefe to all that behelde him, for hee had
<pb facs="tcp:13179:435" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in that place laid ſeuen hardy Knights ſlaine at his foot, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
not to forſake the dead body of the Prince, before he
had loſt his owne life likewiſe in that place.</p>
                     <p>The enemies reſiſted the Prince <hi>Berolde</hi> ſo ſtrongly, as
had it not béene for the ſuccour of the Emperor <hi>Vernar Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon,
Florendos</hi> and <hi>Blandidon,</hi> he had béene ſent to kéepe his
father company: and <hi>Primaleon</hi> laboured very earneſtly to get
the Giant <hi>Almaroll</hi> foorth of the battaile, becauſe he was deſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of a Helmet, his Armour broken very much, and his body
wounded in many places, but ſuch was the loue and fidelitie
he bare to his Prince, as it was impoſſible for <hi>Primaleon</hi> to
cauſe him withdraw himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Vpon this reſkew of the Princes to <hi>Berolde,</hi> the enemies
came running amaine to this place where they were, with
the <hi>Soldane</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> conducting them, who hearing how <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maroll</hi>
continued manfully killing all that came before him,
galloped thorow the rancke till he came at <hi>Almaroll:</hi> but who
ſo had ſeene the gallant behauiour of <hi>Primaleon</hi> and <hi>Florendos</hi>
his Sonne, in defending <hi>Almaroll</hi> from the enemies fury,
would haue imagined the very type of Knightly valour to
conſiſt in theſe two famous champions, who were not a little
grieued to ſée <hi>Almaroll</hi> ſo willing to ſéeke his owne death,
and could not bee perſwaded from that minde by any of his
friends.</p>
                     <p>The Giant <hi>Gramato</hi> (who came in company with the <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane</hi>
of <hi>Perſia)</hi> aduanced himſelfe to deale with <hi>Almaroll,</hi> but
the hardy <hi>Florendos</hi> ſtepped before him, and had ſlaine him
outright, if <hi>Almaroll</hi> had not caught him about the body: but he
being ſo grieuouſly wounded, as no ſuccour whatſoeuer would
ſaue his life, fell down dead before the Giant <hi>Gramato,</hi> whom
<hi>Berolde</hi> afterward charged ſo roughly, as <hi>Gramato</hi> ended his
life to accompany the Giant <hi>Almaroll.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now began the courage of the Chriſtians to encreaſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily,
in that they were ſtronger in that place then the <hi>Turkes,</hi>
for the <hi>Soldane</hi> of <hi>Perſia</hi> was conueyed foorth of the Battaile,
by reaſon of a wound that he had receiued in his throate by the
<pb facs="tcp:13179:435" rendition="simple:additions"/>
puſh of a Sword: ſo that the <hi>Soldane Bellagris</hi> found good op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie,
to carry the bodies of the King <hi>Recinde</hi> and <hi>Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalde</hi>
his ſonne forth of the field, the Prince <hi>Berolde</hi> helping
to conduct the bodies, becauſe himſelfe had loſt ſo much blood, as
he could ſcantly hold out any longer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Primaleon</hi> hauing a regard to the troupes of men diſperſed

retire, for that <hi>Albayzar</hi> accompanied with thrée Giants and a
number of knights (ſéeing the Chriſtians fore trauailed) came
vpon them with a freſh charge: but king <hi>Edward</hi> met his proud
enemie with ſuch puiſſance, as he was glad to draw backe to
reſt himſelfe a while, aſſuring you, that the King of <hi>England</hi>
behaued himſelfe ſo nobly in the field, as the whole Chriſtian

to him, they eſpyed the Emperour <hi>Vernar,</hi> and <hi>Polinard</hi> his

as their liues were greatly to be feared: for the King of

to the ground, brake one of his Maiſters legges in the
fall, ſo that the Emperour was faine to ſtand vppon one

neare his death, but that his Brother <hi>Polinard</hi> ſtept preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
before him, and defended him with ſuch manly proweſſe,
as the enemy could not any way come to hurt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.

                        <hi>Primaleon</hi> ſéeing the miſfortune of the Emperour of <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne,</hi>
and how the <hi>Turkes</hi> ſought euery way to take his life
from him, was ſo ouercome with inward griefe, as the teares
trickled downe his chéekes: and fearing now the vtter ruine
of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> he ran with ſuch courage vpon the enemies,
as downe they tumbled dead to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d on euery ſide of him.
And <hi>Florendos,</hi> thought his Armour was ſhiuered, and he had
no ſhéeld to defend himſelfe, yet (accompanied with the Prince
<hi>Floraman)</hi> he folowed his father, ſhewing incredible proweſſe.
<hi>Floraman</hi> ſetled himſelfe againſt the king of <hi>Bithinia,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed

                     <p>When the <hi>Turkes</hi> that were conducted by the king of <hi>Bythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi>

to got the Emperour <hi>Vernar</hi> out of the field: which made him
aduenture with his men in ſuch daunger, as it was doubtfull he
ſhould haue fallen into his enemies hands. For the king of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi>
came vppon them againe with foure thouſand men, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to recouer that which the other Kings had loſt, ſo that <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleon</hi>
was faine to alight from his Horſe, for the defence of
the Emperour <hi>Vernar:</hi> in like manner did moſt of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

                     <p>The Emperour <hi>Vernar,</hi> ſéeing Death ready to entertaine

it mildely and patiently: but when the young Princes ſaw
the Emperour ſlaine, they carryed him foorth of the Fielde, and
brought him with great heauineſſe into the Cittie, which was

                     <p>The moſt vertuous and valiant King <hi>Edward,</hi> ſéeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

                     <p>When theſe Knights departed from the citie toward the

trapped in blacke, and the more to expreſſe their inward heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
they would haue neither Drumme, Trumpet, nor any

albeit this ſad procéeding to the battaile, declared their owne

black likewiſe, and without either Drums, Phifes, or Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
wherby they gaue the enemies to vnderſtand, what vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained
loue and affection they bare to their Emperour, and how
they could not forget what gracious and friendly entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he was woont to make to his very enemies.</p>
                     <p>A thing which all Princes ought to haue in regard, and in

know what a gréeuous loſſe they haue by the death of
ſuch a Prince, then to behaue themſelues in ſuch manner, as

that they would in this battell make no account of their liues.</p>

But <hi>Albayzar</hi> ſéeing the aſtoniſhment of his Souldiers,
came to encourage them like a noble captaine, laying before

wringing their handes in very grieuous manner. And for that
they had loſt the King <hi>Tarnaes,</hi> and the <hi>Sage Aliart,</hi> whom they
knew were left for their ſuccour and Defence: they came into

King <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Primaleon</hi> were ſo amazed at the clamor
of theſe Women, as they cauſed theyr Enſignes to ſtay, and
commanded the Horſemen not to breake theyr Array, till they
had vnderſtood the cauſe of this diſorder: but when it was told
them, how that the King <hi>Tarnaes</hi> and the <hi>Sage Aliart</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken

to finiſh the memorie of theyr Knightly déedes, by deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

that their Enemies might not triumph in theyr miſfortunes, to
the great diſcontentment of theyr Lordes and Huſbandes.
With theſe heauy Newes they returned to their Camp againe,

                     <p>But I aſſure you, it was a pittifull ſight to behold, how the
Men, Women, and Children, came and fell down at the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

white beards, being ſo weake and féeble with Age, as they were
glad to ſupport themſelues with their ſtaues: they all made their

Princes, enioying theyr ſwéet Ladyes ſo ſhort a time, for whoſe

themſelues not able to liue any long time, being depriued of
their company, whom they honored with moſt pure and vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

they had béene before, and this miſhap was more irkeſome to
them then all the dangers paſt, becauſe their Ladies were the
rewardes of their knightly victories: but hauing thus loſt them
on ſuch a ſodaine, they were out of hope to enioy the ſight of

they reſkewed <hi>Dramuſiande,</hi> and brought him foorth of

on horſebacke againe, notwithſtanding all the practiſes of the

                     <p>After that theſe two Giants were out of the Field, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

fought maruellous fiercely togither, the like did <hi>Polinard</hi> with
a ſtout <hi>Turke</hi> named <hi>Ferrebrocque,</hi> which cauſed the men on

with fiue hundred knights on foote, came to reſkew the

of the King <hi>Recinde</hi> his Father, ioyned in fight with the King
of <hi>Aetolia,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> came thither with his troupe of men
to aſſiſt his friends, and ſo did <hi>Albayzar</hi> on the behalfe of the
<hi>Soldane</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> he bringing with him many Knights, beſide
foure ſtoute and cruel Giants, whoſe preſence did much terrifie
the Chriſtians, ſo that many of them durſt not enter the fight
with ſuch Monſters.</p>

Yet could not all theſe knights and Giants diſmay the noble
<hi>Palmerin</hi> of <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> but he continued in fight ſo brauely with
the <hi>Soldane</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as he would not leaue him, till he ſaw
him ſlaine at hia foote: for whoſe death tha <hi>Turkes</hi> lamented
very much, in that he was the principall captaine vnder the
Prince <hi>Albayzar,</hi> who likewiſe tooke the <hi>Soldanes</hi> death ſo
heauily, as he came with his men vpon the Chriſtians like a
mad man. The victorie of the Prince <hi>Palmerin</hi> againſt the
<hi>Soldane,</hi> was but little comfort to him, in that he ſaw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prince
<hi>Polinard</hi> (who fought ſtill againſt <hi>Ferrebrocque)</hi> fall downe
dead to the ground, &amp; <hi>Ferrebrocque</hi> with diuers other <hi>Turkes</hi>
fall downe ſlaine on each ſide of him likewiſe: but the death of
<hi>Polinard</hi> was very gréeuous to his friends and companions, in
that the Emperor <hi>Vernar</hi> his brother was kilde in the firſt bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail,
and the Empreſſe <hi>Bazilia</hi> (ſeeing her lord and huſband gon)
repoſed al her hope and comfort on the prince <hi>Polinard. Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendos,</hi>
whoſe griefe could not be expreſſed for the death of his
friend <hi>Polinard,</hi> becauſe they had bene nouriſhed al their youth
together, in the Emperors court) to reuenge the death of her
déere friend and companion, he ran fiercely amongſt the thickeſt
of his enemies, and the firſt he met withal was the giant <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolfo,</hi>
who holding a mightie mace in his hand, aduanced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to receiue the prince <hi>Florendos.</hi> Then began a fierce
and terrible combat betwéene them, ſo that within a whyle,
the giant <hi>Pandolfo</hi> railed and exclaimed againſt his gods hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly,
finding himſelfe not able to reſiſt the force of one knight,
he being woont to vanquiſh euery one that entred fight with
him: but <hi>Florendos</hi> not regarding his railling words, brought
him into ſuch féeble eſtate, as at length he fell downe on his

running on <hi>Berolde,</hi> and twentie knights with him, ſo that
they had murdred the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> prince amongſt them, but the
<hi>Soldane Bellagris</hi> hindered their determination: for he came
with his band of men and reſkewed him, commanding foure
knights to carrie him forth of the battaile, for that he ſeemed
<pb facs="tcp:13179:442" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rather a dead man, then one that had any life left in him, and
in this order he was brought to <hi>Pacentio</hi> the Emperors cheefe
Chamberlaine, who had the charge giuen him for the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
perſons, becauſe he was verie ſkilfull therein, and being a
man of very auncient time, he was not iudged fit to enter the
fight. The Prince <hi>Beroldes</hi> miſfortune was ſuch griefe to his
friendes, as they rather deſired to beare him company, then to
liue in hope of an vncertain victorie, which was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to them when they remembred the loſſe of the Emperor
<hi>Vernar,</hi> the King <hi>Recinde</hi> and the other Princes.</p>
                     <p>But the knight of the <hi>Sauageman,</hi> ſeeing the great ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that <hi>Albayzar</hi> made of his friendes, pricked thorow to the
place where he was, and came vnto him with theſe wordes.
Now is the time <hi>Albayzar,</hi> which alloweth vs opportuuitie to
ſatiſfie our long deſired reuenge of eche other, and becauſe we
two are the occaſions of all this trouble, I pray thée let this
quarrell be ended betwéene thée and mee, and let not thoſe
(who are innocent in this matter) looſe their liues for our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.
I am ſo glad (aunſwered <hi>Albayzar)</hi> that it is my good
happe to méete with thée at this time, as I would not chaunge
my preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t fortune for the moſt renowmed eſtate in the world.
So breaking off, theſe two valiant Princes began a fierce Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat,
wherein <hi>Albayzar</hi> was brought into great daunger, but
that a Giant named <hi>Altrope</hi> came and defended him, which
Giant the knight of the <hi>Sauadgeman</hi> ſoone depriued of his
life, and would haue gone afterward forth of the Battaile to
reſt himſelfe a while, but the king of <hi>Sparta</hi> came with a great
many knightes, and compaſſed the knight of the <hi>Sauageman</hi>
in ſuch ſort, as he was fully determined to looſe his life amongſt
them. Yet ſo it chaunced, that <hi>Primaleon</hi> and <hi>Palmerin,</hi> (who
ſaw the hard caſe of his Brother <hi>Florian)</hi> arriued there, and
at this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ickering they ſlew the king of <hi>Sparta, Luymeno</hi> his
Sonne, and <hi>Antiſtes</hi> his Brother, beſide many other knights
and perſonages of great account: and on the Chriſtians ſide
were ſlaine, <hi>Tenebrant</hi> and <hi>Francian,</hi> whoſe loſſe the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
did very much lament. Then was tidinges brought to
the <hi>Soldane Bellagris,</hi> that one had kild his ſonne <hi>Blandidon,</hi>
                        <pb facs="tcp:13179:443" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which report was ſo gréeuous to him, as hée brake thorow the
thickeſt of his enemies, till he came where his Sonne laye:
then preſently he alighted from his horſe, and comming to his
Sonne, he made ſuch ſorrowfull lamentations ouer him, as it
would haue mooued a ſtony heart to pittie. <hi>Blandidon,</hi> who
had yet ſome life left in him, hearing the voice of the <hi>Soldane</hi>
of <hi>Niquee</hi> his Father, opened his eyes, and offered to lift vp
his head to ſpeake vnto him: but ſuch was his feebleneſſe, as he
could not mooue his head, whereupon he was caried forth of
the Field, and committed to the cuſtody of the olde <hi>Pacentio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellagris</hi> tooke the matter ſo heauily for his ſonne, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
to finiſh his dayes in that place, and ſo cruelly was he
aſſaulted by his enemie, as he likewiſe reſigned vp his vitall
ſpirite, after that he had kilde the Giant <hi>Malearque.</hi> In this
conflict were ſlaine of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> the king of <hi>Gamba,</hi> and his
two Brothers, the Giant <hi>Piſiſtrato,</hi> the king of <hi>Caſpia,</hi> the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<hi>Framuſtant,</hi> who was ſlaine by the noble <hi>Dramnſiande,</hi>
beſide a number of famous <hi>Turkes,</hi> and on the Chriſtians ſide
were ſlaine <hi>Germayne</hi> of <hi>Orleaunce, Luyman</hi> of <hi>Burgundie,
Pompides</hi> the king of <hi>Scots,</hi> and diuers other worthy Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Souldiers.</p>
                     <p>But then to amaze them the more, a number of the Cittizens
of <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantinople,</hi> brought forth ſuch richeſſe as was left in the
Citie, and ſet it on fire before the enemies face, to the end that
if the enemie remayned victor, hée ſhould not vaunt of the
ſpoyle of their goodes: but they being not ſo content, when
they had burnt their riches, went and ſet on fire the braueſt
buildinges in the Cittie, and one after another brought them
all into Cinders, which was no ſmall griefe to the Chriſtian
Armie, ſeeing ſuch a renowmed Cittie ſo ſet on fire, which had
triumphed ouer all other Nations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Albayzar</hi> ſéeing the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſtriken in a maze at the ſight of
the fire, came with a freſh Ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of men vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the knight
of the <hi>Sauadgeman</hi> ſéeing <hi>Albayzar</hi> comming, buckled himſelf
againſt him, where on eyther ſide was ſhowne incredible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe:
but in the end the Prince <hi>Florian</hi> preuailed ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
his enemies, as he yeelded vp the ghoſt at his foote; which
<pb facs="tcp:13179:443" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the <hi>Turkes</hi> beholding, they beganne to faint very much, in that
their whole hope and refuge lay in the Prince of <hi>Babylon,</hi>
neuertheleſſe, ſuch was their affection to him, as they would
not depart from his dead body, but hemde in the Knight of the
<hi>Sauage man</hi> ſo hardly on euery ſide, as they had almoſt ſlaine
him, but that he was reſkewed by diuers of his friendes, who
in ſhort time got the better of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and the Knight of the
<hi>Sauage man</hi> was caried to the olde <hi>Pacentio,</hi> who iudged him
almoſt paſt recouery.</p>
                     <p>Thus did the Chriſtians obtaine the victory of the <hi>Turkes,</hi>
albeit with little pleaſure to themſelues, for ſuch ſmall account
they made of the honour they had gotten, as no man had any
mind to goe fetch the riches which was left in the <hi>Turks</hi> tents,
ſo grieuouſly did they take the loſſe of their friends, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of their Ladies, whom they thought neuer to ſée againe.</p>
                     <p>The common Hindes and Boores of the Countrey, came to
ranſacke the <hi>Turkes</hi> Tents, and becauſe they had more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Gold, then of the infinite riches of the precious
Stones and other Iewels, they tooke their fill of the worſt,
leauing thoſe things behinde them of greater eſtimation: not
much vnlike to <hi>Aeſopes</hi> Cocke, that for ſooke a precious Stone
for a Barley corne, but it is to be committed to the brutiſhnes
of the people, in that they had not béene brought vp in places of
knowledge and good iudgement.</p>
