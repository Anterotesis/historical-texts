         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

UPON
<hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>'TIS a conſent almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,
That <hi>Alexander</hi>
and <hi>Caeſar</hi> have been the
greateſt men of the world; and
all thoſe who have concerned
themſelves to judg of them, have
believed, they obliged Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
that have come after them,
by finding ſome reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their Reputation, and their
Glory. <hi>Plutarch</hi> after having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
their Nature, their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
their Fortune, leaves to us
a liberty of deciding, which he
durſt not take. <hi>Montaigne</hi> more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65671:3"/>
bold, has declared himſelf for the
firſt; and ſince the verſions of
<hi>Vaugelas</hi> and of <hi>D' Ablancour</hi> have
made theſe <hi>Hero</hi>'s the Object of
all our Converſe. Every one has
taken part with the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
according to his inclination
or his fancy. For my part, who
have poſſibly examined their lives,
with as much curioſity as any one,
I will not give my ſelf the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to judg abſolutely. But if you
will diſpenſe with me, to tell
you what I think; you ſhall have
ſome Obſervations I have made of
the agreement and difference I
find:</p>
            <p>They both had the advantage
of great birth: <hi>Alexander</hi> the Son
of a conſiderable King: <hi>Caeſar</hi> of
one of the chief Families of that
Republick, whoſe Citizens eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themſelves more than Kings.
It ſeems, the Gods were willing
to declare the future greatneſs of
<hi>Alexander,</hi> by <hi>Olympia</hi>'s dream,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65671:3"/>
and ſeveral other preſages: his
own haughty inclinations from his
infancy, his jealous tears for the
glory of his Father, and the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Philip,</hi> who believed him
worthy of a greater Kingdom than
his own, ſeconded the advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Gods. Many things
of this Nature have been no leſs
remarkable in <hi>Caeſar: Sylla</hi> ſaw in
him (young as he then was) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Marius</hi>'s. He dream't that he
lay with his Mother, which the
<hi>Augurs</hi> interpreted, that the Earth,
the Common Mother of all men,
ſhould be ſubmitted to his power.
He was known to weep, looking
on the Statue of <hi>Alexander,</hi> that
he had yet done nothing, in an
age, wherein that Conqueror had
made himſelf Maſter of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
            <p>The Love of Learning was a
paſſion common to both: But <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
every way ambitious,
was touched with a jealouſly of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65671:4"/>
in his ſtudies; and his
chief deſign for knowledg, was
to be more knowing than others;
witneſs his complaint, that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>
had publiſhed certain ſecrets,
which ſhould have been known to
him alone; he declar'd, that he
aſpired to raiſe himſelf above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men, no leſs by Letters than
Arms. Having a curious and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
ſpirit, he pleaſed himſelf
cloſely with hidden myſteries, and
was particularly affected with Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy.</p>
            <p>There's none but have heard of
the paſſions he had for <hi>Homer;</hi> and
who is ignorant, that in favour of
<hi>Pindar,</hi> the houſes of his Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
were ſaved in the ruin of
<hi>Thebes,</hi> and general deſolation of
his Country.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſomewhat
leſs vaſt, reduced Sciences to his
uſe; and he ſeem'd, not to have
loved learning but for its benefits.
In the Philoſophy of <hi>Epicurus,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65671:4"/>
which he preferred before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
he principally applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to what regarded man: but
it appears, that Eloquence had his
firſt endeavours, as knowing it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
in the Commonwealth to
arrive at the greateſt things; he
pleaded in the <hi>Roſtra,</hi> at the death
of his Aunt <hi>Julia,</hi> with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe;
he accuſed <hi>Dolobella;</hi> and
in the end made that excellent and
delicate Oration for ſaving the
lives of thoſe Priſoners taken in
<hi>Catalines</hi> Conſpiracy.</p>
            <p>There is left to us nothing that
we can aſſuredly ſay was <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
unleſs ſome divine ſayings,
of an excellent and admirable
compoſure, which leave with us
an impreſſion equal to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Soul, and the vivacity
of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt difference I find
in their Sentiments, is, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Religion. For <hi>Alexander</hi>
was devout, even to Superſtition,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65671:5"/>
fering himſelf to be led away by
Augurs and Oracles; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
his natural inclination, may
be attributed to his ordinary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Poets, who begot in men
a fear of the Gods, and did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
compoſe all the Theology
of thoſe times.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whether it were
his temperament, or his having
followed the Opinions of <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi>
he paſs'd to the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.
He expected nothing of
the Gods in this life, and took
little care what might happen in
the other. <hi>Lucan</hi> repreſents him
at the ſiege of <hi>Marſeillia</hi> in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Wood, with an Axe in his
hand, where giving the firſt blow,
he muted the Soldiers, (ſeized
with a ſecret horror of Religion),
by words ſufficiently impious. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſt</hi>
makes him ſay, That death
is the end of all Evils, and that
beyond it, there is neither care
nor thought of Joy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:65671:5"/>
But men, how great ſoever they
be, compared one with another
are always feeble, defective, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to themſelves, ſubject to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
or ignorance. <hi>Caeſar</hi> was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
at a dream which preſaged
him the Empire, and laugh'd at
that of his Wife, which adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him of his death. His life
did very well correſpond with his
faith, 'tis true, 'twas moderated
indifferently as to voluptuouſneſs,
but yet he denied himſelf no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
that he affected, which gave
occaſion to <hi>Catullus</hi> to make ſo
many Epigrams of him; and was
in fine the cauſe of that ſaying,
<hi>That Caeſar was the wife of all hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
and the husband of all
wives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this caſe <hi>Alexander</hi> had great
moderation, yet he was not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
<hi>Barſinoe</hi> and <hi>Roxana</hi> won
his affection, nor had he ſo much
continence, but that he made uſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65671:6"/>
of <hi>Bagoas,</hi> whom <hi>Darius</hi> had uſed
before.</p>
            <p>The pleaſure of feaſting, ſo
dear to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and wherein
he ſometimes ſuffered himſelf to
be carried to exceſs, was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Not but that in
the time of labour and action,
<hi>Alexander</hi> was ſober, and free
from delicacy; but in time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
eaſe was irkſome to him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he gave life to it by ſomething
ſpritely.</p>
            <p>They were, both the one and
the other, liberal in giving, even
to profuſeneſs; but <hi>Caeſar</hi> with
more deſign and intereſt; his lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes
to the people, his exceſſive
expences in his Aedilſhip, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
to <hi>Curio,</hi> were rather cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
than true liberalities. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
gave to do good, out
of the pure greatneſs of his Soul.
When he went into <hi>Aſia,</hi> he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed
all his deſmeans, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhed
himſelf of all things, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſerving
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65671:6"/>
nothing but the hopes
of conqueſt, or reſolution to
periſh. When he beheld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Maſter of the Eaſt, and had
no more need of any perſon,
he paid the debts of his whole
Army. Painters, Engravers, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
Poets, Philoſophers, all
indigent brave fellows had ſhare
in his Magnificence, and part in
his Glory. Not that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was
not likewiſe naturally very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
but in the deſign he had to
raiſe himſelf, he was obliged to
gain perſons neceſſary; and ſcarce
did he behold himſelf Maſter of
the Empire, but it was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
ſnatcht from him with his
life.</p>
            <p>I find not in <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſuch friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
as <hi>Alexander</hi> had for <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,</hi>
nor ſuch confidence as he
had in <hi>Craterus.</hi> His intercourſes
were either ſtrengthnings of his
affairs, or a procedure ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliging, but much leſs paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65671:7"/>
for his friends. 'Tis true, his
familiarity had nothing dangerous
in it, and thoſe who communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, need not fear, either his
anger or caprichio's. Whereas
<hi>Alexander</hi> was extream, either he
was moſt obliging, or moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
nor was any one ſecure with
a ſecret wherein himſelf was enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
Notwithſtanding, his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
was his greateſt paſſion next
his glory; of which we need no
other teſtimony than his own,
when he cried out to <hi>Achilles</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
<hi>O Achilles! How happy wert
thou to have ſo faithful a friend in
thy life, and a Poet like Homer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thy death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto we have ſought theſe
two great men in their Natural
qualifications, 'tis time to examine
the Genius of Conquerors, and to
conſider them in all the extents
of action. It is a kind of folly to
reaſon of things only imaginary,
nevertheleſs according to all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65671:7"/>
If <hi>Alexander</hi> had been
in the place of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> he had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
employed his great and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
qualities to his ruin. It may
be believed, that his haughty hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
(enemy to precaution)
would have difficulty ſecured him
in the perſecutions of <hi>Sylla;</hi> hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
could he have ſought his ſafety
by a voluntary withdrawing; as
what he gave was out of a pure
motion of liberality, his largeſſes
would have been pernicious to
him, inſtead of attaining the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilſhip,
wherein magnificencies
and profuſeneſs were permitted;
his gifts and preſents out of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
would have made him ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the Senate; and 'tis very
poſſible, he could not have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
himſelf to Laws, which
would have pinnioned a Soul ſo
imperious as his; and ſo attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſomething unſeaſonably, he
had found the fate of the <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi,
Spurius, Manlius,</hi> or <hi>Cataline,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:65671:8"/>
but if <hi>Alexander</hi> would have loſt
himſelf in the Republick, <hi>Caeſar</hi>
whoſe Courage and Caution uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
went hand in hand, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
conceived in his mind, that
vaſt deſign of the Conqueſt of
<hi>Aſia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be believed, that <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
whoſe conduct was ſo fine and
cloſe, that he was concerned in all
the conſpiracies, without being
ever but once accuſed, and never
convicted. Who in the diviſions
he ſtirr'd up amongſt the <hi>Gauls,</hi>
aſſiſted one party to oppreſs the
other, till he brought all under
his Yoke. 'Tis to be believed, I
ſay, that that very <hi>Caeſar</hi> following
his own Genius, would have ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his own Eſtate, brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Neighbours, and divided
all the Republick of <hi>Greece,</hi> till
he had fully ſubjugated them. For
certainly, to leave <hi>Macedon</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
hopes of return; to leave
Neighbours about him ill affected,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65671:8"/>
               <hi>Greece</hi> indeed as it were ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
but ſcarce ſettled in a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and with Five and thirty
thouſand men, Seventy Talents,
few Proviſions, to go to ſeek out
the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> whom the
<hi>Graecians</hi> called the great King,
and whoſe ſingle Lieutenants on
the Frontiers made the whole
world tremble; is that which
paſſes all imagination; and ſeems
ſomewhat more, than if in theſe
days, the Republick of <hi>Genoua,</hi>
that of <hi>Lucca,</hi> or <hi>Roguſa,</hi> ſhould
undertake the Conqueſt of <hi>France.</hi>
If <hi>Caeſar</hi> had declared war againſt
the great King; it had been on
the Frontiers, by little and little,
nor would he have thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
unhappy to have bounded his
Eſtates with the <hi>Granick,</hi> or if
his Ambition had preſt him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
can you think he would have
refuſed the offers of <hi>Darius;</hi> he
who daily offered peace to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey,</hi>
or that he would not have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65671:9"/>
contented himſelf with his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and five or ſix Provinces, which
<hi>Alexander,</hi> 'tis poſſible, inſolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refuſed? In ſhort, if my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
be reaſonable, he would
never have gone into the plain
Country, to have ſought the King
of <hi>Perſia,</hi> accompanied with a
Million of men; how brave, how
conſtant ſoever he were, I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whether he would have ſlept
ſo profoundly, that night which
preceded the battle of <hi>Arbella.</hi> I
believe indeed, he would have
been of <hi>Parmenio</hi>'s mind, nor
ſhould we have had from him any
of the anſwers of <hi>Alexander;</hi> yet
it was neceſſary to undertake this
unequal fight to become Maſter
of <hi>Aſia;</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Darius</hi> had
drawn on the War from Province
to Province during life. 'Twas
of force that he periſh as ſoon as
he arrived, or that a thouſand
different people ſhould ſee him
overcome with all his forces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:65671:9"/>
'Tis true, that this immoderate
deſire of glory, and too vaſt Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
which permitted him no
repoſe, rendred him ſometimes ſo
inſupportable to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi>
that they were all ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
him. But 'twas in that Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
he particularly made appear
the greatneſs of that Courage
which nothing could aſtoniſh. <hi>Go
ingrateful wretches,</hi> (ſaid he to
'um), <hi>go, and tell in your Country,
that you have left Alexander with
his Friends, labouring for the glory of
Greece, among people who will obey
him better than you.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in all his life, which the
Prince of—did more admire
than this his fierce anſwer to the
<hi>Macedonians,</hi> and this confidence
in himſelf <hi>Alexander</hi> (ſaid he), for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
by his own, amongſt <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
ſcarcely conquered, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
himſelf ſo worthy to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that he does not believe
they can refuſe to obey him. To
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65671:10"/>
be in <hi>Europe</hi> or in <hi>Aſia,</hi> amongſt
<hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Perſians,</hi> is indifferent to
him; he doubts not to find Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
where he can find Men.</p>
            <p>But what is ſaid for <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
is, That the <hi>Macedonians</hi>
had to deal with Nations ſoft and
effeminate; and that the Conqueſt
of the <hi>Gauls,</hi> whoſe people were
fierce and warlike, was much more
difficult to the <hi>Romans.</hi> I will
not trouble my ſelf to examine
the Courages of the one, or the
other; but it is certain, that <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
found not among the <hi>Gauls</hi> any
true Armies, there were whole
entire Bodies of people, even to
the women, children, and old men,
who tumultuouſly armed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for the defence of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
multitudes who fought
without order or diſcipline; and
to ſpeak truth, if you except twice
or thrice, <hi>Caeſar</hi> might ſay, <hi>Veni,
Vidi, Vici,</hi> in all thoſe occaſions;
which makes me believe, that if
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65671:10"/>
               <hi>Labienus</hi> had commanded thoſe
Legions, he had no leſs ſubjected
thoſe Provinces to the Republick;
whereas <hi>Parmenio,</hi> according to
the beſt appearance, would not
at all have fought that great Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
which decided the affairs of
<hi>Aſia.</hi> You will likewiſe find this
particular remarkable: <hi>Parmenio</hi>
ſtood in need of <hi>Alexanders</hi> aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in this fight; whereas <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
had one day been loſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Labienus,</hi> who, having rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all on his ſide, ſent the tenth
Legion to diſengage him.</p>
            <p>But be it for the greater peril of
their Enterprizes, for the expoſing
their Perſons in them, or for being
the leſs fortunate in doing ſo. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi>
was a hundred times in
manifeſt danger of his life, and
received often very great wounds.
<hi>Caeſar</hi> truly had his hazards, but
more rare, nor do I find him dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly
wounded in all his wars.
Nor can I perceive, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65671:11"/>
of <hi>Aſia</hi> were ſo ſoft and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate,
they who were always
formidable to <hi>Europe.</hi> In the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
power of the Commonwealth
were not the <hi>Romans</hi> unfortunate
againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
but a part of <hi>Darius</hi> his
Empire? <hi>Craſſus</hi> periſhed with his
Legions in the time of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and
ſoon after, <hi>Anthony</hi> made a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and unhappy voyage. As for
Conqueſts, none can be truly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to <hi>C<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſar,</hi> but that of the
<hi>Gauls;</hi> for in the civil war he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the Commonwealth with
the beſt part of its own forces;
and the ſingle Battle of <hi>Pharſalia</hi>
made him Maſter of an hundred
different people, which others
had vanquiſhed. <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> cannot
be ſaid to have conquered the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
becauſe he was declared Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
upon the defeat of <hi>Vitellius;</hi>
ſo <hi>Caeſar</hi> profited himſelf by the
Labours of all the <hi>Romans,</hi> the
<hi>Scipio's, Aemillus's, Marcellus's, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius's,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65671:11"/>
Sylla,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> his own
enemies fought for him, and all
all that was done in ſix hundred
years, was the fruit of one hours
fight.</p>
            <p>But that which ſeems to me
more incomprehenſible of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
is, that in twelve or thirteen
years, he conquered more Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys,
than the greateſt Eſtates have
done in the whole extent of their
continuance: a Traveller is at
this day famous, who has croſs'd
but a part of thoſe Nations he
ſubdued; and that nothing might
want to his happineſs, he peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
enjoy'd his Empire, even to
the point of being adored by thoſe
he had overcome. In which I
lament the misfortune of <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
who could not give a form to the
Eſtate of <hi>Rome,</hi> according to his
deſigns; being aſſaſſinated by thoſe
he was about to ſubject.</p>
            <p>There yet remains one conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
to make, concerning <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:65671:12"/>
That all the Captains of
the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were great Kings
after his death, who were but
mean men compared to him du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his life. And certainly, I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
him in ſome ſort, if in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
where it was a received belief,
that the moſt part of the Gods
had their Families on Earth, where
<hi>Hercules</hi> was believed the Son of
<hi>Jupiter,</hi> for having killed a Lyon,
or knocked ſome thief o'th head,
I pardon him, I ſay, if ſeconding
the opinion of <hi>Philip,</hi> who belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his wife to have commerce
with a God, if deceived by the
Oracles, if finding himſelf ſo much
above all other men, he has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
deſpiſed his true birth, and
ſought for his Original in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
poſſibly, he cauſed this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
to be ſpread among the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi>
to draw from them the
greater veneration. Though whilſt
he gave himſelf out to the world
for a kind of a God; ſleep, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65671:12"/>
with women, and the blood
that diſtilled from his wounds,
made him know, that he was but
a man.</p>
            <p>After having ſpoken ſo much in
favour of <hi>Alexander,</hi> I will ſay in
one word with <hi>Cicero,</hi> that for the
beauty of an univerſal Genius, <hi>Caeſar</hi>
was in all things the chief of all <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
Orator, Hiſtorian, in affairs
of the Commonwealth, and in
Employs of War. In truth the
enterpriſes of <hi>Alexander</hi> have ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more aſtoniſhing, but his
Conduct and Capacity appear not
to have the ſame Equality. His
War in <hi>Spain</hi> againſt <hi>Petreius</hi> and
<hi>Afranius,</hi> is a thing which people
of the utmoſt experience yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.
The moſt memorable Sieges
of the later times have been form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after the manner of that of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexia,</hi>
and we owe to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> our
Forts, our Lines, and our Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallations,
and generally, all that
which ſecures Armies before pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65671:13"/>
For the vigor of it, the Battle of
<hi>Munda</hi> was more ſharply conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
than any of thoſe of <hi>Aſia;</hi>
and <hi>Caeſar</hi> ran as great hazard
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as <hi>Alexander</hi> did in the
Town of the <hi>Mallians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were no leſs different in
their procedure than in action.
When <hi>Caeſar</hi> had not Juſtice on
his ſide, he ſought for appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and never wanted pretexts.
<hi>Alexander</hi> would give the world
no reaſon but his Will, he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all things his Ambition and
his Humour, but <hi>Caeſar</hi> was guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his intereſt or his reaſon.</p>
            <p>There was ſcarce ever known
a perſon of ſuch evenneſs in his
life, ſuch moderation in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and ſuch clemency in injuries:
thoſe impetuoſities which coſt <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
his life, thoſe ill clear'd ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which caus'd the loſs of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotas,</hi>
and which, to <hi>Alexanders</hi>
ſhame, drew in train with it, as a
neceſſary evil, the death of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio,</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65671:13"/>
all theſe Eruptions were
unknown to <hi>Caeſar:</hi> Who could
not be reproached with any death
but his own, for that he took not
care enough of his proper preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>It muſt therefore be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that, far from being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the diſorders of paſſion,
he was the moſt active man of the
World, and the leaſt moved: great
and little things found him ſtill
in the ſame poſture, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to be heightned by one,
nor lor'd by the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> was not properly in
his own nature, unleſs in extreams.
If he were to run, it muſt be with
Kings; if he were to hunt, it muſt
be Lyons; 'twas an affliction to
him, to make a Preſent that was
not worthy of him. Never was
he more reſolute, never more gay,
then when his troops ſeemed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged;
never ſo full of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
as in their deſpair. In a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65671:14"/>
word, he began to enjoy himſelf
at that point, where other men,
whether for fear or ſome other
weakneſs, uſe to give themſelves
over; but his Soul, too exalted,
did difficultly comply with the
common courſe of life; and little
careful of its ſelf, it was to be
fear'd, might take its flight in the
midſt of pleaſure and repoſe.</p>
            <p>Here I cannot forbear to make
reflexion upon thoſe <hi>Hero</hi>'s whoſe
Empire &amp; Rule has ſo much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in it, that it is no difficulty
to obey; we cannot have for them
thoſe ſecret repugnances, nor thoſe
inward promptings to liberty
which perplex us under a forced
obedience; all that is within us is
made ſupple and eaſie; yet what
comes from them is ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable.
When they are our
Maſters by right of power, and
ſo far above us by Merit, they
think to have, as it were, a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Empire, which exacts a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65671:14"/>
ſubjection; and it is a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
condition, to depend on men
ſo great, that they may lawfully
deſpiſe us. However, ſince there
is no reigning in deſarts and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
and that there is a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of their converſing with us;
it ſhould methinks be their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
to accommodate themſelves
to our weakneſs; and we ſhould
reverence them like gods, if they
they would be content to live
with us like men.</p>
            <p>But let us finiſh this diſcourſe,
which becomes toilſome to my
ſelf, and ſay, that by all practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ways, <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath done the
greateſt things, and made himſelf
chief of all the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> was naturally above
all men; and you may ſay, that he
was born Maſter of the Univerſe,
and that in all his Expeditions, he
went leſs to fight with his enemies
than to make himſelf known to
his Subjects.</p>

            </head>
            <p>I Will begin with <hi>Seneca,</hi> and
tell you, with an extremity
of impudence, That I have a
greater eſteem for his Perſon than
his Works. I honour the Maſter
of <hi>Nero,</hi> the Lover of <hi>Agrippina,</hi>
and that <hi>Ambition</hi> which pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Empire; but for the
<hi>Philoſopher</hi> and the <hi>Writer,</hi> I have
a very ſlender value; and am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
affected with his ſtile, nor
his conceptions. His <hi>Latine</hi> has
nothing in it, like that of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65671:16"/>
his time, nothing that's eaſie,
nothing that's natural; full of
points, full of imaginations that
breathe forth more of the heat of
<hi>Affrica</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> than the flame of
<hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Italy.</hi> You will find there
things cut in two, which have the
air and method of ſentences, but
have neither the ſolidity, nor
good ſenſe, which thruſt and preſs
upon the mind, without gaining
the judgment. The continued vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of his diſcourſe does as it
were affright me; and the Soul,
inſtead of finding ſatisfaction and
content, meets with nothing but
melancholy and perplexity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nero,</hi> who though one of the
wickedſt Princes living, was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a great deal of wit; had
ever about him, a ſort of fine ſpruce
delicate little Maſters, who treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Seneca</hi> like a Pedant, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to make a Fop of him.
But I am not of the opinion of
<hi>Bervillus,</hi> who thinks the falſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65671:16"/>
               <hi>Eumolphus</hi> in <hi>Petronius</hi> was the true
<hi>Seneca.</hi> If <hi>Petronius</hi> would have
given him an injurious Character,
he would rather have perſonated
him under a Pedant Philoſopher,
than an impertinent Poet; beſides
it is almoſt impoſſible to find any
reſemblance of humor in it. <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
was the richeſt man of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
yet always praiſed poverty:
<hi>Eumolphus</hi> was a Poet very low,
and almoſt in deſpair with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
continually complaining
of the Ingratitude of the Age, and
for his ſole comfort applying, that
<hi>bonae mentis ſoror eſt paupertas.</hi> If
<hi>Seneca</hi> had vices, he was preciſe
to cover them under the cloak of
Wiſdom. <hi>Eumolphus</hi> boaſted of
his, and lived in the world like a
Libertine.</p>
            <p>I cannot therefore perceive on
what <hi>Bervillus</hi> grounded his conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.
But I am deceived, if all
that <hi>Petronius</hi> ſpeaks of his time,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65671:17"/>
of the corruption of Eloquence
and of Poeſy; if <hi>Controverſiae ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiales
vibrantibus Pictae,</hi> which
troubled him ſo much; if <hi>vanus
ſententiarum ſtrepitus,</hi> at which
he was aſtoniſhed, hinted not at
<hi>Seneca.</hi> If the <hi>per ambages &amp; deo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
Miniſteria, &amp;c.</hi> was not
meant of <hi>Lucans Pharſalia.</hi> If the
praiſes he gives to <hi>Cicero, Virgil,</hi>
and <hi>Horace,</hi> were not deſigned to
leſſen both the Uncle and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew.
However it be, to return
to my opinion of this Philoſopher,
I never could peruſe his writings
without finding an averſion to thoſe
principles wherewith he would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
his readers. If he endeavour to
perſwade Poverty, I dye with a
deſire of Riches; his Virtue makes
me afraid; and the leaſt vicious,
would abandon themſelves to
pleaſures, on the deſcription he
makes of it. In ſhort, he talks
ſo much of death, and wearies
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65671:17"/>
me with ſuch diſmal <hi>Idea's,</hi> that
I do all I can, not to profit by
reading him. That which I find
moſt praiſe-worthy in his works,
are the Examples and Quotations
wherewith he adorms them. For
he living in a very delicate
Court, and knowing a thouſand
fine ſtories of all times, has brought
in very pleaſant ones, ſometimes of
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> ſometimes of <hi>Caeſar,</hi>
of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> of <hi>Mecaenas.</hi> For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all this, he had abundance of
wit, and an infinite knowledg,
but his ſtile hath nothing in it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to me, and his opinions
are too crabbed; and 'tis ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
that a man who enjoyed an
exceſs of riches, and preſerved
himſelf with ſuch mighty care,
ſhould preach nothing but <hi>poverty</hi>
and <hi>death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montaigne</hi> has found out a great
agreement between <hi>Plutarch</hi> and
<hi>Seneca;</hi> both great Philoſophers,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65671:18"/>
both Preachers of Wiſdom and
Virtue, both Maſters of <hi>Roman</hi>
Emperors; the one richer and
greater in the world, the other
more happy in the education of
his Pupil. The opinions of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>
(as ſays the ſame <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne)</hi>
are ſweeter and better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to ſociety. Thoſe
of <hi>Seneca,</hi> according to his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
more ſtrong and firm, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

inſinuate Wiſdom, and would
make his Virtue familiar even in
pleaſures themſelves, <hi>Seneca</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
all pleaſure under Wiſdom,
and makes only the Philoſopher
happy. <hi>Plutarch,</hi> of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
virtuous, and firſt perſwaded,
eaſily perſwades others. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of <hi>Seneca</hi> aims and animates it
ſelf towards Virtue, and as if
it were a thing ſtrange to him,
'tis neceſſary he firſt ſurmount it.</p>

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:65671:18"/>
As for <hi>Plutarchs</hi> ſtile, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any knowledg of the <hi>Greek;</hi>
I cannot give you any aſſured
Judgment, or paſs my Sentence
concerning it; but I muſt needs
ſay, that amongſt his Morals, there
is a great deal I cannot at all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
whether it be by reaſon
of the difference of things and
manners in his time and ours, or
that they are truly above my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
capacity: the familiar <hi>Daemon</hi>
of <hi>Socrates,</hi> the Creation of the
Soul, and the courſe of the Moon,
may be admirable to thoſe that
underſtand them. I muſt confeſs,
I cannot find out their excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
and if they be wonderful, 'tis
a wonder beyond my reach. We
may judg by the good words of
the ancients which he hath left us,
by thoſe ſayings left by him, and
thoſe gathered together with ſo
much diligence, by the long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
at table, how ſenſible he
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65671:19"/>
was of converſation, and yet there
was either little delicacy in thoſe
days, or his palat was none of the
moſt exquiſite; he ſuſtains grave
and ſerious matters with a vaſt
proportion of ſenſe and reaſon,
but on things depending purely
on wit, there is nothing either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
or delicate.</p>
            <p>To ſay truth, the lives of the
Illuſtrious men, are <hi>Plutarchs</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterpiece,
and in my judgment one
of the fineſt Works of the world;
you may there ſee thoſe great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
expoſed to view, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
within themſelves; you may
ſee them in the purity of Nature,
and in all the extents of Action;
One may behold the conſtancy of
<hi>Brutus,</hi> and his fierce anſwer to
the evil Genius that ſpoke to him;
one may perceive, that <hi>maugre</hi>
himſelf, there yet remained ſome
impreſſion of that Fantaſm which
all the reaſoning of <hi>Caſſius</hi> could
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65671:19"/>
hardly efface; a few days after
you may ſee him ordering his
Troops, and giving Battle, ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
on his ſide, and ſo unfortunate
by the error of <hi>Caſſius;</hi> you may
behold him re-attempting his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
loſing the fight, reproaching
virtue, and finding more ſuccour
in his deſpair, than from that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Miſtreſs he had ſo long
faithfully ſerved.</p>
            <p>There is a natural force in all
his diſcourſe, which equals the
greateſt action, and of him only
it may properly be ſaid, <hi>Facta di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis
exaequata ſunt;</hi> yet he forgets
not the mean nor common things,
but with diligence examines the
ordinary courſe of the life.</p>
            <p>For his Compariſons, which
<hi>Montaigne</hi> hath found ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
they appear indeed to me
very polite; but I think, he might
have exceeded them, and pierced
farther into the depths of their
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65671:20"/>
Nature. There are windings and
turnings in our Souls, which have
eſcaped him; he hath given judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of man too much in the
groſs, and has not believed him
ſo different as he is from himſef,
wicked, virtuous, juſt, unjuſt, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful,
cruel; and where man ſeems
to be-ly himſelf, he attributes it to
ſtranger cauſes. In ſhort, had he
been to define <hi>Cataline,</hi> he had
given him us, either Covetous or
Prodigal; that <hi>alieni appetens, ſui
profuſens,</hi> was above his knowledg,
and he could never have unravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
thoſe contraries which <hi>Saluſt</hi>
has ſo well ſeparated, and which
<hi>Montaigne</hi> himſelf much better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
            <p>To judg of the merit of <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
I would have peruſed what
<hi>Tacitus</hi> ſays, and without lying,
he muſt be one of the moſt honeſt
men of the world, ſince he could
oblige ſo ſevere an Hiſtorian, to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65671:20"/>
renounce his Nature, and enlarge
himſelf in the praiſes of a volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
perſon; not but that ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
a voluptuouſneſs contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as much to the delicacy of the
ſpirit, as to that of the taſte. That
<hi>Erudito Luxu,</hi> that <hi>arbiter Elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarum,</hi>
is the character of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
politeneſs, much different
from the groſſer conceptions of
the vicious: Nor was he ſo given
over to his pleaſure, as to become
incapable of affairs; neither had
the ſweetneſs of his life made him
an enemy to buſineſs. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the merit of a Governour
in his Goverment of <hi>Bythinia,</hi> and
the virtue of a Conſul in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulate;
but inſtead of ſubjecting
himſelf to his dignity, as do moſt
part of men, fetching thence all
their perplexity, or all their joys;
<hi>Petronius,</hi> with a ſpirit ſuperior to
his charges, reduced them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
and to explain my ſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65671:21"/>
according to <hi>Montaigne,</hi> he
renounced not the Man in favour
of the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>For his death, after having well
examined it, either I am deceived,
or it was the moſt exemplary of
all antiquity. In that of <hi>Cato,</hi> I
find melancholy, and ſome anger;
his deſpair of the affairs of the
Commonwealth, the loſs of his
Liberty, the hate of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> were
great aſſiſters of his reſolution;
and I know not whether his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
fierceneſs, did not almoſt
reach to fury, when he tore out
his own bowels. <hi>Socrates</hi> indeed
died like a wiſe man, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference
enough; however, he
ſought to aſſure himſelf of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in the other world; was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
reaſoning with his friends
in the priſon; &amp; to ſay all in aword,
Death was to him a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Object. <hi>Petronius</hi> only found
a ſweetneſs and unconcernment in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65671:21"/>
his <hi>Audiebat referentes nihil de im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitate
animae, &amp; Philoſopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
placitis. Sed levia carmina &amp;
faciles verſus.</hi> He not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
his ordinary functions,
to give liberty to his ſlaves, to
cauſe others to be puniſhed, but
ſuffered himſelf to be tranſported
to any thing that might delight
him; and his Soul, at the point
of ſo troubleſome a ſeparation,
was more affected with the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and facility of Verſe, than all
the ſayings of Philoſophers. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius</hi>
at his death only left an
image of life; no action, no word,
no circumſtance betray'd any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of a dying man; of him may
properly be ſaid, that <hi>dying is to
ceaſe to live,</hi> and to him the <hi>Vixit</hi>
of the <hi>Romans</hi> juſtly appertains.</p>

            <head>ON
PETRONIUS.</head>
            <p>I Am not of their opinion, who
believe, that <hi>Petronius</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to reprove the vices of the
times; or to compoſe a Satyr with
the ſame deſign wherewith <hi>Horace</hi>
writ his. I am deceived, or good
manners were not ſo much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to him. 'Tis rather a delicate
Courtier, who finds it ridiculous,
that a Pedant ſhould become the
publick Cenſurer, and undertake
to blame the corruption of the
times. And to ſpeak truth, if <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius</hi>
would have left us an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
moral of the deſcription
of Senſualiſts, he had endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65671:23"/>
to give us ſome diſguſt, but
'tis in this, that vice appears with
all the graces of the Author; 'tis
in this, that he ſets forth with
more excellency the acuteneſs and
politeneſs of his ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if he had a deſign to
inſtruct us by a way more fine and
intricate than that of Precept, we
ſhould at leaſt ſee an example of
divine or human juſtice upon ſome
one of his Debauches: but ſo it
happens, that the only good man,
which he introduces, the poor
<hi>Lycas,</hi> an honeſt faithfull Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
fearing the gods, periſhes
miſerably in the tempeſt, in the
midſt of thoſe Varlets which are
preſerved. <hi>Encolpius</hi> and <hi>Giton</hi>
bind themſelves to one another,
that they may dye in the ſtraiter
embraces, and death dares not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb
their pleaſure. The volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<hi>Triphena</hi> ſaves her ſelf in a
skiff with all her baggage. <hi>Eumol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:65671:23"/>
was ſo little moved with the
danger, that he had the leiſure to
make ſome Epigrams. <hi>Lycas,</hi> the
pious <hi>Lycas,</hi> in vain invokes the
gods for their aſſiſtance, and, to
the ſhame of their providence, is
the only innocent ſwallowed up
among ſo many guilty. If we ſee
ſometimes <hi>Encolpion</hi> melancholy
and grieved, his grief is not the
effect of his repentance; he has
murdred his Hoſt, is a fugitive,
there is no ſort or manner of crime
that he has not committed, yet
thanks to a good Conſcience, he
lives without remorſe; his tears,
his ſorrows proceed from a very
different cauſe; he laments the
unfaithfulneſs of <hi>Giton,</hi> who has
forſaken him, and deſpairs to
imagine he may be in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
of another, who laughs
at the ſolitude to which he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:65671:24"/>
Jacent nunc amatores Obligati
noctibus totis; &amp; forſitan,
mutuis libidinibus attriti de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rident
ſolitudinem meam.</q>
            <p>All crimes ever ſucceeded hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
to him, only one, which in
truth brought upon him a very
ſevere puniſhment; yet this was
a ſin to which neither divine nor
human Laws had allotted any cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement;
he had too faintly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the careſſes of <hi>Carce;</hi> and
the plain truth is, this fumbling
is the only fault that ever afflicted
him; he acknowledges he has ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times err'd, but never deſerved
death but in this occaſion. In fine,
not to tye my ſelf to the order of
the Hiſtory, he relapſes again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſame crime, and receives
the deſerved puniſhment with a
perfect reſignation; 'tis now that
he begins to conſider with himſelf,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65671:24"/>
and feels the Anger of the gods.</p>
            <q>Helleſpontiaci ſequitur gravis Ira
Priapi.</q>
            <p>He laments the ſad and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
eſtate into which he is fallen:
<q>Funerata eſt pars illa corporis,
qua quondam Achilles eram.</q>
And to recover his former vigor,
he puts himſelf into the hands of
a Prieſteſs of that Gods, with
moſt excellent reflections on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but in effect, the only ones
that ever proceeded from him in
all his adventures.</p>
            <p>I could tell you likewiſe, that
the good man <hi>Eumolphus</hi> is—
by little boys, when he recites his
Verſes; but when he corrupts his
Scholar, the Mother treats him
as a Philoſopher, and though they
lye in the ſame Chamber, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65671:25"/>
ſleeps dogs-ſleep. So much
is the buffoon ſeverely puniſhed
in <hi>Petronius,</hi> and vice happily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected.
Judg by this, if virtue
had not need of another Orator
to perſwade it. I believe, he
was of the opinion of—</p>
            <q>That an honeſt man and good
manners agree not together.</q>
            <q>Si ergo Petronium adimus, adimus

               <p>IT's not to be doubted, that
<hi>Petronius</hi> deſigns, to deſcribe
the debauches of <hi>Nero;</hi> and
that that Prince was the principal
object of his <hi>Satyricon.</hi> But to
know, if the perſons which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces
are true or feigned, if
he give us Characters according
to his own fancy, or elſe deſcribes
the proper Nature of certain peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
is a thing very hard, and
which in reaſon we cannot aſſure
our ſelves of. I believe for my
part, that there is no one perſon
in <hi>Petronius,</hi> that can generally
agree with <hi>Nero.</hi> Under <hi>Trimal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio,</hi>
he apparently derides his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
Magnificence, and the
extravagancy of his Pleaſures. <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molphus</hi>
repreſents to us the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh

               <p>And by an agreeable diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of different imagined perſons he
touches divers impertinencies of
the Emperors, and the ordinary
diſorder of his life.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid, that <hi>Petronius</hi>
is very contrary to himſelf, to
blame the ſumptuouſneſs of a Feaſt,
and the delicacy and ſoftneſs of
other pleaſures; he that was ſo
diligent and ingenious an Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor
after voluptuouſneſs!</p>
               <q>Dum nihil amoenum &amp; molle afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia

               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:65671:26"/>
For to ſpeak truth, though that
Prince was in his own nature ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
corrupt, yet according
to <hi>Plutarchs</hi> judgment, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance
of this Courtier contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
very much to throw him
into all manner of Luxury and
Profuſeneſs. In this, as well as
in moſt things of Hiſtory, we
muſt regard the difference of
times.</p>
               <p>Before that <hi>Nero</hi> gave himſelf
over to this ſtrange kind of looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
there was no perſon in the
world, ſo agreeable to him as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius;</hi>
inſomuch, that every thing
paſſed for groſs and dull that had
not his approbation. This Court
was like a School of pleaſure, or
Inquiſition of voluptuouſneſs;
where every thing was fitted to
the delicacy of ſo exquiſite a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.
I believe likewiſe, that the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65671:27"/>
politeneſs of our Author, became
pernicious to the publick, and
that he was one of the principal
cauſes of the ruin of ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
perſons, who made a
particular profeſſion of Wiſdom
and Virtue. He was continually
preaching Liberality to that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
who was already a Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal;
ſoftneſs, to one given over
to ſenſuality; what ever had but
an appearance of Auſterity, ſeem'd
to him fond and ridiculous. If my
conjectures be right, <hi>Traſeas</hi> had
his turn, <hi>Helvidius</hi> his, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
had merit without the art
to pleaſe, was troubleſome at his
own coſt.</p>
               <p>In this ſort of life, <hi>Nero</hi> grew
every day more and more cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt;
and as the delicacy of
the pleaſure began to yeild to
the diſorder of the debauch, he
fell into extravagancies beyond
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65671:27"/>
all bounds, and into an utter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
of mind. 'Twas then that
<hi>Tigellinus,</hi> jealous of the parts
and favour of <hi>Petronius,</hi> and thoſe
advantages he had over him in the
skill of contriving pleaſures, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to ruin him, <hi>Quaſi
adverſus aemulam &amp; Scientiae vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptatem
potiorem.</hi> Nor was it
any difficult matter for him to
do; for the Emperor, abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given over as he was, could
not ſuffer ſo curious a witneſs of
his infamies; he was leſs tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with remorſe for his Crimes,
than with a ſecret ſhame, which
his groſs debauches threw upon
him, when he remembred the
ſweetneſs and delicacy of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
delights. <hi>Petronius</hi> on his
ſide, was not without his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſts;
and I am of the mind,
that in the time of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
diſcontents, he compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
that ingenious <hi>Satyricon,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:65671:28"/>
which we unhappily have but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</p>
               <p>We may ſee in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> the
occaſion of his diſgrace, and how
ſoon after <hi>Piſo</hi>'s Conſpiracy, the

                  <hi>PEtronius</hi> is through his whole

the purity of his ſtyle, and the

that which moſt of all ſurprizes
me, is the great facility where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he does ingeniouſly give us
all ſorts of Characters. <hi>Terence</hi>
is poſſibly the Author of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
which dives beſt into the
nature of perſons. Yet I can find
this to ſay againſt him, that he
is too much confin'd, and all his
talent is bounded, in putting fit
words into the mouths of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and old men, a covetous
father, a debauched ſon, a ſlave,
or a kind of Pick-pocket, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65671:29"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Petronius,</hi> with an univerſal
ſpirit, finds the genius of all ſorts
of profeſſions, and forms, as he
pleaſes, a thouſand different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
if he introduces a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
he manages ſo well his air
and his ſtile, that you would ſay
he had Declamed all his life. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

endeavoured to continue her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
art by the means of her
Children, which with a thouſand

fine diſcourſes ſhe introduces to
old folks which had none. In

<hi>Petronius</hi> does not admirably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
he is a Poet, an Orator, a
Philoſopher when he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>For his verſes, I find in them
a pleaſing force, and a natural

               <p>What a night, O good gods!
What warmth! What kiſſes!
What breathings! What mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Souls in thoſe hot and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
reſpirations!</p>
               <p>Though the ſtyle of a Declamer
ſeems ridiculous to <hi>Petronius,</hi> yet
he forbears not to ſhew a great
deal of Eloquence in his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations;
and to make it appear,
that the moſt debauched are not
incapable of meditation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;
Morality has nothing more
ſerious, nor better applied than
the reflections of <hi>Encolpius</hi> on the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:65671:33"/>
inconſtancy of human things, and
the uncertainty of death.</p>
               <p>What ever ſubject preſents it
ſelf, it is impoſſible either to
think more delicately concerning
it, or to expreſs it more lively.
Oftentimes in his Narrations, he
proceeds no farther than the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
nature, and contents himſelf
with the naked graces, ſometimes
he puts his laſt hand to the work,
and when he pleaſes, there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
diſhoneſt, nothing hard.
<hi>Catullus</hi> and <hi>Martial</hi> treated on
the ſame things groſly, but if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one could find out the ſecret
to clothe ſmutty things in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
like his, I will anſwer for
the Ladies, that they would
praiſe his diſcretion.</p>
               <p>But that which <hi>Petronius</hi> is
more particular in, is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<hi>Horace</hi> in ſome Odes, he is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65671:33"/>
poſſibly the only perſon of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
that has known how to
ſpeak of Gallantry. <hi>Virgil</hi> is
touching in the paſſions; the loves
of <hi>Dido,</hi> the loves of <hi>Orpheus,</hi>
and <hi>Euridice,</hi> have charm and
tenderneſs, but there is nothing
gallant; and the poor <hi>Dido,</hi> ſuch
a charitable good Soul ſhe was,
became amorous of <hi>Aeneas</hi> upon
the recital of his misfortunes.
<hi>Ovid</hi> is witty and eaſie. <hi>Tibullus</hi>
delicate. Yet it behoved all their
Miſtreſſes to be more learned
than my Lady—whilſt they
bring in the gods, fables, exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
drawn from the fartheſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.
They are ſtill promiſing
Sacrifices, and I believe Mr.—
took from them the manner of
burning hearts in Holocauſt. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,</hi>
as ingenious as he was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
dull when he talks of
love, and makes his Gallants
diſcourſe rather in the language
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65671:34"/>
of the Country than Court.</p>
               <p>For my part, though I am a
great admirer of the Ancients, I
cannot forbear to render juſtice
to our own Nation, and do cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
believe, that we have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them a great advantage in
this point; and without lying,
after having well examined the
matter, I know none of thoſe
great Genius's, that could make
<hi>Maſſiniſſa, Sophonisha, Caeſar,</hi> and
<hi>Cleopatra,</hi> ſpeak ſo gallantly of
love as we have heard them ſpeak
in our language; but as much as
others yeild to us, <hi>Petronius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
us. There is no <hi>Roman</hi>
can furniſh us with ſo agreeable
a ſtory as the Matron of <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
Nothing ſo gallant as the love-Epiſtles
of <hi>Circe</hi> and <hi>Polienos;</hi>
and all their adventure, whether
in the entertainments, or in the
deſcription, has a Character much
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65671:34"/>
above all the politeneſs of our
age. Judg then, how delicately
he would have treated a juſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,

            </head>
            <p>THere was a certain Lady
at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in ſo great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
for Chaſtity,
that even the women of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Nations came to ſee her
as a wonder; this excellent wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
when her husband was to
be carried to ſepulture, was not
content, according to cuſtom, to
attend his corps, with diſhevel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
hair, and to beat her naked
breaſt in the ſight of the people,
but would follow his beloved bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to its monument, and when it
was after the Greek manner pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65671:36"/>
in the Sepulcher, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Guard to it; and began
whole nights and days to weep
over it: from thus afflicting her
ſelf, and ſeeking her own death,
neither her friends nor neighbours
could withdraw her; the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
at laſt, finding both their
power and prayers repulſed, left
her; and every one deplored this
woman of ſo ſingular an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who had now paſt the fifth
day without ſuſtenance. There
accompanied her a faithful Hand-maid,
who with her tears aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her mourning, and as often as
the light placed in the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
began to fail renewed it.
She now was grown the talk of the
whole Town; and all ſorts of
people confeſſed her to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rare exemplar of true Love and
Chaſtity. When it hapned, that
the Governour of the Country
having cauſed certain Thieves to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65671:36"/>
be crucified neer the place where
this Lady thus conſumed her ſelf
over the body of her dead Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
the next night after, a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
who had the guard of the
Croſſes, leſt any ſhould give the
bodies burial, took notice of a
light within the Monument, and
heard certain mournful voices;
and Curioſity, that vice of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
made him deſirous to know
who or what it was; going there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
into the Monument, he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
a wonderful fair Lady, and
ſtood aſtoniſhed, and took it at
firſt for an Apparition; but when
he beheld the dead body, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
the tears, and ſaw the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated
countenance, he ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
what it might be, and that
the dead object had made the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
careleſs of living; he then
brought his Supper into the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument,
and began to exhort the
dying Lady, not to afflict her ſelf
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65671:37"/>
with ſo vain a mourning, and
with a grief that could bring no
benefit, that we muſt all dye, and
all go to the ſame home, and many
ſuch like things wherewith we
uſe to reduce minds overcharged
with ſorrow; but ſhe obſtinate to
all conſolation, rent more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
her breaſts, and tearing off
her hair, ſtrowed it on the boſom
of her dead Husband. Yet would
not the Soldier be ſo repulſed, but
with freſh exhortations, began to
perſwade her to eat; till the Maid
corrupted with the ſent of the
Wine, firſt reach'd out her van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd
hand to the humanity of
the Inviter; and being enlivened
with meat and drink, began to
combat her Ladies obſtinacy; and
what will it profit you, ſaid ſhe,
thus to conſume your ſelf? why
will you bury your ſelf alive? or
why will you render you ſpirit to
the Fates before they ask it?</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:65671:37"/>
Think you the gods do for our aſhes
care?</q>
            <p>Will all your mournings give
light to what the Fates have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed?
why will you not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
renounce this womanly error,
and enjoy life while you may?
that very dead body lying there,
ſhould admoniſh you, to live.
There's none do unwillingly give
ear, when they are compelled ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to eat or live. The Lady
wearied with ſeveral days abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
permits her reſolution to
be broken, and with the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
which before had vanquiſhed
her Maid, falls to, and eats; you
might gueſs the reſt, who know
the effects of human ſatiety. With
the ſame allurements wherewith
the Soldier had perſwaded the
Matron to live, with the ſame he
aſſaults her Chaſtity. The young
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65671:38"/>
man appeared to her neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
nor of unpleaſant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
and the Maid was aſſiſtant
with her counſel:
<q>
                  <l>Will you (ſaid ſhe) a pleaſing love
diſdain?</l>
                  <l>Think how you are reſtor'd to life
again.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Why ſhould I prolong my ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?
Neither in this caſe could
the woman preſerve her vow'd
abſtinence; the Soldier becomes
Victor both ways: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
lay together, not only that
night in which they made their
cloſe and ſudden Nuptials, but
likewiſe the following, and
the third day; ſhutting up the
entrance of the Tomb, that both
known, or unknown, which paſſed
that way, believed this Mirror of
Chaſtity to be expired on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of her dead Husband. The
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65671:38"/>
Soldier in the mean time, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as well with the womans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
beauty, as the ſecret of
the adventure, bought all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
as far as his ſlender means
would go, and every night brought
them to the Monument. But whilſt
he thus enjoyed his love, ſome of
the friends of one of the crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
perſons, perceiving the guard
neglected, took down the body
and pay'd it the laſt Rites; which
when the Soldier the next day
found himſelf thus rob'd off, and
beheld one of the Croſſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a body, he runs to his wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
bitterly complaining, and
tells her, the like puniſhment was
to be inflicted upon him; nor
would he ſtay the Judges ſentence,
but with his own Sword do juſtice
upon himſelf for his neglect. So
that now ſhe was like to behold
in the ſame fatal Sepulcher, the
dead bodies of her Husband and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65671:39"/>
her Gallant; but the woman was
as merciful as ſhe was chaſt. The
gods forbid, ſaid ſhe, that I ſhould
at once behold the Funerals of
two men whom I held ſo dear; I
had rather hang up the dead than
kill the living; and accordingly
ſhe bids him take the body of her
dead Husband out of the Coffin,
and hang it on the Croſs that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one, the Souldier ſteads him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of the ingenuity of this pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
woman; and the next day,
all the Town admired, how a
dead body could creep to the
Croſs.</p>
