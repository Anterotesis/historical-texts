            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE People of the <hi>Jews</hi> having been all along trained up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by virtue of it poſſeſs'd of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Advantages beyond any other Nation, were apt to think it as laſting in its Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as Divine in its Original; and that it was no more in the intention of Almighty God to have it aboliſhed, than it could be diſproved to have come immediately from him. This made them ſlow and backward to receive the Goſpel, by which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106697:3"/>
their ancient Conſtitution would be diſannulled; and after they had believed, it made them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to hearken to ſuch Sophiſters, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to compound the Controverſy, and to join <hi>Moſes</hi> and Chriſt, the Law and the Goſpel together, ſo as to be both alike neceſſary to Salvation: Which is in effect to ſet up another Goſpel than what the Apoſtle had taught, and they had received from him; and therefore he expreſſes his reſentment and indignation againſt it with the higheſt aggravations, Verſes 6, 7, 8. <hi>I marvel that ye are ſo ſoon removed from him that called you into the grace of Chriſt, unto another Goſpel; Which is not another; but there be ſome that trouble you, and would pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt: But though we, or an Angel from heaven, preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, let him be accurſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing upon which words: I ſhall conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is underſtood by the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which the Apoſtle had preached, and they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What by <hi>another Goſpel,</hi> againſt which and the Preachers of it, the Apoſtle ſo ſharply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs, and pronounces an <hi>Anathema.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:106697:3"/>
3. I ſhall ſhew that the Goſpel is the only Revelation from God; and that there is not another, nor is any other to be expected.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Goſpel is here oppoſed to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which there were ſome in the Churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi> as well as in other places, that would <note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> maintain to be neceſſary to Salvation, if not alone, yet in conjunction with the Goſpel (as aforeſaid). Theſe two indeed were ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, that the Law was a prefiguration, a Shadow and Type of the Goſpel: But being thus a Shadow and a Type of it, That in reaſon and from the nature of the thing, was to give way, when the Subſtance came on, and the Types were fulfilled. And therefore though the Law was eſtabliſhed at the firſt by Divine Authority, yet in courſe was it to ceaſe in its obligation, when the reaſon of it ceaſed. And conſequently, to plead for its Authority and Obligation, whether in conjunction with, or oppoſition to the Goſpel, was to ſay that the ſubſtance of thoſe Shadows, the completion of thoſe Types, was not accompliſhed, that Jeſus was not the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> nor the Goſpel true. In this ſenſe theſe two that in a ſtate of ſubordination were conſiſtent, by this means were made to be oppoſites to each other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:106697:4"/>
So the Apoſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>If ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> V. 4.<hi>—Ye are fallen from grace;</hi> ye at the ſame time deny what you ſeem to confeſs; it is a perverting the Goſpel of Chriſt, and eſtabliſhing another Goſpel.</p>
            <p>But this is only a kind of a negative account of the Goſpel; therefore we are to proceed further in the conſideration of it; and then we are to underſtand by the Goſpel, the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and more eſpecially that part of it which is called Chriſtian, and for which the Profeſſors of it are called Chriſtians, as diſtinguiſhed from <note place="margin">Acts 11. 26.</note> all Religons beſides. All mankind are not more of the ſame common Nature, than they generally agree in the common Principles of Nature: And that which is natural to all, cannot be a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter by which one man is diſtinguiſhed from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But when a Man or Inſtitution is called Chriſtian, it is for ſomewhat peculiar, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from that which is common to all. And therefore though the Law of Nature be a branch of the Chriſtian Religion, as it was of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical,</hi> and is alſo in it ſelf of a never failing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; yet there is a ſupervenient Inſtitution, and ſomewhat beſides that which denominates us to be Chriſtians, without the belief and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of which, we can no more be entitled to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106697:4"/>
to that Character, than that can be called a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion which excludes, or is contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to the Laws of Nature, and the juſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Mankind.</p>
            <p>And of the number of ſuch Principles, which are neceſſary to the Conſtitution of Chriſtianity, and conſequently to the Character of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and are the Articles of his Faith, are the Incarnation and Nativity, the Death and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Glorification of our Saviour.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His Nativity and Incarnation. So 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 2, 3. <hi>He that denieth that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is not of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. His Death, as he died for Mankind, and was a Sacrifice for Sin. So St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 1, 2, 3. <hi>I declare unto you the Goſpel, which alſo ye have heard, and wherein ye ſtand, by which alſo ye are ſaved. For I delivered unto you firſt of all that which I alſo received, how that Chriſt died for our ſins accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures.</hi> So that to believe in Jeſus as the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and as a Suffering <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> was according to the Scriptures, and by the belief of which we are to be ſaved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His Reſurrection, and what was conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon it, his Glorification, the reward of his Humiliation. In which ſtate he is conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 8, 9.</note>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106697:5"/>
our Mediator. From the connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <note place="margin">1 Tim 2. 5, 6. Hebr. 9. 14, 15, 23. 1 John 2. 1, 2.</note> which two, his Death and Interceſſion, it is, that we ſeldom read in Scripture of the one without the other.</p>
            <p>Theſe are conſtituent and eſſential Articles of Chriſtianity; and if theſe, or any of theſe are omitted, as it is not Chriſtianity which is left, and it would be another Goſpel; ſo it is what the Apoſtle's Anathema will be applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to.</p>
            <p>From whence we may be able to anſwer the next Queſtion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is to be underſtood by <hi>another Goſpel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle ſpeaks here of <hi>another Goſpel,</hi> he thereby means ſomewhat that is added to it, and with it made neceſſary to Salvation, as it was when the obſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was maintained to be as obligatory to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as ever it had been to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From which Caſe, by a parity of Reaſon we may argue, That whatever alters the Terms and Conditions of the Goſpel, and makes that neceſſary to Salvation which the Goſpel has not made neceſſary; or that unneceſſary which the Goſpel has made neceſſary, is ſuch a perverting it as makes it another Goſpel: For that is to ſet
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106697:5"/>
up that as a Divine Revelation, which hath not the Divine Authority to confirm it.</p>
            <p>For it is God alone that can appoint the Terms of Salvation; and ſo, what no man, or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men, has any Authority in, to frame, alter or revoke. The neceſſary Articles of Faith, and Inſtances of our Duty, muſt have a Divine Eſtabliſhment; and ſo what we muſt learn ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the invariable Principles and Dictates of Human Nature, or pure Revelation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That is <hi>another Goſpel</hi> which pretends to a Revelation from God for its Authority, when it is of Human invention or imagination: And that whether for the matter of it, it be true, or falſe. It may for the matter of it be true, and yet not be a Revelation, but proceed only from men; and then to place that to the account of Revelation, though it be for the matter of it true, is a notorious falſhood and Impoſture. But if for the matter of it, it be falſe, it's a double Falſhood; as it pretends to a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is not Revelation, and alſo calls in the Veracity of God to give teſtimony to a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing then that the Immaculate Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Tranſubſtantiation and Purgatory are true, yet to plead a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106697:6"/>
for them, as it is pleaded in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Breviar. Rom. Octob 8. Bellarm. <hi>de Purg. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>de Eucha. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note>, if there were no ſuch Revelation, doth fix ſuch an indelible blot upon the pretended Infallible Church, as all the Water of <hi>Tiber</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cleanſe. But if it ſhould prove falſe (as thoſe things certainly are) then it is to add a ſort of Blaſphemy to the Impoſture, as it makes the God of Truth to juſtify a Falſhood.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That is another Goſpel, which doth eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh another Rule, or adds to, or detracts from that which is eſtabliſhed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 18.</p>
            <p>Now the Scripture is the Rule of Faith and Practice; and then to alter the Rule, by adding to it, or taking from it, is to alter the Goſpel (which that contains the Revelation of) as they do in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who not only add the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> to the Canon; but, as the <hi>Phariſees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> of old, give the ſame Authority to Unwritten Tradition, as to the Scripture; and require it to be received <hi>with the like pious regard,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, To alter, to add to, or diminiſh from the Fundamental Articles or Principles of it, is to make it another Goſpel; as it is to deny Chriſt to be a Mediator, or to appoint other Mediators than him, ſuch as Angels and Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106697:6"/>
By ſo doing, the Goſpel is rendred as imperfect, and the Scripture as an imperfect Revelation of it. But this there is no occaſion for, as I ſhall now ſhew by proving, That</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Goſpel, or Revelation, made known to the World by Jeſus Chriſt, is always to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue th  e ſame; and no new, or other Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be expected.</p>
            <p>This was the Sum of the laſt Lecture, and is to be the remaining Subject of this.</p>
            <p>There have been ſuch, in ſeveral Ages of the Church, both anciently, and of late, that have pretended to new Revelations; and that there was a more perfect Diſpenſation to enſue, than what was contained in the Goſpel. Of this Opinion were the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> of old; and of this mind ſeems to have been <hi>Abbas Joachim,</hi> who flouriſhed about the Year 1200. And what was alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly maintained in the <hi>Evangelium Aeternum,</hi> or <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> chiefly taken out of the  Works of <hi>Joachim,</hi> and publiſhed by the <hi>Mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi> Fryars about 1254. Wherein it was affirmed, <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. Par. <hi>Hiſt. An. Dom.</hi> 1255.</note> That the Doctrine of that Abbot excelled that of Chriſt: * That the Goſpel of Chriſt was to give way to another Goſpel, called the Everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting Goſpel; or Goſpel of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:106697:7"/>
And this was a Doctrine ſpread far and near, <note place="margin">Eymeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.

               </note> among the <hi>Beguardi</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Alumbrados</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Fratricelli</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp;c. The Spawn of which continued for a long ſeaſon in ſeveral parts, and in ſome till <hi>Ann. Dom.</hi> 1560<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who all agreed, that their Doctrine came from God by as immediate Inſpiration as ever the Goſpel of Chriſt did.</p>
            <p>I deny not, but that there may be ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Revelation or Inſpiration, with reſpect to ſome eſpecial Caſe: But as it may ariſe, for ought we know, from imagination, ſo if it be not attended with great caution and circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, may end in the Whims and Frenzies of a <hi>Brigit,</hi> a <hi>Catharina,</hi> or a Mother <hi>Juliana,</hi> and what not? Nay, it may proceed to the diſannulling the Goſpel it ſelf, and to the preferring their own Inſpirations (as they will have it) above it.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſing it to be true, that there may be now ſome particular Inſpirations from God in ſuch ſpecial caſes; yet it is to be ſuppoſed that they are agreeable to the Goſpel Revelation; but if once they contradict it, it can be no more a true Revelation, than the Goſpel can be falſe; and yet ſuch muſt be a Revelation that will make the Goſpel to ceaſe in its obligation, and to be of no more Authority to Mankind, than the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:106697:7"/>
When the obligation ariſes not from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, but from poſitive Inſtitution, it is in the power of the Lawgiver to bind or looſe, to eſtabliſh or evacuate a Law as he thinks fit. And thus it was in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which conſiſted of things typical, that had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial reference to that people, and the place of their Habitation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such were the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Tribes, the preſervation of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogies, their three great Feſtivals, their <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batical</hi> Year, and Year of <hi>Jubile,</hi> &amp;c. Of this temporary nature alſo were the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the Law, which either had a relation to the Cuſtoms of the Nations conterminous to them; or to a more perfect State that was in proceſs of time to ſucceed it. The Laws relating to which could not be ſuppoſed to be of any force, when They were excluded that Land, and the Tribes were loſt and confounded; no more than the Laws relating to the Wilderneſs and the Tabernable, could oblige them when they were ſetled in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and that they had a Temple erected there.</p>
            <p>And therefore the phraſe <hi>for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ever,</hi> when an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 29.</note> to the Conſtitution, muſt have a laxer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation accordingly allowed, which was, That it ſhould continue to oblige (as it follows
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106697:8"/>
often where that Phraſe is uſed) <hi>throughout their generations;</hi> that is, whilſt they were that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">Ex. 12. 17. Lev. 23. 14.</note> ſo embodied, and ſo ſituated.</p>
            <p>And had the Goſpel conſiſted of ſuch things that were thus mutable in themſelves, or thus peculiar to any People, Time, or Place; there might be reaſon to admit it to be temporary; and to be evacuated when time ſhould ſerve, as the Law was; But there is nothing either in the nature of the thing, nor is there any notification of the Divine Will concerning any time ſet for its expiration; but rather the contrary; and ſo there is not the ſame reaſon for a new Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation after the Evangelical, as there was for the Evangelical after the <hi>Moſaical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I grant that it is as poſſible in it ſelf for God to reveal himſelf at ſome time hereafter, as it was for him to have revealed himſelf here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore: And he that revealed himſelf under the Law, and at the firſt Inſtitution of the Goſpel, may, if he ſo pleaſe, after the ſame manner reveal himſelf at any time, or times. But he that will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the futurity of this, muſt have more to prove it than a poſſibility. It is certain God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed himſelf, and that the Goſpel was by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation from him: But there is not the like cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty for a Revelation after the Goſpel, or in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106697:8"/>
after-times of the Goſpel, as there is, that the Goſpel it ſelf was of Divine Revelation.</p>
            <p>It is certain that the Goſpel has been the only Revelation for above 1600 years paſt, and that we have had no other Revelation than that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scripture: And therefore whatever Pretences any Perſons or Age made to it, were <note place="margin">
                  <hi>V.</hi> Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dani <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. Ann. Dom.</hi> 1204. <hi>de Almarico</hi>
               </note> apparently Miſtakes and Impoſtures; for that Diſpenſation of the Holy Ghoſt, which each Sect fancied to be in their Age, or near to it, is yet to come, if ever it is to be.</p>
            <p>But to give ſome further light and force to this Argument, I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is no proof of any other Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, than the Goſpel of our Saviour, and now recorded and preſerved in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there is no need of any further Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Scripture ſhuts up all Revelation with it ſelf, ſo that no other Revelation is to be expected beyond it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is no proof of any other Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than what is contained in the Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:106697:9"/>
If any one will contend, that there either is, or ſhall be ſuch a Revelation, he muſt have ſome Revelation to prove it: And that muſt either be an antecedent Revelation, ſuch as Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is taken to be; or it muſt be ſome perſonal Revelation, made to himſelf, or to ſome other credible Perſon or Perſons.</p>
            <p>But where is the Revelation of this Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>If it be to be found in Scripture, where is the Prediction of ſuch a State, That the Goſpel ſhall be ſuperannuated, and another of greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſhall grow out of it?</p>
            <p>Under the Law there was a plain ſignification of another Revelation to be in the time of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and of a more perfect ſtate of things to enſue. But where are the Proofs as plain under the Goſpel for a New Revelation, as there were for that of the Goſpel under the Law? Or where is it ſaid of that, as it is of the Law, that it <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayeth,</hi> or is antiquated, <hi>and waxeth old,</hi> and ſo <hi>is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb. 8. 13.</note> 
               <hi>ready to,</hi> or ſhall at laſt, <hi>vaniſh away?</hi> Our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle here ſaith on the contrary, <hi>If we, or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from heaven, preach any other Goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accurſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106697:9"/>
If it be a perſonal Revelation, then we may reaſonably demand, Where is the Evidence for ſuch a Revelation?</p>
            <p>All Revelation muſt have a ſufficient Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and if it be a true Revelation, and what obliges us to receive it as ſuch, it will be able to produce its Evidence.</p>
            <p>And a New Revelation muſt ſuppoſe a better ſort of Evidence than the former, or at leaſt equal to it. There muſt be the like wonderful Works; the Blind muſt as miraculouſly be made to ſee, and the Lame to walk, and the Diſeaſed to be whole, and the Dead to riſe. Nay, Chriſt himſelf muſt again deſcend from Heaven, and dye, and riſe, and aſcend; or elſe the Miracles will fall ſhort of what it is in competition with.</p>
            <p>Nay, it muſt proceed farther, and its Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence muſt not only be equal, but ſuperior alſo to that which it is to ſupplant. It was not only fit that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Rod ſhould be turn'd into a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but when the Magicians pretended to do the ſame, to ſhew his Power to be greater than theirs, his Serpentine Rod ſwallowed up theirs.</p>
            <p>It was not enough that he brought forth <note place="margin">Ex. 7. 12. 2 Tim. 3. 8.</note> Frogs, when <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> produced the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106697:10"/>
like; but that he ſhould do what they could not, and ſo what would oblige them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it to be <hi>the Finger of God.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ex. 8. 18, 19.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And thus our Saviour being to advance a new Scheme of things, did not only ſhew he was the Perſon deſcribed, and propheſied of; but alſo by his numerous Miracles, and many of them ſuch as never any, neither <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Perſon, ever did work. <note place="margin">John 15. 24.</note>
            </p>
            <p>If then there be no ſuch Evidence for ſuch a new Revelation, (where there is a pretence to it) we may conclude it to be <hi>another Goſpel,</hi> a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſititious Revelation, and what is to have no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given to it, no regard paid to it. It's Anathema.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no need of any further Revelation. Revelation has ſomewhat in it of a Miracle; it is a way extraordinary; and as we cannot ſuppoſe God will work Miracles, and break through the ſtanding Laws of Nature, when there is no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for it, nor neceſſity to require it; ſo we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſuppoſe he will communicate himſelf by a way of Revelation, and immediate Inſpiration, and much leſs break down an Eſtabliſhed Order of his own appointment, when there is as much reaſon for the Continuance of it, as for the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and that it anſwers all the Ends for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106697:10"/>
which a new Conſtitution can be framed, or a new Revelation made.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle argues, <hi>If the firſt Covenant had</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 8. 7.</note> 
               <hi>been faultleſs, there ſhould no place have been ſought for the ſecond:</hi> And if <hi>there be a place</hi> for a Third, there muſt be ſome fault or imperfection charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon the Second. But that I ſhall ſhew it to be freed from; and that the Second Covenant or Goſpel-Revelation is ſo perfect, that there is no need of another. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) There can be no more noble and uſeful Subject for a Revelation, than that of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which is concerning God's Reconciliation to Mankind, and their Redemption by the Death of his Son.</p>
            <p>And where this is plainly revealed, there is no place for a Second, nor any need of a new Revelation.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) If we conſider the Goſpel-Revelation as a Covenant, conſiſting of Promiſes and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; there cannot be more excellent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial than thoſe, nor more neceſſary than theſe.</p>
            <p>For what can be propoſed of greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage unto Mankind, than what the Goſpel offers to thoſe that believe and obey it? It is no leſs
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106697:11"/>
than the favour of God, the bleſſing and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Providence, the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, and in the cloſe of all, Everlaſting Life, a tranſlation out of this mortal, uncomfortable, and uncertain State, to a State of unchangeable Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; where Body and Soul ſhall again be united, <hi>When this corruptible ſhall put on incorruption, and this mortal ſhall put on immortality.</hi> An Encouragement that is the higheſt Cordial that can work upon Humane Nature, and will (if any Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can) qualify the Troubles of this preſent Life, and ſet a man above the fears of an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion out of it.</p>
            <p>And when this is promiſed, there can nothing be offer'd beyond it; nor is there any need to find out others after this is propoſed.</p>
            <p>And ſuch as the Promiſes are, ſuch are the Conditions required of us, which are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable as the Reward: thoſe indeed are unchangeable from the Divine Declaration, and God's faithfulneſs; but theſe are unchangeable from the nature of the things, as well as the Divine Command. So that there is no room for another Revelation, unleſs we can change the nature of things, and make <hi>evil good, and good evil; and put darkneſs for light, and light for dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> unleſs we will diſſolve all Order, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106697:11"/>
confound all Relations, and ſet the Creature looſe from all obligations of Love, and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and Service to the Creator. Terms ſurely uncapable of abatement or alteration. For who can ſuppoſe Mankind ſhould be left at liberty, whether they would love God, or neglect him; whether obey, or violate his Laws; whether they would be vertuous or vicious; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would believe in Jeſus, and own him to be their Saviour; or, with the <hi>Jews,</hi> reject him, and <hi>not have him to reign over them?</hi> Alter the Promiſes and Conditions, and there is <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Goſpel,</hi> and another Revelation; but till they are altered, or alterable, there needs no New Revelation.</p>
            <p>All the abatements or relaxations that can be allowed, are inſerted into the body of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; where there is a two fold allowance; an allowance of remiſſion for whatever ſins are paſt, and truly repented of; and an allowance for Humane Infirmities under the ſtricteſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to our duty. And lower than theſe the Goſpel doth not, nor for the reaſon before gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, can deſcend; ſince then it would counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance Impenitence, and eſtabliſh Iniquity by a Law; and then indeed it had been an imperfect, a defective, a faulty Covenant, and there would have been a place for a New.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:106697:12"/>
(3.) The extent of this Law, or New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, is ſuch as none can exceed it; for it is as much fitted for the whole Race of Mankind, as any could be for any particular Nation. The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Law to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſuited to their Temper and Circumſtances in its original Frame and Conſtitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo what other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as Nations, could not come within the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of; nor could particular Perſons, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than as they became Proſelytes, and made themſelves ſubject to it by the ſame way of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation in Circumciſion. And it is of the nature of all Humane Laws (though the general Lines running through them are one and the ſame) that they are fitted for the immediate uſe and ſervice of that People, whoſe Laws they are; and which therefore vary infinitely, and alter as Circumſtances alter, and as Reaſons of State require.</p>
            <p>But now the Goſpel-Diſpenſation compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends in it all Nations, and they are all to that as if they were but one People. It was our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Commiſſion to his Apoſtles after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19. Mark 16. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Goſpel to every creature.</hi> And ſuch as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was, ſuch were the Rules and Precepts they were to give and publiſh, which were of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106697:12"/>
univerſal concernment and obligation; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confined by Perſons nor Places, by Times nor Circumſtances, but what all Perſons, in all Places, Times and Circumſtances, are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to obſerve; and which are of that nature, and have ſuch a tendency to the good welfare and happineſs of Mankind, whether alone, or in Society, whether as particular Perſons, or Families, or Nations; that if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerved, purity, and peace, and love would every where abound, and the Earth be a kind of Paradiſe again.</p>
            <p>And therefore, if there be any Narrowneſs of mind, and feuds among Mankind, if Vice and Wickedneſs overflow the World, it is not for want of a Law every way perfect to bind and reſtrain them; or that there need <hi>another Goſpel</hi> to mend them; but for the reaſon given by St. <hi>James,—from their luſts that war in their members.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 4. 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) If we conſider the Evidence given to the Goſpel-Revelation, we ſhall find there needs no other evidence to be given to that Revelation; nor that there needs any other Revelation for want for want of Evidence in this. Our Saviour's Life was a Life of Miracles as well as Innocence; and where ever he went, the Divine Power went along with him; for <hi>in him dwelt the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:106697:13"/>
               <hi>of the Godhead bodily.</hi> And which he exerted where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ever he came, and as occaſion ſerved, to the confuſion, if not the convicton or converſion of his Adverſaries; and all which at laſt concluded in his own Reſurrection from the dead, his Aſcenſion into Heaven, and the effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt, which began on <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> but like a torrent ran on through the Apoſtolical Age, and bore down all manner of competition. And what then can any Revelation pretend to beyond it? or where can there be any that can be ſuppos'd to produce the like Evidence for its veracity? (as I have juſt before obſerv'd.)</p>
            <p>Laſtly, How can we have a Goſpel that can pretend to vye with that which the Son of God came into the World to reveal, who was the laſt that was to come from Heaven; and when our <hi>Faith</hi> is that which was once <hi>delivered to the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jude 3.</note> 
               <hi>Saints. Once for all;</hi> and ſo there is no more ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith or Revelation to be expected after that, than another Mediator after Him, who was <hi>once offered to bear the ſins of many.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 9. 28.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This leads to the Third Branch.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Scripture ſhuts up all with this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and becauſe we have now no Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but that Written Revelation, we cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106697:13"/>
any Revelation beyond it, and much leſs derogatory to it; or that ſhall direct us to any other way by which we are to be ſaved, than that we <hi>have already received,</hi> and is therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.</p>
            <p>I have before obſerved, that the time from <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm.</hi> 8. <hi>of the laſt Year.</hi>
               </note> our Bleſſed Saviour's appearance, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Goſpel by him (to his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) is called the <hi>laſt days</hi> in Scripture, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently has none to ſucceed it. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>As it is appointed unto men once to die, but after</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Hebr. 9. 27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>this the judgment: So Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many; and unto them that look for him, ſhall he appear the ſecond time; without a</hi> ſin-offering, <hi>unto ſalvation.</hi> That is, as there is no alteration in the ſtate from Death unto Judgment, but as men dye, ſo they will appear to be at Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So there is no alteration to be between Chriſt's firſt appearing, when he offered himſelf; and his ſecond, when he <hi>ſhall ſo come in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as he was ſeen to go into heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore there is to be any alteration as to this Revelation, it is not to be before, but muſt be after our Saviour's ſecond appearance. But of that we have nothing to ſay.</p>
            <p>Thus far as I have conſider'd the Argument, there may be very few ſuppoſed to be concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106697:14"/>
that is, ſuch as ſet up another Revelation in oppoſition to the Goſpel-Revelation; or that maintain the Revelation of the Goſpel to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temporary, and that it ſhall have its ſeaſon in which it is to expire, and be ſucceeded by another. And it may ſeem to be ſcarcely worth the while to have ſpent ſo much time upon it with reſpect to ſuch wild Enthuſiaſts as have been, and ſtill are in the World.</p>
            <p>But however, what has been hitherto ſaid, may be of further uſe with reference to another Caſe, juſt mentioned before, and that is the Caſe of perſonal and occaſional Revelation; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 10.</note> which may be conceived only to ſerve to a more ſpiritual manifeſtation of the Revelation already received, and ſo be no more derogatory to that Revelation, than occaſional or perſonal Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation heretofore in the <hi>Moſaical</hi> State was to the Body of that Law which was of immediate and Divine Revelation, and of univerſal obligation to that People.</p>
            <p>I would not altogether deny this; becauſe I know not how far ſome Perſons may in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be enlightned by a Spirit of Prophecy; nor what particular directions they may receive in an extraordinary way in ſome ſpecial Caſes with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of God; which may be like a ſpecial Providence to ſome particular perſons. But now as a man muſt govern himſelf by the general Rules of Divine Providence, and not by particular; and becauſe he has ſometimes met with Deliverances, and Supplies, and Directions beyond all his own fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and reaſoning, muſt not forſake his own reaſoning and care, and wholly rely upon the Extraordinary: So it is to be here; a perſon may perhaps have ſome occaſional Revelation, ſome Divine Inſpiration, at ſome ſpecial Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or in ſome ſpecial Caſe; but if he forſakes the Ordinary to depend upon the Extraordinary, and expects Revelation in every caſe, becauſe he has had it in ſome particulars, he will as much be ſubject to error, and err no leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly, than if he wholly relied upon Divine Providence, and forſook all other means what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>And truly this is a way much liable to be abuſed, and to miſlead perſons, and is very ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious and dangerous.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a Caſe liable to impoſture and abuſe, foraſmuch as thoſe that are under the influence of ſuch a conception, are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, if at all, capable of making a certain judgment of it. For it is all tranſacted

within, and the Imagination may be ſo much influenced by the Body, and by an agitation of the Humours and Animal Spirits, from an Enthuſiaſtal and even a devout Temper, by prepoſſeſſions and foreconceived Principles, and even by the Circumſtances of Life, that it may be wholly natural; as natural as Dreams, or the Deliriums of a Fever, which proceed from the ebullition of the Blood, and ſuch like ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Cauſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Perſons have been impoſed upon, and taken the effect of Imagination for Inſpiration and Divine Illumination. I am far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning all the Inſtances of this kind, of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy, and of a deſign to deceive, like <hi>Maria Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitationis</hi> in <hi>Portugal.</hi> I will rather think more charitably, That very often they have thought themſelves thus moved and acted by the Spirit of God: And yet notwithſtanding all their Pretences, and the opinion others have had of them, it has been afterwards evident, that it has been far from being a Divine Infuſion and Illumination.

            </p>
            <p>Now if we would but alter the place, and for the Nunnery conceive her to be in a Hoſpital, we ſhould take it to be, what that Author in a tranſport ſometimes calls it, a <hi>Phrenzy.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. They are very much to be ſuſpected of Impoſture.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) And that becauſe we read ſo little of this way in Scripture, even in the Apoſtolical Times, and nothing to encourage us in the expectation of it afterwards: We read nothing there of the <hi>Union of the Soul to the Divine Eſſence,</hi> of <hi>its being abſorpt and drowned over head and ears, and ingulphed in the depth of Divinity, ſo that it became one and the ſame</hi>

               <hi>with God,</hi> by a <hi>true Deification.</hi> We read
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106697:16"/>
there ſparingly of ſome Extaſies; as one of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and one or two of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> but with how much reſerve and modeſty doth the Holy Apoſtle ſpeak, when he comes to <hi>Viſions and Revelations of the Lord,</hi> when he <hi>heard unſpeakable</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what can be greater, if theſe of <hi>Tereſia</hi> be true? And where might we more expect to be entertained with the Relations of ſuch <hi>Rapts,</hi> as in the Goſpel? So that when they are there ſo unuſual, and here ſo frequent, that even So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties are embodied and formed from it, we have reaſon to ſuſpect.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) It's much to be ſuſpected, when that which is the proper means of judging, and of diſtinguiſhing Imagination from Revelation, is laid aſide, which is Reaſon; and when all is reſolved into the Perſon's own teſtimony.</p>
            <p>We are required in all Caſes to <hi>ſearch,</hi> and to <hi>try,</hi> which doth ſuppoſe the free exerciſe of our Reaſon; and when this is rejected, 'tis a ſign there is no truth in the thing pretended.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) It is ſuſpicious, when they exalt their own private Revelations to the ſame Authority with the Revelations of Holy Writ; and ſeek to juſtify the one by the other.</p>

(4.) When they eſteem the way of Religion, as deſcrib'd in Scripture, to be mean, in compariſon of this that they are in, and prefer this way of Contemplation and Inſpiration above the plain Precepts of Chriſtianity: When it is a condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them to join in External Worſhip. Thus it is given by Father <hi>Ubald</hi> as an inſtance of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of one to ſome degree of this rapturous ſtate, that when the hour of Prayer was ſpent, <hi>he could hardly be perſuaded that it was ſo, not knowing</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 57. <hi>n.</hi> 4.</note> 
               <hi>what Prayer he was in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the famous <hi>Quietiſt, Molinos,</hi> reports of <hi>Gregory Lopez,</hi> 
               <q>That having for the ſpace of <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>So that all is by this means reſolved into a ſpiritual and ſenſeleſs frame and courſe, a certain ſtilneſs and quietneſs, as <hi>Molinos</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>when</hi>

            <p>A ſtate of Perfection that is above what the Goſpel doth deſcribe; and is <hi>another Goſpel</hi> than what we have in Scripture received; and which there needs an uncontroulable Evidence for; the want of which increaſeth the ſuſpicion. For,</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) There is no Evidence for all this beyond their own ſimple affirmation. And who is there without good Evidence that can believe that thoſe Rapturous Ladies, (ſuch as <hi>Santa Tereſa,</hi> and <hi>Donna Marina d' Eſcobar)</hi> did in <hi>Molinos</hi>'s Phraſe, <hi>hear and talk with God hand to hand;</hi> when he reads the interlocutory matters that are ſaid <note place="margin">

            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:106697:17"/>
The World, eſpecially one part of it, has been much impoſed upon, when credulous this way. The Pretence aboveſaid, of <hi>Maria Viſitationis,</hi> is an Inſtance beyond all exception, who impoſed upon her Confeſſor (no leſs a man than <hi>Lewis Granada)</hi> the Inquiſition, and even <note place="margin">
                  <hi>V. Lud. à Paramo de</hi> Orig. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit. &amp; Bp.</hi> Wor. <hi>Fanat. of the Church of</hi> Rome.</note> on the Pope himſelf: And yet notwithſtanding ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſomewhat more than internal for her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with our Saviour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was detected at laſt of notorious Impoſture.</p>
            <p>But moſt of the Viſionaries (we are ſpeaking of) pretended not to ſo much. And therefore where there is no external Evidence attempted by them, nor that we have the gift of Intuition to ſee into their inward and Self-evidence, we have no reaſon to think otherwiſe of ſuch Illuminations, and Introverſions, and Interlocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than at beſt the effects of an heated Imagination. But of this before.</p>
            <p>And ſo much the rather are we to be careful in theſe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 15.</note> matters, and not to be too eaſy of belief,</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe it may be very dangerous in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it. For if inſtead of a Star, it ſhould prove an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> whither may not Perſons be led under the deluſion of it? For what will not be concluded to be lawful, nay, a duty, which Revelation ſhall warrant? And where will this end, if it once be credited, and that we commit our ſelves implicitly and blindly to ſuch an uncertain Guide? So that in the iſſue, ſuch a Spirit of Revelation, as it is not promiſed by God, and therefore not reaſonable to be expected; ſo it is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this with a Saying of one converſant <note place="margin">Ubald. <hi>ibid. part.</hi> 3. <hi>c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>great Saints that never had any of them; and others that had Viſions and Guſts are not therefore Saints; for true Sanctity doth conſiſt in ſolid vertue, and true conformity of our will to the will of God in all things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I freely acknowledge that there will be a great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the preſent ſtate of the Church, before the cloſe of the whole, and before an end ſhall be put to Chriſt's Mediatory Kingdom upon Earth; When <hi>the</hi>
