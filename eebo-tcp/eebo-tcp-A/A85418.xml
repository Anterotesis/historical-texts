            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What good, or hurt, they will or are like to doe, now they are gotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, is not eaſie, either for thee, or me, ſo much as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. Be it in this, as God and men ſhall agree. When the danger of the diſeaſe runs high, there is little hope but onely in that phyſicke, whereof there is ſome feare. We are under a bondage of much miſery, and it is onely the <hi>Truth</hi> (as our Saviour ſaith) that can <hi>make us free:</hi> and yet<note place="margin">Joh. 8. 32.</note> ſuch is our condition and miſery, that there is cauſe to feare, leſt the Truth, which onely is able to <hi>make us free,</hi> ſhould increaſe our bondage and miſery, by being rejected and oppoſed by us, when it comes in love and mercy to <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit</hi> us, and to <hi>bleſſe</hi> us out of our miſery. <hi>For this end I was borne</hi> (as our Saviour ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Joh. 18. 37.) that I ſhould beare witneſſe to the truth,</hi> not to the opinions or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of men. In which reſpect I know I am like to have the harder quarter and ſervice in the world; but God hath made me a lover of men in ſuch a degree, that I can willingly conſecrate my ſelfe unto their ſervice, through any ſufferings from them. If this world faile me, I know God hath prepared another for a reſerve, which will ſtand by me, and will not faile. Reader, take my prayers along with thee, and an honeſt heart of thine own; and ſo paſſe on to the Sermons before thee; doubtleſſe they will either ſtrengthen thy hand in the way thou art in, or guide thy feet into a way thou art not in, or at leaſt qualifie thy ſpirit with chriſtian patience and reſpects towards ſuch a way.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:125233:4"/>
it was that brought forth this fruit of death, what ſin by name it was amongſt them, that had ſeparated between him and them in their late ſad miſcarriage, yea, and would ſeparate ſtill, to their further and greater miſery, except they took a courſe to make an atonement for themſelves, by purging and clenſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from it. Onely the diſcovery or finding out of the perſon that had committed the ſin, was put upon <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the people; wherein yet againe they were directed by God to ſuch a method or means for this diſcovery, that God himſelfe may be ſaid too to have diſcovered even the ſinner alſo. For he it was, that by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall directing hand of his providence, cauſed the lot to fall upon <hi>Achan,</hi> who was the man that in taking the <hi>excommunicate thing,</hi> had fin'd that great and ſpeciall provocation, which was fallen in this guſt of wrath from Heaven upon the people. Theſe things you ſhall finde related more at large <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. From which paſſages by the way (amongſt many other very obſervable) you may take knowledge of theſe three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That when God is at any time ingaged, and his hand in (as we uſe to ſay) ſhewing mercy and doing good to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he is ſeldome or never wont to change or alter the tenour of his preſent diſpenſations, to break off the courſe of his grace by ſuffering evill to come upon them, but upon ſome ſpeciall diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent taken, from ſome ſpeciall ſin or other, one or more, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That ſometimes the ſin of one or of ſome few, in a great ſocietie or body of people, in the provocation or guilt of it, redounds and runs over to the involving and defiling of the whole ſocietie, and rendring all the members thereof obnoxious to the diſpleaſure of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the beſt, if not the onely way for the people of God, being under the disfavour of God, and ſtroke of his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to make atonement for themſelves, and to recover his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, is to make diligent ſearch and ſtrict inquiry, what that ſin by name ſhould be, which hath turned away the heart of their God from them, and accordingly to remove it.</p>
            <p>My Brethren, the caſe of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon their loſſe neere unto the Citie of <hi>Ai,</hi> is our condition and caſe at this day; ſave onely that the hand of God hath been laid heavier upon us,

then it was upon them, in that breach. God had begun to doe great and gracious things for us, yea he had gon on for a good ſpace together, treading and trampling downe the ſtrength of our Enemies under us apace; inſomuch, that wee began to take our Harps down from the willow trees, on which we had hung them, to prepare our ſelves to ſing <hi>the ſong of Moſes, the man of God:</hi> but loe on the ſuddaine wee are <hi>ſmitten</hi> back againe <hi>into the places of Dragons,</hi> and the God of our lives <hi>hath covered us with the ſhadow of Death.</hi> That viſion of peace and good things which was let downe from heaven unto us, and was come ſo neere us, that wee began to ariſe, thinking none other but to fall to and eate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; is now againe taken up from us into the heavens, and we have loſt the ſight of it. The beſt art and wiſdome we can uſe to open the heavens over us, and cauſe them to deliver downe that treaſure againe to us, to heale our preſent wound, if it be not dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is to make as narrow a ſearch, as ſtrict an inquiry, as we can, what that particular and ſpeciall ſin or provocation amongſt us is, the chaſtiſement whereof is now upon us, and which hath brought the rod of this indignation upon our backs. If God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would pleaſe by ſpeciall revelation to make knowne what this ſin is, as he did unto <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſatisfaction in this point were at hand, nor ſhould we need to abide the various and conjecturall diſcourſes of men, Miniſters or others, about the matter: But having perfected that ſtanding Revelation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the Scriptures, he refraines revelations extraordinary, and leaves his people to conſult with theſe Oracles of his for reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in all ſuch caſes of Queſtion and difficulty as this; onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing the gracious aſſiſtance and guidance of his Spirit unto thoſe that ſhall aske it of him, and not lay ſtumbling blocks in their way otherwiſe, to direct them in ſuch dark and dubious inquiries as theſe. And one ſpeciall end (I conceive) ay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:125233:5"/>
that I made choice of the Scripture read unto you, upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion; Conceiving that very ſin to be there deſcribed, yea, and expreſſed by name, (though ſomewhat more generall) which hath occaſioned the ſad interruption of late made in our hopefull proceedings, yea, and which in all likelihood wrought againſt us formerly, both in that blow which was reached us from heaven, in that as ſtrange, as ſorrowfull a defeat at <hi>Newark,</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; but was not then known or conſidered of. The Lord grant that yet at laſt it may enter into all our hearts to conceive aright, and to conſider of it, leſt it brings forth yet againe like bitter fruits, yea, and magnifies it ſelfe at laſt in our utter ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>But let us addreſſe unto the words; and in them conſider, firſt, their relation and coherence in the Context, and then their ſenſe and meaning. For the former; the words are part of a ſpeech made by one <hi>Gamaliel</hi> (as he is called <hi>ver.</hi> 34.) a Phariſee, and Doctor of the Law, in an Aſſembly or Councell at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The Councell (as appeares <hi>ver.</hi> 21. &amp;c.) was called, about the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, their Doctrine and proceedings; the chief deſigne and intendment of it, was to conſider and reſolve what courſe to take with them, how to ſuppreſſe both them and their Doctrine, being both looked upon as prejudiciall to their perſonall and private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, both of honour and profit, in that State and Nation; and as likely to carry away the hearts and affections of much people from them. When they had ſent for <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles by a Captain with his Officers, to appeare before the Councell, the Prolocutor or chief Prieſt, charged them after this manner: <hi>ver. 28. Did not we ſtraitly command you, that you ſhould not teach in this Name? and yee have filled Jeruſalem with your Doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> When <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles, ſtanding ſtiffe to their tackling, had made their anſwer, fully juſtifying what they had done, and given a brief accompt of that Doctrine about which they were queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and of their calling to preach and beare witneſſe of the ſame unto the world; it is ſaid (<hi>ver.</hi> 33.) that the Councell, ſeeing them upon thoſe termes, hearing them ſpeake at ſuch a rate, <hi>burſt in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for anger</hi> (as the former tranſlation) or (as the latter hath it) <hi>were cut at the heart, and took counſell how to ſlay them.</hi> What? would they not ſubmit to the Authority and advice of ſuch a Reverend,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125233:5"/>
learned, and pious Aſſembly as that? Did they thinke themſelves wiſer then they? would they preach a Doctrine that ſhould aſperſe them, and bring them out of credit and requeſt with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Such men as they were not meet to be <hi>tolerated</hi> in the State, nor yet to live; and therefore they would fall upon ſome courſe, how to free themſelves, the State and Nation of them, and that muſt be in no lighter way, with no lower hand, then death it ſelfe, they muſt die for it. This (it ſeems) was the ſenſe and reſolution of the generality of the Aſſembly, untill one of them, (that <hi>Gamaliel</hi> we ſpeake of) a man of a better temper and deeper reach then his fellowes, excited to ſpeak, and aſſiſted in ſpeciall manner by God in ſpeaking, by a grave Speech tending to moderation, qualified their ſpirits in part, and brought them to accept of ſomewhat a lighter attonement from the Apoſtles, for their ſuppoſed ſin, then their lives would have amounted unto. For their ſpirits were ſo full of bitterneſs and indignation againſt them, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all that <hi>Gamaliel</hi> could ſay, they were reſolved to have their peniworths of them, (as we uſe to ſay) to eaſe themſelves on them ſo far, as to cauſe them to be beaten, and withall, ſeverely to charge them the ſecond time, to give over preaching their erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and dangerous Doctrine, <hi>to ſpeak no more in the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ver.</hi> 40. What the tenor of <hi>Gamaliels</hi> Speech was, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining to the end of it, you may read, beginning at <hi>ver.</hi> 35. untill the end of 39. <hi>Men of Iſrael, take heed to your ſelves, what yee do to theſe men;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid, yee will but run a needleſſe hazard of bringing evill, or ruine upon your ſelves by attempting any thing for the preſent, in a way of violence againſt theſe men; implying, that men had need take heed how they ingage themſelves to ſuppreſſe, moleſt, or deſtroy any generation or ſort of men whatſoever, untill they have a cleer and expreſſe warrant from heaven for the execution. To perſwade them not to be too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate or forward in any courſe of violence againſt the Apoſtles, he declares to them by a double inſtance (well known unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) that if they be ſeducers and evill men, and ſo worthy to be deſtroyed, God himſelf would in a ſhort time, reveal his wrath from heaven againſt them, and bring them and their work to ruin.

Upon the mention of theſe two memorable examples of Divine juſtice againſt Seducers and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, he infers as followeth in the words read unto you.</p>

However, by this double Caution or Item he gives unto them, not to have any thing to do (for the preſent) with the Apoſtles, in any way of moleſtation, he diſcovers an utter averſeneſſe in him to ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. Wherefore he gives this reaſon further.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For if this counſell or work be of men, it will come to nought] i.</hi> If the deſign which theſe men drive, with the method, courſe and means whereby they carry it on, hath no better foundation to bear it up, but either their own wiſdomes, intereſt, and authority, or ſome other mens, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, it will be diſſolved, or come to nought, it will ſoon diſcover its originall by its end, if it were taken out of the duſt, to duſt it will return; and they that are ingaged in it, will fall and ſink with it. <hi>But if it be from God] i.</hi> If it be countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or authorized by God, if he be the Founder of it; <hi>Yee cannot deſtroy or diſſolve it, leſt, &amp;c. i.</hi> you muſt not, or you ought not, to attempt any thing againſt it to deſtroy or diſſolve it, becauſe by ſuch an attempt as this, you will do no better then <hi>fight againſt God. Yee cannot] viz.</hi> lawfully, or wiſely, or upon any good ground. There is a double impotency, or impoſſibility often mentioned in Scripture; the one we may call <hi>naturall,</hi> or <hi>phyſicall,</hi> the other <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:125233:6"/>
With the firſt kinde of impoſſibility, things are ſaid to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, when there wants a naturall or executive principle of ſtrength or power in any kind to do them: with the latter, that is ſaid to be unpoſſible for a man to do, for the doing wherof he hath no ground or warrant either in the Word of God, or in reaſon or equity, though he hath never ſo much naturall ſtrength or power to do it. Of this latter kind, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. where he ſaith, <hi>that hee could do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth;</hi> meaning, that he had no ground or warrant, either from God, or otherwiſe, to do any ſuch thing. So again, 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 21. Yee cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of the Devill; i.</hi> yee cannot do it <hi>lawfully;</hi> or with any congruity either to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtianity, or of ſound reaſon. Of this kind of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency or impoſſibility, that common ſaying in the Civill Law ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <hi>Id tantum poſſumus, quod jure poſſumus.</hi> Of the other kind, we have many inſtances alſo; <hi>I ſpake to thy Diſciples to caſt him out, but they could not (Mar. 9. 18.) i.</hi> they wanted an executive principle or power, whereby to do it: otherwiſe it was lawfull enough for them to have done it. So again, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. 19. and <hi>Mar.</hi> 2. 4. beſides many other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deſtroy or diſſolve it] i.</hi> do or attempt any thing to deſtroy it. Not only the endevours and attempts, but even the purpoſes and intents of doing things, are often in Scripture expreſſed by words, which properly ſignifie the doing or effecting the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Many good works</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh. 10. 32) have I ſhewed you from my Father: for which of theſe works do you ſtone me? i.</hi> do you intend, or go about to ſtone me? for they had not yet actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtoned him. Thus <hi>Heb. 11. 17. Abraham</hi> is twice ſaid to have <hi>offered up his ſon Iſaac,</hi> becauſe he was fully intended, and had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to offer him.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) the blood of the Prophets, and of the Saints, and of all that were ſlain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth;</hi> meaning, that whereas this City had till now thought her ſelf the moſt religious City under heaven, the Mother and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſs of Prophets and Saints, an enemy only unto Heretiques and perſons hatefull unto God; now when God came to call her to an account, and to <hi>enter into judgement with her,</hi> contrary to her expectation and opinion of her ſelf, ſhe was diſcovered and evicted to have been the moſt cruell and bloody enemy that ever <hi>Prophets</hi> or <hi>Saints</hi> had, yea, and further, a principall Actreſs in the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of many millions otherwiſe. So <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> expreſſing himſelf thus to the Councell, <hi>leſt you be FO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ND even fighters againſt God;</hi> gives them to underſtand, that how holy, wiſe, or juſt ſoever they might ſeem in their own eyes, yea, and might think themſelves the furtheſt of any men under heaven from practiſing or <hi>fighting againſt God,</hi> yet if they went on with their preſent intentions and reſolutions againſt the men they had now before them, they might fall into this heavie guilt and condemnation, when they thought leaſt of it.

Thus <hi>Gamaliel</hi> admoniſhing his Colleagues, to conſider well what they did, <hi>leſt they ſhould be found EVEN figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt God,</hi> plainly intimates unto you, that this is one of the worſt ſtones in the world to ſtumble at, and that no improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or inconſiderateneſs whatſoever beſides, is like to make any ſuch breach upon the comfort and peace of the creature, as for men to ingage themſelves in any ſuch action or courſe, wherein they ſhall be found fighters againſt God.</p>

               </gap>, <hi>Fighters againſt God</hi>]. Every act of ſin, eſpecially with knowledge and conſent of will, is (in a ſenſe) a <hi>fighting againſt God:</hi> but that ſin which <hi>Gamaliel</hi> here intends in his expreſſion of <hi>fighting againſt God,</hi> is a ſin of an higher nature then ordinary, as appeares by the particle <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>even,</hi> joyn'd with it, and formerly opened. Therefore by <hi>fighting againſt God</hi> (in this place) muſt needs be meant ſome high and peremptory action or ingagement of the creature, wherein it oppoſeth God in ſome ſpeciall or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable deſign, which he ſeeketh either to ſet on foot, or elſe to carry on in the world, whether the oppoſer knowes it to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of God's or no. And thus the propagating of that Doctrine, which the Apoſtles preached, being a deſigne of God, the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the councell againſt it, eſpecially with ſo high an hand as the cruſhing, or ſlaying of the Apoſtles, who were appointed by God to publiſh it, would have been, was, and would have been very properly, <hi>a fighting againſt God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words explain'd, are matter ready prepared for Doctrine and obſervation. Onely one word (by the way) for Anſwer to that Queſtion; What authoritie, weight, or credit, is to be given to that which <hi>Gamaliel</hi> delivers in this ſpeech of his to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell? Whether may we build upon every thing, or any thing, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by him, as authorized by God?</p>
            <p>I anſwer;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That there is little queſtion to be made, but that the Spirit

of the man, was in ſpeciall manner touch'd and ſtirr'd up by the Spirit of God, to interpoſe in the behalfe of the Apoſtles, as he did; as the ſpirit of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> (another branch of the ſame root) formerly had been, to ſtand up and ſpeake in the behalfe of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 51.</item>
               <item>2. The principall end and ſcope of what he ſpake, being the reſcuing of the Apoſtles from the bloudy Counſells of thoſe who had concluded their death, and were conſulting about the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; plainly ſheweth, that there was more of God then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the thing, eſpecially if we conſider further, that he who thus inexpectedly appeared with ſhield and buckler for the Apoſtles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, was of that ſect or generation of men, who generally hated and oppoſed the Doctrine of Chriſt with more inveterate and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous malignitie of ſpirit, then any other.</item>
               <item>3. Evident it is, 1. that the intent, end, and ſcope of <hi>Gamaliel</hi> in this ſpeech to the Councell, being the bringing of the Apoſtles from the bloudy rage and violence of men, was good, and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the will and word of God. And 2. as evident likewiſe it is, that the ſpeech it ſelfe, in the whole carriage, and in all the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it, is duly, and with all exactneſſe of wiſdome and prudence, proportioned to the end, and tends in a direct and regular way to effect it. Now whatſoever directly and regularly tends to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of that which is good, muſt needs be good, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from God. That which is good may occaſionally and by ſome collaterall influence of Providence, be brought to paſſe, by means that are evill; but in a regular and direct way, it can onely be produced by that which is good. There is no more friendſhip or fellowſhip naturally, between good ends and ill means, then is between <hi>light and darkneſſe, Chriſt and Belial.</hi> But</item>

            <p>In the words, there be theſe ſix enſuing Points of Doctrine, faire and large, beſides many others of a more collaterall and illa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive obſervation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, From thoſe words, <hi>ver. 38. And now I ſay unto you, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from theſe men, and let them alone: for, &amp;c.</hi> Obſerve, that <hi>it is a point of much wiſdome to forbeare the oppreſsion, or ſuppreſsion of ſuch perſons, Doctrines, and wayes, which men have any reaſonable cauſe at all to judge or thinke, that they are, or may be, from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, From thoſe doubtfull expreſſions of ſo great a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Law, and one that knew how to meaſure and eſtimate the Authoritie and weight of a Councell-determination, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides can no wayes be ſuſpected of any diſaffection or prejudicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt ſuch Authoritie, from thoſe doubtfull expreſſions (I ſay) of this man, <hi>If this counſell or work be of men, &amp;c.</hi> And againe, <hi>If it be of God, &amp;c.</hi> Obſerve, That <hi>the determination of a Councell, or of the major part of a Councell againſt a way, Doctrine, or practice, is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative or ſufficient proofe for any wiſe man to reſt or build upon, that ſuch a way, Doctrine, or practice, are not from God.</hi> The whole Councell, as you heard, this one man excepted, had peremptorily concluded the Doctrine and practice of the Apoſtles, to be, not from God, but from men, and thereupon were in high conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuppreſſe them, and that by death; yet all this did not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>Gamaliel</hi> in point of judgement or conſcience, he was ſtill but where he was, doubtfull and in ſuſpence with himſelfe about the buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From that clauſe, <hi>If this counſell or work be from men, it will come to nought</hi>] Obſerve, that <hi>every invention, contrivance, way, or device of man, eſpecially in things either appertaining or pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appertaine unto God, in matters of Religion, will in time weare out into nothing and be diſſolved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, From the Connexion or dependance between the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and latter parts of <hi>ver. 39. But if it be from God, yee cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, leſt, &amp;c.</hi> Obſerve, That <hi>for any man, or men, to attempt the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of any Doctrine, way, or practiſe that is from God, is to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fiftly, From that ſignificant phraſe or expreſſion, of being
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:125233:9"/>
               <hi>FOVND fighters againſt God,</hi> ver. 39. Obſerve, <hi>that many, who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly for the preſent may conceive and thinke, and that with much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they fight for God, when the truth comes to an unpartiall and perfect ſcanning, will be found to have fought againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixtly, (and laſtly) From the importance and weight of that emphaticall particle, <hi>even,</hi> in the laſt clauſe, <hi>Leſt yee be found EVEN fighters againſt God;</hi> Obſerve, that <hi>fighting againſt God, is a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous poſture or ingagement, for a creature to be taken or found in by God at any time.</hi> The dread and terror of ſuch a miſpriſion as this, is the baſe and ground-work upon which <hi>Gamaliel</hi> builds the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of that important counſell and advice, which he gives un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his fellows, thoroughout his diſcourſe or ſpeech made unto them.</p>
            <p>We ſhall for the preſent (paſſing by all the reſt) pitch upon that Doctrine mentioned in the fourth place, the tenor and effect whereof was this; <hi>That for any man to endeavour or attempt the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of any Doctrine, practice, or way, which is from God, is to fight againſt God himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the ſenſe and true import of the Doctrine, I ſhall need to adde little beyond what was ſaid, in explication of the words; here we briefly ſhewed what was meant by fighting againſt God. I now onely adde this, (which is ſomewhat more particular) that it is not every degree or kind of oppoſing a way, Doctrine, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of God, which either the text, or the Doctrine calleth <hi>a fighting againſt God;</hi> but onely ſuch an oppoſing which is peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and carried on with an high hand, ſo that thoſe Agents or Inſtruments of God, which he hath anointed to hold forth that way, Doctrine, or Deſigne of his in the world, are not ſuffered to execute their Commiſſion, but are countermanded either by the Authoritie or over-bearing ſtrength and power of men. It is one thing to oppoſe, or contend againſt a Doctrine or way of God, <hi>per modum Doctoris,</hi> as when a Miniſter through a miſtake or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of judgement, pleads for <hi>Baal</hi> againſt God, preacheth error up, and truth downe, which may befall the beſt and faithfulleſt of men: another, to doe it <hi>per modum Judicis,</hi> as when men will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume an Authoritative power, whether Eccleſiaſtique or Civill, to ſuppreſſe or ſilence the publiſhing, practiſing, arguing, or debating of ſuch wayes or Doctrines, with the judgements and conſciences
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:125233:9"/>
of men. It is true, even this kind of oppoſing them, is ſometimes incident to men otherwiſe upright in the maine before God: but the children of this contention and conteſtation againſt their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, muſt expect to be taught r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore wiſdome and reverence towards him, with briars and thornes. If men fight againſt God after any ſuch manner as this, upon ſuch termes as if they were Gods too, this will ingage him to take up armes alſo in his own defence, and provoke him to fight againſt thoſe, who fight againſt him. This for opening the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>For the confirmation of the truth of it, wee ſhall not need to cauſe many Scriptures to labour: the word will be ſufficiently eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the mouth of two or three of theſe Witneſſes. <hi>Why doe</hi>

               <hi>the Heathen rage,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) and the people imagine a vaine thing? The Kings of the Earth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers take counſell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the Lord and againſt his Anointed, ſaying, Let us break their bands aſunder, and caſt away their cords from us, &amp;c.</hi> Thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, of <hi>raging, ſetting themſelves, taking counſell together againſt the Lord and his Anointed,</hi> amount every whit as much as to a <hi>fighting againſt the Lord.</hi> And what was it, that the <hi>Heathen, people, Kings, and Rulers of the Earth,</hi> did, or attempted to doe <hi>againſt the Lord and againſt his Anointed;</hi> (meaning Chriſt) Was it any thing elſe but to quench that fire, which Chriſt (as himſelfe ſaith) <hi>came to kindle,</hi> to ſuppreſſe the Goſpel, to cut off thoſe wayes of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe from the knowledge and practiſe of men, which are therein recommended and held forth unto the world? Theſe are the <hi>bands,</hi> which they <hi>ſet themſelves</hi> thus <hi>to cut aſunder,</hi> and the <hi>cords,</hi> which, if it had been poſſible, they would have <hi>caſt from them. Saul, Saul,</hi> (ſaith the Lord Chriſt from Heaven unto him, as he was travailing towards <hi>Damaſcus) Why perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteſt thou me? And he ſaid, Who art thou Lord? And the Lord ſaid, I am Jeſus, whom thou perſecuteſt, &amp;c.</hi> Act. 9. 4, 5. To <hi>perſecute</hi> Chriſt (and conſequenly, God himſelfe, who is in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports every whit as much, as to <hi>fight againſt</hi> Chriſt, and ſomewhat more. But why is <hi>Saul</hi> here charged with <hi>perſecuting</hi> Chriſt? What courſe of hoſtilitie did he run or practice againſt him? It is ſaid (<hi>ver.</hi> 2.) that <hi>he deſired Letters of the high Prieſt to Damaſcus to the Synagogues, that if he found any of this WAY, whether they were men, or women, he might bring them bound to Jeruſalem.</hi> Whereby it appears,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:125233:10"/>
that the preciſe oppoſition againſt Chriſt, upon which <hi>Saul</hi> was arreſted from Heaven (as we heard) under the termes of <hi>perſecuting</hi> him, was his attempting with ſo high and bloudy an hand, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy out of the world that <hi>WAY</hi> of worſhipping &amp; ſerving God, which Chriſt in his Goſpel recommends unto, and chargeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world. <hi>Men and women</hi> were not the preciſe and formall object of his hatred and perſecution, but that <hi>way</hi> of Chriſt in the Goſpel, which they maintained, practiſed, and taught, who were perſecuted by him. If he could have told how otherwiſe to have gotten this <hi>WAY</hi> out of their hearts, tongues, and lives, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently out of the world, then by moleſting, vexing, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting them, it is not like that he would have proceeded againſt them, with ſo rough and cruell an hand. It is ſaid (<hi>Revel. 12. 7.) That there was warre in Heaven; Michael and his Angels fought againſt the Dragon; and the Dragon fought, and his Angels.</hi> Whether <hi>Michael</hi> in this Scripture be Chriſt himſelf, (as ancient Interpreters gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally carried it) or ſome prime Angel appointed by Chriſt, to be as a Generall or Head to his Saints and ſervants, in thoſe warres and fiery conflicts, wherein they were for a long time engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Satan, and his bloudy Agents in the Roman Empire, (as ſome later Expoſitors conceive) is not much materiall. But it is here expreſly ſaid, that <hi>the Dragon and his Angels,</hi> that is, the Devill and his Inſtruments, ignorant and bloud-thirſty-men, <hi>fought,</hi> viz. againſt <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, <hi>i.</hi> againſt Chriſt himſelfe in thoſe appointed by him to hold forth the way and Goſpel of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome unto the world. But why, or how are they ſaid to have <hi>fought againſt Chriſt?</hi> What was their ingagement or attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him? Queſtionleſſe nothing elſe but the extirpation and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Doctrine and Way of his Goſpel out of the world, by the torments, ſlaughter and ruine of thoſe who profeſſed them, and by this profeſſion, gave them a ſpeciall ſubſiſtence and beeing in the world. For that rule, Doctrine, or way, which is not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed or profeſſed in the world, languiſheth, and is little better then dead. I adde but one Scripture more, and then I have done with the proofe of the Point, in this kind. <hi>Then cometh the end</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 24.) when he (i.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>ſhall have delivered up the Kingdome to God even the Father, when he ſhall have put downe all rule, and all authoritie and power.</hi> Why the <hi>end</hi> ſhould not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:125233:10"/>
               <hi>be,</hi> untill Chriſt hath <hi>put downe all rule, and all authoritie and power, i.</hi> all kinds of rule, Authoritie and power; this reaſon is rendred, <hi>ver. 25. For he muſt reigne, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</hi> I demand, why ſhould <hi>all rule, all Authoritie and power,</hi> as well Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall as Civill, be looked upon, as enemies unto Chriſt? What is the enmity or hoſtilitie they exerciſe againſt him? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe no lawfull rule, Authoritie, or power, are enemies to Chriſt, either in their nature or inſtitution, but are confederate with him. It is their degeneration in their exerciſe and actings, that renders them of an hoſtile interpretation to him. There is none of them all but is apt ever and anon to be <hi>fighting againſt him,</hi> and that by ſome peremptory and ſtiffe oppoſing and ſuppreſſing ſome way, Doctrine, or practiſe of his, where they have to doe. And this is the quarrell which the Lord Chriſt hath to the whole fraternitie or aſſociation of them; for this he counts them his <hi>enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſons of the point, which we ſhall briefly touch, are three:</p>
            <p>Firſt, He that attempts or ſeeks by an high hand to ſuppreſs any<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> Doctrine, Way or Practice which is from God, may well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and ſaid to <hi>fight againſt God,</hi> becauſe he oppoſeth, and that with vehemence and might, the will of God, and that in a very conſiderable act, motion, or deſire of it. There is no Way, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or Practice, which is from God, but his will ſtands ſtrongly bent for the propagation and ſpreading of it in the world. <hi>I am</hi>

               <hi>come</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>to ſend</hi> (or, caſt) <hi>fire on the earth: and what WILL I,</hi> (or, what is my deſire, as the former tranſlation had it) <hi>if it be already kindled?</hi> meaning, that his deſire to ſee the Goſpel on foot, to ſee it well taken, and ſufficiently rooted in the world, was ſo great, that when he once ſaw it, he cared not how ſoon he left the world. So <hi>Luke 22. 15. And he ſaid unto them, With deſire have I deſired to eat this paſſeover with you, before I ſuffer:</hi> mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he even longed to erect and found that great Ordinance of the Supper, for the uſe and benefit of the world in after times, before he left the world. Many other Scriptures there are that ſpeak this over and over, <hi>viz.</hi> that the heart and ſoul of God are firmly and deeply ſet within him, to have ſuch Wayes, Doctrines and Ordinances as come from him, publiſhed, maintained, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and held forth unto the world. Therefore they who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves with all their ſtrength, and all their might, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:125233:11"/>
this will of his in the accompliſhment of it, what do they elſe but fight againſt him?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Hee that magnifies himſelf to ſuppreſſe, quaſh, or<note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> keep down any way, Practice or Counſell which is from God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably oppoſeth the glory of God, and doth what in him lies, to keep God from being magnified in the hearts and lives of men, at leaſt as far as that Way, Practice or Counſell which hee ſeeks to ſuppreſs, tends to ſuch a magnification of him. And will this, being weighed in the ballance of the Sanctuary, be found any whit lighter, then a fighting againſt God? Certain it is, that God hath (as it were) a ſtock of glory in the hand of every Way, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice, which he recommends unto the world; yea, in all and every of theſe, he hath a peculiar deſigne for the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Name. The <hi>beauty of the Lord</hi> is ſaid to be ſeen, or to be <hi>beheld</hi> in the Wayes and Ordinances of his <hi>Houſe,</hi> or Temple. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 4. There is no way or truth of God, but carries an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in it of ſome lineament or other of the glory and loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his face. So again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67. The Prophet having (<hi>ver.</hi> 1.) petitioned that at the hand of God, which (<hi>ver.</hi> 2.) might make his <hi>way to be known on earth, &amp;c.</hi> he breaks out (<hi>ver.</hi> 3.) in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall ſtrain, <hi>Let the people praiſe thee, O God, let all the people praiſe thee;</hi> clearly implying, that the <hi>way of God</hi> being publiſhed, and made known to the world, is that which increaſeth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the throne of Heaven, raiſeth and procureth new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of praiſe and glory from men unto God. So then he that ſhall riſe up to oppoſe the God of Heaven in any of thoſe methods, counſels or projections of his, whereby he projects the exaltation and advancement of his own great Name and Glory in the world, may in as proper a ſenſe, as the phraſe lightly will bear, be ſaid <hi>to fight againſt God;</hi> eſpecially, if we conſider but this one thing further: that Gods glory is his darling, his <hi>unica,</hi> his only one, (as <hi>David</hi> cal'd his life, <hi>Eripe à gladio animam meam, a cane uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam meam, Pſ.</hi> 22. 21.) it is the only life which he lives in the world; it is the only apple that his ſoul careth to eat of, out of that great Orchard which he hath planted (I mean the world.) Therefore doubtleſs, he that ſhall oppoſe him in his gathering of this fruit, hath the greater ſin.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, (and laſtly) there is in every thing that proceeds or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives<note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:125233:11"/>
its originall or being from another, ſomewhat of the nature, property, or ſpirit of that, from which it takes this riſe or ſpring of its being: there is ſomewhat of the father in the childe, of the root in the fruit and in the branches, &amp;c. In like manner, in every Way, Doctrine or Practice which is from God, there is ſomewhat of God himſelf. The very ſubſtance, frame and conſtitution of them, at leaſt that which is operative, quickning and ſpirituall in them, what is it but a kinde of heavenly compoſition, the ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients whereof are the holineſs, wiſdome, mercy, goodneſs and bounty of God? and what are theſe, and every of them, but God himſelf? Every Ordinance or Way of God, is (as it were) a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne conſtellation of theſe ſtars unto the world; out of the midſt of which he gives a gracious aſpect of himſelf, and communicates thoſe ſweet and rich influences of himſelfe, light, and life, and ſtrength, and peace, and joy, unto the world. It is ſaid, (1 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 11.) that the Lord neither was in the <hi>ſtrong wind that rent the mountains,</hi> nor yet in the <hi>earthquake</hi> that followed it, nor in the <hi>fire</hi> that came after that; but after theſe there came <hi>a ſtill voyce,</hi> wherein it is implied, that the Lord was. The meaning is, that God had neither prepared or intended, either the wind, earthquake or fire, by, or out of which to impart himſelf unto his Prophet <hi>Elijah;</hi> he had only prepared and ſanctified the <hi>ſtill and ſoft voyce</hi> for ſuch a purpoſe as this; and therefore he is expreſly denyed to have been in any other, and conſequently ſuppoſed to have been in this. In ſuch a ſenſe or manner as God was in this <hi>ſtill voyce,</hi> he is in every Way, Doctrine, and Ordinance of his; in, by, and out of all and every of theſe, he communicates and imparts himſelf graciouſly unto the world. Therefore whoſoever ſhall fight againſt any of theſe, by ſeeking to ſupplant, ſuppreſs, or keep them down, that they may not <hi>run and be glorified</hi> in the world, what do they elſe, let this work and courſe of theirs be truly interpreted, but fight againſt God himſelf?</p>
            <p>We have done with the Reaſons of the Doctrine; we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with ſomewhat by way of uſe and application.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by way of Inſtruction: If to attempt the ſuppreſſion or keeping down, any Way, Doctrine, or Practice which is from God, be of no leſs concernment, of no ſafer interprepation, then a fighting againſt God, then certainly it is the greateſt imprudence
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:125233:12"/>
or improvidence under heaven, for any man, or rank of men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, to appear, eſpecially in any hgh-handed oppoſition or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation againſt any Way, Doctrine, or Practice whatſoever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they have proof upon proof, demonſtration upon demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, evidence upon evidence; yea, all the ſecurity that men in an ordinary way (at leaſt) are capable of, that ſuch Wayes or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines only pretend unto God as the author of them, and that in truth, they are not at all from him, but either from men, or of a baſer parentage. For what do men by ſuch a practice and ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelves as this, but run an apparent hazard, of daſhing their foot againſt that ſtone, at which <hi>Paul</hi> ſtumbled, (when time was) yea, and without the higheſt hand of mercy that was ever lift up to ſave a mortall man, had been utterly broken to pieces by it? <hi>It is a hard thing for thee</hi> (ſaith the Lord by a voyce from<note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> heaven to him) <gap reason="foreign">

And (to make the beſt of ſuch a doubtfull and blind ingagement) put the caſe that that Way or Doctrine, which men ſhall proſecute with ſo much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and fierceneſſe of ſpirit, ſhall in concluſion be found to have been miſtaken, erroneous, and not from God: yet</p>

            <p>Secondly, Whatſoever Doctrine or way is recommended and tendered unto men in the Name of God, whether either the one or the other be from God or no, yet he expects from men (as well he may) that reverence and regard unto that Great Name of his, wherein ſuch things are brought and tendered unto them, that they ſhould be diligently conſidered, and due proofe and examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, whether they be from him, or no, before they be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and much more before oppoſed. And certainly men doe but pollute and prophane that ever-bleſſed Name of God, by making refuſe, yea abomination (as many doe) of ſuch things as are brought unto them in that Name, before they know upon any conſiderable grounds or terms of knowledge, whether the things be indeed from God, or no; yea, though the things thus rejected ſhould at laſt be found worthy of no better entertainment, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no agreement with God, or his Word. The event or iſſue in this caſe, though it ſhould fall out to the beſt for ſuch men, will ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little caſe or qualifie their ſin. Shall not that wicked tyrant and enemy of God, <hi>Eglon, riſe up in judgement, and condemne that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of men we now ſpeak of, who, when <hi>Ehud</hi> onely ſignified that he <hi>had a meſſage from God unto him,</hi> did not preſently reject the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage before he knew it, or fall foule upon the meſſenger, but (as the Text ſaith, <hi>Judg. 2. 20.) aroſe up from his throne,</hi> addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in that deportment of Reverence to receive it?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, (and laſtly) It is extreme madneſſe in men to run the hazard we ſpeake of, I meane of <hi>fighting againſt God,</hi> in ſeeking to ſuppreſſe ſuch waies or courſes as they are not able to demonſtrate, but that they are waies of God indeed, becauſe, in caſe they be not the waies of God, he himſelfe will give teſtimony from Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:125233:13"/>
them in due time, he will ſuppreſſe and ſcatter them, and bring them to nought: and then there will be no danger for men to reject and abhorre them. <hi>Dearly beloved</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 12. 19.) avenge not your ſelves, but give place unto wrath,</hi> i. unto the wrath of God, whoſe juſt avenging hand is lift up againſt thoſe that wrong you, and deale unjuſtly with you, and is ready to ſmite for your ſakes; as it followeth: <hi>For it is written, Vengeance is mine: I will repay, ſaith the Lord.</hi> It were great folly in any man, to expoſe himſelfe to the juſt offence and diſpleaſure of God, by ſeeking to right himſelfe in an angry and revengefull manner upon him, whom he certainly knows hath injur'd him, God himſelfe being ready with his ſtroke of juſtice to do him right, and to avenge him on his adverſary, though he himſelfe ſhould be patient and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it ſtill. But it would be a point yet of ſeven-times greater folly then ſo, for a man to fall foule in a way of revenge upon an imaginary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, and who (at moſt) can onely be ſuppoſed or ſuſpected to have done him wrong, conſidering that God who is an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcerner and judge of injuries and wrongs, and withall a juſt Avenger of all ſuch things, will ſhortly appeare for his full vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, in caſe he hath been wronged indeed. Nor hath any man cauſe in this caſe to feare, leſt <hi>whilſt the graſſe grows, the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For God certainly will give full and ample conſideration for all forbearance and long-ſuffering of men, wherein and whereby the rights of his Throne are tendered and maintained. It were no leſſe then an exaltation of folly in any man, to expoſe his own life to the ſtroke of juſtice, by aſſaulting the life of a malefactor whilſt he is going to execution.</p>
            <p>Againe, ſecondly, (by way of Inſtruction) If to attempt the deſtruction or ſuppreſſion of any Doctrine, or way, which is from God in ſo high and peremptory a manner, as was formerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, be a <hi>fighting againſt God,</hi> take we knowledge from hence alſo, what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>hardened himſelf againſt him</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> as wee heard before) <hi>and proſpered?</hi> If this be but granted, it is enough to demonſtrate our caſe and condition to be very dangerous and doubtfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the beſt:
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:125233:14"/>
For whether that <hi>WAY</hi> we ſpeak of, which is ſo generally tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and trampled upon like clay and mire in the ſtreets, as well by the foot of ignorance and prophaneneſſe, as of learning and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accompliſhment, be the <hi>WAY</hi> of God, or no; moſt certain it is, that all the wit, wiſdome, parts, learning, judgement, that have encountered and oppoſed it hitherto, have not been able by any demonſtrative or concluding proofe, to overthrow that title or claim which it maketh unto God as the author and founder of it. Therefore unto me it is a thing of the ſaddeſt conſideration un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven, and of more grievous portendance unto us, then any thing elſe, (as far as I am able to diſcern) that we ſhould hang the great weight of the peace and ſafety of a whole Nation, all our hopes and expectations of help and aſſiſtance from God in our greateſt extremities, upon the brittle pin of ſo doubtfull a diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as that which is maintained, and yet depending, between the one <hi>WAY</hi> and the other. For in caſe that <hi>way</hi> againſt which the ſpirits of men are ſo generally and fiercely bent, ſhall at laſt be found to be the <hi>Way</hi> of God, we are all this while look'd upon from heaven as <hi>fighters againſt God,</hi> and ſo have as good as given hoſtages to our enemies, that we never mean to proſper, or do any great thing againſt them. Whereas, if men would but follow <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliels</hi> counſell in the Text, and refrain themſelves for a ſeaſon from laying either violent hands, or tongues upon this way, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till God had either untied or cut the knot, till he had given ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt it, the <hi>doubtfulneſſe</hi> of the <hi>diſputation,</hi> need not, would not be prejudiciall in the leaſt, either to our preſent proceedings, or future peace: and men do but make themſelves <hi>wiſe above that which is written;</hi> yea, above that which is either <hi>reaſon</hi> or <hi>faith,</hi> to think, or ſpeak otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>If it be objected, that Reformation ſuffers and loſeth time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Way</hi> is not yet hedgd up with thorns, but men are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to walk in it.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Firſt, If the <hi>Way</hi> be one of thoſe <hi>wayes</hi> which call God Father; Reformation indeed ſuffers, and loſeth time, but not becauſe this <hi>Way</hi> is not hedg'd up with thorns, but becauſe it is not laid more open, becauſe it is not repaired and made more paſſable by the favour and countenance of men in place, whether Miniſters or others; that ſo the people of God, whoſe hearts are towards it, may walk therein without fear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:125233:14"/>2. That reformation (ſo called) which is the apple of ſo many eyes, and the joy of ſo many hearts, needs ſuffer nothing, nor loſe an hours time, though the <hi>Way</hi> we ſpeak of, be occupied in peace by thoſe, whoſe feet by the light of Gods Word and Spirit (at leaſt as they conceive) are guided into it. For what doth the poor Flie ſitting on the top of the wheele to hinder the waggoner from dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on his way? If the reſidue of the Nation be ſubjected to this Reformation, the Nation it ſelf may be ſaid to be reformed (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſuch a denomination, as this Reformation will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford) notwithſtanding ſuch a number of perſons (comparatively ſo inconſiderable, I mean as touching their <note n="*" place="margin">In ſeverall populous towns in the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> ſcarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, nay, not every 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> perſon (as I have been credibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) is immembred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into any of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and yet the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Nation is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall. 1 Joh. 5. 19.</note> number) as adhere to this <hi>Way,</hi> be not concluded in it. During the regency of Prelaticall extravagancy, there were many Non-conformiſts; yea, ſeverall Congregations of people in the land, who openly diſclaimed and proteſted againſt that government; and yet the Nation was look'd upon as Epiſcopally <hi>reformed,</hi> notwithſtanding. The irregularity of the mountains and valleys in the ſurface of the earth, troubles no mans opinion concerning the perfect roundneſſe of it, becauſe it is ſwallowed up into victory by the vaſtneſſe of the globe. <hi>John</hi> ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>this whole world lyeth in wickedneſſe,</hi> notwithſtanding a remnant who were born of God. The gleanings of Independency (ſo called) will not hinder the vintage of Presbytery.</p>
            <p>3. If a complete Nationall Reformation be indeed the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land or Crown that is contended for, let but <hi>Presbyterie</hi> beſtir her ſelf, and act her part within her Juriſdiction, with as much dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, wiſdome and faithfulneſs, as the <hi>Congregationall Way</hi> will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to act hers amongſt her Proſelytes; and there will not be the leaſt occaſion to fear, but that the whole and entire body of the Nation will ſhine with the beauty and luſtre of a perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. If this <hi>Way</hi> ſhall be found tardy, or looſe, and not to keep pace with her ſiſter in carrying on the work of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even her <hi>enemies themſelves being Judges,</hi> let her ſuffer; yea, let her with her children be caſt out of doors. Therefore it is but a frivolous and putid ſlander caſt upon her, when ſhe is charged with enmity to Reformation: But,</p>

Will it take the <hi>members of an Harlot, and make them the members of Chriſt,</hi> whether either <hi>Chriſt</hi> or ſuch <hi>members</hi> themſelves, will or no? Or will it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to reconcile darkneſs with light, to ſettle a communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt and <hi>Belial,</hi> to throw down the partition wall, and make the wilderneſſe of the world the garden of God, the Church and the world, enter-commoners? Or what is the glory or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the deſign of it, that the Congregationall <hi>Way</hi> is counted unworthy to be ſo much as a ſtander by, and to behold it? Will it lift up its hand, to quaſh and cruſh, to break the hearts and bones of the one half of the moſt religiouſly affected, and beſt conſcienced people in the Land, for trading in Apes and Peacocks, for holding ſome erroneous opinions (perhaps erroneouſly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) as if it ſelf were the Lord of infallibility, and had a <hi>non poſſe errare</hi> ſettled by God, as an inheritance upon it? I profeſſe inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly, that when I put my ſelf into a poſture of the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgency I am able, to conſider of the reformation ſo much ſpoken of, and even conflict with my ſpirit to forme and caſt the poſſible effects and fruits of it to the greateſt advantage, I am not able to apprehend any thing deſireable likely to come of it, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a civill, or religious accommodarion unto the Nation, above what might be expected, and that upon terms of a far more promiſing hope, from the other <hi>Way</hi> which indureth ſo much contradiction from men. But I apparently foreſee many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, and thoſe not of a light or contemptible importance
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:125233:15"/>
likely to attend it, for which no place would be found in the other <hi>Way.</hi> Particularly, it is to mee inſtead of all arguments and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations, that no Reformation is according to the mind of God and of Jeſus Chriſt, which is deſtructive to the edification of the Saints, and directly impeding their <hi>growth in grace, and in the knowledge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And whether ſuch a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (if yet it be lawfull ſo to call it) which injoynes the Saints to ſit under, and hold themſelves to ſuch Paſtors, with whom their hearts cannot cloſe in that relation with any tolerable ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor yet are capable of his Miniſtery, or any edification by it, be not under that condemnation, I leave to men that have not ſold themſelves under partiality, to judge and determine.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, but men ſhall have liberty to chooſe what Paſtor they pleaſe, and to ſit under what Miniſtery they deſire, if they will but chooſe their dwellings accordingly. I anſwer:</p>
            <p>1. There may be (and I believe are) many of a rich anoynting from God for the work of the Miniſtery, and much deſired by a conſiderable number of godly perſons, in Paſtorall relation, who muſt ſay their conſciences nay, to accept of a Parochiall charge. In this caſe the change of a mans houſe will do nothing towards the bleſſing of his ſoul; if ſuch a Reformation, as moſt mens thoughts run upon, ſhould be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>2. All the dwellings within the Parochiall line, relating to the Paſtor that is deſired, may be fill'd with Inhabitants already; and ſo there is no place, or poſſibility (at leaſt for the preſent) for him whoſe ſoul longeth after that Paſtor, to injoy him: and when, or whether ever whileſt he liveth, the door now ſhut againſt him will be open, no man knoweth.</p>
            <p>3. Many times the ſituation and conveniency of a mans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent dwelling for trade, imployment, &amp;c. is ſuch, that he cannot remove, but at the perill of his eſtate, and ruining himſelf and his whole family. And how they, who ſhall compell men, either to ſacrifice their peace, comfort, and ſubſiſtenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> this preſent world, or elſe run the hazard of loſing a ſubſiſtence in that which is to come, will anſwer it either before the righteous God, or reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men, is above my apprehenſion.</p>
            <p>4. This liberty of chooſing Paſtors only by chooſing houſes, is ſo conditioned, that it ſmiles only upon the rich, (and that but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:125233:16"/>
faintly neither) but frowns upon the poor; and ſo is partiall, and therefore not Chriſtian. He that hath enough of that, which (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) <hi>anſwers all things,</hi> may probably be able to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10. 19.</note> himſelf within the precincts of what pariſh he pleaſeth, in point of dwelling; as either by buying out ſome Inhabitant, or by purchaſing ground, and building upon it, or the like; but the caſe of the poor man is many times ſuch, that he cannot tell where to finde another hole in all the world to hide his head in, beſides that wherein it is hid already. So that this liberty of chooſing a Paſtor, being nothing elſe, if plainly interpreted, but only a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of chooſing ſuch or ſuch a Pariſh determinately to dwell in, is little better then a meer colluſion, in reſpect of thoſe that are poor, and (indeed) rather an upbraiding of them with their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, then any gratification of them with a liberty.</p>
            <p>5. (And laſtly) ſuch a liberty as this we now ſpeak of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were it more valueable then it is, is no gratuity, benefit or bleſſing of that Reformation ſo importunely demanded and preſſed for by many, being nothing elſe, but what was every mans permiſſion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment under the iron rod of Epiſcopall tyranny. I am more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to every man that comes neer me, for not taking away my life, then I am to any Reformation whatſoever, for giving me li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to chooſe my Paſtor upon ſuch terms. This for anſwer in full to that undue charge againſt the Congregationall <hi>Way,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was attainded of inconſiſtency with, and enmity againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <p>A ſecond objection levied againſt it, and all ſufferance of it, by thoſe that are adverſaries to it, is, that if it be permitted quietly to walk up and down amongſt us, and not be ſuppreſſed, it will ſoon make the Land unquiet, fill the Land with troubles, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That mount of accuſation which is raiſed ſo high againſt the <hi>Way</hi> we now maintain, doth not at all prove that there is any thing in it that deſerves battery.</p>
            <p>3. There is no ſubſtantiall reaſon at all can be given, why this <hi>Way</hi> ſhould occaſion troubles, diviſions, diſcontents, or the like, above the rate of that other <hi>Way,</hi> which ſo much magnifies it ſelf againſt it; except (haply) this, that it hath more of God and Chriſt in it, then that other: and then it is no marvell if it be more offenſive, and troubleſome to the world. But ſuppoſe both equally intereſſed in this, I affirm and undertake to demonſtrate, that in the nature, frame, and conſtitution of it otherwiſe, it is every whit as gentle, ſweet, complying and accommodating, and no whit more threatning or portending troubles or diſtractions, then the other; yea, that in all ſuch conſiderations as theſe, it hath the preheminence: For,</p>
            <p>1. It ſeeketh not, it attempteth not the moleſtation, harm, or diſturbance of any ſort of men that are contrary-minded to it; it thinketh no evill, it ſpeaketh no evill of ſuch: if it conceives them upright and faithfull with God and Jeſus Chriſt, it imbraceth them with all love, tenderneſſe and honour, as <hi>partakers of like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious faith</hi> with it ſelf; and nothing doubts, but that they ſerve and worſhip God with as much ſincerity and ſingleneſſe of heart, and are accordingly accepted by him in their <hi>Way,</hi> as it ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:125233:17"/>2. If God ſhould pleaſe to give it favour in the eyes, and intereſt in the hearts of the powers of this world, it thinks it very un-Chriſtian and unworthy, to arm it ſelf with this intereſt, to fight againſt the peace of the conſciences of other men. If any of this <hi>Way</hi> have miſcarried in any of theſe particulars, they have done it as men, and not as children of this <hi>Way;</hi> the principles of their <hi>Way</hi> taught them better things. And why, or how a <hi>way,</hi> baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no worſe, or harder ſpirit then this, ſhould come to be arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a troubler of State, or ſtrife-maker, a diſſention-breeder amongſt men, except it be by a ſpirit of contention and ſtrife in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, is to me a thing incomprehenſible. Nevertheleſſe it is no new thing, that both the wayes and ſervants of God ſhould be charged with ſuch crimes and demerits, not only whereof they are wholly innocent and free, but which have a ſpeciall contrariety to ſome ſuch grace or vertue, wherein they have a remarkable and choyce preheminence above others. Thus <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the great mirrour of chaſtity, was accuſed of Adultery, <hi>Gen. 39. Moſes,</hi> the meekeſt man upon earth, of ambition, and ſelf-aſſuming, <hi>Numb. 16. Elijah</hi> of being the troubler of <hi>Iſrael, 1 King.</hi> 18. who was the Chariot and Horſe-men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to defend it: 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. The Lord Chriſt himſelf, <hi>in whom the Godhead dwelt bodily,</hi> of <hi>having a Devill, Joh.</hi> 8. and ſo of being <hi>an enemy unto Ceſar,</hi> when as it was, and is he, <hi>by whom Kings reign;</hi> with many the like. Therefore how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may ſeem ſtrange that a <hi>Way</hi> of God, which is eminently ſet, ſtrongly bent, and (in a manner) every wayes calculated for peace, ſhould ſuffer in the tongues and thoughts of men as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturber of States, and ſower of diſſentions amongſt men, yet is there nothing in this, but what hath been acted, and that over and over upon the Theatre of the world formerly.</p>
            <p>If it be here replied and ſaid; Yea, but experience riſeth up, and confirms the truth of that accuſation and charge againſt the <hi>Way</hi> you ſpeak of, which you would wipe off; this ſhewes and proves againſt all deniall and exception, that where your <hi>Way</hi> is entertained, Congregations are torn, families rent, relations di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced and divided, &amp;c.</p>

effects under one &amp; the ſame notion, eſpecially where the diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of cauſality is not very notorious and broad. A man in reaſon can hardly think, that any man, <hi>compos mentis,</hi> (as we uſe to ſay) ſhould be ſo defective or weak in his inellectualls, as to think that the building of <hi>Tenderton</hi> Steeple, ſhould be the cauſe of <hi>Godwins Sands,</hi> only becauſe theſe ſands were never known to be before the building of that Steeple; yet old M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Latimer</hi> relates the Story in one of his Sermrns, and improves it to very good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: By ſuch a form of arguing as this, <hi>Judas</hi> his betraying his Maſter, ſhould have been the effect of the womans powring out <hi>that box of oyntment upon his head,</hi> mentioned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 7. For he never betrayed him untill this oyntment was powred out upon him; and immediately after, he did. The <hi>Way</hi> we ſpeak of, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the more any cauſe of troubles, diſſentions, or diviſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe troubles, diſſentions and diviſions, many times follow upon the embracement and entertainment of it.</p>
            <p>2. If troubles or diviſions were the proper effects of this <hi>way,</hi> then the more, and more generally it were taken up and practiſed in a familie, Citie, or Countrey, the more troubles and diviſions there would be. Effects are ſtill found in proportion to their cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, where nothing interpoſeth to hinder it. But where it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aſſented and ſubmitted unto, whether in families, relations, or otherwiſe, there is as much unitie, love, and peace, (as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter of government) as where Presbyterie hath its higheſt throne. Therefore the reaſon why troubles and diviſions ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times accompany it, is not becauſe it is intertained, but becauſe it is not intertained ſufficiently, or with that generalitie of conſent, which is deſireable.</p>
            <p>3. When troubles and diviſions are occaſioned in relations, families, Congregations, &amp;c. by the meeting together of two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite wayes, why ſhould the one <hi>way</hi> be ſtill burthened and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the occaſion of ſuch troubles, and the other acquitted, there being no ground or reaſon at all, why either that which is acquitted, ſhould be judged more innocent; or that which is charged, more obnoxious or peccant, in this kind. Nay,</p>
            <p>4. If matters were duly and fairely examined between the two Combatants in this caſe, the <hi>way</hi> wee plead for, would be found <hi>via lactea,</hi> the candid, harmleſſe, and peaceable <hi>way:</hi> and her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall

If there be any claſhing or unkindneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two wayes, <hi>Independency</hi> (ſo called) and <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> when they meet together, either in a relation, familie, &amp;c. the very complexion of the latter bewrayes that to be ſtill the foundreſſe of the quarrell. To me it is a wonder of the firſt magnitude, how men come to have ſo much ground of hope as to ſet their foot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of compoſing differences and diſtractions, of ſetling peace and love throughout the Nation, by exalting one way of Diſcipline, of Church-Government, for the treading downe and trampling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot all others.

That in this caſe, I know no more occaſion, (at leaſt no more neceſſitie) of any diſtraction, rent, or diviſion, then when the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being free of one company, as ſuppoſe of Merchant-taylors, ſhall ſtill upon occaſion of the meeting of this company, repaire to the hall belonging to it; and the ſon being free of another, as perhaps of the company of Grocers, ſhall upon the like occaſion repaire to the hall appertaining to them. Who knows not that the members of all the ſeverall Companies in <hi>London,</hi> dwell ſcattering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and promiſcuouſly up and downe the Citie, with the greateſt irregularitie of intermixture that lightly can be, and without any obſervation of their relations to their reſpective Companies, ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry members of twenty ſeverall Companies (it may be) inhabiting within one and the ſame pariſh; and yet without any complaint or inconvenience of <hi>rents, diſtractions, or diviſions?</hi> Or if by <hi>rents, diſtractions, and diviſions,</hi> he means diſtances or alienations in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; nor can theſe with any face of reaſon be charged upon that <hi>way,</hi> whoſe cauſe we plead; becauſe it is a maine principle and maxime in this <hi>way,</hi> to hold terms of love and Chriſtian cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, with all perſons of what judgement ſoever in point of Government, if they be godly, as well as with her owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (as hath in effect been argued formerly.)

it; becauſe ſuch figures and characters as theſe, are the knowne impreſſions of the Goſpel upon the world, where it comes in power, and is entertained in truth. <hi>Thinke yee</hi> (ſaith our Saviour)<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 51. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you, nay, but rather debate. For from henceforth there ſhall be five in one houſe divided, three againſt two, and two againſt three. The father ſhall be divided againſt the ſon, and the ſon againſt the father: the mother againſt the daughter, and the daughter againſt the mother: the mother in law againſt her daughter in law, and the daughter in law againſt her mother in law.</hi> Nor is it to be conceived that theſe <hi>diviſions</hi> in relations and families, foretold by Chriſt as the common and ordinary effects and conſequents of the Goſpel (for in different reſpects they may be either) are to be limited onely to ſuch either relations or families, wherein the ground or occaſion of the diviſion ſhould be, the receiving of the Goſpel in the maine truth and ſubſtance of it by the one partie, the other partie abſolutely rejecting it, as if they were onely to take place in ſuch caſes as this; but they are to be extended to ſuch both families and relations alſo, where ſome particular and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall points or truths of the Goſpel are intertained by one partie, and rejected by another, though both agree as well in the beliefe, as in the Profeſſion of the Goſpel in the generall. Experience ſhews that <hi>rents &amp; diviſions</hi> take place in both, as well, yea, and that with as much heate and diſtemper of affection, in the latter caſe and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the latter occaſion, as in the former. Now if the queſtion in this latter caſe be, Whether the occaſion of the diviſion be rather to be imputed to the truth held and practiſed by the one partie, or to the error held and practiſed in oppoſition to the truth, by the other: The anſwer is, that where all were before bound up in unitie and peace, by a common band of error, there the occaſion of the diviſion muſt needs be imputed unto the truth comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. Therefore were it granted, that the way ſo much conteſted againſt, did indeed occaſion, <hi>rents, diviſions, diſtractions,</hi> in relations, in families, in Congregations where it comes, this would rather <hi>turne unto</hi> it <hi>for a teſtimony,</hi> and aſſert its originall from God, then otherwiſe: The Goſpel <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>elfe works no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then thus, where it is preached and intertained. And as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſuppoſeth, that in caſe any piece or fragment were broken off from the maine body of the Heavens, it would move circular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:125233:19"/>
according to the naturall motion of the maine body; in like manner any particular opinion or practiſe which moves, acts, and works, according to the manner and tenor of that motion, acting, and working, which are genuine and proper to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is ſo much the more likely to be a parcell or branch of the Goſpel: but however, ſuch a moving, acting, and working as this, can with no ſemblance or colour of reaſon, be drawn into any contrary interpretation, or be made an argument of the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformitie of it unto the truth.</p>
            <p>A third objection againſt that <hi>way</hi> whoſe condemnation out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runs her triall day and way, in the world, is; that it opens a doore to all errors, hereſies, and unſound opinions, yea to all looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and prophaneneſſe, and conſequently it cannot but be a thing diſpleaſing unto God, and ſo prejudiciall to the peace and ſafetie of the Nation, if it ſhould be tolerated, or practiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. But to theſe things alſo full and clear anſwers are not wanting. For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, it being certain that error cannot be healed or ſuppreſſed but by the manifeſtation of the truth, as darkneſſe cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed or removed but by the ſhining of the light; that way which affords the greateſt advantages and the beſt incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto men, both for the ſearching out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and bringing forth into light the truth being found, muſt needs be ſo farre from opening doores unto <hi>errors, hereſies, unſound opinions,</hi> &amp;c. that it ſteers the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> advantagious and hopefull courſe that lightly can be taken, for the evicting, and conſequently for the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them. I need not adde, that it is the congregationall <hi>way</hi> (and this onely amongſt all its fellows) that rejoyecth in the method of this warfare and advance againſt thoſe enemies of God, and Religion, errors and hereſies. And,</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the way ſir-named <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> which conjures all mens gifts, parts, and induſtrie into a ſynodicall circle, and ſuffers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them onely to dance there, as it may poſſibly ſhut the doores againſt ſome errors and hereſies, which were not like to ſtay long, in caſe they ſhould enter under the other <hi>way;</hi> ſo it is in every whit as much poſſibilitie and danger, of ſhutting the doore upon, and compelling ſuch errors and hereſies as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie gotten in, and otherwiſe have a mind to be gone, to ſtay
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:125233:20"/>
it, and ſo to infeſt and annoy the truth, and peace of the Churches of Chriſt, againſt their wils. But,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I would gladly learn of the ſons of this objection, how, which way, or in what reſpect the <hi>way</hi> ſo much objected againſt, commits this folly-deed of opening a doore unto errors and hereſies. Certain I am, firſt, that this <hi>way</hi> hates both the one and the other with as <hi>perfect an b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tred,</hi> as her competitreſſe doth. Secondly, I fully beleeve, that this <hi>way</hi> is as diligent, faithfull, and induſtrious to ſlay theſe enemies of Chriſt by <hi>the ſword of the Spirit,</hi> (which is in ſpeciall manner conſecrated for ſuch executions) as the other way. Thirdly, if the error be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, amounting to, or neer an hereſie, after two or three ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions (that is, according to her warrant from Heaven) ſhe caſts it out of the line of her communication, unto him who caſt it in (I mean, Satan.) If to hate errors and hereſies, to preach with all diligence and faithfulneſſe againſt errors and hereſies, to excommunicate errors and hereſies, be to open a doore unto error and hereſies, then muſt the adverſaries of the <hi>way</hi> whereof we ſpeak, be juſtified in their accuſation of her: otherwiſe they ſpeak at the utmoſt perill of their reputations, when they lay ſuch things to her charge.</p>
            <p>If it be here replyed and ſaid; Yea, but all this notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi> you plead for, is but feeble-handed, for the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of errors and hereſies; becauſe theſe, though hated, preach'd againſt, and caſt out of the Church by excommunication, may yet live and gather head again in the world, except error and errant be further reſtrained by a ſecular hand, and hereſie and heretique put to ſilence together in the grave. And this, which is the moſt, if not the onely effectuall means to preſerve the wheat from thoſe tares, the <hi>way</hi> of your deſires exerciſeth not, nor yet approveth.</p>
            <p>I anſwer: firſt, we preſume that <hi>Priſons</hi> and <hi>Swords</hi> are no <hi>Church-officers,</hi> nor any appurtenances to any Eccleſiaſtique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in what form of Government ſoever.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we ſuppoſe that the Lord Chriſt ſo far tendered the ſpirituall ſafety and peace of his Churches, as to leave them ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently furniſhed, and every wayes appointed with internall proviſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, for the effectuall procurement and preſervation of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:125233:20"/>
them, without any concurrence of any heterogeneall or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall power. Eſpecially conſidering, that he fore-ſaw, that theſe Churches of his, for the ſpace of three hundred yeers together, and ſomewhat more (during which terme he knew likewiſe that they would continue in their greateſt puritie, and perfection of love and loyaltie towards him) were not like to have any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation at all in this kind from any ſecular or civill power.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, though the Churches of Chriſt, during this period of time wherein they had no comportance with any ſecular arm for their preſervation either in this or any other kind, were not wholly free from <hi>errors and hereſies;</hi> yet did they quit and defend themſelves againſt the danger ſpreading and troubleſomeneſſe of them upon better terms, and with farre better ſucceſſe, then they were able to do afterwards, when they had an arme of fleſh and a ſword in it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to aſſiſt them. Note this.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if perſons delivered up unto Satan by the Church, whether for Error, Hereſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or other crime, were preſently to be cut off by the ſecular Sword, all opportunitie for the effectuall and ſaving work of that ordinance of Chriſt upon the perſons ſo delivered up, would be cut off alſo. The Apoſtle, 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. 5. expreſly affirms the end of Excommunication or <hi>delivering up unto Satan,</hi> to be the <hi>deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt proper and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired effects; in like manner the ordinances and means which the Lord Chriſt hath graciouſly appointed for the everlaſting ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the precious ſouls of men, muſt, according to the nature and condition of their reſpective workings, and the tenor of Gods providence obſerved for the time of his falling in with them to make them effectuall, have their full and juſt allowance of time given and permitted unto them, to work upon men effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually. And whoſoever ſhall limit or ſtraiten the providence of God, in this kind, by any haſty or violent taking away a ſoul from under the influence and working of any ordinance of Chriſt appointed for his ſalvation, before the bleſſed work of

Repentance be accompliſhed in him, will be arraigned before the tribunall of the living God, as acceſſarie to the blood of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oul, except he can ſhew a better warrant from God for ſuch an action, then I know any. And God himſelf having no where preſcribed or limited any determinate or ſet time, within which he intends to make the ſentence of Excommunication after the paſſing of it by the Church, effectuall to the ſaving of the ſoul, or otherwiſe never to do it, I conceive it can be no leſſe then an act of high preſumption in any man to undertake any ſuch preſcription or limitation. As God by the voice of the Goſpel calls ſome at the third and ſixth houre; ſo he cals others<note place="margin">Matth. 20. 6.</note> at the ninth, and ſome at the eleventh houre: and why may he not work ſavingly, by the ſentence of Excommunication with as much libertie, and difference in reſpect of time? And this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence being the laſt and utmoſt means which God is like to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a poore hardened, impenitent ſoul for the eternall peace and ſalvation of it, how can it but be conceived an act moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Chriſtian bowels, to cut him off from this alſo, whilſt God is pleaſed to ſpare him? If it be here objected and ſaid, But if an heretique be ſuffered to live, he is in danger of infecting others, and deſtroying them eternally. I anſwer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt, ſo is a drunkard, a fornicatour, a ſwearer, a covetous perſon, with the like; the lives of all theſe kinds of ſinners are of as dangerous a conſequence in reſpect of infecting, yea and of deſtroying the ſouls of others, as the life of an heretique is: and yet no man (I preſume) judgeth this a ſufficient ground why ſuch men ſhould be puniſhed with death. Secondly, as for thoſe that are within the Church, they are not capable of any communion or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with an Heretique that is caſt out by Excommunication, and ſo are not in danger of being infected by him: and for thoſe that are without, theſe are infected already with a diſeaſe every whit as mortall, as any hereſie, I mean unbelief. So that infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with hereſie, will not much impaire the eſtates or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe. Thirdly, (and laſtly) the truth is, that an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique being dead (eſpecially if puniſhed with death for his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſake) ſpeaketh in his ſurviving hereſie with every whit as much authoritie, and conſequently with every whit as much danger of infecting others therewith, as he could do if he were alive, if not with more. And ſo,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:125233:21"/>Fifthly, (and laſtly) concerning other civill means for the ſuppreſſion and reſtraint of thoſe ſpirituall evils, errors, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, &amp;c. as impriſonment, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>niſhment, interdictions, finings, &amp;c. both reaſon and experience concurre in this demonſtration, that ſuch fetters as theſe put upon the feet of errors and hereſies to ſecure and keep them under, ſtill have prov'd (and are like to prove no other, but) wings whereby they raiſe themſelves the higher in the thoughts and minds of men, and gain an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of a further and ranker propagation of themſelves in the world. It was an obſervation of <hi>Tacitus</hi> long ſince, that <hi>punitis ingeniis gliſcit authoritas;</hi> To puniſh men of parts and wit, is to caſt a ſpirit of Authoritie upon them, and to make their reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion glowe. Men of ordinarie capacitie, and vulgar apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, are and ever will be inclinable to think, that men of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and worth will never expoſe themſelves to ſufferings, but for that which is weightie, and which hath more in it, then every man ſeeth. And beſides, men of better breed, may eaſily be ſwayed by ſuch a principle as this, that wiſe men, whileſt they have the advantage and odds of their adverſaries in <hi>reaſon,</hi> will never renounce or diſclaim this ſo honourable an advantage by calling in the more ignoble aſſiſtance of horn and hoof to their aid. It is true, when Chriſt was handled with this rough hand we ſpeak of, that piece of prophecie was verified; <hi>I will ſmite the Shepherd, and the ſheep ſhall be ſcattered;</hi> but ordinarily the ſmiting of the Shepherd or head of any Sect or error, is the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together, yea the multiplication and increaſe, of his ſheep. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly (to the main objection laſt propounded) whereas the innocent <hi>way</hi> is condemned as opening a doore to all looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and prophaneneſſe, ſhe may juſtly take up <hi>Davids</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and ſay, <hi>Cruell witneſſes did riſe up: they laid to my charge things that I knew not.</hi> Pſal. 35. 11.

I will early deſtroy all the wicked of the land: that I may cut off all wicked doers from the Citie of the Lord.</hi> This is ſuch a draught and copie of Reformation as the <hi>Way</hi> we ſpeak of (<hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis mutandis</hi>) emulates, and aſpires unto. If <hi>David</hi> in thoſe reſolutions and practiſes mentioned, opened a d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ore to looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and prophaneneſſe, then cannot ſhe excuſe her ſelf from part and fellowſhip with him, in that ſin.</p>
            <p>If it be replyed and ſaid; but this <hi>way</hi> taketh care for none in point of holineſſe, but her own: ſhe ſuffereth all the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her to <hi>lie in wickedneſſe,</hi> and to <hi>ſleep in death,</hi> without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after them, or taking any pitie or compaſſion on them. To this alſo we anſwer in one word:</p>
            <p>That ſhe doth as tenderly, as affectionately deſire and pray for, yea and with as much diligence and faithfulneſſe, yea and prudence of endevour otherwiſe, and likelihood of ſucceſſe, attempts and ſeeks the ſalvation of thoſe that ſit in darkneſſe and in the ſhadow of death, as any other way can do. It is true, ſhe doth not judge it any wayes conducing towards the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe that <hi>are dead in ſins and treſpaſses,</hi> to put them into a conceit that they are <hi>living ſtones</hi> (whileſt they are yet dead) by putting them into the building of the <hi>ſpirituall temple</hi> of God: ſhe knows no ſuch method or means of converting ſouls unto God, as this. Nor doth ſhe willingly ſuffer any man <hi>to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>drink damnation unto himſelf,</hi> to further him in his ſalvation. Nor doth ſhe make Faith of apparent unbelief in parents, by baptizing their children, as any wayes accommodating the ſouls either of the one, or of the other. Therefore if ſhe declines ſuch things as theſe, it cannot be argued from hence (except either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or a worſe Logician, makes the ſyllogiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e) that therefore ſhe neglects or caſts off all care of ſeeking the ſalvation of others; but onely this, that ſhe thinks it no point either of wiſdome or charity to expoſe her ſelf to the diſpleaſure of God by doing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:125233:22"/>
that, which is more like to expoſe others alſo to the ſame ſtroke, then any wayes to comfort or relieve them. But whatſoever ſhe can reaſonably conceive or judge to be a means any wayes likely to <hi>ſave a ſoul from death,</hi> to <hi>tranſlate</hi> men <hi>from darkneſſe unto life,</hi> ſhe girds her ſelf to miniſter unto the world both farre and neer, in every ſuch thing: She cordially prayes for the converſion of the unconverted, ſhe mourns over them, ſhe cauſes <hi>her light to ſhine before them,</hi> ſhe bears their burthens, ſhe intreats them gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhe feeds their hungry, and cloatheth their naked (as ſhe is able) ſhe recompenceth evill for evill unto none of them, with all ſuch exemplatities of life and converſation, which are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, and appointed by God for the <hi>winning of thoſe without the Word,</hi> who refuſe <hi>to obey it.</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 1. And beſides all this, (that which is the firſt-born means of converſion) ſhe preacheth the Goſpel with as much diligence, and faithfulneſſe, and power, and with as much libertie and freedome unto all to partake with her in this her miniſtration, as any other way whatſoever: yea, as readie and forward ſhe is as any other, to contribute her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the full, whether in counſell, purſe, or otherwiſe, for the furniſhing of all the candleſticks in the land with burning and ſhining lights, I mean for the erecting and ſetting up a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full preaching Miniſtery throughout the Land, yea if it were poſſible, throughout the whole world. Therefore</p>
            <p>Fifthly, (and laſtly, to the main objection) whereas this <hi>way</hi> with the permiſſion and ſufferance of it, is burthened with this jealouſie and fear, that it is ſo highly diſpleaſing unto God, that he is not like to turn in mercie unto the Nation, untill it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and all the factors for it taken away. I anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that this jealouſie and fear is of the ſame inſpiration, with that wherewith <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> of old, ſought to poſſeſſe the heart of the good King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and the inhabitants of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, that ſo upon the diſcouragement they might be the more willing to compound for their City. <hi>But if thou ſay to me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

unto him and his people that God was and would be with them to ſave them and their Citie out of <hi>Rabſhakehs</hi> hand, this doth this deceived ambitious man contrive into an argument of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and fear unto them, that God was offended with them; and ſo repreſents their <hi>hope and confidence,</hi> in the ſhape of <hi>diffidence</hi> and deep <hi>diſcouragement</hi> unto them.

               <hi>and their welfare a trap,</hi> it is a ſigne that God is about <hi>to bow down their backs, if not to make their habitations deſolate.</hi> When the Jews began to reaſon after this manner, (and to act accordingly) <hi>If we let him thus alone,</hi> all <hi>men will beleeve on him: and</hi> then <hi>the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes ſhall come, and take away both our place and nation;</hi> it was a<note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 48.</note> preſage, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> indeed <hi>would come,</hi> and <hi>take away</hi> both: which they did not many yeers after. <hi>Make the heart of this people fat</hi> (ſaith the Lord by his Prophet, concerning the ſame people) <hi>and make their eares heavie, and ſhut their eyes, leſt they ſee with their</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Another objection leavied againſt the <hi>Way</hi> is this: If this way be let alone, and ſuffered to take place, it will ſtill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the credit and comfort, of many worthy and conſcientious Miniſters in the land. For as faſt as they, through the bleſſing of God upon their faithfull labours in the work of the Miniſtery, ſhall convert ſouls unto God; this <hi>Way</hi> will allure them away from them unto it ſelf; whereby their hand muſt needs be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled and diſcouraged to their work. But to this alſo I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that if that way of Government and worſhip, wherein thoſe good Miniſters ſhall walk, who are ſuppoſed to convert people unto God, be indeed and in truth the <hi>way</hi> of God, there is little ground or cauſe of fear, that any other way ſhould ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate between them and their converted ones. For firſt, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie grace of converſion, being diſpenſed unto theſe by their hand, is a great and ſolemne ingagement upon them, to love and honour them above others. Secondly, the perſon being dearly lov'd, and highly honour'd, gives credit and intereſt both in the judgements and affections of thoſe who do ſo love and honour, to all his matters, as well of opinion as practiſe; at leaſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:125233:24"/>
armour of proof againſt any prejudice in reſpect of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thirdly, when men and women are converted unto God, they are endued with a principle of a neerer and more inward ſympathie and compliance with all the wayes of God, then they had before. So that there is more cauſe for Miniſters to fear the withdrawing of their people from them before their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then after, in caſe the way of worſhip and government which they imbrace, be of God. For in this caſe and ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unconverted ones have no inward ſutableneſſe of ſoul, to incline them to love or delight in this <hi>way,</hi> and conſequently their hearts muſt needs ſit looſe (if they ſtand not in oppoſition) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o it: but thoſe that are converted, are baptized into ſuch a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is apt to comport and correſpond with it. Again</p>
            <p>Secondly, if the hearts of men and women upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion unto God, are ſo generally found (for otherwiſe there is no place for the jealo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Yea, moſt of thoſe revelations of himſelfe, which he was graciouſly pleas'd to impart unto his ancient Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> were not imparted unto them by their Synedrion or Great Councell, but by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men; who likewiſe uſually (if not alwayes) received their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations from God, in their greateſt privacie and ſequeſtration; yea, and that (if the obſervation of the Rabbins will hold in that behalfe) whilſt they were yong. That light of Evangelicall truth, wherein the Reformed Churches rejoyce at this day, yea, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over Antichriſtian darkneſs, did not break out of the clouds of Councels and Synods unto them, but God cauſed it to ſhine upon them, from ſcattered and ſingle ſtarres, as <hi>Luther, Calvin, Zuinglius, Martyr,</hi> &amp;c. God never took any pleaſure to cumber his arme with fleſh and bloud, when he meant to doe any great thing for his Church by it. Wee find him once complaining right out, that <hi>the people were too many for him,</hi> to give deliverance or victory<note place="margin">Judg. 7. 2.</note> by; but we never heard of any complaint from him that they were too few. And why may we not think, but that God may as well ſay within himſelfe, that there are too many learned and wiſe men in a great Councell, for him to reveale truth, or to give victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt error by? The reaſon of this kind of diſpenſation is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious; and therefore I forbeare (for the preſent) to inſiſt upon it.</p>
            <p>3. As a preſuming confidence of a mans leggs, is a ſigne of ſuch a <hi>time</hi> or <hi>chance</hi> (in <hi>Solomons</hi> phraſe) wherein the <hi>race ſhall not be to the ſwift;</hi> and ſo the challenging a victorie, as it were of courſe, becauſe we have chariots, and horſes, and vaſt multitudes of men, expert in warre above our enemies, is a preſage ſeldome failing, that <hi>the battell</hi> will <hi>not be to the ſtrong:</hi> in like manner when Synods and Councels ſhall beare themſelves inordinately upon their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and multitudes, upon their wiſdome, learning, and pietie, and becauſe of theſe, ſhall (upon the matter) challenge an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie (for what doe they leſſe, when they command all mens judgements and conſciences to bow downe at the feet of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations?) this is little leſſe then an authorized ground of Divination, that they will miſcarry, and that God will not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

unto God; wherein himſelfe more frequently interpoſeth by his prerogative, and ordereth the tenor and courſe of occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and effects, beſides the proportion of ſecond cauſes, by the good pleaſure of his will. All the great and rare inventions of the world, which either former, or latter ages have brought to light, were not the iſſues or reſults either of the thoughts or ſtudies of the wiſeſt or learnedeſt of men, nor yet of the conſultations or communications of the greateſt numbers or multitudes of men: but the wiſe Diſpoſer of all things, according to his owne good pleaſure and will, caſt this honour upon particular and ſingle men, (for the moſt part) and thoſe not alwayes of the moſt learned or profound, as by many inſtances might readily be evicted, if it were neceſſary. And <hi>Solomon</hi> reports unto us a caſe, wherein one <hi>poore</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9. 15.</note> 
               <hi>man by his wiſdome delivered a Citie</hi> out of imminent danger; which (it ſeems) all the reſt of the Inhabitants did not ſee or apprehend how to doe. Yea, in Councels themſelves, or greater aſſemblies of men, it is uſually ſeene that ſome one, or few, either of predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant parts, or authoritie amongſt them, ſway and ſteere all the proceedings, and act the judgements and affections of the reſt, though conſcientious and learned to a degree. So that upon the matter, and juſt accompt, the reſolution<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of Councels and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods themſelves, are but the fruits or putting-forth of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and judgement, of a very few men; and whether theſe be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of the moſt conſcientious, I had rather others ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, then I determine.</p>
            <p>The laſt objection deſigned for preſent examination, is this that the intent and project of this way, is ambitious, high, and dangerous, that it affecteth a Dictatorſhip Eccleſiaſticall, a power of Law-giving, that it undermines Civill or Parliamentary Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, &amp;c.

                  </gap>.</hi> The words are good, if the interpretation did but anſwer. For doubtleſſe the Brethren in the mentioned period and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, reflected only upon the generality of the people in the Land, who according to the Lawes of the Land; yea, according to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of all reaſon and equity, have the right of nominating perſons into the places of Parliamentary truſt and power; but have no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or power from Chriſt to nominate or appoint, who ſhall be the men that ſhall order the affairs of Chriſts Kingdome, or inſtitute the government of his Churches. Theſe, and eſpecially the ignorant and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious part of them (which they that know any thing concerning the generality of the Kingdome for matters of Religion, muſt needs know to be far the greater part in every place) are that <hi>ſecular root,</hi> out of which the Brethren conceive an impoſſibility, that <hi>a ſpirituall extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould be made,</hi> that is, that a legitimate Eccleſiaſtique power ſhould according to the minde of Chriſt, or any precept or preſident of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, be by them conferred upon any man: and this impoſſibility con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them, they only illuſtrate and declare by that parallel expreſſion in <hi>Job, Who can bring a cleane thing out of an uncleane?</hi> When they imply, that men unworthy, and ſtrangers to the power of godlineſſe and matters of Religion, have the right and power of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Parliamentary truſt and power, upon perſons choſen by them hereinto, they reflect not the leaſt touch of prejudice or diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the perſons honoured with that choyce: Firſt, becauſe there is no other way, no, nor is there any conveniency or lawfulneſſe of any way whereby to aſcend the height of the intereſt and honour, but ſuch a choyce: And ſecondly, the votes and voyces of ſuch men being carried upon perſons of honour, worth and Religion, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates that there was ſo much the more of God in their election;

which is ſo far from diminiſhing their honour in the leaſt, that it add<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> double and treble unto it. But to hold that the perſons ſo elected, as hath been ſaid, have a power by vertue of ſuch nomination or election, to enact Laws and Statutes in matters of Religion, and to order under mulcts and penalties, how men ſhall worſhip and ſerve God; as it is a means to awaken the eye of jealouſie upon them, and ſo is ſeven times more deſtructive unto, and undermining, not only of their power, but of their honour, peace, and ſafety alſo, then any thing that is found in the <hi>Way</hi> ſo ill intreated; ſo is it the ſetling of a power upon the electors of ſuch perſons, I mean, upon the promiſcuous multitude of the Land, a greater power then ever Jeſus Chriſt himſelf had, at leaſt then ever he exerciſed. For as <hi>dare Regem</hi> argues a greater power then <hi>eſſe Regem,</hi> as hee <hi>that buildeth an houſe, hath more honour then the houſe, Heb.</hi> 3. 3. So to nominate and appoint who ſhall have power to umpire in matters of conſcience and of God, to determine what ſhall be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and what not, what ſhall be believed, and what not, is a branch of a greater root of power, then the exerciſe of the power that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto others in this behalf. Now though Jeſus Chriſt had a power, and was authorized by God to be a Law-giver himſelf unto his Churches and Saints, in their ſpirituall Republique; yet it is hard to prove that ever he inveſted any other with ſuch a power. His Apoſtles themſelves were <hi>no Lords over the Faith</hi> of the Saints; nor had they any power or authority to impoſe any thing upon men, as neceſſary, either to be believed or practiſed, but what they had in expreſſe commiſſion and charge from Jeſus Chriſt himſelf to impoſe upon ſuch terms. So that notwithſtanding that ſevere &amp; angry conteſtation of the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Gentleman againſt the two Brethren with their fellows, <hi>Is this your ſo much boaſted of preaching, writing, fighting for the rights &amp; priviledges of Parliament?</hi> whereby he thinks to daſh both them and that <hi>their boaſting</hi> together out of countenance; though they boaſt neither little nor much of any thing; boaſting is their charge not their crime; they only ſay, and that with modeſty yet, bleſſed be God, they are able to maintain and make good that their <hi>boaſting</hi> (if it muſt needs be ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) in the ſight of God and Angels, and men, and Devils, and <hi>whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beſides is named, not only in this world, but in that alſo which is to come.</hi> And though he hath done like himſelf, and (I ſpeak it to his honour) far above the line of many others, in vindicating the rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Parliament; yet (<hi>abſit verbo invidia</hi>) I am very confident, that there are thouſands of that <hi>Way</hi> and judgement, againſt which his pen riſeth up with ſo much indignation, who rateably, and according to their means and opportunities, have quitted themſelves upon equall

            <p>4. (And laſtly) It were no task of much labour or difficulty, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate that the <hi>Way,</hi> in the defence whereof we have thus far ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, is ſo far from carrying any malignity, or ſeed of danger in it to the State, or perſons inveſted with civill power, that it is of a manifeſt and rich compliance both with the one and the other. He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded<note place="margin">Matth. 22. 21.</note> 
               <hi>to give unto Ceſar the things that are Ceſars, and unto God the things that are Gods:</hi> did <hi>Ceſar</hi> as much (if not more) ſervice, in the latter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as in the former. Silver and gold, wood and ſtone, never got any thing by having an artificiall deity beſtowed upon them, and being worſhiped, but only a meer proximity to deſtruction. They that ſhould only have ſaid unto <hi>Herod,</hi> that he had ſpoken like a ſober and well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed man, might have ſhewed as much affection to him, yea, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him upon better terms, then they that ſhouted, <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>God, and not of a man.</hi> There is no foundation ſo ſure and precious to build the honour, peace and ſafety of <hi>Ceſar</hi> upon, as a ſtone duly pitched for a land-mark between God and him. But if there be a queſtion or difficult caſe between God and <hi>Ceſar,</hi> whether ſuch and ſuch things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the one, or unto the other, they will be found the beſt and faithfulleſt Counſellors unto <hi>Ceſar,</hi> who ſhall adviſe him rather to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render unto, then to claim a doubtfull right or priviledge from God. The <hi>Way</hi> we ſpeak of is ſo ingenuous, loyall and true-hearted to men in place of civill authority and power, that it teacheth her ſons to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves unto their diſpleaſure, for the procurement of their good; which even the heathen themſelves have atteſted for one of the beſt and leaſt queſtionable ſigns of true friendſhip and love.</p>
            <p>To theſe anſwers of objections, I thought to have added ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive arguments, whereby the <hi>Way,</hi> now little more then only defended, might have gained the honour of a more perfect conformity to the Will and Word of God, then (perhaps) hath been diſcovered or ſeen hitherto. Yet I cannot but think, that the vailes of the principall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which covered the face of it, being rent and torn, the beauty and brightneſſe of it muſt needs ſhine forth in the eyes of all thoſe who have not ſacrificed unto partiality.</p>
            <p>To cloſe with a word of exhortation. The premiſes conſidered, as we love the things of our peace, and deſire the ſpeedy diſperſion and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of that dark and black cloud ſtill hanging and hovering over our heads, and threatning more fiery ſtorms &amp; tempeſts of deſolation and blood upon us, and to ſee the heavens cleering up, and looking like Cryſtall or Saphire over us, as we deſire to ſee thoſe terrible ſwarms of

Locuſts and Caterpillars, which now devour and eat up our good land daily, ſwept away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carried by a ſtrong weſt wind into the midſt of the ſea, that ſo we may be fed again, with the ancient heritage of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I mean plenty, ſafety, and peace; if there be any bowels, any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions in us towards our nation, (ſo far ſpent &amp; waſted with miſery) towards our cities and habitations, towards our friends, towards our ſelves, towards any thing which is dear either to the one, or to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; let us be exhorted to take heed of <hi>fighting againſt God;</hi> let it be the firſt-born of religious adviſements and cautions to us, not to be fierce, no, nor ſo much as to lift up an hard thought againſt Doctrine or <hi>Way</hi> claiming origination and deſcent from God, till wee have ſecurity upon ſecurity, conditions as cleer as the noon-day, that they are but counterfeits and pretenders only, and ſtand in no relation at all, but that of enmity and oppoſition unto God. Particularly, let us be tender above all tenderneſs, to act to the value of the leaſt hair of our heads in any way of bitterneſs or blood, againſt that <hi>Way</hi> of governing the Churches of Chriſt, which hath by ſo many good hands been preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us as moſt agreeable unto the Word and Will of God, untill we ſee the condemnation of it written with a beam of the Sun, by the finger of God himſelf; untill he hath diſclaimed or renounced it from heaven, either by giving ſuch wiſdome unto men whereby to detect the error and vanity of it, or elſe hath quite raſed it out of the fleſhly tables of the hearts of his Saints, and diſtreſt ſervants. The motion and matter is of a moſt ſerious and formidable importance; therefore let me exhort you yet once more, to <hi>beware of men,</hi> (as our Saviour ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth, in a caſe of leſſe conſequence) to take heed, that no man, either through paſſionate exclamations and outcries, or through any faire or flouriſhing pretences whatſoever, draw your foot into this ſnare, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage you in any ſuch warfare, wherein, for ought you know, you ſhall <hi>fight againſt God.</hi> If your judgements ſtand off from the cauſe wee ſpeak of, for the preſent, and you can ſee nothing of God in it; you may pleaſe to conſider, that this was the caſe of many thouſands amongſt you, in whom there is much of God, and in whoſe heart is this <hi>Way,</hi> as a <hi>Way</hi> of his. If they be deceived in imbracing it, God<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15.</note> will ſhew mercy unto them in revealing the truth unto them in due time. But if you ſhall be deceived in the violence and fury of your <hi>fighting</hi> againſt it, is it not much to be feared, that you will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with the guilt of ſuch a ſin, which <hi>ſhall not be purged from</hi>
