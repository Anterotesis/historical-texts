            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For by the 29 Chapter of the great Charter, <hi>all Commoners are to be tryed by their equals;</hi> and there are 30 Seſſions of Parliament which confirm the great Charter, being a Statute declaratory of the Common Law, eſpecially thoſe eminent Laws, wherein your Lordſhips had your ſhares in making of them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Petition of Right in the 30 <hi>Caroli,</hi> and the Act for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhing the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and regulating the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel Table, in the 17. <hi>Caroli,</hi> in which many Statutes are enumerated, <hi>That Commoners ought to be tryed by their equals, by Bill of Indictment or writ original, and by thoſe of their neighbourhood;</hi> And all Decrees and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made contrary thereunto, are declared thereby to be <hi>null and void in Law,</hi> which bars all Preſidents: And by ſeverall Declarations and Ordinances your Lordſhips have declared, that <hi>Ordinances are no Laws,</hi> but temporary, during the Wars; and the cauſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity being taken away, your Lordſhips have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the free people of <hi>England, that they ſhall be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the known Laws of the Land,</hi> as it appears in the <hi>Ordinance</hi> dated the 15 of <hi>January,</hi> 1647. And it is againſt the Law of <hi>God, Nature</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> that any perſon or perſons ſhould be <hi>Judg</hi> and <hi>Parties, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminers &amp; Accuſers</hi> in their <hi>own cauſe,</hi> or to be tryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny otherwiſe then by a <hi>known Law, for where there is no Law there is no tranſgreſsion.</hi> It is declared by Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cook,</hi> that the <hi>Parliament</hi> cannot make a <hi>Law</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> which is cuſtom according to <hi>Right</hi> and neceſſary <hi>Reaſon.</hi> That Preſidents are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

The old Maxime in Law is, <hi>Non recurrendum eſt ad extraordinaria quando fieri po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt per ordinaria.</hi> And your Lordſhips are not only <hi>ſworn,</hi> but have impoſed ſeveral oaths, as the <hi>Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> upon the free Commoners of <hi>England;</hi> to defend the <hi>fundamental Laws of the Land.</hi> And they are confident your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips will be very tender of the preſervation of the <hi>great Charter,</hi> in which is wrapped up our <hi>lives, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>estates;</hi> Your noble Predeceſſors being ſo glorious and famous Inſtruments in aſſiſting the PEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLE, in purchaſing the ſame.</p>
               <p>Concerning the point of Preſidents, which is all can be ſaid for your Lordſhips, we ſhall give you this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>1. It is obſervable, that moſt Commoners, which have ſubmitted to your Lorſhips Juriſdiction, were in the time of the Civil Wars, <hi>Flagrante Bello,</hi> not by compulſion, but by <hi>voluntary Petitions</hi> of the <hi>Commons</hi> in a ſummary way, to the <hi>King in perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. One Preſident againſt your Lordſhips Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is of more conſequence then a thouſand for it; The reaſon is plain, becauſe all Courts of Judicature are bottomed upon the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> and it cannot be ſuppoſed that any Court can be miſcognizant of its own Juriſdiction. Your Lordſhips have confeſſed in Sir <hi>Simon de Berisfords</hi> caſe, that it is againſt the Law for Peers to try Commoners, and your Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
<pb facs="tcp:117672:5"/>
have promiſed upon record, that they wil never do the like again, though that occaſion were ſuperlative.</p>
               <p>3. The Corporation of <hi>Cambridg</hi> was accuſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King and Lords for complying with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels of <hi>Eſſex, Kent</hi> and <hi>Hartford,</hi> their Councel plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt the Juriſdiction of the Lords Houſe, in the point of Treaſon, and the King and Lords allowed of the Plea, as appears <hi>Rot. Parl. 5. Rich. 2. numb.</hi> 45.</p>
               <p>4. As there are many preſidents more may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that Commoners have denyed your Lordſhips Juriſdiction, and that your Lordſhip have tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch caſes to the <hi>Common Law,</hi> if deſired by the free people; ſo there can no preſident be ſhewn that Commoners, which have refuſed to be tryed by your houſe, have been over-ruled by them in point of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</p>
               <p>5. There was never Preſident, ſince there were Parliaments in England, That the ſame Seſſion of Parliament hath impriſoned, fined, or any otherwiſe diſſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
