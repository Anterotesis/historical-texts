            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Greekes also, for this purpose, haue bene noted of learned men, to be by disposition and motion of nature exquisite searchers of cunninge in manuel craftes, &amp; verie studious in the liberall Sciences. The Egiptians and Iewes (by obseruation of wise men) are founde more geuen to superstitions and idolatric, then other nations: The Scythien, the Turke, and Tartarian addicted to crueltie, and the Persian to delicate life. But to drawe nearer vnto our skope, and marke, The Englyshe man (for whom this trauaill is taken) liuinge in a fertile countrye, and vnder a temperate Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and thereby indewed with the more excellent disposition of mynde and bodie, beinge by the great bountie and blessynge of God not vnfurnished of anie vertue, that other people haue: So is there principallye seene in him, that yet remaines of the right stampe or race vndegenerate, an honourable desire to the exercyse of armes, hauinge by the prycke of Magnanimitie, a victorious mynde, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectinge fame, soueraigntie, and honour aboue other nations. But least I flatter him whom I loue, and woulde to be warned, Two one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye poyntes of imperfection, thoughe not yet, nowe, notablie excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to anie great vice, (how? be it some defectes) are noted to bee in a great parte of Englishe men, whiche maye well bee refourmed. The one is, negligence or securitie: The other is mutabilitie, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable chaunging of mynde, principallie shewed in delectable thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, not of the greatest importaunce, as in daintie fare of sundrye delicate meates, diuers curious buyldinges, and most of all in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye

almost infynite guyses, sortes, and fashions of habyte, yea and diguysed attyre, whearein, oftentimes is planted and bestowed so muche care and studie, that, there is the lesse employed on vertuous and neadefull exercyses. Yea sometime, while tryfles are regarded, thinges most commendable &amp; requisite are neglected. I doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempne them, but commende ornamentes, they are to bee regarded in a sorte, and not to be reiected: but more worthye thinges to be pla ced before, and with greatest desire &amp; diligence endeuoured. Weare it not to be pytied, that the great helpe and benefite of nature geeuen to this nation, in highnesse of courage, and noble inclynation to prowesse, should be defaced &amp; obscured, that no light effecte, or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof shoulde appeare? yes, but there is an other thinge in it, besydes the pittye of the matter, which is the qualitie and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this time, wherein wee liue, whiche if it be well considered, will sufficientlie perswade (where iudgement is, thoughe feawe wordes be vsed hearein) to stirre vp the sleapinge myndes from slewthe, to abandon tryfles, and fall to the commendable practises meete for men, and necessarie for the troublesome state of the worlde. For what is in want or lett that the Englisheman, hauinge a stronge bodie, good will enoughe, and a fertyle countrey, sufficient to supplye the prouysion and maintenance of a myghtie armye, shoulde not excell other nations in deades &amp; exployctes of Armes, and extende the victorious forces of this Realme, by renowmed conquestes farre? Surely the defectes are, lacke of endeuour, &amp; discipline. By these the Citie of Rome, from extreme pouertye (hauinge most bare &amp; slender <note place="margin">Practise &amp; skyll. Dido obtay ned somuch grounde, to buylde the Citie vpon, as might be compassed vvith an ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es hyde, and that she cut in thonges.</note> beginninges, their territoryes beinge as short, as the content or boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des of the smallest shyre within this lande) in shorte time, aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her Empyre ouer the whole worlde, By these likewyse, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginoys, whose towne, countrey, &amp; dominion, weare first bounded by the circuyte and compassinge of an Oxes hyde: Soone after, they grewe in greatnes, to checke &amp; encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter the mightie estate of Rome, &amp; once put the same in daunger of a mate, by this skill, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of Macedone beynge not great, vnder the conducte of the most puissant Alexander, subdued the mightie Monarchye of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, with a great parte of the worlde besides, and in his mynde had the plott and conquest of the whole, yea &amp; of an other worlde, if it
<pb facs="tcp:19666:4"/>
had bene to be founde, but GOD stayed his victories, (whiche men coulde not) by cuttinge of his life, about thyrtie yeares of his age. The mightie and victorious Alexander of Englande, whose most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noumed battaile of Agincourte, and sudry triumphant conquestes in Fraunce, made the whole worlde to shake, was cut of in like youthe, <note place="margin">Henrye the fifthe.</note> from no lesse hope, then the other greate Alexander, after that hee had by most excellent disciplyne of warre, in shorte time obtayned many greate victories. By this arte and practise, of later time, an other Pirrhus, Prince of the little Countrey Epirus in Grecia, resisted the huge and grosse powers of the greate Turke: By this, the greate <note place="margin">G. Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg. Baiazet.</note> Tamberlane conquered him, and made him his miserable vassall and captyue, in feawe yeares, arysinge from a poore Neteherde, to be Lorde ouer the most mightie Prince in the worlde. By this excercise partelie, thoughe principallye by the huge monstrous multitudes of barbarous Scithyens, the Turkes in no longe time, haue subdued so many kinges and countreyes, and extended their Empyre so farre, into all the three partes of the worlde, &amp; yet prosecuteth and thrus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the same further daylie. Now it is to be reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and practyse of the actes and feates of armes, principallie and properlye are of the profession of noble menne, and gentlemen of greate reuenues. For and by whiche, they were firste ordayned and preferred into that place, to be a wall and defence for their countrye. For the poore man hath not, wheareof to lyue of his owne, if hee em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploye time, or expences hearein. And thearefore the other, ought to geue example, bothe by his owne industrye in such practises, and also maintayne the same in the meanor sorte. Securitye and longe peace breadeth idlenes, whiche sucketh the valure out of noble myndes. A plaine proofe wheareof, &amp; of the hurte that groweth theareby, ys <note place="margin">The arte of Nobilitie.</note> had by the Romaynes, whiche in xxiiij. yeares space, betwene the first and seconde warres of Carthage, weare so farre growen out of vse and good practyse of armes, that wheare as before, they weare euery wheare Conquerours. In the seconde warres, they went, alwaies to wracke, till their sundrye greate losses droue them vnto their olde course &amp; Bias againe. Thus seeynge the causes of these defectes in Englishe men discouered, the cure is the more plaine &amp; casie, &amp; the rather, if the remedie vnto the other impediment be applyed, that
<pb facs="tcp:19666:5"/>
ys want of skill or discipline, which proceadinge &amp; growing partlie vpon the other cause, vz. lacke of practise, the reste, is also to bee sought for and supplyed.

               <p>THe skill and knowledge of all which, are verie necessarie for our nation, but especially of the first &amp; the last. Now for explanation of the diffini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion aboue, I wil go vnto the singuler partes there of. Warre is first sayd to be a contencion which is deryued of the latine woord tendo: it signifieth
<pb facs="tcp:19666:8"/>
properly to be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, so that with this particle, Con, it is by the Etymologie or Interpretation of the woord, a be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng of the forces, an inclinyng of al endeuour, a striuinge vnto some purpose, betwene what parties? it followeth, betwene princes or es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, for if it be betwene subiectes without auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the prince, it is a faccion, &amp; if the same be vsed agaynst the prince, it is a rebellion, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention against lawe, duetye naturall, allegeaunce, and agaynst the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. By what meanes and instrumentes is this stryfe made and pursued? By armes and force of menne, whych are to bee vsed for the defence of the Realme, Territories, Lawes, bondes, libertyes and rightes of the same. And this same power of men, which is the pythe and matter of the warre, is also to receyue some forme which shapeth things in their perfeccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; that therein is guyde &amp; gouernment, for without order and conduct, thys force is not woorthye the name of warre: but it is a tumulte, route or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie of people, prepared not for victorie, but ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nynge headlong, or rather tumblinge headlesse into Ruine. So that it is to bee concluded, that a prynce for the ordayninge and waginge of warre, is to prepare and gather together a power of men vnder orders and gouernmentes, whych power so appoynted, is called an armye, the seuerall bandes and partes whereof must haue sundrie guydes and Captaynes: and ouer the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die <note place="margin">The diffini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.</note> of the armie, there is to be constituted and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained

The other part or braunch of pietye, is to serue God religiously, and duely, which because it ought to bee a ground worke, proper vnto euery Christian man: therfore haue I not noted the same as a peculier or perticuler vertue heare: But I say the more Christian the meater Captaine, and the better hee serueth God: the better hee shall hys Prince and Countrey. In this vertue of Iustice the Captaine ought to bee very diligent and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to see as well the iust rewardes of vertue, as the due punishment and correction of tumultes,

rapyne, iniuryes, disorder and breach of discipline and lawes of warre, wherein, the quantitie and qualitie with the circumstances of time, person, &amp; place, is to be waighed in iudgement by the paise of wysedome, in the balance of endifferency, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vpon the beame and rule of right, that refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation may grow, and not confusion follow there of: that by example of a feaw, many may be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and yet no such remisse clemencie to be vsed, that negligence of Iustice should breake all good order. But if by faire meanes or perswasion, the euil might be wonne or reformed, it is first so to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayed, and when none other remedy, then rygour roughly to be extended: How be it, often times the greatnes of the mischiefe requireth sodaine iustice. For in warres, the like time of deliberatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; staye in iudgement and execution is not giuen, as in peace, for the generall affaires and state of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, maye not be stayed or neglected, for priuate causes. And therefore the Captaines dome, order, or sentence, in this case of spedie Iustice, standeth for law, and is called martial lawe.

the armye, fayning that he would chaunge his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with him, when he had put of the same, the King remayning stil armed, thrust him thorough with his swerd, and so deliuered his estate from daunger. King Aswerus likewise, caused Aman &amp; his sonnes to be sodainly apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded &amp; executed, because that thorough their great power, the stay thereof had bene daungerous.

But the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Law or sentence, would be vsed and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnder this forme and order, that the generall calling vnto him such of the Captaines and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall persons of the Army, as he shall thinke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient thereunto, reciting shortly the maner of the offence, the mischiefe that might grow therof, the odiousnes and villanye of vnnatural Treason, and dissention within an armye, tending to the ouerthrowen of most valiant &amp; worthy persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of most honorable attemptes, and purposes, the quayling of most great and high endeuours before in that seruice vsed, and to the miserable spoyle of the whole army, with the decay and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour of the countrey of whence they are: and there with all the proofes being heard, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, to geeue iudgement according to the nature of the offence, and commit ouer order, for executing the same. And sometime for the better satisfiyng of the army (if time permit) it is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for the punishment of criminall causes, to referre the hearinge thereof to the Captaines of
<pb facs="tcp:19666:13"/>
euery bande, and certaine of them to speake theyr mindes, for the qualitie and odiousnes of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, with some admonishment at the last to the <note place="margin">Exod. 18. Iethro gaue counsaile vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Moyses to make the like distribution and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission of the comen affaires vnto other, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eased of a great part of that burden, he might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attend to the more waightie causes.</note> rest of the hearers. And sometime, it is policie to commit the same vnto twelue or more of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner sort, or commen souldiers, as circumstances may require. And if the partie accused, and vnder iudgement, be a straunger, it is the better order of Iustice, that he haue parte of his triall by some of his owne Countrey, if the matter be playne, that they be not to be suspected of partialitie. And the whilest that other haue the handling of this matter, the generall may the better attend his greater af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. For the other part of Iustice, what course is best to be taken in rewarding the valure and well deseruing of those, which with great endeuour, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for same, to the honour and aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Countrey: Hearein the good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Captaine, is to be exercised, for wel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and right regarding the dispositions, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, and doinges of each person. For some are geeuen not to make challenge, or claime, of theyr <note place="margin">Ambition disturbeth wel ordered states.</note> owne proper deedes and vertues, other will make large report and ostentation of that which they do, setting the same artificially forthe, to the vtter most, and further, sometime clothing themselues with that which they neuer sponne, and thrusting into the glorie of other mens desertes. And diuers <note place="margin">Enuious and peruerse men of disposition.</note> there are of disposition to extenuate, and seeme to make lesse the vertues of other, whom they cannot
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19666:13"/>
matche in valure. And therefore sith that honour is the right reward of vertue (as the Philosophers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree) &amp; that <hi>Laudata virtus crescit,</hi> and <hi>Honos alit artes:</hi> commended vertue encreaseth, and honour is the nouryce of valure, which maketh men to excell in practises, the Captaine ought to be wyse, to sifte &amp; perceiue such knackes &amp; cunning colours, from substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, that he be a iust distributer of the due sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laire, and rewarde vnto the vertuous, without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or parciality, that they beyng encouraged, encrease, &amp; not discouraged, cease from well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge. Moreouer for the maner of rewardes, there is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>syderation to be had of the person, thus, if he be poore, he may be somewhat enryched thereby, if he meane to bee a continuer in the seruice of warre, to geue him a more highe place, &amp; greater charge in the armie, to call him vnto the more wayghtye &amp; secrete affaires. If he be one that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth or seeketh not wealth, let him haue credite, honour, &amp; aucthoritye the more, vse all curtesye towardes him, findinge meanes to knowe hys de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighte, wherewith, most to gladde or gratifie him, as with horse, Armour, some rare Iewell, or other acceptable thinge, to geue him, where euer he goe, speache of credite, honorable commendation and report: If he desier to become expert in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of warre: by all curtesye and meanes to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hym thereunto, so that (as neare as maye bee) euerye man accordynge to hys desyre and mynde bee contented. And this due fourme of
<pb facs="tcp:19666:14"/>
iustice obserued, with the conformitie of his other dealinges, shalbe vnto the Captaine, a foundation of most highe enterprises. For the generall, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming towardes the souldiers, al that on his part is to be perfourmed: he may the better expostulate and requyre in them their endeuours and duityes, which also they will the more willingly doe, if they be wel paied of their wages, which principally must be prouided for, for money is the synewes of warre, &amp; the Captaine ought not to suspende or delaye the paye of the same any time, except for especiall occasion. When the generall oweth not vnto the souldier, but he hath his wages payed, he may franklye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund him to any seruyce of the warres. Furthermore this vertue of Iustice chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie preserueth the dygnitie of the Captaine, that the souldyers loue him, feare him, and reuerence him, for this is the hoope and bande that bindeth fast together, and strengthneth all the state and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of the warre. This Iustice in the Captaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth two other vertues: that he be liberal where cause is, and to be temperate and continent of his lust and affections to any other vanitie. Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is generally defined in this Latine verse, <hi>Est virtus placitis abstinuisse bonis:</hi> A vertue of refrayning or abstinence from alluring euils, whether it be coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnes, ambition, wanton pleasures, or such like. For modestie of Magistrates or Gouernours, due obseruation of Iustice, and iust distributing of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, preserueth states from sedition. This vertue,

greate Alexander, to his greatest honour, vsed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the captiue daughters of Darius.

               <head>¶ Of Prudence, the fourth vertue in a Captaine.</head>
               <p>PRudence, is an excellent vertue (as necessarye as any thing for our Captaine) which by good aduise, &amp; prudent foresight, guydeth the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires <note place="margin">VVyse Ianus is paynted with two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, one loking towardes things past, the other to that which is to come.</note> in the best course and state, conferring them with thinges past, and prouidinge for thinges to come. This Prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce must haue deliberate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, by iudgement to sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and search the depthe of that which is doubtful, it is the Rule almost of all his doinges, whereby he deuiseth, disposeth and ordereth them, as for due consideration of the quality of his souldiers, good araye of his Battailles, diligent espyall of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies doynges, due estimation of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitye, and occasion of takyng of any aduan<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage, and for the auoydinge of all inconueniences, for the prouision of all necessaries for the campe, for vsynge the endeuours of euery one, as he is most mete, for the assocyatinge vnto his weighty and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete counsailes and practises, men of iudgement wise, of inuention politike, and trust approued. And how to trye, and finde the trustye: prudence also, by meanes discerneth. For all thy deuises, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be concealed, and close kept from the enemy, til the time of practise of the same, they be seeldo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e auailable, &amp; oftentimes hurtful. And as the good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration &amp; iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of a Captaine is to be sene in those pointes before reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred, &amp; ought euer to accompanye his doinges: So is inuention
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19666:15"/>
requysite vnto hym, to deuyse how to cutt of the strength of the enemye, or circumuent hym, for by this, manie thinges haue ben atchieued, which force could not winne. What the policye of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and Vlisses at the battaill of Troye, and Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyrus amonge the Babilonians auayled, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouslye knowne. This inuentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and cunninge to entrapp the enemye, Hanniball had at will, and oftentymes plagued the Romaines there with all. but at the last when he had remayned diuers yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in Italye, wastinge and destroyinge of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trey, &amp; the Romaynes could by no meanes dryue him foorthe, Cornelius Scipio founde out the waye to ryd him, geuinge this prudent aduise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Romaines, that they should sende an armye to inuade Affricke, and besyege Carthage, whiche was the head of the enemies Empyre, shewinge that the stroke at the head as it is most daungerous: so it is most feared: &amp; as when the harte is afrayde, the bloud resorteth from other partes, vnto the comforte thereof, as the principall storehouse of lyfe: So sayd Scipio, the Carthaginoys pinched with warres at home, will sende for their powers abroade to succour them, &amp; kepe saufe the home stall. Which hapned and fell out accordinglye, that Hanniball leauinge Italye, and retourninge into Affricke to defende his owne countrey, and resist the Romaine armye ledd thither by Scipio, was there by him ouerthrowne, Carthage taken, and Affricke subdued. So remooued he the daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb facs="tcp:19666:16"/>
&amp; ruine by excellent inuention from Roome, and caryed the same vnto Carthage. was it not a famous policie of Henrie the fifth, at the battaill of Agincourt, when the power of the French me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stoode most vpon horsemen armed with heauie armour, to cause the fielde to bee pitched full of sharpe stakes when they should inuade his battail? which withdrawinge, till they were come vppon the stakes, then had hee placed his archers in an Iland or plott so inuironned or surrounded, that they might saufelie shoote at the enemie, and hee not come to hurte them, by which traine and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the French hoste tumblinge downe in disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was ouerthrowne: whiche inuention is the more honorable, for that it is credible to be of the kynges owne deuisinge. About the time of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge of Bullen, by kynge Henrie the eyght, this practise was vsed by a noble Englyshe Captayne, for the winninge of a towne (which was defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded on the weaker parte thereof by a marishe, so that ordynaunce could not bee planted to batter the same) he caused pieces of light wood to be secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie made, and cunninglye painted like gunnes, and layinge bordes vppon the marishe, so conueyed ouer his disguysed ordinaunce, by terror whereof at the first summons hastelie made, with great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasse and shewe of the pretended batterye: the towne rendred and yelded vppe vnto him. Great Alexander vsed this cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ninge to gett a fort of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull strength, hee conueyed a fewe actiue men
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19666:16"/>
vnarmed, vp to a rocke, not doubted or loked vnto of the enemye, for the steepenesse and difficultie to bee clymmed, and when they had possessed the toppe thereof, beinge nighe the walles, where they might greatlie anoy them within the houlde, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge a great shoute, or noyse of triumph on a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, and aduauncinge their banners as though there had been a great parte of the armye with them and all sure their owne, Alexander also on the other syde then fiercelie skalinge the walles, the people within, beeynge stryken with great feare, and in a maze, the Castell was easelie by him surprised &amp; taken. Thus to conclude of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Prudence: it is the lyne of the Captaine, to measure hys owne doynges, the touchestone, and the syue to trye &amp; sift the sleightes of the enemie, to discerne the substau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the shadow, to shunne hys trappe, not to bee abused by anie paynted or coloured crafte. And this vertue encludeth in it constancie, without which, a man is no man, for as well, without reason, as without iudgement or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, in time to vse the same, after co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sultation and good aduisement hadd, speadye executyon shoulde followe.</p>

And therefore if the gouernours of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill estates, haue been called fathers, as the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of Roome had first that name, to remember them of the fatherlie affeccion and care, whyche they ought to beare towardes the people: muche more ought the generall, ouer his martiall commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weale to haue a fatherlie minde and regarde, for the souldier leaueth father, all his frendes, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of liuinge at home, to followe his captaine in foreine countrey, committinge his life and all, to the guyde and good fortune of him.

Scipio, is noted, and honoured for this cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie. Alexander the great, passinge some daies in the desertes, &amp; barre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drye places of Arabia, where as no water was to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, so that both the army &amp; himself weare pained with great thirst, &amp; almost intollerable, in this neade, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men souldiour, had by great trauayll, gotten one helmet full of water, and brought it vnto the kinge: which when he had receaued very thankfullye, he powred it out vpon the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, shewing him selfe willing to be partaker of the come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> want &amp; necessitie of his armie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the rest seeing the abstinence and noble minde of their Gouernour, forgott the pinche of theyr thirst, &amp; prepared them selues to suffer any hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and not to bee weryed, but constantlie to continue, to ouercomeall labours &amp; difficulties. The same Alexander no greater in power, then in noble vertue of minde, an other time passinge a iourney in extreme, &amp; intollerable frost, &amp; sharpe weather, with rough &amp; vncomfortable wayes, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge a souldiour stiffe, &amp; almost dead with could of the percynge ayer, he caused him presentlye to be caryed into his tente, &amp; theare being sett in his owne chayer, he sawe him tenderlye dressed, and cherished, geuinge vnto him of his owne clothes to keape him warme.

haue more then one generall, or highe Captayne of the Armie: Belinus and Brennus two Princes, beyng brothers, were ioyntlye gouernours ouer their armie, with which they subdued a great parte of Fraunce, Germayne, and Italye. Fabius, and Porsenna, were likewise constituted ouer the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainearmie, against the same Belinus and Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. Romulus and Remus, by equall aucthoritie guyding their armie, surprised the Cytie of Alba. King Mithridates, &amp; Tigranes, ioyntly, lead their powers against the Romaines. Cassius, &amp; Brutus, were ioygned generalles against Octauius Caesar, and Antonius. Fabius &amp; Minutius, were thought to be well matched together against Hanniball: the one graue, and somewhat slowe by his age, the other hott, quicke, and lusty, the one excelling in aduise and experience, the other better able to styrre and endure paynes. So that albeit, it hath bene more vsed, to ordayne, and depute one onely generall ouer an armie, yet twayne may doe very well, as it appeareth by the examples before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, which may the rather be allowed, for that the one Generall being sicke, hurt, or slayne, yet the Armie is not destitute of a heade, or guide. which sometime is the cause of losse of a battaile, the head beeinge striken and Captayne slayne, the bodie of the armie standeth in a maze, and is highlie discomfited, and oftentimes honourable attemptes ceasse thereby, and goe backwardes, as Crassus, by Parthian falshood slaine, the relyques
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:19666:19"/>
of his armie were shortlie destroyed. Antonius, in his great battaile on the Sea, against Octauius Augustus, fliyng, or rather following Cleopatra, his whole army was e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forced to yelde vnto Caesar. Brennus, as Iustine writeth, beinge dead of hurtes in battaile receaued in Grecia, his purposed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questes in those partes ceassed, and his armie dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed: all that they had gotten beefore, was lost for lacke of a good guyde. Great Alexander bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge dead, the glorye of Macedonie dyed, their victories proceaded no farther, their armies retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and tourned to discention and diuision a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them selues: whereby the Empyre was rent and skambled, and shortlie after taken from them by the Romaines. So that, where there hath been but one head or guyde of the warres, the same be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge cutt of, for the most parte the warrfare hath ended and expired with all: whereas if there had been two generals ordayned, ioyned in auctho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or else successiuelye three or fower, one after an other nominated &amp; appointed after the death or losse of the generall, to supplie the place, and to establishe the state of the armie, the warres myght still proceade, vntill the purpose &amp; desired fruites thereof bee obtained. But more then two generals of one armie at once, I can not finde by any good president allowed.

               <p>THe place and state of a generall is highe, his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, his power, and charge great, and therefore his aucthoritie from the prince by or vnder who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is deputed and ordeyned, ought to be great. To punishe and pardon, to erect, exalt, &amp; pull downe, to take order, or truce with the enemie, to receaue hostages, remitt prisoners, raunsomes and tributes, to geue lawes, libertie, lordshyp, bandes, condici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of captiuitie to the conquered, to ioygne or breake foreine frendshippe vpon vrgent cause, and not otherwise, to impart vnto the souldiers, frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of that which is taken and wonne, to assygne victorious ensignes and solempnitye of honour &amp; prowesse, to geue aduauncement of degrees and dignities vnto the worthye. He maye also leuye, for the great necessitie of the armie, vpon the prynces subiectes where he serueth, &amp; borrowe or receaue ayde of the princes frendes, and herein extende his maisters credite, and the prynce is bounde in honour, to ratifie, allowe, &amp; perfourme thus farre, the dealinge of the generall, by him deputed and appointed, which is also at all times remouable at the pleasure of the prynce, at whose commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19666:20"/>
the warres cease, ende, or otherwise be turned. And the Captaine, ought not to make or establish peace without the consent, will, and aucthoritie of the prince, nor to render anie towne, countrey, or forte conquered, except for great aduauntage or extreame necessitie. Hystories are full of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to prooue the perticulers before recyted, to bee incident to the function of a generall, and therefore in a matter not doubtfull, I will cyte but onelie the large graunt of Gaius Martius, generall of an armye of the Romaines: on a time when a battaill went verie harde with him, hauinge in hys armie, fifteene hundred hyred Souldiours, of whose trust and endeuour he doubted, consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deringe the strayghtes and daunger wherein hys armye stoode, he promised vnto his sayd strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge retinue, that if they woulde extende their valure to the wynnynge of the fielde, to make euerye man of them a Cytyzen, and free of Roome: whiche in that time was a thinge hyghlie regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of straungers, for the honour, great aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and noble fraunchyses thereof, wherewith beeinge encouraged, they spared not to hazarde their lyues, vsinge suche endeuour that the fielde was wonne. And notwyth standynge that by the ordynaunces of the Cytye, noe man myght bee made a Cytizen without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of the Senate, yet hee alleagynge beefore them, that necessy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye is aboue lawe, and that then tyme serued not to seeke the lawes, but rather requyred to
<pb facs="tcp:19666:21"/>
breake them, hee obtayned the graunted free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vnto the souldiours, and honourablye hys promise was perfourmed. And it is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that the prynce should geeue hym cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, power, and aucthoritie in smaller matters, vnto whose order and wisedome hee hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted an armie, which is the strength of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces estate. which trust if it can not saufely be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto one, it were better to ioyne an other in gouernment vnto him, then that the place of the generall shoulde lacke or bee lame of power. Nowe to see what the generall ought to desyre or seeke to gaine by the warres, infinite examples of the antiquitie do shew, especially in the most flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishinge estates of Roome &amp; Grecia, where vertue &amp; valure were chiefly fostered, all the most excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Captaynes sought and endeuoured by victoryes to purchase fame vnto them selues, honour, and aduauncement vnto their countreys, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealthes which they loued so dearelie, and regarded so highlie, that their endeuours (vsed &amp; employed for the benefit of the same) seeme to sur mount almost the power of men, and also credite. Glad was he which by dying valiantly, could sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulerlye profite his countrey. As Brutus the first Consul, Horatius Cocles, the two Decij, Curtius, Atilius Regulus, Scaeuola, Lucinius Dentatus, Codrus, Leonidas, and iiij. hundred gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Lacedaemon with him. And of the spoiles &amp; prises of their conquests, the great captaines of Roome
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19666:21"/>
and Grecia enriched them selues little, but ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred all to the publique treasure, &amp; behoufe of the comen wealth. So that diuers Dictatoures (which was the place of a great Prince, and Gouernour, ouer the whole Empyre, duringe the time of the warres) after the same finished, and great kinges by them conquered, and lead in triumphe with all their treasures, and substance, yet haue they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned little the richer (for all that which passed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough their handes) to their oulde state, and meane degree of liuynge, from whence they weare called, not for their Lordship, but for their vertues. And some of them after, liuynge thriftelye of a little, haue dyed possessed of so short substance: that for the iust honour of their funeralles, due vnto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonages of so great vertues, for want of their owne <note place="margin">Arist. polit. 3. He loseth the name of a good Citizen, which prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth priuat profit, before the commen weale.</note> abilitie, the commen Treasure hath supplied the charges, and expences thereunto. And thoughe some esteeme fame as a bare rewarde, without fruites of profit, yet they regarded nothing of ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in comparison of honour. The Romaynes ordained for honour to victours, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>querours, triumphes, whearein their Generall returninge in great pompe from the warres, all his Captaines &amp; spoyles following his Emperiall charyot, he was with his Armie receaued of his Countrey with all ioye and honour that might be deuised, erectinge also for the perpetuall fame, and memory of such as had greatly aduaunced their Countrey, images set vp in open places, with inscriptions: This was
<pb facs="tcp:19666:22"/>
the father of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. This was the champion of Roome, &amp; terrour of their enemyes. And for priuat, &amp; meane souldiours, which first had bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a ship of the enemyes, entred their campe, or Towne, saued a Citizen, slayne a Captaine of the enemyes, gotten an au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient, broken a rancke, or atchieued any great exploite, they ordayned crownes of siluer, bracellets, &amp; collers of goulde, with such like conisaunces, the worthy wearinge whereof, the souldiours estemed as much, as of great seigniorye. Whereof there is an example, written of a certaine yonge man, in the Armie of Scipio, which had done marueylous deades of Armes in a battaile of his, so that he had deserued such a like rewarde of prowesse, as is spoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in liewe whereof, Scipio thinkinge better to content hym, gaue him a great substaunce of goulde, exhorting him to continewe manlike &amp; valiaunt: but he, verye sadde, threwe downe the monye at Scipio his feete, who demaundinge of hym, whether hee woulde rather haue the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted rewarde, and ensigne of manhoode, hee aunswered, that therefore he had trauayled: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferringe worshippe aboue ryches. The Generall ought to gyue great regarde both by hymselfe, and by others, which without partialitye, maye bee markers and obseruers, of such as best deserue in battaile. And moreouer, the most expert and valiaunt men shoulde bee from one place, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, aduaunced to the hyghest degrees,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19666:22"/>
and offices in the Armye, that the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and rewarde bee duelie assigned, accordinge to desert. Also he must obserue, and execute the lawes, and orders of warre, for theare is no Arte without rules, and in none more necessarye rules, then in this: wherein also disorder most of all hurteth, as neglygence in the watche, or warde, in espyall for discoueringe the Countrey, where the Armye soiourneth or is to passe, wante of furniture, or any prouisyon allowed, or charged vnto any man, breache of arraye, mutyne, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraye, ryott, faylinge of duetye in any poynte, or transgressinge the Captaynes commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which muste stande for a lawe, and rule vnto the Souldiours. These misdemeanours, and offences, the victoryous Romaynes punished streyghtlye, yea sometyme thoughe aduauntage, and benefite grewe vnto the Armye, by excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge the Generalles commaundement, yet the Captayne in thys offence, hath not spared hys owne Sonne, from sharpe Iustice, and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the lawe, and ordinaunce violated. For the due keepinge of Lawes, and orders, is the staye of all the affayres of VVarre. Also the Captayne hath muche more neade to bee wyse in iudgement, then the ciuill Magistrate in peace, for that hee hathe not so manye assystentes, to ayde hym in counsayle, neyther like leasure in deliberation, and aduyse: Some time hauinge so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne daungerous comminge on, to disturbe,
<pb facs="tcp:19666:23"/>
and interupt the same. Sodaine passions, (saye the Philosophers) troubleth, and disordreth the minde, and quiete establisheth the vnderstandinge, and ripenethe counsailes. The greke Philosopher Iso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates sheweth, that two sortes of men theare are to be commended. First he which is of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, able to geue good aduise, the other that is of wisedome to vnderstande good counsaile gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by an other, and of inclination to followe the same: diligence and good will supplieth a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of wantes. There hath bene diuers Generalls of great vertue in trayning of their souldiours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge able of their owne practise, to instructe them in all feates, and pointes of a Souldier, as in well vsinge of armes and weapons of warres, bothe on horsebacke, and on foote, in chosinge and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fitt, and good furniture for euery man, and euerye purpose to encounter the ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and engins of the aduersaries, by policie planting, and hardye, and victorious minde in their souldiours. In which Cirus, Romulꝰ, Paulꝰ Aemilius, Scipio, Hannibal, &amp; Caius Caesar, chiefely excelled. How be it that Captaine, which is able wel to leade, and gouerne an army trayned, ordered, and martialled to his hande is also to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if he vse consideration, and diligence in taking order, that his souldiours may practise the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, profitable for the warres. It is to be regarded, that the Captaine be generally of good nature &amp; disposition, not subiecte to malitious anger, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19666:23"/>
or enuie, that hee haue his conuersation and conference with the most vertuous and best affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sorte, to suppresse wrongfull dealynge and ryot, the mother of disorder and ruine. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Charles the fifte was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended of great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie and diligence in his affaires, and to be verie skilfull in settinge and orderinge his battailes, for anie aduauntage. The Captayne ought to flye the faulte of infidelitie and vntrothe, as from a rocke. For there is no regarde to bee hadde of the man that is not iust &amp; honest, and firme of his woorde, but fycle and variable of promise, which ought alwaies to bee perfourmed towardes souldiours, frende, &amp; enemie. The breache whereof hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye times bread great myseries, and brought great wracke: as Laodislaus kinge of Hungarie, vppon presumption of dispensation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Pope, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge his faythe geeuen, and league made wyth the Turke, fell afterwardes into his handes &amp; cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie. The Carthaginoys, breakinge league made with the Romaines, and afterwardes beeinge in parle, and towardes a composition or ende verie necessarie &amp; greatlie desired of the Carthaginens, the Romaines demaunded of them what pledges of their trothe they coulde geeue, or what newe Gods they had now to sweare by, &amp; vowe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmaunce of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicions agreed, seeing they had sworne by all their Goddes before, &amp; had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued in breakinge their othe: Hasdruball a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Captaine, one of the companie, aunswered,
<pb facs="tcp:19666:24"/>
we sweare agayne by the same Godds, which now both wee, &amp; you ought better to regarde, for that they haue reuenged by you sharpelie our periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie &amp; othe breakinge: but the Carthaginoys con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their falsehode, and eftsones violated their fayth: wherefore the Romaines determined finallie, not to cease, or geeue ouer warres against them, till they had vtterlie ouerthrowne them, subuerted and destroyed their Cytie and estate, which their iust plague followed. A noble exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for the due regardinge of his fayth, and othe, shewed Regulus before mencioned, a generall of the Romayne armie, taken prisoner by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginoys, and dismissed vppon his othe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne, if hee did not entreate and obtaine of the Senate of Roome, the exchaunge and deliuerie of diuers great Captaines of Carthage, whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee had taken prisoners, whiche thinge him selfe disswaded the Romaines from, for the bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houfe of the commen wealthe in diuers weightie respectes, and so retourned to Carthage vnto his determined death. Also the general may do much the better if he be able to be his owne secretarie, to endicte orderlie, and aptlie, in his affaires, and to perswade in mutiue discention and case of neede, to vnderstand languages, to reade with iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in hystories, of the dealinges and stratagemes of great princes &amp; captaines in like affaires, for sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the greatest captaines that euer were, &amp; almost all those chiefetaines &amp; conquerours of antiquitie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19666:24"/>
were wel lerned. An other thing also there is which maketh a captaine most honourable, &amp; to be as a father vnto his countrey, that is, after warres e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, if he can frame him selfe to peace, good gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; to be as profitable vnto the cyuill estate by his industrie &amp; policye, as he was by his valure in the warres. So to conclude, though it be harde to fynde a martiall man, so farreforth furnished with all ciuill vertues as before recyted: yet is it not like Tullies oratour, or Sir Thomas Moores common wealthe, which represent a shadowe, &amp; not a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, discoursing of matter like a dreame to bee imagined, &amp; not possible to bee followed, or in such perfection as they preciselie picture to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished. But examples of such chiefetaines as I write of, I haue cyted some, affirming that he may be a good captaine, though he wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of those partes before declared some thing, but the more bright &amp; resplende<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t light of vertues that hee geeueth forth by his exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, the more honourable he is, the more ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tifull is the hope of his successe, the more pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouslie proceade his affaires, the more good he doth to his armie, It may wel be sayde, <hi>Principis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplo totus componitur nobis.</hi> According to the president of the prince, or chieftaine, the subiect conformeth his fashions, &amp; endeuoureth his deedes.</p>

               <p>THe Souldiour in good course must now follow his captaine. And first we are to shewe the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties &amp; disposition of mynde requysite vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19666:25"/>
For all be it, hee ought to bee affected and encly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto vertue, no lesse then the Captaine, yet is it in an other sorte, for the difference of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, functions, and doynges. For there are dyuers thinges, which appertayne vnto the callinge and exercise of a Captaine, whiche beelonge not to a common souldiour: as for rule, and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, politique order and iudgement in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affaires, magnificent and bountifull deedes. But the souldiour ought in like sorte, to be a cyuill manne, to feare God, and liue orderlie in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as it behooueth the Captaine, beinge in day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <note place="margin">Deutero. 20.</note> daungers of deathe, whiche are alwayes lesse feared of him which hath an honest and well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared minde, voide of the horrour and burthen of lewde and dissolute dealinges liynge vpon his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Suche a good souldiour was the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, of whom our Lorde and Sauiour in the viij. of saint Mathaew sayeth, that hee founde not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter faythe in Israel, then in him. And such was the deuoute Cornelius, spoken of in the tenth of the Actes of the Apostles. And it is seldome or neuer seene the dissolute person to prooue a profitable souldier, as if he be an idle, vnrulie, blasphemous, or licentious manne of lyuinge, a ryotous dyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>player or iangler, such bee more meete for an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house then an army. Wherefore good sould your, take thy beginninge of God, Remember first and chyefelie to dyscharge thy duetye towardes him. For wythoute hym noe trauaile bringeth foorth
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19666:25"/>

Then oughtest thou next to seake with all diligence, the honour, profit, and saufegard of thy Countrey, which hath bred thee, and noury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed thee. The same thou art bounde, most sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastlye in thy mynde to hould more deare then thy life: for the preferrement whereof, and for the generall good of the armye, no daunger in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable sorte is to be refused, no endeuour omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For it is better like a man to dye, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houfe of manye, then by cowardyse to bee slayne with manye. The Souldiour also in his degree, ought to fauour Iustice and right, to defende the honest &amp; vertuous from oppression, to be louinge &amp; helpefull after his power, vnto his fellowe soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour. Moreouer it is requisite that he be hardye, constant, and valiaunt, to endurethe bruntes dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and chaunces of warrefare. Yt beseemeth him to bee hyghe mynded (I meane not proude, but rather the contrarye) to endeuour to climbe to the highest top of vertue, and valure. He ought to vse exercises of armes, for encrease of force, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitye, to be diligent, and perfecte in the partes of a souldiour, to keape the orders, &amp; lawes of warre. He must be tractable, and obedient to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of his Captayne, and that without styckinge, for he is to houlde for assured, that the Generall, to whom for his skill, and vertues, the Prince, and counsaile, hath committed the strength of the estate, is a person sufficyent well to guyde
<pb facs="tcp:19666:26"/>
the same, which will by wisedome, and sound ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, order, &amp; dispose his affayres. Yt is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in a souldiour to be full of tongue, or a busie bodie, but he should be secrete and sober. It is not conuenient for him to bee nicelie accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but to endure hardnes of lyuinge, in foode &amp; trauaile. VVherefore the martiall knightes of Roome, which brought vp their children to serue their countrey honourably in the warres, they vsed them not dayntilie in dyet, or curiouslye in clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but caused them diligentlie to be instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vertue, and perfectlie practised in manlike martiall exercises. Licurgus expellinge all idelnes and wantonnes, from the well gouerned estate of Lacedaemon, caused the youthe to dyne &amp; suppe abrode in comen places, with an ordinarye fare; harde &amp; short, to cutt of excesse &amp; rvot, the nourice of slouthe, &amp; that they should not sit longe at their <note place="margin">Effeminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye to force &amp; manlynesse.</note> meate, but be soone gone to the publique exercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and profitable studyes appointed for them. Delicate custome, and lycentious liuynge spoyled of all valure, the victorious and most redoubted army of Hanniball, wallowinge one wynter in the pleintifull pleasures, and fine fashyons of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryous Citizens of Capua, wheare they soiourned, by which the iuste reproofe followed, and was imputed vnto their Captayne, that hee hadde the skill and way to conquere, but he knewe not how to vse and prosecute his victories. For if hee had pursued the Romaynes after the great ouerthrow
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:19666:26"/>
which he gaue them at Cannae, and not runne his Armye on the rocke of ryott, restinge out of time, and waxinge restife by pleasures in Capua: Roome had neuer rysen in seigniorye, or Empyre to bee the loftye Ladie, and Regient of the world, which then beeinge downe, when hee oppressed not by his slackenes, shee toke breath agayne, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to his ruyne. By ryott and carelesse rest, in lascyuious lasye pleasures, Marcus Antonius the moste valyaunt Captayne with his Armye was spoyled and vanquished. The great empyre of the Affiryens sonke in this vice, vnder their Prince Sardanapale, and was subdued. Darius drowned the Persian state in delycate lyfe. Italye of later time setled in loose and licentious lyuinge, gee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge ouer all vertue, and woorthye excercyses, hath offered occasion, to be so often ouercome by the Hunnes, Gotthes, Sayffers, Spanyerdes, and Frenchmen, and so haue fallen, and shall decaye as manye Nations, as geeue ouer them selues to lyke effeminate beastelyke, and flewthfull lyfe. And thearefore those Princes which raygne in reste onelye by fortune, stande vppon wheeles, roulinge towardes ruyne: But the state whiche hath the foundatyon and defence theareof, vpon vertue, is firme, saufe, and permanent. Good Souldyours shoulde lyfte vp their courages to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyue moste hyghe and hard thynges, treadynge abiecte ease, &amp; poorishe pesauntlike idlenes vnder foote, and flying lasciuyous lewde intemperaunce

as from a Scorpion. They ought to contempne dayntines, as a womanlike, and childishe thinge, for the gluttons bodye, or minde, is apte for no good purpose. And yet am I not of his mynde, which woulde haue the souldiour in warrefare, to eate no other breade, or meate, but suche as hym selfe baketh, and dresseth, for, time serueth not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man alwayes so to doe, and some beinge more vnhandsome in handlinge of the same, their foode should be the lesse healthsome. And other percha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce would be ouer curious, and employe more time thearein, then in the most weyghtie affaires. But it is necessarye that for a neade, euerye souldiour knowe howe of meale, egges, otemeale, oyle, or <note place="margin">Moderate dyet.</note> butter, to bake, and make his foode.

him, or the estate of the armie, but hee ought to stretch al his synewes alwaies to profit the same. He must not be ouermuche scrapinge or couetous of spoyles, for so diuers victorious armyes haue bene spoyled and destroyed, whilest they onelie respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge their gaine, haue neglected the enemie, till they haue falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen in his mouthe: for sometyme, the enemie hath left hys campe for a trayne that the other in spoylinge thereof, might be surpry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in disorder and easelie vanquished, to mocke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (with Tantalus his apple, as the Prouerbe is,) plucking the bone or possessd praye, out of their iawes.

               <head>¶ Of what constitution of bodye, trade, and qualitie of lyfe, the best souldiour is to bee chosen: and what exercyses and practises are neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of hym to be vsed. Cap. 11.</head>
               <p>NOwe for the choyse of our good souldiour, for the lykelihode of his strength, courage, and actiuitie, to sett downe a precyse order, for the same by his shoulders, brest, armes, thyghes, feete, or composition of anie other parte of the bodye: I houlde it most vayne: seeinge that good iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the eye discerneth thereof playnelie, and wysedome easelye findeth out fitte exercyses for certayne proofe and tryall hereof, and it is not possible to haue a great armie of men, so framed in all pointes, but the courage &amp; mynde is as much to bee respected as the bodye. But it is necessarye to bee considered, of what age, trade, and maner of lyuinge, best choyse of souldiers maye be made. For their age, the lustiest time of youth for strength, and to endure trauaile, is meetest, as betwene the yeares of two and twentye, and towardes fiftie. How be it, great Alexander had manie of hys best souldiers, aboue those yeares of age. And for their exercyse or trade of lyfe, first it is cleare, that the stronger, better breathed, and harder man of bodie by nature or custome, is the more auaylable for warres: and therefore it is to conclude, that men of suche occupations, as are accustomed most to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19666:28"/>
labour with the strength of their armes, are to bee preferred for this purpose, as smythes, butchers, masons, dyggers in mynes, Carpenters, &amp; most principallye the husbandman, both for his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted enduringe of hardnes in fare, and of all wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and toyle in the fielde, beeinge also for the more parte, of honest inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; thriftie, which be good partes in a souldier. And the daintier sorte of seruinge men &amp; riotous fellowes, are least profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table herein. But the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> speache of fencers, that they be neuer good souldiours, proceadeth not of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For though there be of them, as of other men, some faynte fellowes, yet for the more part, that inclynation &amp; delight in the vse of weapons, sheweth some manlike courage, &amp; the practise &amp; skill therein, breadeth hardines: and albeit there be other sortes of weapons vsed in warres, yet the exercyse of these, causeth nimblenes &amp; actiuitye to handle anie other. And therefore if he bee not otherwise vnrulie, or naughtelye geuen, he that is practysed and skilfull in vsynge of weapons, is lykelye to prooue a valyaunt and an excellent souldiour. But hee that feareth not to receaue hurte, excepte he knowe howe to inflicte daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger &amp; doe harmes vnto the enemie, is not profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And therefore, when there was one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vnto an expert captaine (by his manie skarres of wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des receaued) that he was a great souldier, &amp; a verie man, the captaine asked streight, where is the
<pb facs="tcp:19666:29"/>
man which hurt him thus: brynge him vnto mee, (quod he) &amp; I will entertayne him presentlie, for in this case I like the geeuer, better then the taker. Nowe are wee next, to see, what exercyses are most conuenient and expedient to bee vsed of souldiours. And generallie, suche are moste auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable in the seruice of warres, as cause anie of these effectes: that is to saye, to harden the bodie, to make it nymbler, stronger, or to bee well brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, as for the purpose, wrastlynge, shootinge, dartynge, leapinge, castinge of great stones, vaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, swymminge, and to labour in armour, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyer then the commen forte, which is vsed in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, for custome maketh labour lyght, as it is pro ued by the practyse of Milo, whiche begynninge to carriea Calfe into the fielde to pasture, euerie daye on his necke, hee continued with the same burthen, till it was growen a great Oxe, addynge still encrease of goodwil, to supplie the daylie gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of hys burthen, not sufferyng his force to be sodaynlie so surmounted, that he woulde at anie time shrynke or yelde, vnto the trauaile &amp; burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the daye before passed: So that custome, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to alter or excell nature, eftsones. Nowe the bodie beeynge made apte and nymble, yet doe there twoe other exercyses remayne, to bee put into the practise of a souldyour, for their skyll &amp; order in warres. The first is, that hee exercyse to handle hys bowe, peece, pyke, or other weapon wherwith he shalbe charged, nimblie, &amp; cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19666:29"/>
that he be able to doe his feate thearewith, and if he be a horseman, skilfullye to vse his horse and staffe, to bee readie to mount or alight nymblye at a becke, for any purpose or aduauntage to bee taken of the enemye. The other practise is, to be perfecte in keapynge the arrayes, ranckes, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of warre, in marching, encampinge, &amp; fight, or pursute of thenemye, yea, and in reducing, and bringinge them selues againe into any fourme of arraye, if perchaunce they shalbe broken or disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by force of the enemy, &amp; that spedelie, at the voyce of the Captaine, or sounde of Trumpet, or Drumme, (which alwayes stande by him for the same purpose) or by any other noyse, or certayne signe, which hee vseth, sometime secretelie, and sometime open, to geeue out vnderstandinge of his minde, as to marche, or proceade, to retyre, to take this waye or that. And hearein it is to bee certainlye obserued, a thinge by all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence alwaies approued, that no force of men, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisyon, power, industrie, or furniture can preuaile, without arraye, and order of battaile, against the <note place="margin">One trayned souldiour, worth ten untrayned.</note> well appoynted, whereof a feaw, shall easelie van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishe a multitude disordred, and confusely clus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teringe together. The souldiour thus expert, and by practise thoroughlye manned, furnished and made perfecte mayster, and possessour of his Arte, shall boldelye, and courageouslie proceade into the fielde: For feawe men feare, or shrinke to doe that, whearein they are skillfull, and well practized.

Now for the more endeuour, and exercise to bee vsed and had hearein, thorough out this lande, it is a thinge not after anye other to bee looked vppon, and effectuallye considered vnto refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, leaste wee doynge nothinge, thinke to do muche, &amp; beeinge naked vnder a nette, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our selues armed, when wee are nothinge couered. (For, such is the dulnesse of some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.) I will recyte some Examples of the dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence vsed by the moste excellent estates heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. First in the foundation of the greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchye of the worlde vnder Rome, what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynaunces, and continuall excersyses of warre, Romulus established theare, it is not doubtfull. For the Romaynes allwayes after vsynge the same orders, whiche hee instituted, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto their handes, vppon the same foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proceadynge in prowesse, attayned to moste highe honour of Armes, and erected their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Empyre. Tullus Hostilius, and Ancus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius kinges theare, bestowed greate trauayle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrye, in encreasinge the sayde Disciplyne of warre. In Lacedaemon a Citye of Grecia, which by excellent gouernement grewe to haue domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ouer dyuers Kingdomes, Lycurgus the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique Prince, amonge his Lawes and custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, whiche hee established theare, ordayned that all spare tyme shoulde bee expended in vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exercises, and principallye in the noble prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyses of Armes, to gett honour, and souerayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19666:30"/>
of the enemyes, cleane cuttinge of vnthriftye, wastfull ryott, abandoninge delycate nycenesse, and banyshinge idle, and chyldishe Games, as commen Cardeplaye, Cayles, Coytes, Slyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourde, Bowles, and Blowepoynt, which weare throwen oute of the commen wealthe. From whence also hee dyscarded and expelled, Iang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, Iesters, Iuglers, Puppetplayers, Pypers, and suche like vnprofitable persons, in steade of which weare mayntayned menne of valure, frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge, and exercisynge actiuitye of wrastelinge, dartynge, throwinge the Barre, the sledge, vsinge the weapons of Warre, in skyrmishes, and lyke actes to example the practises &amp; exployts of warre, as skalynge of Fortes, skilfull ridinge, runninge at the rynge, marchinge eftsoones in arraye of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle <note place="margin">Vegetius sayth, that Gentlemen to whom the profession of armes is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as their arte ought from their cradel to their graue, to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thearein.</note> &amp;c. And publique places weare appoynted commodiouslye for the commen vsinge of the same, and moste actyue menne to bee teachers hearein. The honourable exercyses called Olim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piades, celebrated in Grecia, withe concourse of people from all partes of the worlde, to trye va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, and wynne the Vyctours Crowne, thys contentyon in all practises and qualyties of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and commendation, caused Grecia first aboue all other nations, to floryshe in honour of armes, learninge, and other laudable trades, wheare the righte and excellent Dyscipline, and order of VVarre was nouryshed and maintened wythe
<pb facs="tcp:19666:31"/>
great soueraintie &amp; dominion. The famous spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of the exercises of Armes, in Campus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, in the latter time of the triumphant estate of Rome was of great industrie, &amp; actiuitie, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes nolesse honourablye, then duelie on the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidayes frequented, and obserued of al sortes. And at this daye vnder diuers estates in Germanye, this diligence is vsed in trayning of souldiours, &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for warres, they deuide the inhabiters of euerye citie, or shire, into certaine partes, or ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, geuing vnto them the names of such weapons, as they will chose to bee charged with for their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, &amp; seruice in the time of warres, as Archers, Pikemen, Demilaunces &amp; such like, so that theare is no able person, exempted out of these orders, either for exercise, or supplye, &amp; contribution to the charges of one sorte of these weapons, which companies bee thus on their holydaies, and spare times duelie trayned and practised. The Turke also, what numbers hee causeth from verie yonge yeares, to bee brought vp, and skilfullye practised vnto the feates and seruice of warres, and what huge garrisons, and armies of Souldiours, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie maintaineth, it is well knowen: and with all no Prince, Realme, or estate more free from Rebellion of subiectes, and forewarde in victories <note place="margin">Plaut.

               <p>THe weapons which the antiquitie vsed in their warres were diuers. They hadd crossebowes, slynges, dartes, and hatchettes, all which the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebus hath nowe displaced, beinge more auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable for the warres. They vsed also malles like our pollaxes, glayues, hammers, and battail axes. The Romaines vsed most for their footemen, the swerd <note place="margin">Samuel ca. 13 The Isralites for want of weapons vsed their matocks &amp; cowlters.</note> and target, speares or iauelins. The Macedonien weapon, was a longe speare called Sarissa, whych our partizans and pykes well supplie. The Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens were all light horsemen, vsinge bowes and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, by which, in the large plaine cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis, where they sought to ioigne battaill, they archieued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie notable conquestes. In steade of the Parthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens bowe, mee thynketh the curryer weare of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vse for some light horsemen, for that he shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth more certainelie, and stryketh more daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouslie then the arrowe, and when hee hath dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, he maye be gone, and remooue lightlie to charge againe, but his horse must bee well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged heareunto, as vnto all other feates of the warre. Moreouer in myne oppinion, it were an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent furniture for the pikeman to haue a dagge, or a case of dagges at his girdle, for diuers purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. But it is needefull for euerie souldiour in the
<pb facs="tcp:19666:32"/>
fielde to haue a good swerde and dagger, and for the armed souldiour, the same woulde bee but shorte, with waightie pomells, stronge, &amp; narrowe poynted. One other thinge I woulde saye, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, for the regarde of souldiours, when a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is to be leuied, and men prest into the warres, if it stande vppon no greater necessitie, but that such choyse maye be made, it is to be respected, that men of occupation, husbandmen, and suche like, (which after the warres ended, maye retourne to their trades, or els haue somwhat of their owne to liue ciuillye with all) be first taken. Secondlie it is to be considered, that men hauinge great charge <note place="margin">See also Deut. 20. &amp; 24.</note> of children, or occupyinge, be the rather spared &amp; exempted from the warres. For Iudas Machabeus the most redoubted Captaine of the hoast of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, dismissed out of his armie, suche as newely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried wyues, buylded houses, or planted vineardes, whereby their hartes beeynge left at home, they shoulde be the lesse valiaunt, and more lothe to hazarde their lynes. Good order must bee taken, that the commen wealthe be not pestered wyth idle and vnprofitable men, and the same once bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge purged, if none be after taken into the warres, but such as by their trades or other staye, are lyke to liue conuenientlie by their owne industrie or hauoyr, except so manie as maye be maintayned by the warres, preferred by pentions, or placed in garrisons afterwardes: souldiours shall not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to see manie of that sorte, the warres
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:19666:32"/>
beinge dissolued, needie, neglected, and fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to miseries. For surelie the souldiour, that is a ciuill man with all, is an especiall member of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to be regarded more then hee which is lesse able to serue the same, for it is a blessinge of God, both for the vse, necessarie, &amp; of valure, worthye estimation. And therefore principallie, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Captaines ought after the warres ended, to retayne their tender affection towardes the souldiours, which haue serued them well, and to endeuour as they may, to preferre them. But ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie all good men ought to fauour and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honest souldiours, which hath a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaunt desire to propulse the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, &amp; to purchase honour and sauftie, vnto their natiue countryes.</p>

Hanno a Captayne of Carthage, being streightlie besyeged within a trenche, he enclosed himselfe most stronglye, as it seemed, on that parte where he purposed to breake forthe, which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes setting on fire, escaped thorough wyth his armie, the enemies geuing no watche vnto that place. Nabides, at the syege of Lacedaemon, set fire on a parte of the Towne, where enemies weare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, &amp; by the trouble thereof, with a fresh assaulte made of the Townesmen, draue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out agayne. Hanniball, on a time driuen into a streyght by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius the Romayne, so that hee was enforced by a great enconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to passe a hill, where the armie of Fabius lay on the top thereof, he therefore cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed linkes &amp; bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, to be fastened vnto the hornes of a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of oxen which weare in the campe, &amp; setting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on fire by night, the cattail were driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with great noise &amp; larum, vp to the enemies campe, which hearinge the terrible noise of the beastes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they felt the force of the fire, &amp; also being ama zed with the sight, as though they stoode in doubt to fight with the dyuell, that made such a whorlye burlie: Hannibal the whilest, quietly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueied ouer his armie. Diuers Captaynes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue bene hardlie pursued, or let in like passage by the enemy, they haue setled their armies, and begonne tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, as thoughe they would haue rested theare, or ioygned battaile shortlye, withe the enemye, which markinge &amp; obseruinge the same, hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, &amp; made the like preparation, whilest that
<pb facs="tcp:19666:35"/>
the other haue vsed oportunitie to passe suche ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, hilles, or gayne such grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, as they desired. Also the excellent Captaines haue accustomed, when they vnderstoode that the enemie had made strongest the front, or some other singuler part of his battaile, they haue sett against the flanke, or weakest side theareof. Some other, haue suffered them selues to be enclosed by the enemies armie, to the ende, that the same beeinge brought out of order, they woulde breake thoroughe the weakest parte theareof, whiche hath happened to the great hurt of the enemie. Manye thinges theare are to be obserued, which geue great aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage in the ioyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of battaile, as if thou canst trayne thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie into a streight or valley, &amp; thy selfe to possesse the hilles, on bothe sides, as Hanniball caught the Romaine armie at Cannae. And alwayes it is good policie to haue the higher ground of the enemy, and to haue the aduauntage of the winde, and the sunne, for the same being in the face of the enemie, thou maist sett furthe a part of thine armye to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade his battaile on the one side, or at the backe, that their sight being troubled, they shall not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue wheare about thou goest, wheareby also if thou haue any ambushe in anye trenche, wood, or couert laide, as he shall marche, he is more apte to come into the same vndiscouered, &amp; then, sodaine daungers when they be not knowen, or perfectlie sene, are the more feared. As the experience here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was had by Epaminondas, a famous Captayne
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19666:35"/>
of Grecia, which supplyed this aduantage of the sonne, another waye, hee caused his light horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in verie dustie wayes, to make an attempte vpon the enemye, and shortlie to withdrawe, and gallop backe before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the whilest Epaminondas came about vppon them, on the one syde, before they coulde discerne the order of his battaile, for the dust that was raysed, &amp; so easelie vanquished them. The like practise maye be by a pyle of wood, or olde hedges in the waye of the enemyes sette on fire, to rayse a smoke, for a impedyment of their sighte, till some enterprise bee atchyeued. Where the one parte is exceading stronge, by store of horsemen or of shott, it is vndoubtedlie for the aduantage and sauftie of the other, to keepe in rough groundes, or neare some bankes, hilles, or woodes, &amp; also to keepe their armie close that the horse men or shot be verie nigh vpon them, before they bringe foorth their battaill. So shall not the shott haue leasure or leuell to discharge, likelie to hurte, and horses in suche groundes disordered, and leapinge one vpon an others backe for lacke of roome, shall loose their force to take the starte vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the enemie. Great policie also it is, if thou canst come with thy armie freshe vpon the enemie, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with muche trauaile, or beinge in anie mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine amonge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, weakened or discouraged by want of victualles, or anie other perplexitie or distresse by ill tydinges out of their countrey, or some losse else where sustayned, before the same
<pb facs="tcp:19666:36"/>
bee salued or supplyed by anie later victorye, or other good happe fallen vnto them, and it hathe been vsed, cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ninglie to coygne, and cast abrode, imagined rumours of mischiefes towardes, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall and dismaye the enemie. Manie singuler and famous exploytes and victories haue been had &amp; done, when the enemie hath been surprysed on the sodaine in disorder, or by nighte, for want of good espyall, when hee hathe not doubted anie daunger, and therefore it is good to bee circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and readie, to stande still vpon guarde and defence, and little to truste the enemie duringe the warres. Titus Didius, beinge weaker then his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie which was remouinge to encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter a legion, comminge into his ayde, to staye that purpose, hee publyshed thoroughe out all his armie that he entended the next daye to fighte the fielde, and suffered certaine prysoners colourablie to escape, which freshlie coulde so orthe those newes when they retourned into their campe, whereby the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie stayed, and the other sauflie receaued the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour sent vnto him.</p>

               <p>OTher policyes there are to be remembred, and practised, when a battayle is orderlie sette, to breake or trouble the same, and this is one, to geue out with great noyse duringe the fight, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

on the other syde, is slayne, or that parte of hys battaile duringe the fighte, flyeth, or to make some sodaine shewe to be a terrour vnto them. As Caius Sulpitius, caused a manie of Pages vnder Romaine ensignes, with bad cast horses, cartes, &amp; trumperie, to make a great muster &amp; shew sodaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye vpon a hyll within sight, whyle he was a figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge with the Frenchmen, whiche thereby being discomfited, he obtayned the victorie. But it is of greater effecte, if in deede there be a troupe closelie conueyed, or an ambushe layed, on the sodaine, to inuade the enemyes fightynge, at their backe, whiche maye most conuenientlie be done, where there be hilles or couert nyghe. Hanniball in a battaile against kynge Eumenes, threwe earthen pottes full of snakes and vipers amonge his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, wherewith they were presentlie frighted and disordered. The Spaniardes, against the armie of <note place="margin">Plutarch in vita Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balis.</note> the Carthaginoys led by Amilcar, put in their fronte, Cartes full of Towe, drawen with Oxen, and ioygninge to fighte, they kyndeled fire in the same, by force whereof, the Oxen thrust furth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the battaile of the enemyes, and opened it. The <note place="margin">Carts hooked, Horsemen.</note> lyke hathe been done with Cartes full of hookes, by great power enforced and dryuen vppon the fronte of the enemies. For the auoydinge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Sylla the Romaine, planted Pyles &amp; stakes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his battaile, whereby the Cartes were stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <note place="margin">Stakes.</note> and dyd not hurte.

engyns, thorough spaces prepared in the fronte or first rankes, till they may bee turned a syde, by which practise also, great power and fierce assaulte of horsemen hath beecome vayne. Nowe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie sodaine mischiefes, whiche maye fall, and to staye the armie from fearefull flight before there be cause: there bee two firme and necessarie rules constantlie to bee kepte, the one is, that no man for anie sodaine chaunce, terrour shewe by any practise or assault of the enemie made by daye or by night, take anie other waye or purpose, but to fight couragiouslie, till there be certaine signe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by the generall to retyre, or otherwise to deale. The other rule is, that the Captayne cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuented or deceaued by the enemie, seeme to <note place="margin">Tu ne cede malis, sed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Cato Maior by the verie same means, came vpon Antiochus, beinge stronglye guarded &amp; defended, in the streyghtes of Thermopylae in Graecia, at which enterprise, the kinge Antiochus, being greatly hurte with a stone, his armie fledde. Scipio the excellent Captaine, goinge to subdue Afrique, procured in so great warres, the aide of K. Masinissa, whom shorthe after his arryuall there, he se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to prouoke Hanno generall on the other side, for the Carthaginois to fight, who seing the small number with Masinissa led, proceaded against him with all his power on a heape, and the other after a feawe blowes, fayninge to flye, brought the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my foorth vnto Fooles baye, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hoast of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio, which he had arrayed and sett in excellent or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of battaile, readye to receaue the enemie: So was Hanno there slayne, and his disordered Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie put to flyghte. Then Scipio purposinge the syege of the Citye Vtica, and hearinge of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge of Hasdruball and Syphax, with a myghtye power agaynst him, hee planted his Armye vpon an hyll, wheare he might saue and defende his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye, and also with sum<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aduauntage fighte wyth

And when he had vnderstandynge, that the enemyes had setled bothe their campes nyghe, and that their tentes weare made wythe woode and bull rushes warme, for the wynter time, he sent Masinissa, and.

cease, till they had obtayned it all, wheareof his Countreye was parte: and by other such enduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, withdrewe him from the Romaynes, with all his power to assiste them. The like deuise had Hannibal after, to wynne Antiochus kinge of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia, and Prusias kinge of Bithynia, to the aide of the Carthaginoys. Also it profiteth no lesse, to geue occasion vnto the enemye, to distrust, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place their best friendes or Captaines. The Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens weare alwayes victours, till they banished their excellent Captaine Alcibiades, and shortlye after weare subdued by the Lacedaemoniens. And if the Romaines had not banished Coriolan: The Volsciens before subdued, had not afterwardes put Rome in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of ruyne, &amp; vtter ouerthowe. Alcibiades vsed the like practise to make a iarre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Duke Tissaphernes, and his mayster the kinge of Persia. Hanniball wasted and spoyled wheare euer he went in Italye, sauinge onelye the possessions of Fabius vntouched, which he dyd, to cause the Romaines to houlde their best Captaine suspected. Some haue vsed to the same ende, to make manye priuate confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces with the Generall of the enemyes, sending sundry letters secretelye, &amp; sometime presentes, working also that some sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious letter, of an imagined conference or prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, may come to the Princes ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, vnder whom such Generall is deputed.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19666:39"/>
tyme hathe gathered strength. Other wayes there are to detracte battaile, and to saue an armie, at neede, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the greater power of the enemie, which is to encampe stronglie within some trenche or lyke place, or else to bee backed with some fenne, maryshe, steepe hyll, or ryuer, so that the enemye haue but one waye vnto them: and that beinge the streyghter, is the more aduauntage for the fewer number. Fabius vsed this waye with Hanniball, seekinge and endeuoutinge daylie for thauoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge of dyuers enconueniences, to fighte wyth him: but Fabius encamped alwayes so cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and with suche aduauntages for the fielde, that the other without great daunger coulde not deale with him. Marius thus encamped at the mouthe of the ryuer Rhodanus, the infinite multitude of the Duchemen, durst not inuade him, till hee brought foorth his armie into the fieldes. But two other wayes there are, more certaine to bee saufe from the enemie. The one is to puruey thy campe distant at the leaste a dayes iourneye from hym, remoouinge alwayes in the open countrey, that thou bee not stayed by hilles or ryuers &amp;c to passe vnto the sea syde, or suche place where thou desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to rest thyne armie. The other helpe is, if thou bee wylling to assaye the force of the enemie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie great losse, and to abyde him in the fielde, then it is best for thee to keepe thy selfe neare vnto some strong towne of thine owne, or thy frendes, where thou mayst withdrawe thine armie from
<pb facs="tcp:19666:40"/>
pursute of the enemie, if he prooue the stronger in battaile. So did Eumenes saufelie retyre into the Cytie Nora, from the armie of Antigonus. It is good to prouyde for the woorst, as it is common lie saide, for the best will saue it selfe.</p>

               <p>IT is first to be considered, that armed men, vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualls, and moneye, be the accidentes insepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, or rather the substaunce and strengthe of warres. There must bee prouyded also for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, store of Iron, and staffe tymber, to make wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of all sortes, with sundrie artificers, for dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers purposes, powder must bee had with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, carriages, and cattaill good store to followe the campe, for necessaryes, with vtensyles and suche like. And if an armie be led into a foreyne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, there must be the greater store of this proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and forage also to bee had, and yet maye not the campe bee pestered with caryages, for then it can not so lightlie remoue, as occasions maye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Also when souldiours haue muche carriage beinge greatlie enritched with spoyles, their min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des are sometime more vppon their baggage, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon battaill. And if they sende often of the same into their countrey, their hartes be also at home. Great Alexander therefore seeinge his armie one time, so laden with booties and pryses, he burned
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19666:40"/>
all the surplusage of the carriages whiche myght encumber them, beinge of a great substance. But a more politike and profitable waye it weare, to pro uyde to haue some one stronge towne or twayne, where the warres are, to conuey the same into, which shalbee moreouer a maker of great benefite &amp; vse, daylie vnto the armie, and to the state of the warres dyuers wayes, as for reliefe of suche as bee hurte from time to time, also to receaue suche ayde of men, victualles, or other necessaries, as shal be sent from home, to keepe the same till it maye be saufelie conueyed into the armie, and not surpry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the enemie by the waye. Also it is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie place, to soiourne in wynter time, (for the wynter warres be more noysome &amp; tedious then profitable) or to withdrawe into, when the armie or store of thinges is spent, or worne with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res there, it is a good restinge place till supplie be had of their wantes. And if the same be neare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea syde, and towardes home, It is farre the more commodious. Nowe the waye to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne and wynne suche a towne or herbour the more easelie, is in the begynninge to make thyne aryuall so dayne, and in a place vnlooked for, that the enemye maye bee surprysed vnfurny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. And it is not best to spende muche of thy store of menne or pouysion, in the wynninge of manye Townes at the fyrste. For fyue bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayles haue beene fougheten wyth losse of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer menne, them some one Cytye is wonne
<pb facs="tcp:19666:41"/>
withall, and therefore, will not the wise Captayne so weaken him selfe, before the great necessitie &amp; mayne force of battayle. For it is to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red withall, that manie townes taken, requyre ma nie garrisons to bee assigned, for the defence and keepinge of the same, all whiche dismember an armie and put it downe, as muche as anie prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of the enemie against the same maye do. For the armie is the assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of warres, without which thou canst little annoye or terrifie the enemie, nor yet longe maintaine or defende thy walled tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes from hym, for if hee possesse the countrey with his men, hee shall cutt of tyllage, and stoppe all trades vnto the townes, by whiche they onely maye liue and be maintained. And therefore that Prince that possesseth stronge townes, and dareth not, or hath not power to keepe the fielde, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende his countrey by battaile, if he be cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie dealt with, will vndoubtedlie prooue a pesant. And therefore the knowledge to guyde an armie into the fielde, and to order &amp; make battaile with skill and aduauntage, is misteresse of all dominion and victorye, for thereunto all warres maye bee brought in the ende. And in passinge foorth with his armie, let the generall auoide streightes, obserue good orders, and choose his grounde and wayes commodious as he goeth. Nowe let vs see, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther policie counsayleth, as soone as thou arte en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the enemies countrey, and that he will offer battaile to receaue the same, and shortlie to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19666:41"/>
trye the matter? Herein I am not of opinion, that it is generally best to detracte battail, except there be some aduantage to be taken and vsed in ioygning of the same, for so the one may goe about the other longe enoughe to little purpose. But other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and accidentes are to be considered in this generaltie. For commonlye it is for the behoufe of him, whose Countrey is inuaded, to seke battaile for auoydinge spoyle of the same: But yet it is to be considered, that if the other bee like shortely to be wearied, or be neare some mischiefe by mutine, or for some wantes forced to forsake the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, &amp; that it shoulde be daungerous to deale wyth him for his force, then policye perswadeth to protracte battaile on that parte. And generallye the inuader, as longe as he proceadeth with spoyle, to plage the enemy, &amp; to enritche himselfe, hath not necessity to hasten battaile, but maye take the time best for his aduauntage. How be it, occasions may growe on, otherwise, and be vrgent vnto him to ioygne bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile spedelye, as by encrease of ayde comminge towardes the enemie, or casuall empayring of his owne present power. Moreouer, vnto him which hath manye hyered souldiers, it is more requisite to make hast vnto battaile, and to end the warres, as well for the great charge of that retinue, as for the daylie daunger of their vnsure seruice, and doubt of reuoltinge vnto the enemye, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney men, by corruption, or for a greater paye, they lightlie leaue their mayster in his greatest neade.

For seldome haue theare bene greate conquestes made by force of hyred menne. The Romaynes, and the Grekes, warred withe their owne Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours against all nations. Great Pompeye, withe the natiue people of Italie, ouercame Mithridates with hys huge Armye, of more then twentye Nations. Of later tymes, the estates of Italye haue bene vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and ouerrunne, by vsinge the helpe of hyred Souldiours. And the Venetia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, (hauing otherwise moste excellent gouernement, and plentyfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisyon of all thinges, both for peace &amp; warre) but for thys cause onelye, had growen to haue greate Empyre. This Realme of Britayne, hath sum<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of these hurtes, beinge sumtime oppressed by the hyred Saxons, vnder Hengistus. But nowe to trie the truste, and faithe of hired Souldiours before their infidelitie, or defection maye great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hurte: It is good before thy greate neade, and daye of battaile, to sende them foorthe wythe a feawe of thyne owne approued men, to sum<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploite, supposed to bee of greate importaunce, and to plante priuelie by the waye, or to sende af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them a sufficient number of trustye Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, to doe the same feate, if the other shoulde bee false, or faile in the same. Also it is policye for the same purpose, to conferre with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes of them that are suspected of suche matters as thou entendest not to doe but in shewe, to see if they wyll keape the same secrete, or geue pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye aduertysement theareof vnto the Enemye.

Scipio began hys warres in Spayne, withe the syege of newe Carthage, the principall citie there both of trade &amp; power: And in like sorte inuadyng Afrique, he foorthwith layde syege vnto Vtica, a famous citie, sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding on the sea side, wheare he also harboured and kept his shippes, so that he might cut of all ayde &amp; succoure, both by lande &amp; sea fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the towne. Now for the maner of subduing holdes, it is to be agreed, that the best waye of wyn ning, is that, whych is with moste speade, &amp; leaste

losse. And thearefore, if a Towne maye not be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised and taken by sum<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> trayne or policie, it is lesse daunger to inuade and force the enemye, by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, then with the swearde. How Zopyrus suttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie caughte the Babiloniens (fayninge him selfe fledde from his Prince, for crueltie shewed vnto him, and being of them vnder fayned friendshipe receaued, betrayed their Citie,) the maner theare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is declared at large, in the first booke. This shift also hath bene vsed, when a Captayne had vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standynge of ayde looked for by the besyeged, he hath apparelled a troupe of his owne souldy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, vnder the ensigne of those whiche shoulde come vnto them, and so to haue taken the Towne. Cimon of Athens, besieginge a Towne, by nighte sett fire on a temple in the suburbes of the same whearefore sum<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Townes men rashelie run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge out to succour it, the enemie entered in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And such persons haue geuen intelligence by letters fastened to arrowes, and shote foorthe vnto the enemies, of the state and dealinges within the Towne, as of the weakest parte theareof or least defended, of the custome of the watche, when and howe they

maye be deceaued, that the enemie maye enter vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them vnware. The Frenchmen corrupted Tarpeia a mayden, to lett them in, by a little posterne doore into the Capitall of Roome. But in this case, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent examination must be made by captaines, for double dealinge, that they be not abused in their practises, the same beinge disclosed vnto the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: which hath sometime suffered parte of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries power, to e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter within his houlde to their destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hauinge prepared, sodainlie to repulse and shutt out the rest. For the takinge of a stronge towne by famine, it is a good waye to winne sum<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weaker-nighe, &amp; to tourne out the inhabitauntes thereof, that they may be receaued into the other, &amp; so their victualls, the soner consumed.

And therefore the siege ought not to be slacked by suche pretence, but good watche to be alwaies abrode. For it hath chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced that an army lying at the siege of a towne, hath ben on the sodaine inuaded of enemies at the backe, &amp; withall they of the towne haue issued foorth vpon them, to their ouerthrowe. It must be alwaies holden of the good captaine as a principall grounde, that hee haue diligent espyall of the enemies doynges, &amp;

keepe his owne secrete. And therefore hee consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and conferreth with manie, what is best to be done: but that which he determineth to doe, hee reuealeth to fewe or none. Hee must also haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, that his custome or certaine order vsed in some doinges, disclose not anie of his purposes vn to the enemie, and therefore the same must bee often varied and chaunged. It is good also to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campe in suche place as the enemie see not what is done within the campe.

By these perswasions, (wheare as Darius thought by his great pompe, &amp; trayne of men to haue daunted &amp; dismayed the enemie:) Alexander turned the same to be a great encouragement vnto his armye. Furthermore, if the souldiour be afrayde, by store of terrible ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, straunge engins, or daungerous deuyses of the enemie, the same must be by like inuention, &amp; industrie preuented or encountred, as by setling sum<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ambush priuelie to surprise the same, or by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge on sum<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bande of horsemen, to interrupte the plantinge theareof, or to make sum<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like exployte as noysome vnto the enemie, that the battaile may come on before the same can take effecte to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye great hurt. Thus, must the politique captaine make readie, an Oliuer for a roula<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, to remoue all stumblinge blockes and impedimentes, from the good courage of the Souldiour, so that without stickinge, most valiauntlie he maye marche to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile the enemie. Iulius Caesar excelled other, for trayninge, and makinge valiaunt &amp; noble minded

And with all he shewed such courtesie and good affection towardes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that neuer any man had souldiours of greater endeuour and valure, or more faithfull towardes their Captayne.

Yet made they day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye skirmishes withe the contrarie parte, and eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soones preuayled thearein.

is to bee consydered, what maye bee a good grounde and cause to vse weapons, and begynne warres, by the lawe of nature, Iustice, and pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallie by the lawe of God: whiche ought to bee the foundation and rule of all our doynges, of whom wee ought to take all our begynninges, by whom affayres prosperouslye proceade, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelye ende, without whom nothinge encreasethe or groweth to anie good effecte. That warres may bee iustlye made, and howe diuers good menne haue attempted and vsed the same, we reade in the holye booke: Almightie God hath stirred vp dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers as well Prynces, as priuate menne, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men persons to take armes, and vse force agaynst the wicked. The children of Israell vnder Iosua, by <note place="margin">Iosua.</note> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement &amp; leadinge of God, conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Cananites, expelled the miscreaunt and idolotrous nations, and possessed their landes. Saul, &amp; Sampson were raysed by him, to plague the Philistynes with battaile. The Assyriens, were <note place="margin">King Saul.

Iudas Machabeus also, and <note place="margin">Iudas Mach.</note> Gedeon, were leaders of the Israelytes against the enemies of God by his ordinaunces, by which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, <note place="margin">Gedeon.</note> Iehu, was mooued to make warres for the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction <note place="margin">Iehu.</note> of the house of Ahab. And who se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Titus from Rome, to enuiron Hierusalem, with the most

dreadfull and fatall siege, the ende &amp; ruyne where <note place="margin">Titus sonne of thempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tien.</note> of, was foretoulde by the mouth of the Almightie. But for our purpose, to shewe howe there maye be iust cause to leuie and prosecute warres, &amp; to dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne of right herein, we are to serch for the roote &amp; originall thereof. The worlde, God created &amp; gaue vnto the sonnes of men, &amp; this conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the geeuer most iustlie annexed, this he enioyned with all, that no man shoulde couet, that whiche to an other belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth, and that to euery man belongeth, which he without wrong enioyeth. For in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginninge, when there was no auncient tytles to be made to landes, or lordship: possession caused good right, this is the lawe of nature and equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; it is also in the ciuill lawe allowed, that those thinges wherein no man hath propertie or interest, are his, which first possesseth them, which he maye lawfullie houlde, &amp; therefore ought not by force to be dispossessed of the same. Muche lesse, where possession is planted, and setled vppon auncyent ryght, or grounded on other good tytle. A later lawe there is, of the most highe God generallie ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which endureth the iustice of the first lawe, that euerie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shoulde doe so, as hee woulde bee done vnto. And this is the iust measure, the direct rule, &amp; certaine bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des betwene righte &amp; wrong, which beeinge considered, we shall knowe how to vse warres, and to dyrecte all our doynges well. Now lett vs runne as farre as wee maye, into the course of antiquitie, to serche the first beginninges
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19666:50"/>
and causes of warres, that wee may conferre them with the euentes and successe theareof, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge and iudgement herein. We finde, that Cain the eldest sonne of Adam, in the firste <note place="margin">Cain.</note> time of the worlde liued so long, that diuers la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des in the East partes beyng peopled, he buylded a city for feare of his enemies, knowinge iuste cause gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by him to be odious vnto men, for the vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall parricy de and murder of his brother. For at that time, Iaball the sonne of Lamech, was growen <note place="margin">Iaball.</note> mightie, and excercised armes against such as vsed vniust violence or oppression. Tubalcain was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <note place="margin">Thubalcain.</note> the first that wrought on Iron, &amp; forged weapons for that purpose. For as yet, theare was no kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome established, nor countrey by conquest sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, the pompe of Princes was not knowen, men desired not then, soueraintie ouer estates, but prepared by armes to shilde their owne, in saufe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when they had no lawe to defende them. This beginninge of warres was made, in the first age, and no more we reade of, till after the floode: when the three sonnes of Noah, with their manifolde issue multiplyed, possessed the sundrye regions of <note place="margin">Semin Asia. Cam in Afrique. Iaphet in Europe. Thuball.</note> the worlde. Sem setled in Asia, Cam came into Afrique, and Iaphet inhabited Europe, whose of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring shortlie spred abrode into the sudry partes, regio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; prouinces of the same. Then waxed Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of Iaphet, mightie in power, and bare rule aboue the rest. This man renued againe the vse of weapons. Soone after, Nimrod began &amp; aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <note place="margin">Nimrod.</note> the firste kingdome ouer Chaldea, wheare he
<pb facs="tcp:19666:51"/>
buylt the citie Babell, subduinge people &amp; Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treies, by oppression and oultrage of warres, vnder his dominion. And thearefore the same violent Empire, lasted not longe, but it shortlye sonke, &amp; was drowned in the great estate, which Assur ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in assirya, the lande yet now bearinge his name. <note place="margin">Assur.</note> He buylt the Citye Niniue, Rezen, &amp; others, by iust conquestes, amplifiynge his seigniorie. After him succeaded Ninus, in the time of the patriarke Abraham, whiche enuironned Babilon withe a stronge wall, and muche beawtified the Citie, as the chiefe seate of his estate. Hee subdued the Bactriens, and other nations, makinge vnto him selfe a mightie Monarchye aboue other Kinges, by honourable, &amp; not iniurious warres, as it may appeare by the continuaunce of thys Empyre, whiche remained amonge the Assiryens, aboue 1300. yeares, vntill the raigne of Sardanapalus, <note place="margin">Sardanapalꝰ.</note> whose estate thoroughe his beastlike lasciuyous life, was taken from him by Arbactus, a Prince of the Medes. Abraham him selfe made warres with <note place="margin">Arbactꝰ. Abraham.</note> the kinge of Sodome, and fower other Princes, vsinge at that time good order and policye in his battaile. And thearefore they that affirme Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Mars, or Hercules, to bee the beginners, <note place="margin">Ninus. Mars. Hercules.</note> and firste vsers of warres, and order of battaile, are not learned in reading, for that theare is large proofe of those before alleaged. And as for Mars, he was the sonne of Saturne, whiche was kinge of Crete, at that time when Ianus raygned in Italye, and that was about the time of Mofes. And Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:19666:51"/>
of Thebes, lyued after that, in the time of Saull king of Iudea, or a little before by sum<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which was soone after the buylding of Troye. Mars made warre of ambition, and lordlye minde to rule: But Hercules, the patron of Iustice, and champion of noble prowesse, thrust him selfe into all daungers of battaile, to redresse iniuries, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse rapyne, &amp; oppression, to roote out tirantes, to maintayne &amp; defende right, to spred the valyle of prosperous peace, and wished saufe securitye ouer the worlde, to shewe example of most hyghe vertue and valure, punishinge robbers, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge countryes of mischeuous malefactours, and v le persons. For whiche his ryghteous affection, and iust minde, as of deuyne vertue proceadinge, he was after hys deathe honoured and holden as a God. Romulus, to erecte a famous Citie, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablishe <note place="margin">Romulus.</note> an happye estate withe excellent lawes, orders, and gouernement, called people toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and made warres for the compassinge, and encreasinge thereof. So dyd the auncient kinge Belus of Assiria, and Phoroneus in Grecia, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due <note place="margin">Belus. Phoroneus.</note> people to good order and conuenient course of lyfe, geuinge vnto them lawes for their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique benefite and behoufe. In like sorte Ianus <note place="margin">Ianus. Licurgus.</note> before recyted, and Licurgus in Lacedaemon, reduced menne from idlenes, and leude lasye lyfe, vnto good trades, ciuilitye and practyse of vertue, for none other cause desirynge soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntye, but for the good state and profytte of the people. To thys ende Minerua, Cecrops, <note place="margin">Minerua. Cecrops. Cadmus.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19666:52"/>
&amp; Cadmus vsed armes in their times before, (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue in diforder without gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfortably to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouslye one for an other,) they exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded their power &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to refourme them into an happie &amp; ciuill sorte of life. And diuers nations haue wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie submitted &amp; put them selues vnder the rule &amp; scepter of such, as they perceaued to be wise, wel disposed, &amp; carefull of the weale of a multitude, to be a patron, &amp; a refuge, by their wisedome &amp; expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in their troubles &amp; neades. Thus <note place="margin">Plato. Magistratus excellens.

The au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient warres of Troye &amp; Thebes, arose vpon great wronges offered, the first of them, in the time that K. Dauid raygned, the other, not longe after. The Grekes maintained continuall warres, for their libertie, to preserue their publique states vnder elected gouernours, &amp; especially to auoyde
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19666:52"/>
subiection to anie foreine nation, which they es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teamed barbarous and rascall, in respect of them selues. The Scythiens, hauinge no riche or dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate possessions of pleasant or frutefull fieldes, no substaunce or store of goodes to loose, yet they fought fiercelie to defende the tombes of their au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestours (whereof they had their greatest care) fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iniuries of the enemie, &amp; defacing. And generallie, nature hath geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liuinge thinges, a desire of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; resistinge of wronges, wherefore that force is better to be allowed of, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inuasion. Iudas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabeus saide to the Israelites, let vs fight for our liues &amp; our lawes. And thus to cut of our course in to the antiquitie of warres, seing that it is not my purpose nowe to wryte thereof, (yet supposinge thus muche not to be impertinent vnto hym, that woulde bee a trauayler in the knoweledge and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of warres) we conclude by plentiful proofe out of the store of histories, accordinge to our propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. That warres iustlie made, for the more parte, growe to good effecte, and the violent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre lasteth not longe. Battail atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted for pompe, or ambitious desire of dominion, not regardinge right or wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, seldome hath good successe: or els the frutes had thereby, soone fade, suche victories take no roote. But yet it remayneth, to aunswere one obiection, that seemeth to ouerthrowe and quyte condempne all our warres, whiche is, that our Lorde Iesus hath sayde, that he which striketh with the swerde, shall perishe with the same, which is to be vnderstoode, eyther of wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gfull striking', <note place="margin">Math. 26.</note>

or else betwene pryuate persons, which haue the sworde of the prince &amp; defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the lawe, to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die their wronges. Also, where it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, that he which is stryke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on the one eare, should turne the other, toreceaue the like, (it is expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded) whereas the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of such singuler pacience, maye greatlie auaile to make such insole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t oultrage, the more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; detestable, &amp; that there is a law to punish the same, otherwise warres, &amp; armes maye be vsed for maintenance &amp; defence of vertue &amp; ryght, &amp; great good grow therof. For in the x, of the Actes of the <note place="margin">Act.

The time of warres is troublesome to take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile in, and more vnfitte for exactions, but most of all it is vnmete then to take order and to haue thinges to seke, when they shoulde bee occupied. Also this preparation &amp; furniture for the warres, woulde bee had of euerie priuate manne, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to his abilitie, as well as in comen stores of corporations and companies. And suche person as is of wealthe, and lesse able by his persone or good counsaile for the seruice and defence of his Countrey, oughte to extende his good will and forwardnes the further, for good purueyance to arme and furnishe others theareunto. For he, that is so sotted in simplicitye, and drowned in base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of minde, that hopinge still vpon peace, will neuer aduaunce his consideration or care, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, in time of warres, but employe all his ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vnto his owne priuate gaine or pleasure, and not laye out anye money for the behoufe of the comen state, is like by his policye to saue a fether, &amp; lose the birde, while hee snatched at a shadowe,

he loseth the substaunce. And the example of such grosse carelesse securitie, is verye pernicious vnto a comon weale, for diuers of them, which haue the wealthe of the Realme beinge slacke &amp; negligent in this point, it is not a feawe of the other, though they weare neuer so careful, or wel disposed &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to serue, that can sustaine the brunte of warres, &amp; the poore man can little auayle hearein, being thoroughe wante of abilitie, naked both of armour &amp; experience, hauing no spare time for the excercise of armes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all his endeuour emploied to purueye for his necessarie lyuinge, can skantlie suffice theareunto: but his trust is, that thoroughe the circumspecte prouidence of them which haue whearewithall to doe good hearein, hee shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye his pouertye, saufe from captiuitye. So, if the other bee vnfurnished at the time of neade, what doth he, but bringe ruyne vpon him selfe, and hys deare Countrey. Is it not the wished wellfare, and a right happye state, wheare euerye man may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye his owne quyetlie, vnder their naturall and gratious Prince, moste carefull and tender ouer the Countreye and people, vsynge suche lawes, as the wyse menne of the Realme, can best de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyse and finde oute to bee moste profitable for all sortes of menne: And an horrible miserye more odyous then anye deathe, to haue oure Lawes, lyues, goodes, and what soeuer is deare vnto vs, at the lyst, and vnder the contempte and rule of the insolent and cruell enemye, to bee spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by force, pylled by exactyons, and trybutes,
