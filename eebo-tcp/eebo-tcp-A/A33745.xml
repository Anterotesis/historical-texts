            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In order to which, and that every man may at once ſee the Whole before him, and thereby
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101351:3"/>
come to the truer Concluſion, I ſhall take my Riſe from the Occaſion of this Paper, and thence proceed to the Matter of it. Now the Occaſion was thus.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty finding it had been the frequent endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors of the four laſt Reigns to reduce this Kingdom to an exact Conformity in Religion, and how little the Succeſs had anſwer'd the Deſign, but rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd Trade, depopulated the Country, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd Strangers; and being reſolv'd to eſtabliſh His Government on ſuch a Foundation as might make His Subjects happy, and unite them to Him by Inclination as well as Duty, on the 4th of <hi>April,</hi> 1687. iſſued His moſt Gracious Declaration for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conſcience, thereby declaring, That He will Protect and Maintain His Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Clergy, and all other His Subjects of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the free Exerciſe of their Religion, and full Enjoyment of their Poſſeſſions and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as now Eſtabliſhed by Law, without any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—That all Execution of Penal Laws for matters Eccleſiaſtical, as Nonconformity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be, and are thereby ſuſpended.—That all His Subjects have leave to Meet and Worſhip God in their own way, without diſturbance.—And foraſmuch as the benefit of the Service of His Subjects is by the Law of Nature inſeparably annex'd to, and inherent in His Royal Perſon, and that no one for the future may be under any Diſcouragement or Diſability, by reaſon of ſome Oaths or Teſts uſually adminiſtred; That no ſuch Oaths or Teſts ſhall be hereafter requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them; And that He would diſpenſe with them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe ſeveral Endeavors had been made, to

abuſe the eaſineſs of the People, as if He might be perſuaded out of what He had ſo ſolemnly declared, His Majeſty, as well to ſtop the mouth of Gainſayers, as to ſhew his Intentions were not changed ſince the ſaid 4th of <hi>April,</hi> by a ſecond Declaration of the 27th of <hi>April</hi> laſt paſt, enforces and confirms the ſaid former Declaration, conjures His loving Subjects to lay aſide all private Animoſities and groundleſs Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, and to chooſe ſuch Members of Parliament as may do their part to finiſh what he has begun, for the Advantage of the Monarchy over which God hath plac'd Him, as being reſolv'd to call a Parliament that ſhall meet in <hi>November</hi> next at furtheſt.</p>
            <p>This Declaration was forthwith printed, and by Order of Council required to be diſtributed, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and read in the reſpective Churches thro' the Kingdom: And in that it was not enjoyn'd to be read in any the Congregations thereby permitted, what greater Evidence can there be of His Majeſty's real Intentions to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever He ſuffer'd others, He own'd not yet any Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd National Church but the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Upon this the enſuing Paper was on the 18th of <hi>May</hi> following (between the hours of Nine and Ten at night) preſented to His Majeſty by the Six Biſhops the Subſcribers.</p>

Our Saviour calls his Diſciples, <hi>The Salt, and Light of the World.</hi> And why? But that they ſhould ſeaſon others with their Doctrin, and guide them by their Example, into the way of Peace. His Name is, <hi>The Prince of Peace:</hi> His Sermon on the Mount was, <hi>The Goſpel of Peace:</hi> The Bleſſings in it, are to <hi>The Poor in Spirit, The Meek, The Merciful, The Peace-makers,</hi> &amp;c.

What the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101351:5"/>
Apoſtles in their time were, the ſame ever, and now challenge the Governors of all Churches; next, and under Kings, they are in the ſtead of God to the People; and where they make a falſe Step, what wonder if the unthinking People forget the Precept, and take after the Example? They ſee nothing but <hi>(ſub imagine luſca)</hi> by twilight, and conceive accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the colour of thoſe Rods are caſt before them; They hear a noiſe, but know not whence it cometh, or whether it goeth, and run away the Cry, without ſo much as laying a Noſe to the Ground for't. What made the People ſet up <hi>Adoniah</hi> againſt <hi>David</hi>'s diſpoſition of the Crown to <hi>Solomon? Abiathar</hi> the High Prieſt was in the Head of them. What made the Nobles break the Yoak? The Prophets had Propheſi'd falſly, the Prieſts applauded it with their Hands, and a fooliſh People lov'd to have it ſo. Or what made the <hi>Jews</hi> who had ſo often acknowledg'd our Savior, turn head againſt him, and crucifie him? The Chief Prieſts, the Scribes and Elders had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd the People, that the <hi>Romans</hi> would come, and take away their City. Thus we ſee what Influence Great Men have upon the heedleſs Multitude; and therefore how wary ought they to be, how they give them the leaſt Example of Diſobedience; for it is ſeldom ſeen, but where the one Diſputes, the other Cavils; and where their Leaders make but a Shrug at the Government, the People think it high time to be Mending it: Our own Hiſtories are as one Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of it; or if they run narrow, <hi>Tacitus</hi> may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd of his, <hi>Erant in Officio, qui mallent mandata.

            <p>And for the Time of their Preſenting it, I ſhall conſider it as it may reſpect the preſent Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Kingdom, or that half ſcantling of time they gave his Majeſty to conſider of their Excuſes.</p>
            <p>As to the former, the glut of Reformers in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's time was great, and the Qualifications ſo indifferent, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> has ever ſince labor'd under it, and the ſame Elements that compounded her, half deſtroy'd her: For as the Laws, not the Doctrin, brought them firſt together, they no ſooner found themſelves ſtreightned in the <hi>One,</hi> than they made it up with the <hi>Other,</hi> and Themſelves ſomewhat in the Broils, that were otherwiſe nothing in the Peace of the State. Theſe Humors, during Her, and King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, lay fermenting in the Body, but in his Son's broke out into a Peſtilence. The Crown ſell, the Church follow'd it, and the moſt diligent Enquirer might have ſought <hi>England</hi> in her ſelf, yet miſs'd her; till at laſt it pleas'd Him, whoſe only it is to ſtill the raging of the Sea, to ſay to the Madneſs of the People, <hi>Huc uſque, nee ultra.</hi> His late Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd; and ſo little averſe were the Catholic Lords to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that their Votes, which otherwiſe might have kept them out, brought them
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101351:6"/>
once more into the Houſe of Peers: nor were they ſcarce warm in their Seats, before the Act of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity was paſs'd, and driven with that Violence, that it had like to have overturn'd all agen. The Diſſenters were not fit for Employ, they had Mony in their Purſes, and the World was wide enough: The Catholic Lords were leſs to be truſted, they cumber'd the Ground, and 'twas but fit they were down: There remain'd nothing but to caſt out the Heir, and then the Inheritance would be the eaſier divided. And here alſo it pleas'd God to appear in the Mount: He pluck'd him out of the deep Waters, and ſet him on the Throne of his Anceſtors: And as he came to the Crown thro' the greateſt of Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he has been preſerv'd in it by no leſs a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. He ſtifl'd two Serpents in the Cradle of his Empire, and in a three-years Government conquer'd all Example, in His own. And now, when our troubl'd Waters had begun to ſettle again, what need of whiſtling up the Winds for another Storm? When the Wounds of the Kingdom were almoſt clos'd, what Charity was it to unbind them too ſoon, or under pretence of eaſing the Patient, to ſet them bleeding afreſh? In a word, when the Brands of our late Rebellions lay ſmother'd in their almoſt forgotten Embers, what prudence was it to rake them into another Flame? I ſee little of the Dove in it, and am loth to ſay, too much of the Serpent.</p>
            <p>And for that half ſcantling of time they gave his Majeſty to conſider of their Excuſes, it ſeems here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the Spirit of Direction (like <hi>Baal</hi> in the <hi>Kings)</hi> was ſome way or other out of the way. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration was no new thing, it had been publiſhed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101351:7"/>
the 4th of <hi>April</hi> 1687, and his Majeſty had receiv'd the general Acknowledgments of the Kingdom for it; which argu'd their Satisfaction in it. The Corn was in the Ground, and now, if ever, was the time to ſow Tares; and therefore, to prevent their choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, His Majeſty the 27th of <hi>April</hi> 1688, (which was one full year, and three weeks after) enforces his firſt Declaration, and commands it to be read in all Churches within Ten miles of <hi>London,</hi> on the 20th and 27th of <hi>May,</hi> and in all other the Churches thro' the Country, on the 3d and 10th of <hi>June</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; time enough (one would think) to have conſider'd the Matter, ſo as to have given the King ſome time to have advis'd. Whereas on the contrary, they make no ſcruple of it, till the 18th of <hi>May,</hi> about 10 at Night, and then (the 19th being a Day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Hunting) they preſent the Paper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd, as well knowing, that if his Majeſty had an Inclination of Countermanding his Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was ſo ſtraitned in time, that he could not do it, for it was to be read the Day after. And what can be rationally interpreted from it, but that they had been all that while numbring the People, to ſee whither the Party were ſtrong enough? And I am the rather inclin'd to it, for that ſince the time of the firſt Declaration, the Doctrin of <hi>Non-Reſiſtance</hi> has not been ſo much in Vogue, as it was formerly; it would keep cold for another time, and to have preſſed it now, who knows but the People might have believ'd it? In ſhort, <hi>Nathan, Zadoc,</hi> &amp;c. had ſome pretence for oppoſing <hi>Adoniah; Me thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and</hi> Zadoc <hi>the Prieſt, he hath not called.</hi> So <hi>Core, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> were Eccleſiaſtical Princes, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101351:7"/>
thought they might have as much right to Govern as <hi>Moſes:</hi> But when the Church of <hi>England</hi> (found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Law of <hi>England)</hi> acknowledges the King Supreme in all Cauſes; Themſelves, <note place="margin">Glan. l. 7. c. 1. Tract. l. 5. 427.</note>
               <hi>infra aetatem, &amp; in cuſtodia Domini Regis;</hi> when the King by his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration has ſecur'd them in their Religion, Poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Properties, and by vertue of his Royal Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative (and for the Quiet of the Nation) only indulg'd it to others, (yet making no doubt of the Parliaments concurrence in it) is it juſt that <hi>Their</hi> Eye be evil, becauſe the <hi>King</hi>'s is good? or muſt the Kingdom of Heaven be confin'd to a Party? I never heard that Diſobedience was any Qualification for it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if they will not enter themſelves, why do they ſhut it againſt others, that would enter?</p>
            <p>But perhaps the Petition (if yet there can be any reaſon for the breach of a Duty) may give us the reaſon of it. The Title ſays, <hi>In behalf of themſelves, and others of their abſent Brethren, and of the Clergy of their reſpective Dioceſes.</hi> Which makes good what I before hinted, that inſtead of Diſtributing and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing His Majeſty's Declaration to be read in their reſpective Dioceſes, as in bounden Duty to their Supreme Ordinary the King, they ought to have done; and the Clergy, in reſpect of their Canonical Obedience to them, muſt have obey'd under the pain of Suſpenſion, and in caſe of Contumacy of Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they had been feeling the Pulſe of their Clergy, and finding little return from them, but <hi>ſpeak, Lord, for thy Servant heareth,</hi> they concluded the Flock would follow the Shepherd; and conſequently, if the Party were not ſtrong enough, the Multitude of the Offenders might make it diſpuniſhable; whereas
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101351:8"/>
it has been ſeen, that a Ferry-boat's taking in too many Paſſengers, to increaſe the Fare, has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the occaſion of ſinking all together. And if the Loyalty of the Church of <hi>England</hi> receive any ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh by it, what can ſhe ſay, but that ſhe was <hi>wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Houſe of her Friends?</hi> For by the ſame Reaſon that a Metropolitan refuſes the Injunctions of his Supreme Ordinary the King, by the ſame Reaſon may a Dioceſan refuſe his Metropolitan, and every inferior Clergy man his Dioceſan; and when the Chain is once broken, you may diſpoſe the Links as you pleaſe.</p>
            <p>But the Petition ſays, <hi>It was neither from any want of Duty and Obedience to His Majeſty.</hi> No? Then why was it not comply'd with? <hi>Shew me thy Faith by thy Works,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James;</hi> nor will it be poſſible to clear that Son of Diſobedience, that ſaid <hi>I go,</hi> but went not. A Biſhop (as before) is not bound to obey any Mandate but the King's; which Exception proves the Rule, and that he is inexcuſably oblig'd to obey the King's: For all Biſhops are ſubject to the Imperial Power, who is to be obey'd againſt the will of the Biſhop. <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Emperor (ſays Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <note place="margin">Ductor dub. fol. 606.</note> 
               <hi>Taylor)</hi> commanded St. <hi>Gregory</hi> to hand an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Edict to the Churches; the Biſhop advis'd the Prince, that what he went about was a ſin, did what he could to have hinder'd it, and yet obey'd. It was the Caſe of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Samuel:</hi> The King deſires <hi>Samuel</hi> to joyn with him in the Service of the Lord; He, with the liberty of a Prophet, refus'd at firſt, but afterwards joyn'd with him: Whereupon the ſaid Biſhop in the ſame place further ſays, <hi>That even the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Edicts of a Lawful Prince may be publiſhed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101351:8"/>
by the Clergy:</hi> How much more then thoſe that are Lawful? And that this Declaration is ſuch, I ſhall ſhew preſently, when I come to ſpeak to their word <hi>Illegal.</hi> In ſhort, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is <note place="margin">Heylin's <hi>Life of A.

In a word the late War was <hi>Bellum Epiſcopale;</hi> and if King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt would have confirm'd the Sale of Church Lands, he had ſav'd Himſelf: And why then do they reproach the King His Son with their Loyalty, when they inſtance the contrary in ſo ſmall a trial of that Obedience; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when, were the matter doubtful, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption were for Obedience, and even unjuſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands may be juſtly obey'd?

In a word, to pretend Loyalty for a common Principle, and yet make Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting and Diſobedience the Practice of it; what is it, but a drawing near with the Mouth, when the Heart is fartheſt from it?

He has in the Word of a King ſecur'd to them their Religion, Poſſeſſions and Properties; And why? but to aſſure them, He repented not the Character. And it was their Intereſt, if not Duty, to keep it up; nay, the Honor of their Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on it, inaſmuch as Men value things, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the preſent Good or Evil they do in the World; and what Advantage can that Religion give us to another Life, when it ſhall be found miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, or deſtructive to this? They have (I ſaid) the Word of a King for their Security; but if they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101351:9"/>
force him in his own defence, to ſecure againſt it, whom can they blame but themſelves, who firſt made the Challenge? <hi>Abiathar</hi>'s Service to <hi>David,</hi> was acknowledg'd by <hi>Solomon,</hi> but when he once began to boggle, he forgave, but remov'd him. And our Biſhop <hi>Bonner,</hi> tho' he got his Biſhoprick by thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pope, yet he loſt it agen by oppoſing the King. In a word, The Holy Spirit in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> acknowledges the good works of the Seven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> but bids ſome of them remember, whence they had fall'n, and repent, and do the firſt works, or he would remove their Candleſtick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor yet from any want of due tenderneſs to Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> No? Why then have thoſe Penal Laws been executed with ſo much rigor againſt them? Or why are they ſo averſe from having them eas'd at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent? What brought them into this Kingdom, I have touch'd before, and what turn'd them out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and our Trade with them, is demonſtrable enough in the late Proteſtants of <hi>France.</hi> I will not ſay but they might have been kept out at firſt; but being ſettl'd, and embodied into a People, it may ſeem ill Policy to remove any Greater Number to gratifie a Leſſer. It is not the Nobility, or the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that are the Traders; nor is it the Gown that enriches more than particular perſons: but the Trade of the Merchant, and the Induſtry of the Middle ſort, that enriches a Nation, and without which <hi>Vena porta,</hi> let a Kingdom have never ſo good Limbs, it will have but empty Veins. It was Trade gave <hi>England</hi> its firſt Credit abroad, and the Manufacture at home found mater to it; the One drein'd other Kingdoms to water our own, and the Other brought
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101351:10"/>
a Ballance to it, in making the Export come up to the Import, and both together ſecur'd the Dominion of the Sea, and made the Wealth of either <hi>Indie</hi> a kind of Acceſſary to it; and all this carry'd on by the Middle-ſort of People. Take our Sea-Ports, and the Sea-Man is but here and there a true Church-of-<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land man:</hi> The Merchant that employs him not much better at Heart: The Artiſan thro' the Kingdom has more than a Spice of the Diſeaſe; and the Body of the People not leaſt infected with it. However, let them be quiet within themſelves, and they diſpute no Authority; but when they are uneaſie, and mew'd up at home, what wonder if they change it for a freer Air? What makes us complain of the want of Trade? That our Neighbors have gotten into our Manufacture? That our Ships are not ſo well Mann'd as formerly? And the Rents of Lands fallen? The Reaſon is obvious: Our ſelves have cut off our own Hands. The Merchant ſits down with what he has, or turns Builder; The Work-man carries his Art with him; The Sea-man will have his Opinion, as well as his Pay; And the Lump of the People their Conſciences, or Good-night Landlord! Whereas, ſince his Majeſties late Indulgence, Trade is viſibly encreaſed, Building ſtops of it ſelf, the Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to People agen, and the numerous Addreſſes on this occaſion, ſpeak ſo general a Satisfaction, that if ſuch be the Dawn, what may there not be expected from its full Day? And is there no Equity, that the Catholic alſo come in for a ſhare, tho' the word Diſſenter ſeems not (in proper Speech) to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him; for neither the Law of <hi>England,</hi> or themſelves, ever knew him by that Name? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101351:10"/>
that ſome tenderneſs might be due to them, may be gather'd from the Engliſh Litany. The Church of <hi>England</hi> knows, the King profeſſes the Faith of <hi>Rome;</hi> And therefore when they beſeech God, <hi>That it may pleaſe thee to keep and ſtrengthen in the true worſhiping of thee, in righteouſneſs and holineſs of Life, they Servant</hi> James <hi>our moſt gracious King and Governor,</hi> what do they mean by it? if after the way which ſome of them call Idolatry, ſo worſhips he the God of his Fathers, and they beſeech God to keep and ſtrengthen him in the true worſhiping of him, they imply that Worſhip to be a true Worſhip; and if they do not believe it, and yet uſe the words, how will they avoid a Sin? for whatever is not of Faith, is Sin. In a word, The King has made a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Indulgence to all his Subjects, The Catholics fall under no particular Exception, in it; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Law of Reaſon, as well as the Law of the Land, gives them the benefit of it.</p>

               <hi>In relation to whom, they are willing to come to ſuch a Temper, as ſhall be thought fit, when that Matter ſhall be Conſider'd and Setled in Parliament and Convocation.</hi> What the Temper hitherto has been, is but too ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible already, and what it is like to be for the future, may be gueſs'd by what's paſt. The King (who by the Law of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>Supremus in Eccleſiaſticis)</hi> has Thought fit, Conſider'd, and Setled the Matter; and were a Parliament now Sitting, the King is ſole <note place="margin">22 E. 3. 3.</note> Judge, all the reſt but Adviſers. The Royal Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative is a part of that Law of the Land, and by that <note place="margin">Stan. Pl.

Perſon in the Kingdom, but would have found the Temporal Cenſures too heavy for him, when it had been too late to have ask'd a Parliamentary Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whether Legal or not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in particular in the years 1662 and 1672, and in the beginning of Your Majeſty's Reign.</hi> As to the firſt of which, matter of Fact ſtands thus: King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, by his Declaration from <hi>Breda,</hi> had declar'd Liberty for tender Conſciences, and that no man ſhould be diſquieted for difference in Opinion in matters of Religion, which did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Peace of the Kingdom. And in his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the 26th of <hi>December</hi> following ſtood firm to it, but that no ſuch Bill had been yet offer'd him. While it thus lay, an Act of Indempnity, and one other of Uniformity, were paſs'd: The firſt regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Themſelves; and the ſecond, with the old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient, <hi>The Growth of Popery,</hi> was a probable way to exclude Others. The 25th and 26th of <hi>February</hi> the Commons come to ſome Reſolves againſt That, and Diſſenters; which, with the Reaſons of them (wherein yet they declare not the Declaration Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal) they preſent His Majeſty on the 28th in the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetting Houſe.</hi> The King complies; and it was too ſoon after a Rebellion to have done otherwiſe: However, if they had declar'd it Illegal, it was but the ſingle Opinion of the Commons, wherein the Lords made no concurrence: And therefore to ſay, This Diſpenſing Power was in the Parliament of 1662 declar'd Illegal, when (in common and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Conſtruction) a Declaration in Parliament is intended of both Houſes of Parliament; why may it not be as well urg'd, That thoſe other Votes and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101351:13"/>
Reſolves of the Commons, touching the Bill of Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, were a Legal Declaration in Parliament, when yet the Lords ſwept their Houſe of it?</p>
            <p>Then, for that other of 1672, the King in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of Parliament was engag'd in a War with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> and, to ſecure Peace at home while he had War abroad, had put forth a Declaration for Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to Diſſenters: The Parliament meet, grant a Supply of Twelve hundred thirty eight thouſand ſeven hundred and fifty thouſand Pounds; and, without charging the Declaration with Illegality, pray His Majeſty to recall it. The Argument pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd, and the King did it: Which ſhews, that it was in the King's Option not to have done it, or done it.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, for that other in the beginning of His Majeſty's Reign. That alſo (without declaring it Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal) was but ſome Heats of the Commons. There were at that time two open Rebellions; the King (who is ſole Judge of the danger of the Kingdom, and how to avoid it) had granted Commiſſions to certain perſons not qualified according to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute 25 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. The Commons offer to bring in a Bill for the Indempnifying thoſe perſons: The King knew his own Authority, and ended the Diſpute. And if any man doubts the Legality of the King's diſpenſing with that Statute, a ſubſequent Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Trin. 2. Jac. 2. in B. R.</note> (in the Caſe of Sir <hi>Edward Hayles)</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd the Point; And that the Power of diſpenſing with Penal Laws, upon Neceſſity, or urgent Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of which the King is ſole Judge, is an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Prerogative in the King, not given Him in Truſt, or deriv'd from the People, but the ancient
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101351:13"/>
Right of the Crown, innate in the King, and unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable by them. And that this has been the ancient Judgment of the Judges from time to time, I ſhall meet with the occaſion of ſhewing it in the next Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And is a matter of ſo great Moment and Conſequence to the whole Nation, both in Church and State.</hi> And ſo indubitably is it, that nothing can be more: For the beſt of Laws being but good Intentions, if a Prince ſhould be ty'd up to ſuch unalterable Decrees, as in no caſe whatever he might vary from them, it might ſo happen, that what at one time was intended for the Good of Church and State, may at another prove the Deſtruction of both, if not as timely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. The preſent Caſe is a pregnant Inſtance of it: One would have thought, that the frequent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors of the four laſt Reigns, for the reducing this Kingdom to an exact Conformity in Religion, might have anſwerd the Deſign; but (if His Majeſty in his Declaration had not told us His thoughts of it) our own Experience might have taught us, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof have in a manner brought the Kingdom to nothing: And what ſhould the King have done in this Caſe; ſate ſtill, and expected a Miracle, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpos'd his Royal Authority for the ſaving it? The Queſtion anſwers it ſelf: And if the Power of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing with Penal Laws, were not inſeparably and unalterably in Him; how could he have done it? What elder Parliaments have declar'd in it, I have already ſhewn; and that the Judges ſucceſſively have gone with it, is, or may be, obvious to every man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:101351:14"/>
Such was the Reſolution of all the Juſtices in the <hi>Exchequer-Chamber, 2 R.</hi> 3. 12. And that the King might grant Licenſe, againſt a Penal Statute. And what is that, but a diſpenſing with it? In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by all the Juſtices in the ſame place, 2 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. That the King may grant a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> to a Penal Statute, tho' the Statute ſay, ſuch <hi>Non obſtante</hi> ſhall be meerly void; and ſuch was the Caſe there.—The 13 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 8. to the ſame purpoſe.—Allow'd for good Law. <hi>Plowd. Com.</hi> 502.—Confirm'd by Sir <hi>Edward Coke, 7 Coke</hi> 36.—and 12 <hi>Coke</hi> 18, 19. And laſtly, by a Judgment in His now Majeſty's Reign, of which before. And if ſo neceſſary a part of the Government, ſo ſolemnly determin'd by Parliaments and Judges, is fit to be ſlighted, or not obey'd, which amounts to the ſame, I leave it to every man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Your Petitioners cannot in Prudence, Honor, and Conſcience, ſo far make themſelves Parties to it, as the diſtribution of it all over the Nation, and reading it even in God's Houſe, and in the time of His Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, muſt amount to in common and reaſonable Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> And on the other hand I conceive, that both in <hi>Prudence, Honor,</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> they were highly oblig'd to it: For what is <hi>Prudence,</hi> but the active Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Mind, directing Actions morally good to their immediate Ends? That this Declaration is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally good appears by the purport of it; and that is, <hi>His Majeſty's deſire of Eſtabliſhing His Government on ſuch a Foundation, as may make His Subjects happy, and unite them to Him by Inclination as well as Duty.</hi> And what greater Prudence could there have been, than by their Lordſhips diſtributing that Declaration
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101351:14"/>
as enjoyn'd to them, and by their Paſtoral Authority requiring it to be read in all Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to have directed it to its immediate Ends, which were the Eſtabliſhing the Government, and making the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects happy? Or, if Wiſdom muſt come in for a ſhare, the Offices of That are Election and Ordination; the choice of right means for, and ordering them aright to their End. The right means of quieting the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was before them; and I think it no queſtion, whether their Lordſhips not diſtributing it, has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it aright to the end. The King had enjoyn'd it to be publiſh'd, and Wiſdom in this Caſe (like Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) is not of private Interpretation, but lies in Him that has the Power of commanding, not in him whom Conſcience binds to obey. In a word, if Obedience in Subjects is the Prince's Strength, and their own Security, what Prudence or Wiſdom could it be, by weakning the Power of Commanding, to leſſen their own Security?</p>
            <p>Then for <hi>Honor and Conſcience,</hi> tho' in this place, they ſeem to mean the ſame thing, and may be both reſolv'd into <hi>Nil conſcire ſibi,—</hi>yet I'll take them ſeverally. And how ſtands it with the Honor of <hi>the Church of</hi> England, <hi>both in Principles, and conſtant Practiſes, unqueſtionably Loyal, and to her great Honor, more than once ſo acknowledg'd by His Majeſty,</hi> to ſtart aſide in this Day of her trial? Both the laſt <hi>Armagh</hi>'s, <hi>Uſher,</hi> and <hi>Bramhal;</hi> Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> &amp;c. have all along by their Doctrin, and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, beat down that other, of Reſiſting Princes, in that <hi>the Church</hi> of England <hi>held no ſuch Cuſtom:</hi> nor have the moſt eminent of her Clergy, Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> Dr. <hi>Scott,</hi> and others, until this laſt uncomplying,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101351:15"/>
Compliance, taken any other Meaſures. And ought not their Practiſe now, to have made good their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples? Or that Advice of the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to have been conſider'd, and follow'd? <hi>Let her be thankful</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to God,</hi>

Nor muſt the Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary of the now Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> be paſt in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. <hi>Tho' the King</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhould not pleaſe, or humor us; tho' he rend off the Mantle from our Bodies,</hi>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101351:15"/>
once acknowledg'd her Loyalty, who in Honor more oblig'd to make it good, than thoſe that ſerve at her Altar? unleſs (perhaps) they coin a Diſtinction to Salve it, And that the Church may be of one Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Church-men of another.</p>
            <p>And then in <hi>Conſcience,</hi> their Obligation was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for beſides what I ſaid before, that the People are apter to follow Example than Precept, every Man (and even their Lordſhips with the reſt) is Party, and privy, to an Act of Parliament, and bound in Conſcience, to the obſervance of it: Nor is there ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Biſhop, or Clergy-man in the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> who has not ſubſcrib'd to the lawfulneſs of this Declaration's being read in the Church, during the time of Divine Service. As thus: Every Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at the time of his Inſtitution, ſubſcribes (in a a Book kept for that purpoſe) That the King's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty <note place="margin">Eccleſiaſtical Canons 16<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Now, the Book of Common-Prayer, as it is now uſed in and thro' the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by Authority of Parliament, to be read in ſuch Order and Form, as is mentioned in the ſaid Book: And the Rubrick, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Order and Form, how thoſe Prayers ſhall be read, is to all intents and purpoſes, as much Enacted as the Book its ſelf; And in that <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,</hi> next after the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> (in the Communion Service) follow theſe words: <hi>Then ſhall the Curate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:101351:16"/>
anything, but what is preſcribed by the Rules of this Book, Or enjoyned by the King, or by the Ordinary of the Place.</hi> Now when all Clergy-men have ſubſcribed, That the Book of Common-Prayer, containeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, contrary to the Word of God; and that the King has enjoyned, That his Declaration be read in all Churches, during the time of Divine Service; theſe Subſcriptions of theirs (beſides the Authority of King and Parliament) conclude themſelves, from offering any thing againſt the Lawfulneſs of reading it, as it had been enjoyn'd to them, and the Rubrick, requir'd of them. And being ſo, what Excuſe can there be, why they did not read it?</p>
            <p>Or ſuppoſe that Clauſe, <hi>Or enjoyned by the King,</hi> had not been in the Rubrick, (as it was firſt inſerted in this Act of Uniformity, and every Man that was of the Convocation of 1661, knows by whom:) were none of the King's Declarations ever read in Churches (and that, during the time of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service) before that time? I think there were, and (amongſt many others) that of the Declaration for Sports, for one. Or that the <hi>Ordinary of the Place</hi> had enjoyn'd the contrary, ought not the King, the Supreme Ordinary, and as their Subſcriptions far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acknowledge, The <hi>Supreme Governor of this Realm under God,</hi> to have been firſt obey'd? I think he ought; for the Authority of the Greater, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedes the Leſſer; nor is there any Power in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but what is deriv'd from him. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Station the King has given them in the Church, it is not to be preſum'd, he thereby lock'd out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Nor muſt a Remark of the ſaid Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> in his Sermon before mention'd, be forgotten
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101351:16"/>
here: <hi>The Jews</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſay, That the Keys of the</hi>

               <hi>Temple were not hung at the High Prieſt's Girdle, but laid every night under</hi> Solomon'<hi>s Pillow, as belonging to his Charge.</hi> The Moral of it holds true; for when a Prince ſhall have little Authority in the Church, it is not to be expected he ſhould have much better in the State.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, for their Lordſhips <hi>ſo far making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Parties to it, as the Diſtribution and Reading of it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>muſt amount to, in common and reaſonable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> A Clergy-man's meerly Reading the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer in his Church, is no giving his Aſſent to it, unleſs after his ſo Reading it, he ſhall publickly, and openly, before the Congregation there aſſembled, declare his unfeigned Aſſent, and Conſent, to all and every thing contained, and preſcribed in and by the ſaid Book, Entituled, <hi>The Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">

            <p>The Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Submit your ſelves to every Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Man for the Lord's ſake.</hi> And upon this, the Biſhop of <hi>Hereford</hi> grounds his Judgment, for the Reading this Declaration. <hi>The King</hi> (ſaith he) <note place="margin">His late Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe on this occaſion.</note> 
               <hi>expreſly commanding it to be read in all Churches, without requiring him that reads it, to declare either his Conſent, Aſſent, Allowing, or Liking it; I would gladly know how this is contrary to the Word of God?

Which if we loſe on this Occaſion, they will have much to anſwer for who are the Authors of it.</hi> (pag. 13.) Beſides whom, there are ſeveral other Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd his Majeſty's Commands in it, albeit they may not have ſo publickly declar'd it. And having ſaid ſo much to the Matter of the Paper, I think I may well paſs the Prayer of it, <hi>That his Majeſty will be Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleas'd not to inſiſt upon the Diſtribution, and Reading that Declaration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore upon the whole, If this Declaration had not been thought fit to have been diſtributed, as enjoyn'd, leſs ought the ſaid Paper to have been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed privately, and by ſuch previous diſpoſition, ſtoll'n the Form of the Deſign into the Matter it was to work on: And conſidering the Evils we had paſs'd, and that the Kingdom wanted a Lenitive, not a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſive, leaſt of all ought <hi>The People on the wall</hi> to have been har'd with new Jealouſies: The People (I ſay) who need more a Ballance than a Fly, ſomewhat to moderate, not multiply their Motion.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, Truſt is the Sinew of Society, which is the right Object of true Policy; and Diſtruſt, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding of it. The King, as he has <hi>more than once acknowledg'd the Church of</hi> England'<hi>s Loyalty,</hi> has as often declar'd, that <hi>He will Protect, and Maintain, His Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and Clergy, and all other His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101351:17"/>
of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>in the free Exerciſe of their Religion, as by Law Eſtabliſhed: And in the quiet, and full Enjoyment of all their Poſſeſſions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Moleſtation or Diſturbance whatſoever.</hi> The King has ſaid it, and ſhall he not perform it? He has pledg'd his Royal Word, and ſhall we doubt the Truth of it? It is not with God, that he ſhould lye; nor with his Vicegerent, that he ſhould be chang'd. And therefore, let us (as his Majeſty by this his Declaration Conjures us) lay aſide all private Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, and groundleſs Jealouſies: Let us <hi>Fear God, and Honor the King,</hi> and not diſcover the falſneſs of our own Hearts, by diſtruſting our Prince's.</p>
            <p>In a word, Let every Man in his Station, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute <hi>(his Mite)</hi> to the Peace, and Greatneſs of his Country: Let him ſhew his Love to God, in his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to his Prince: And let no Man, by ſetting up Conſcience againſt Duty, run the hazard of daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Firſt Table againſt the Second.</p>
