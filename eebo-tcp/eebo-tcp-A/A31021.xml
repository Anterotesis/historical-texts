            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

expir'd also. After this, I with my Orphan Sister <hi>Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica,</hi> retir'd to our Castle, (towards which we now equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate) where we reape as much delectation in the rurall solentary groves and hewts of our owne, as the rest of the <hi>French</hi> Ladies doe in the populous streets of stately <hi>Paris,</hi> she that hath no looking-glasse to dresse her head by, will use a boule of water, she that wanteth a sleeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone to repumicate her linnen, will take a pibble. The Countrey-girle girdeth her selfe as strait in the waste with a course caddis, as the Madame of the Court with a silke riband; and we were as well content in our Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick immorigerous roomes,, as others in the magnificent structures of our Royall Soveraigne.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, there arrived at my Castle <hi>Phylispis</hi> a valiant and heroicall Knight, one out of the number of those, whom renowned Fame will ever celebrate: his errand was to prostrate his love-sicke-heart at my feet, in the highest degree of lowest duty; and the purity of the verity is, he had taken a full possession of the Fort, before he did aske for the keyes; the match was concluded, and agreed on before the capitulations were treated on: my ravished eyes did no sooner behold him, then my amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous heart did fancie him; (for he resembled <hi>Abdalmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis,</hi> the grandfather of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> who was so amiable, that women were enamoured of him;) yet my modest tongue did a long time hold him in wavering suspence, neither suffering his feare to fall into despaire, not his hope to hasten to assurance; though once to prove the reality of his unalterable affection, I charged him with whole vollyes of flatte denialls; though any man that had beene trained up in <hi>Cupids</hi> discipline, might easily perceive, I shot nothing but powder, to try his animosity, not bullets, to batter downe his breast-workes of hope already reared. To these hee framed this satisfactory reply.</p>

                     <hi>Madame,</hi> the poore Fisherman that was warned hee should not fish, would notwithstanding at his door make nets. And the old Vintner of <hi>Venice</hi> that was prohibited from selling Wine, did stil hang out an inviting Ivie-bush; and so will I die in faith to you, if I may not live in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of you: My malevolent and inauspicious starres may impeach my injoyment of you, but if they should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the assistance of <hi>Erynnis,</hi> and call into their ayd the three Acheronticall Haggs, <hi>Alecto, Megera,</hi> and <hi>Tyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phone,</hi> they should never force me from your love; which is radicated so profoundly in my heart, that hee which plucks it out, pulls up at once that, and my soule together. Your gifts inspir'd by bounteous nature, and your vertues acquir'd by liberall education, have stampt for you such an indelible impression of love &amp; affection in my estimation, as no distance of place, length of time, or traverse of chance, shall be able to race out, or impaire, till death and sad despaire, make a sponge of my bleeding heart to wipe it out.</p>
                  <p>For all this, I still made his condition like a taper al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most burnt out, sometimes all obscured in blacke darke dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, and now and then a flash or two, an <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> of comfort; but of so short continuance, 'twas as soon extinguished, as perceived, till at length, my kinder heart being willing to yeeld, I was content not to perswade it to hold out any longer, against the sweet blowes of love, but I promised him marriage, which is shortly to be consummated.</p>
                  <p>Soone after him came this knight, who is by your va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, <hi>Ad Charontem sine naulo missus,</hi> and he also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a desire to match my matchlesse beauty, with matchlesse affection, him I denyed as fervently, as I did the other faintly. And now this <hi>Tripolis</hi> (for so he was nominated, whom you have vanquished) did attempt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52423:15"/>
to atchive that <hi>(Tarquin-like)</hi> by force of armes, which he could not effect by perswasion and argument, this made him devise all meanes, and waite for all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to surprise me.</p>
                  <p>It fortuned, though late, yet at last, there was a match concluded on between <hi>Arcates,</hi> sonne and heire to the ancient Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and <hi>Claritia</hi> my Mothers si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters daughter; to solemnization of these nuptialls, I with my damsels tooke our way, and now earths black bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling daughter spred the pinions of swift wings, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her shtill trumpet, and fill'd the inquiring eares of <hi>Tripolis,</hi> with the relation of our journey; of which being certified, he diligently awaited for my returne, and had assuredly made me his captive, had not you been my rescuer; to whom I am indebted for my liberty (the joy of life) which I hold now the second time of you. Thus sir have you bound me to you in an energeticall chaine of gratitude. To attempt a requitall, would extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extenuate your transcendent courtesie, and dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the worth of your high favour: but for the other office of gratitude, retention, if you had a window into my memory, you might espie there safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stored up, and conservated, to preserve it from moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring away in oblivion.</p>

such delicate shaddowes, and in the Winter, the chilly and sharpe windes found no passe; the trees were so high and thick; round about these ran silver streames, whose sweet murmur, as they gently tumbled over their beds of pebble stone, did much adorne the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant solitarinesse of the place. Opposite to the front of this strong structure was a large parke, which for cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full risings of the ground, for groves, and rowsings for the Deere, and for chrystall Rivolets of cleere water might compare with any. In the Hall, cost and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion strove for mastery, so many Stories did so succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively succeed one another, that the most curious specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors eye, (though his admiration might dwell in each peece) could find no cause of stay, untill hee had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd them all; here he did recreate his active fancy, with this varietie of pleasing objects.</p>

There might he behold sorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Venus</hi> bemoaning the violent death of her bore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaine minion <hi>Adonis,</hi> and striving to wash away the clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered blood from his worried carkesse with her pearly teares, which dropt from her tender eyes like a continued chaine of pearle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

as those reall torches which by this time had inherited the set-Suns office. There might hee discrie the rude mouthes of <hi>Acteons</hi> dogs fill'd with white foame, greedy to dismember their brutified master, and delacerate his limbes instead of the innocent beast he persued. There griefe in the stead of gaine, paine in the roome of pleasure, seemed to bath its selfe in his sorrowfull eyes.</p>
                  <p>By this time our Spectators appetites began to soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them in behalfe of their stomacks, the colerick lookes knockt, the trumpets sounded to supper, and when the tables were with-drawne, the Ladyes servants for the better entertainment of <hi>Flaminius</hi> (being ambitious to exhibite all their forces to performe any thing that might conduce to his contentment) presented him with this pastorall.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now every busie Virgin is preparing costly jewels to adorne the Bride. every willing hand is providing orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to deck her.

                  <p>The second that came against <hi>Flaminius,</hi> was <hi>Pliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> in whose acts there is truth enough to make him fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, besides that which is fabulous, when these two sons of valour, (whose lightfooted steeds ran as if they had beene begotten by the winde, and ballassed with quick silver) met, breaking their knotty speares even to their gaunt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Our Champion next <hi>Antagonist</hi> was <hi>Alsus,</hi> a man of a haughty courage, and of grand experience in Military affaires, he bore for his device upon his shield, fickle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes whirling wheele; but this angry goddesse placed him in the lower spokes, for he was soone sent with his heeles upward to company his fellowes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Flaminius</hi> still continued unhorsing his unabiding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, till the declining lamp of light did treble each shaddow, and <hi>Titans</hi> fierie chariot horses defatigated with their tedious race, were retired to drench them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their hospitable salt bath, for the refreshing of their sweating members; at which time he left the lists, having renowned Victory for his hand-maid, and the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of the day adorning his crest.</p>

                     <hi>Flaminius</hi> waited not long before <hi>Uernar</hi> appeared gallantly mounted upon a bay browne coursier, full of black spots, his forehead marked with a white starr, to which in his whole body there was not any part answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable but the left foot behind, his armour was rich and gorgious of a skie colour full of starrs of gold, he bore in his sheild the effigies of <hi>Cassandra</hi> the propheticall daughter of <hi>Priamus</hi> in silver, with this word <hi>Mentriri non est meum,</hi> Its not my part to lye.</p>

                  <p>Or had <hi>Nullifidius</hi> whom no man will credit reported this it had not been worth my answering, or her regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but that you <hi>Uernar</hi> who was sometimes of her intimate acquaintance (being <hi>Deli'as</hi> friend) Though as it is now evident a dissembling <hi>Sycophant,</hi> for you to relate this, others beleeve it, she stomaches it, and I'le re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge it, I had better take a blister of a nettle, then a prick of a rose, I am more willing that a Raven should pick out my eyes, then a Turtle pick at them, to dye of the food one affecteth not is better then to surfet of that one delighteth in, I am of <hi>Scipi'os</hi> mind who had rather that <hi>Hanibal</hi> should eat his heart with salt then

                  <p>We come not hither to debate, but to combate, not to prate but to praeleate, not to cavill but to duel, not to jest <hi>but to just,</hi> wherefore (having turned their horses) these champions met so furiously, That their shiver'd lances flew upwards, as if they challenged the skie before they falled on earth, never was game of death better playd, never did fury display it selfe in greater bravery, never were <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> better imitated or rather excell'd, never were swords guided by more skilfull hands, never were hands accommodated with more trusty swords, which like deep mouth'd Cannons battering downe by peace meale their armours, made many wide breaches for troopes of wounds to rush in at, Her's the <hi>Trojan</hi> warrs in <hi>Epitome,</hi> her's the battell of <hi>Lepanto</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Monomachy,</hi> her's <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> fought over againe in a <hi>Hippomachy,</hi> her's the <hi>Pharsalian</hi> feild discrib'd in these lists, her's the fight at <hi>Canna</hi> excelled in a duell.</p>

Thy gifts are onely temporarie, there is no stable happinesse in this circle of flesh, nor is it in the opticks of these eyes to behold permanent felicitie: <hi>Apres un peu de joye ou seut mieux la tristesse,</hi> a pound of griefe followes an ounce of joy: as the tree and the rinde groweth and sprouteth together, the one not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting without the other; so with man is care and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xietie ingendred, which as an inseparable evill Angell follows him in all his actions, as the shadow doth the body: <hi>Lieur &amp; mallieur se suyvent tour à tour,</hi> good and evill follow one another.

If to day <hi>Mars</hi> smiled on one of them, he feared the amphibologicall successe of to morrow; for, <hi>Cela qu'un jour nous donè, un autre jour nous l'oste,</hi> what one day gives us, another takes away from us: so that a man can make himselfe sure of nothing without the power of his action (that is not wholly in his hands) for, <hi>Multa cadunt inter po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum, &amp; labra,</hi> Chance is a Dicer; its vaine to put more confidence in this life then in one wind at Sea, but 'tis wisdome to have tackling readie for all vicissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Fortune.</p>
                  <p>The Mulberry tree (as Herbalists observe) is long in begetting and keeping its buds, but (the cold season being past) it shootes them all in one night; and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which sometimes is long in dandling her favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, (the edge of her lubricious affection being aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) she diverts from them her benignitie, and converts it to their miserie.

                  <p>Wee must not with <hi>Marcus Lepidus</hi> stretch our selves upon the grasse, and say <hi>ô utinam hoc esset laborare,</hi> our intention must rather be as stable, and unmoveable as the Roman <hi>Fabritius</hi> of whom it was said, that one might with as much facclity obvaricate the Sunnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse as cause him to digresse. <hi>Il faut semer devant qu' ou puisse moissouner,</hi> wee must sowe before wee reape, we must conquer before we triumph, win the Garland before wee weare it; timidity and consternation will hold out a Gorgon head of encumbrances, and tell of <hi>Chimaeras,</hi> and Phantasies of determents: but let not these dash our hopes, melt our courage, or emas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate our resolutions, for believe <gap reason="foreign">

Cicero</hi> terme'd it the treasury and life of the City, a Land deliciously fertile, and wonderfully productive, humectated with winding catracts, and small sluces, this will bee an opulent purchase, and a good penny-worth at my rate; <hi>Imperia pretio quolibet constant bené.

This dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciloquie inspired the faintest hearts with freshest cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and made them impatient of delay, they and their horses too, with a <hi>clamor militaris,</hi> and loud acclamations assented to their Generalls Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Silenus</hi> also was encouraging his Souldiers when the classicum of their enemies was rhetorick enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite them to their tasks. The black clouds poured down upon the <hi>Sicilians</hi> store of Funerall teares: and sholes of Ravens and other birds of prey) as predicting the harvest of carkasses at hand) flew over their hoast.</p>
                  <p>A sore Battel was begun, and with equall successe a long time maintain'd, where the grasse became gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed for want of moysture, it was sprinkled with a sanguilent Nectar. Here was a Father divided from his Son, here a Husband from his Wife, and yonder where there was no Kin they be joyned in blood.</p>
                  <p>But because that <hi>Cato</hi> the Censor that taught the young men to preliate with a steady foote, would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten say, that words and shoutings had more power to amaze and put enemies to the rout, then hand, strokes, wherefore <hi>Amenides</hi> hoast did amaze their adversaries with a shrill clamour, whereas the <hi>Cicilians</hi> (as if the whole army had had but one heart) let all their coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges fall into their feet, which now they altogether tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amenides</hi> who knowes as well how to use as gaine a victory, pursued his dissipated foe-men to <hi>Mount-royall</hi>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:52423:86"/>
their chiefe Assylum, which place being reduced to the height of penury by the multitude of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and deprived of supplyes from the adjacent and conterminent Villages, by its cautelous besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. <hi>Silenus</hi> in a disguise fled, and got to the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy at <hi>Tolouse,</hi> where hee changed his royall Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynes for sables, and became a phantasticall Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, spending the residue of his life in enigmaticall disputations, as whether or no <hi>Cassandra</hi> was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the tooth-ache, how many knots were on HERCULES Club, of what colour ACHIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LES Beard was, hee studyed himselfe halfe bleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey'd to know the true sementry of <hi>Caesars</hi> nose by a Shooing-horne, and all to bee dignified with the name of a speculative man.</p>
                  <p>But the Citizens considering <hi>ameux vaut plier rompre,</hi> its better to bow then breake, and seeing that their egresse afforded no hope of regresse, of feare of their foes ingresse, and perceiving no happy helpe, for their helpelesse hap, had wit enough to set their sailes that way that the winde blew, and to wheele about as they saw occasion, that they might bee of the prevailing side. Much like the man in <hi>Macrobrius,</hi> who during the Civill Warre betweene <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> and <hi>Antonius,</hi> had taught two Crowes their severall notes, the one to say <hi>Aue Imperator Antoni:</hi> the other to say <hi>Aue Imperator Augusti.</hi> That so when the Controversie was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, what side soever prevailed he might have a Bird for the Conquerour.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Silenus</hi> being fled, his Subjects subjected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Victor, and framed themselves to call <hi>Vivat Rex Amenides,</hi> who soon adorned his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all browes with the Regall Circle, the Gates were opened to entertaine his Army, and the peoples

hearts were opened to entertaine himselfe.</p>
                  <p>But those which ingenuity prompted not to love him, hee taught to feare him, knowing <hi>primus in orbe deos fecit timor.</hi> But it was as possible for <hi>Phoehus</hi> to find new pathes to drive his Chariot in, or for the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone to forget its faith to the North, as for <hi>Amenides</hi> to turne Loves Apostate, and be unmindful of <hi>Dionella,</hi> by the ayre of whose Blessed name, <hi>Chamelion-like</hi> hee lived, having taken fealty of his Subjects, steered his course to <hi>Naples.</hi> At his presence <hi>Dionella</hi> was revived, as a starved flye is when the Sun get out, after their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmie, they repaired to <hi>Sicilie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now these Potentates, <hi>Flaminius</hi> and <hi>Clorinda, Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> and <hi>Dionella,</hi> after they had a long time Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chised in the highest degrees of Soveraignty (having left a numerous off-spring to sway their Scepters whom I wish a Chrysostomaticall repositor of their vertues) yeelded rather to a gentle dissolution then death. Their Bodies are interr'd in the most magnificent Cathedralls in their Dominions where the sumptuonsnesse of their Monuments proclaime their extrinsicall Fortunes, and their ever-living Fame their intrinsicall endowments. But when their Statenesse and Tombes, composed and erected of Gold, Marble, or Ivory, shall drop down into ashes, and crumble by peece-meale into non-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and bee found as ARCHIMEDES his Tombe (by <hi>CICERO)</hi> in Vepretis, crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with mosse, and over-growne with bryars, and thornes, I wish they may survive in this Monument of their Fame.</p>
