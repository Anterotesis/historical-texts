            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Loyal Protestants VINDICATION.</head>
            <head>Fellow Natives and Brother Protestants.</head>
            <p>FOR by Birth and Charity we are bound so to call you. And we hope, That (upon the Ebbs of your heat and humour) you will out of humility think it fit at last to call Us so too.</p>
            <p>It cannot de denied, but that (ever since the Blessed Reformation) Protestanism is the Common Cause and Interest of <hi>England.</hi> And that he only is to be reputed Our Enemy, who shall and doth by Plots and Designs endeavour, either to Subvert or Alter our Government, as it now stands by Law established both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>Now for the Blasting and Defeating of all wicked Conspiracies against Our Established Government, both at present and for the future, I can assure you, that you have our Heads, our Hands and our Hearts. Nor can you be more zealous for the Overthrow of the late discovered Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and Hellish Popish Plot, and the suppressing the Growth of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than the true honest-minded Church of <hi>England</hi> men are. Pardon them only in this; That they love a Zeal regulated with Prudence, and softned with Moderation.</p>
            <p>You all very well know, That it hath been of late the great artifice of the Jesuited Party to intrude (if possible) their damnable Plot upon that Classis of Protestants call'd <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> Who I am perswaded have learn'd from their former miscarriages, That it is both theirs and all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants Interest, not to disturb our National Government, or disoblige their Prince.</p>
            <p>And I could heartily wish that the Papists might never have had any colourable pretence for fathering their Brat of Rebellion upon any sort of Protestants amongst Us. And this they would never have had, if the years between 1640. and 60. could be raz'd out of the Book of Time, and the memory of this Age.</p>
            <p>But whatever things the Papists may Revive to serve their Cause, We are willing to forget them, so it may heal our Breaches, and Cement us together in a Brotherly Assistance of each other, for the saving both of You and Us, and our Protestant Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96197:3"/>
And for the effectual promoting of so considerable and publick a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, I think all judicious and thoughtful men will allow that there is nothing so essential and necessary as our Union. And though it's not reasonable to expect, that all the sorts of Protestants in <hi>England</hi> should in a moment concentre in one mind, in one judgment and opinion: Yet what should hinder, but that they may have a reciprocal kindness and love one for another, and one and the same Loyalty to their Prince?</p>
            <p>Unless the Protestant parties in <hi>England</hi> are like the Princes in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> wherein every one is so much wedded to his own interest, that he had rather see the Emperor dethron'd, and the whole Empire lost, than lose one little <hi>Regalia</hi> of his own to save it.</p>
            <p>Never were the Papists so full of Plots, and so big with hopes as now. And never was the Wicked one so busie in sowing the Seeds of discord and contention as within this moneth or two last past. For to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving eye the Print of the Cloven foot hath been easily seen in all the Roads, Cities, Towns and Corporations of <hi>England</hi> within that time.</p>
            <p>And whatever Sentiments some Over-zealous and misguided men may have of linking and listing themselves and names, under the form of a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition; yet certainly none but the <hi>Jesuite,</hi> (who alone hath the Art of out doing the Devil in malice and mischief) could have invented a more proper and effectual way of setting Protestants in <hi>England</hi> at a greater variance and distance than ever they were before.</p>
            <p>The Old weather-beaten course which the <hi>Jesuits</hi> used to make us Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants hateful to, and hating one of another, was to cast upon some the name and character of <hi>Calvinists,</hi> upon some <hi>Arminians,</hi> upon some <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians,</hi> upon some <hi>Pelagians,</hi> upon some <hi>Cavaliers</hi> and <hi>Malignants,</hi> upon some <hi>Covenanters</hi> and <hi>Round-heads</hi> after the old style; but now <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> and <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> or Court and Countrey party, after the style of the newest fashions.</p>
            <p>But now since the <hi>Jesuit</hi> perceives that We Protestants begin to smell the device of these Nick-names, and that we are growing so skilful as to discern that these are only bones thrown in amongst us, merely to make us snarl, and bite, and devour one another; Therefore the <hi>Jesuits</hi> (to perpetuate and continue the Protestant fray and scuffle, which is the only advantage to their Cause) have now at this time (if not invented) yet at least set on foot a Form and mode of Petitioning, which must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably run us into fearful Broyles, if not timely prevented.</p>
            <p>For pray observe, With what heat and earnestness did some press the Subscription of it upon others their fellow subjects? With what Reluctancy and stubbornness did others deny and refuse it? How passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately and bitterly did many in <hi>Coffee-Houses</hi> and other places debate and argue the lawfulness and unlawfulness of it?</p>
            <p>And it's to be wisht, that in some Towns, Parishes, and Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods it be not the standing cause of irreconcileable feuds and quarrels among the people. For such hath been the imprudence of some Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed men that carried this Petition about for Subscriptions, that they told the un-thinking vulgar, it was the <hi>Shibboleth</hi> to discern between the Protestants and Papists in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence many of them (poor Souls!) out of fear and ignorance set their Hands, but more their Marks to it: when as they, and those that Prest it upon them, can give no just positive account, whether this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> were invented and fram'd ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by a Papist or a Protestant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96197:3"/>
And now is not this a pretty piece of Sport to our Common enemy the Papist, to see a Leaf of paper set all <hi>England</hi> in a Flame, and create most desperate Animosities amongst its Protestant natives? Could there be any Project or Device (next to the killing of our Gracious Soveraign whom God long preserve) so essential and proper for the Ruine of Us, and our Protestant Religion as this?</p>
            <p>What need have the Papists of Collections from their friends? or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys from the Holy Chamber? or of Armyes from Foreign Popish Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? when as our Divisions, which they have set up amongst us, will with good looking after most certainly and inevitably do this work to their hands, without any such cost or trouble.</p>
            <p>Serious and frequent have been our Addresses to you for a Brotherly Correspondence and Reconciliation, and your Joyning with Us in the Defence and Preservation of the Protestant Religion. Nay we have made it Our Humble Requests to You, that you would do Us that Right and Justice, as to own and allow us to be Protestants as well as your selves. And yet such hath been the hard fate and misfortune of Our Gentleness and Meekness towards you, that like the Grace of God to proud and wanton sinners, they have been scorn'd and rejected.</p>
            <p>For instead of any Civilities to us for this our Humble Demeanour, you have imperiously ascended the Seat of Judgment, and the Chair of the Scorner: Loading us with Scoffs and Reproaches, and condemning us for Hereticks and Papists. Nay, so mightily Sowr'd are you in your Opinions and Judgments of an <hi>English</hi> Church-man, that you nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seate him, as you pretend to do a Papist, and shun his converse and sight as much as a man of curdled bloud doth Cheese.</p>
            <p>But whatever Treatments you are pleased to give us, or whatever Liveries you think fit to Clothe us withal; yet (begging your leave) we shall desire this freedom as to cleanse our Garments from those foul Aspersions thrown upon them from Pulpits in <hi>Conventicles,</hi> Libels from the Press, and those Scurrilous Reproaches vented by Republican Tools and Tantivy's.</p>
            <p>And therefore let him that hath Eyes and Learning to read, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Loyal Protestants Vindication, <hi>In these following Particulars,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>FIRST,</hi> We do own and love all Protestants of whatever Sort, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Name, that do really abominate the Superstitious fooleries and Heretical Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We do Approve and Delight in all Persons, which assert and vindicate the King's Supremacy over all Persons and in all Causes both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We countenance and commend all such, who mind their own business and study to be quiet, and who out of Duty as well as Modesty have so good and just opinion of their present Soveraign's Art and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Governing, that they will not presume to prescribe him rules and methods of managing the people which God hath committed to his care and charge.</p>
            <p>For such hath been his Education, and so much experience hath he learnt in foreign Courts and Countreys, during his Exile, that we can
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96197:4"/>
positively say, He is the Wisest King in <hi>Christendom,</hi> and the best States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in all his whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are for giving all men their just dues according to their Dignities, Places, and Qualities, and do abominate all those harsh and rough methods, which irritate our Superiors anger and displeasure. For certainly of all persons, Governours chiefly are to be oblig'd and not forc't.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We do verily believe, that according to the Contents of our New Testament, no man ought to Affront and Vilifie his Princes Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Authority either in words or deeds. And that if he cannot conform to the Government of his Prince, yet he is bound in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not to be openly, publickly, and actually disobedient, especially where the Prince is Christian and Protestant too. And where the ground of Subjects Obedience and Disobedience is purely about Things Indifferent, which is a thing that wholly excludes all doubts and scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> We do abominate, and as seasonably and prudentially as we can, rebuke and suppress all sorts of Vices and Immoralities without respect had to persons. And should be heartily glad to see Whoredom, Adultery, Drunkenness, Swearing and Pride, to grow out of fashion in the Kingdom; as we wish, Malice, Spight, Backbiting, Censuring, Slandering, Railing and Bitterness of Spirit may decay amongst you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> We heartily Love, and highly Applaud all plain-hearted and publick-spirited men, who aim and endeavour at things for the Kings Honour and Greatness, and the real good of the whole Kingdom. But we do detest and abhor all self-ended and self-seeking men, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally those who engage a whole Kingdom for a particular disgust; and study revenge for a private defeat they have received, or who design to make themselves Popular, great and rich under the Pretence of serving the Publick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> We heartily pray, and use all the interest we have, that this late Damnable Hellish Popish Plot, (which God in mercy to us all hath brought to light) may be daily more and more detected and brought to a final Period. And we joyn with you in our souls, that the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> may sit for the Tryal of those Great Conspirators, who cannot be otherwise Tryed but by <hi>Parliament.</hi> But as for the time, when this <hi>Parliament</hi> should sit about this weighty affair, we humbly leave it to His Majesties Prudence, who, of all men hath the sole right, and is best able to chuse the seasonableness of doing it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> We do firmly believe, that the Present Actings and Designs of Our Enemies the <hi>Papists</hi> are so wicked and evil, and Our Cause so Good and Just, that we dare (with the use of lawful and justifiable means) in an humble confidence refer the whole matter into the hands of Providence, not doubting but that God will so rule the heart of our King, and direct his Councils, that We and Our Religion will at last have as Memorable a Deliverance, as any of those which have been in the Days of our Ancestors.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> We do affirm, and can justifie it: That the Men of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are the true, right, and only Protestants. And for this we dare appeal to the known Laws of the Land, to the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and all the <hi>Calvinistical</hi> and <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches abroad; for whenever they write or speak of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they mean that which is established by Law in our Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96197:4"/>
And because the Memory of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is always so fresh and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant in your minds, that you keep her Anniversary Coronation-day above all other Protestant Kings of <hi>England,</hi> with the solemnities of Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires and ringing of Bells. We therefore take the opportunity to declare to you; That it's not you, but we are the Men, who are not only the Legal, but the true Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Protestants. And I would advise you, the next time you observe that Day, (which I shall observe with you) that you would enquire into your selves, whether you are the Protestants of that mould and stamp, which she loved, and her Laws protected in her Reign.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> Though you take a pride or pleasure, or both, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent us to the Vulgar under those filthy characters of Mungrel Protestants, Half Protestants, Protestants in Masquerade, and Church Papists. Yet under our patient bearing of your Reproaches: We beg your pardon to make this Declaration: That we do abhor and detest those black and odious Titles. And had you but a spark of modesty, or a grain of reason, or the least insight into our Laws, you would have long since forborn to persecute us with this slanderous Accusation.</p>
            <p>What was Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a good Protestant, and now must the Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Protestants be counted no Protestants, or call'd half Protestants, and Protestants in Masquerade? What doth the <hi>Jesuit</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> hate us, and plot to destroy us, because he finds us the best and truest Protestants? And must you to Revile us and seek to Root us out: because we are not Protestants according to your standard?</p>
            <p>Certainly had you but any wit or Reason about you, you might plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see; That whatever you think of us, the <hi>Papists</hi> take us only to be the truest Protestants, and their greatest Enemies. For it's against Us that all these malicious Plots are levell'd. And they have only set you up as Tools and Instruments to compleat their design. For alas, there is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one amongst all your Parties hath writ so Judiciously and Rationally against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to deserve either a Learned <hi>Papists</hi> read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or answer.</p>
            <p>And now must our Bishops, Doctors and Divines be the only Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions for the Protestant Religion against the <hi>Romanists.</hi> And yet must their Hearers and Followers be branded with the Ignominious Names of Half Protestants, Church Papists, and Protestants in Masquerade?</p>
            <p>For shame forbear these unchristian slanders; or else all foreign Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants will say, that you want both manners and modesty, or which is worse, brains and reason.</p>
            <p>Go on, if you please, with your trade of Calumniating: But thus plain we will be with you, to acquaint you, that our Eyes are so open, as to see you use one way, and the <hi>Papists</hi> use another way, to destroy and Ruine the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with its Protestant professors. And we declare, That from our knowledge of you Both, we expect no Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or mercy from either of you.</p>
            <p>For the Church of <hi>England</hi> men have already endured two Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the one of Fire in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> the other of the Sword in our late Unnatural Wars, when men of your own kidney Plundered, Sequestred, Imprisoned, Hanged and Beheaded many Thousands, for no other Crime, but that they were Loyal Subjects, and Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> Protestants. And now we are Expecting to fall under a Third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution: But whether it will come from the <hi>Papists,</hi> or <hi>You,</hi> we cannot as yet so easily Discern.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:96197:5"/>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Because you so arrogantly call your selves <hi>The Protestants,</hi> and the <hi>True Protestants;</hi> and so scoffingly call us the <hi>Half Protestants,</hi> and <hi>Church Papists,</hi> and <hi>Protestants in Masquerade:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>We therefore send you this Challenge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Go if you dare with us into <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> to the Assizes and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Sessions before the Judges and Justices of the Peace; and there (if you dare) take with Us the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce with us the Doctrine of Transubstantiation, and the Solemn League and Covenant. Subscribe with us the Declaration of the Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of taking up Arms against the King. And bring with us your Certificates of Receiving the Sacrament according to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, This is the Test and Shiboleth to distinguish <hi>Protestants</hi> from <hi>Papists,</hi> and not your Form of Petition which lately went in Procession; and should your boasted multitudes of Subscribers be brought to this Touchstone, we know that three parts of five would run a great danger of being convicted for <hi>Recusants</hi> by Law; for many of you who proudly call your selves the <hi>True Protestants,</hi> will as stifly deny the doing of these things as the Rankest <hi>Papist</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In love therefore I desire you to refrain from the Villifying us with the filthy characters of <hi>Protestants</hi> in Masquerade, and Church Papists, since that we have been so kind to you for many years, as not to put you upon this Tryal, which we know would be as ungrateful and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to you as any <hi>Papists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if you cannot out of Modesty and Charity, yet out of Interest learn to be more Sober and Moderate to your fellow Natives and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant</hi> Brethren; and do not Calumniate the Honest Church-men of <hi>England</hi> who Pray for you, and love you better than you do your selves, and would be glad to have you to joyn with them in all lawful and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable ways, for the overthrow of all <hi>Popish</hi> Plots, and the Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion which is Established by Law.</p>
            <p>And now let all the World Judge, whether We or You, are Half-Protestants, and Protestants in Masquerade; since that We will abide by those Legal Tryals and Touch-stones, which are the National Discri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations between <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists:</hi> and You, or the major-part of You, refuse these <hi>Tests</hi> as well as the <hi>Papists;</hi> and as long as You stand in the Refusal of them, You are but <hi>Papists</hi> in a <hi>Protestant</hi> disguise.</p>
