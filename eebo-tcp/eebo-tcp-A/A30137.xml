         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

are to be followed, Principally, as they are made known to us, by the
Dictates of Humane Nature; and that this obedience, is the first, and best sort
of obedience, we Christians can perform, <hi>Pag.</hi> 8, 9, 10. 3. That there is
<hi>such</hi> a thing as a foundness of Soul, and the purity of Humane Nature in the
World, <hi>Pag.</hi> 6. 4. That the <hi>Law,</hi> in the first Principles of it, is far beyond,
and more obliging on the hearts of Christians, then is, <hi>That of coming to God
by Christ, Pag.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10. 5. That the Precept of coming to God by
Christ, &amp;c. is in its own Nature, a thing <hi>indifferent,</hi> and absolutely considered
<hi>neither good nor evil, Pag.</hi> 7, 8, 9. 6. That Christ's great Errand, in coming
into the World, was to put us again in Possession of the Holiness <hi>we had lost, P.</hi> 12.
7. That <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> the <hi>Angel</hi> that was sent to <hi>Zecharias,</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi>
Preached this Doctrine; and so also did <hi>Malachy</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Pag.</hi> 13. 8. That
Christ by saving us from Sin, is meant, not first, his saving us from the <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but from the <hi>Filth,</hi> and from the punishment, as a <hi>Consequence</hi> of that,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 14, 15. 9. That Christ's Work, when he was come, was
to establish ONLY an inward Real Righteousness, <hi>Pag.</hi> 16. 10. That
Christ's fulfilling the Law FOR VS, was by giving more perfect, and lighter
instances of Morral Duties, then were before expressly given, <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. 11. That
Christ's <hi>Doctrine, Life, Actions, Miracles, Death, Resurrection, Ascention,</hi>


                  <pb facs="tcp:32067:4"/>
and <hi>coming again to Judgement,</hi> is all Preached to establish us in this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 12. That it is not <hi>possible</hi> a Wicked
man should have God's <hi>Pardon, Pag.</hi> 119. 13. That it is impossible Christ's
Righteousness should be imputed to an Vnrighteous Man, <hi>Pag.</hi> 120. 14. And
that if it were, he boldly affirms, it would signifie as little to his happiness, while
he continueth so, as would a Gorgious and Splendid Garment, to one that is
almost starved, <hi>Pag.</hi> 120. 15. For God to Justifie a Wicked man, &amp;c. would
far more disparage his Justice and Holiness, then advance his Grace and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 130. 16. He saith, Men are not Capable of God's pardoning
Grace, till they have truly repented them of all their Sins, <hi>Pag,</hi> 130. 17. The
Devils, saith he, have a large measure of these Attributes of God; as his Power,
Knowledge, &amp;c. <hi>Pag.</hi> 124. 18 That Christ did himself perform, as our example,
what ever he required of us to do; Yea, That he trod, himself EVERY
step of our Way to Heaven, <hi>Pag.</hi> 148. 19. The Salvation of Christ, <hi>First,</hi>
Consists in curing our <hi>Wounds, (our Filth.)</hi> And <hi>Secondarily,</hi> In freeing us
from the <hi>Smart, Pag.</hi> 216. 20. That pardon doth not so much Consist in
Remission, as in healing; to wit, our filth, <hi>Pag.</hi> 216. 21. Faith Justifieth,
AS it includeth true Holiness in the Nature of it; it Justifieth AS it doth
SO, <hi>Pag.</hi> 221. 22. That Faith which Intitles a Sinner to so high a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
as that of Justification, must <hi>needs</hi> be <hi>such</hi> as complyeth <hi>with</hi> ALL
the purposes of Christ's coming into the World, &amp;c. And it is <hi>no less</hi> necessary
that it should Justifie AS it doth THIS, <hi>Pag.</hi> 222. 23. He wonders
that any Wordly man should be so difficultly perswaded, to imbrace THIS ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Justifying Faith, <hi>Pag.</hi> 222. 24. There can be no pretence for a man,
to think that Faith should be the condition or instrument of Justification, as it
complyeth with, only the Precept of relying on Christ's Merits for the obtaining
of it, <hi>Pag.</hi> 223. 25. It is, saith he, As clear as the Sun at Noon-day, that
obedience to the other Precepts must go before obedience to this, <hi>Pag.</hi> 223. 26. He
shall be his <hi>Apollo,</hi> that can give him a sufficient reason, why Justifying Faith
should consist in Recombancy and Relyance on Christ's merits for the pardon of
Sin, <hi>Pag.</hi> 224. 27. He will take the boldness to tell those who are dispeased
with this account of Justifying Faith, that in his opinion it is impossible they
should ONCE think of another, <hi>Pag.</hi> 225. 28. The Imputation of
Christ's Righteousness, Consisteth in dealing with sincerely Righteous Persons, as
if they were perfectly so, &amp;c. <hi>Pag.</hi> 225. 29. The rand intent of the Gospel;
is, to make us pertakers of inward real Righteousness; and it is but Secondary,
that we should be accepted as before, <hi>Pag.</hi> 226. 30. It is not possible (he
saith) that any other notion of this Doctrine should have truth in it, <hi>Pag.</hi> 226.
31. Whatsoever is commanded by the customes of the place we live in, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Superiours, or made by ANY circumstance convenient to be done,


<pb facs="tcp:32067:5"/>
our Christian liberty consisteth in that we have leave to do them, <hi>Pag.</hi> 242.
32. For our resuffering to comply with these, can hardly proceed from any thing,
then a proud affection of singularity, or at best from Supersticious Scrupulosity,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 242. 33. Those Ministers hinder the design of Christianity, that
Preach up free Grace, and Christian Priviledges OTHER WAYS then
as Motives to obedience, and that scarce ever insist upon any other Duties then
those of believing, laying hold of Christ's Righteousness, applying the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
&amp;c. <hi>Pag.</hi> 262. 34. But to make the Christian Duties to consist either
wholly or MOSTLY in THESE, &amp;c. is the way effectually to harden
Hypocrites, <hi>Pag.</hi> 262. 35. Those Ministers do nothing <hi>less</hi> then Promote
the design of Christianity, that are never in their Element but when they are
talking of the irrespectiveness of God's Decrees, the absolute promises, the utter
Disability, and perfect Impotency of Natural men, to do any thing towards their
own Conversion, <hi>Pag.</hi> 262. 36. He is the <hi>only</hi> Child of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who in
the purity of his heart obeyeth <hi>those</hi> substantial Laws, that are by God imposed
upon him, <hi>Pag.</hi> 283. 37. There is NO Duty more affectionately commanded
in the Gospel, then <hi>that</hi> of Alms-giving, <hi>Pag.</hi> 284. 38. It is impossible we
should not have the design of Christianity accomplished in us, &amp;c. if we make our
Saviours most excellent life the Pattern of our lives, <hi>Pag.</hi> 296. 39. To do
well is better then <hi>believing, Pag.</hi> 299. 40. To be imitators of Christ's
Righteousness even of the Righteousness we should rely on, is counted by Mr. <hi>Fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
more</hi> noble, then to rely thereon, or trust thereto, <hi>Pag.</hi> 300.</p>

evade me by saying, the Graces of the Spirit of God are pure:

of Soul, and the holiness we lost in</hi> Adam, things a great way
off from the Spirit of Grace, or the gracious workings of the
Spirit. You talk indeed of a <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Godlike</hi> Nature,
but this is still the <hi>same</hi> with your pure <hi>humane Nature,</hi> or with
your <hi>sound</hi> Complexion, or <hi>habit</hi> of Soul; and so must either
respect man, as he was Created in the Image or likeness of

But it must be concluded, that the Divine Nature
<hi>you</hi> talk of, is that, and no other <hi>then the dictates of the humane
Nature,</hi> or your feigned <hi>purity</hi> thereof; because you make it
by your words the self same; <hi>it is the purity of the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

Mouth is full of Cursing and Bitterness; their feet are swift to shed
Blood, destruction and misery are in their ways, and the way of
Peace they have not known, there is no fear of God before their Eyes.</hi>
I the rather give you this of <hi>Paul,</hi> then any of my own; because
it is the <hi>soundest</hi> complexion of Soul, that the Holy Ghost him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<hi>could</hi> draw. Here is now no purity of the humane Nature,
nor such sound complexion of Soul as can keep it self from mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with that which is contrary to itself. And note, that this
is the state of all men, and that as they stand on themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God; Wherefore <hi>together,</hi> even <hi>altogether,</hi> all the men
in the World, take them in their most pure naturals, or with
all the purity of humanity, which they can make, and <hi>together,</hi>
they <hi>still</hi> will be <hi>unprofitable,</hi> and so must come short of doing
good, <hi>that every mouth might be stopped, and all the World become
guilty before God,</hi> ver. 19.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>But proceeding, you say, that this complexion</hi> is so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
as to keep his supreme faculty <hi>(I suppose you mean the
Conscience)</hi> in its Throne, and that brings into due subjection
all his inferiour ones as namely his sensual imagination, bruitish
passions and affections.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> These words suppose that it is within the power of a
mans own Soul, always to keep sin out of it self, and so guilt
out of the Conscience; albeit the Scripture saith, that both the
mind and it are defiled with the filth of sin, in all whoever do
not believe the Gospel,<note place="margin">Tit. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

2. They suppose that <hi>this</hi> Conscience is perfectly clear and
light, when the Scriptures say they have the understanding
darkened; yea and farther, in despite of these your sayings of
the sound complexion of Soul, of the purity of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and of this supreme faculty, the Scriptures teach,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>that
man in his best estate is altogether vanity,</hi>

            <p>Yea, <hi>say you,</hi> this sound complexion brings into due subjection
all his inferiour ones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Here seems to be a contradiction to the former part
of this description, yea, to the Nature of the Soul it self; for
you say; before it suffereth not any thing unnatural to mix it
self therewith, when yet here you seem to suggest that part,
I say, even <hi>part of it self</hi> is disobedient and rebellious; <hi>It brings
into subjection all his inferiour ones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It</hi> brings into <hi>due</hi> subjection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. Due subjection</hi> is such as is everlasting, universal,
perfect in Nature, kind and manner, such as the most righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
perfect, comprehensive Law, or Commandment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
object against, or find fault therewith. Here's a Soul!
here's a pure humane Nature! here are pure dictates of a

thing in any, man in this world, as a <hi>purity of humane Nature:
we are all an unclean thing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 64: 6<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Job 15. 14<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

               <hi>and who can bring a clean thing out of

clean? or he that is born of a Woman, that he should be holy?</hi>
These are therefore expressions without the Testimony of the
Word, arising from your own phantasie.</p>
            <p>It is a Divine or Godlike Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus you seem allso to fetch from the similitude or
likeness of God that was in us at out first Creation, before we
sinned; but that similitude being at best but Created, and
since most unspeakably defiled, defaced and polluted with sin;
there is now, no not in the best of men, as men, any smiles,


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:32067:9"/>
likeness and similitude of God to be found, no such <hi>petty</hi> Divine
or Godlike Nature to be found, as you magine.</p>
            <p>But having thus stated your holiness in its Nature and
essence, you come in the next place to tell us, under what
considerations it moveth a person to act, also by what Rules and
Laws it squareth its acts and doings.</p>
            <p>First by or under what considerations it acts, and these you
scatter here and there in this your description of holiness, under
these heads.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>To act as becomes a Creature indued with a principle of
reason,</hi> eyeing the state or place in which God hath set him;
approving of, affecting and complying with the Eternal Laws
of righteousness, <hi>Pag.</hi> 6. which eternal Laws in <hi>Page</hi> 8. you
call the Divine moral Laws, <hi>those that were first written in the
hearts of men, and originally the dictates of humane Nature,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To do these, <hi>from truly generous Motives and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
Page</hi> 7. such as these.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Because it is most highly becoming all reasonable Creatures</hi>
(you might also have added, and those unreasonable) <hi>to
obey God in every thing</hi> (within their Spheres) <hi>and as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming
them to disobey him, Page</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>2. Because it is a base thing to do unjustly, <hi>Page</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>Now a little to touch upon all these, and then to proceed to
what is behind.</p>
            <p>First, To act and do the things of the moral Law, but as
<hi>Creatures indued with a Principle of Reason,</hi> is but to do things
in our Sphere as Men, as the Beast, the Hog or Horse doth
things in his, as a Beast which is at best, if it could be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
to act but as pure naturals, which state of man is of
at infinite distance from that, in which it is by God expected,
the man must act, that doth ought that is pleasing in his fight.
For</p>
            <p>First, The qualification and consideration by you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
is that which is in <hi>all</hi> men, in men simply as men,
they being reasonable Creatures, and somewhat, though
qut somewhat capable of acting as such.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This qualification is not only <hi>in,</hi> but <hi>of</hi> men;
<hi>reason</hi> is of the Man <hi>himself,</hi> even that which is as <hi>essential</hi> to
him, as is <hi>that</hi> of his being Created or made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:32067:9"/>
Thirdly, The Law also, which <hi>you</hi> call <hi>Divine,</hi> Moral and
Eternal is that which is <hi>naturally</hi> seated in the Heart, and as
you your self express it, <hi>is originally the Dictates of humane
Nature,</hi> or that which Mankind <hi>doth naturally assent to,</hi>
Page 11.</p>
            <p>Now I say, that a man cannot by these Principles, and
these qualifications, please the God of Heaven, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Because</hi> none of these <hi>are</hi> Faith, but without Faith it is
impossible to please him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</p>
            <p>2. Because none of these is the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> but there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
accepted of God, under a New Testament considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but those which are the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The</hi> Man <hi>and</hi> Principles <hi>you have stated, may be such as
are utterly Ignorant of Jesus Christ, and of all his New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
things as</hi> such: But the Natural man receiveth not the
things of the Spirit of God <hi>(the things of his New Testament)</hi>
for they are foolishness to him, neither can he know them, because
they are Spiritually discerned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 24.</p>
            <p>4. Your qualifications and considerations, know nothing
at all of the <hi>adoption of Sons,</hi> and of our <hi>acting</hi> and <hi>doing</hi> our
<hi>Duty,</hi> as <hi>such.</hi> You only content your self to rest within the
confines of the humane Nature, acts of reason, as men or
Creatures only, or in their supposed <hi>pure, natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Sir, a little by way of digression; I will tell you also
of our truly Christian righteousness, both as to its <hi>original</hi> or
<hi>first</hi> Principle, and also <hi>how,</hi> or under <hi>what capacity</hi> it puts the
Person that is acted by it.</p>
            <p>First, The Principle which is laid within us, it is not the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the humane Nature,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> 
               <hi>but of the Holy Ghost it self,</hi> which
we have of God received, by believing in the Son of God, a
principle as far above yours of Humanity, as is the Heavens
above the Earth; yours being but like those of the first <hi>Adam,</hi>
but ours truly those of the second. <hi>As is the Earthly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>such
are those that are Earthly; and as is the Heavenly, such are those
that are Heavenly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now whosoever hath not this Principle, although he be a
Creature, and also have <hi>the Dictates</hi> of the humane Nature,
yea, and also follows them, yet he is not Christs: <hi>If any man


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:32067:10"/>
have not the Spirit of Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>he is none of his.</hi> Thus therefore
is the Christian Principle, another from, and far above your
Heathenish Pagan one. By <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> is Spirit is the Christian qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
with Principles, not N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ural, but Spiritual, such as
Faith, Hope, Joy, Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are the fruits of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of the forgiveness of sins, freely by Grace, <hi>though the
Redemption that it in Jesus Christ</hi> In this Spirit and Faith we
walk,<note place="margin">Gal: 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>5:</note> by this Spirit we are led, even into the Joy and Peace of
the New Testament of our Lord;<note place="margin">Rom: 8. 14:</note> wherefore our Holy Actions
are the fruits of Righteousness, <hi>that is by Jesus Christ,</hi> not by
our humane Nature, or the purity of it in us; yea, they are the
fruits of the Spirit of God, the qualifications that attend the
new Covenant, and those that by the work of regeneration
are brought within the bounds and Priviledges thereof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</p>
            <p>Secondly, The capacity that we are in, who act and do from
the Heavenly Principle; it is <hi>that of Sons,</hi> the Sons of God <hi>by
adoption,</hi> as the Apostle said; <hi>Because ye are Sons, God hath
sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Rom: 8:</note> 
               <hi>crying, Abba
Father.</hi> And again, <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God
they are the Sons of God.</hi> This is a far other then is your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
description of acting as a Creature, indued with a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Reason; for here is a man acts as a Son, indued with
the Holy Spirit of God, who hath before the World, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated
him <hi>to this Estate, by Jesus Christ to himself,</hi>
As a Son therefore,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 4, 4<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> the Christian acts and does, because he is
indued with that high and heavenly Principle, mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
by which Principle this man hath received a <hi>new</hi> Heart, a
<hi>new</hi> Spirit, a <hi>new</hi> understanding, a <hi>good</hi> Conscience, so made by
<hi>Faith in the blood of the Lord Jesus:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> Thus being made again anew,
and <hi>another</hi> man;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 14, 15, 16.</note> he acts from a <hi>new,</hi> and another Principle
then yours; a Principle as far beyond, and above you, as is a
<hi>Man</hi> above a <hi>Bruit,</hi> and as is Grace above Nature.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, As the Christian acts &amp; does from a better Principle,
and under a better capacity or consideration then that you have
described; so (to allude to your own notion) the first Principles
by which they receive this Spirit and Adoption, are not those
Principles of Morals, or those originally dictates of humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
but it is through the <hi>hearing of Faith, Gal.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3. by
which we understand, that the Son of God became a Man,


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:32067:10"/>
dyed for our sins, hath saved us from the curse of God, and
accounted us to be the righteousness of God <hi>in him;</hi> this being
<hi>heard</hi> with the Gospel, and a new-Testament-<hi>hearing,</hi> the Holy
Ghost forthwith possesseth us, by the glorious working where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we are helped through the Son, to call the God of Heaven,
<hi>our Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now thus being made <hi>free</hi> from sin, by the only Faith of
Jesus Christ, <hi>we have our fruit unto holiness, and the end ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom: 6. 22</note>
            </p>
            <p>And here come in those reasonable conclusions, which you
would make the very radicals of Christianity, they being only
remote, and after conclusions, drawn from the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Mercy of God, <hi>viz.</hi> from predestination, Calling, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and Justification by Christs Blood,<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 22, 2<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>while we in our selves,
are sinner</hi>s. I say these are the things which <hi>Paul</hi> endeavored
to provoke the <hi>Romans, Philippians</hi> and <hi>Colossians</hi> to an Holy
Conversation by.</p>
            <p>1. To the <hi>Romans, I beseech you therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>by the
Mercies of God;</hi> (What Mercies? Why those of Election, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
Calling, Justification, and Adoption mentioned in
the foregoing Chapters) <hi>that you present your Bodies a living
Sacrifice, Holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
Rev. 12. 1.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>To the</hi> Philippians, If there be therefore any consolation in
Christ, if any Comfort of Love, if any fellowship of the Spirit,
if any Bowels and Mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like
minded, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 1.</p>
            <p>3. To the <hi>Colossians, If you be risen with Christ, seek those
things that are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of
God; set your affections on things above, not on things of the
Earth; for you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God,
when Christ who is our life shall appear, then shall ye also appear
with him in Glory.</hi> Now mark; mortifie therefore, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore!
wherefore? why, because they were risen with Christ;
because they should appear at the end of this World with
Christ himself in Glory; therefore mortifie the deeds of the
Body, or our Members that are upon the Earth, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:32067:11"/>
These Sir are the Motives by which we Christians act; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are <hi>forgiven,</hi> because we are <hi>Sons,</hi> and if Sons,
then Heirs, and so we act; but to speak to this more
anon.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will say I deal not fairly with you, because
you treat, as of moral, so of Gospel or New Testament
Laws.</p>
            <p>But to that I will answer at present, that in this description
of your Holy Principle, which is the Foundation of your
Book, whether the Laws be Natural or Spiritual, moral or of
Grace, the Principle by which you do them, is no other then
the Principle of Nature, <hi>the dictates of the humane Nature;</hi>
and so such as can by no means reach the Doctrines of the
Gospel any farther then to make a Judgment of them, by that
wisdom which is <hi>enmity with God,</hi> as will farther be seen in my
progress through your Book.</p>
            <p>Indeed you make mention of Divine Laws, and that under
two Heads.</p>
            <p>1. Such as are of an indispensible and Eternal Obligation, as
those purely moral.</p>
            <p>2. Such which you call positive precepts, in themselves of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Nature, and absolutely considered are neither good nor
evil. <hi>Of those of this kind that we have under the Gospel,
you say you know but three,</hi> viz, That of coming to God by
Christ, and the Institutions of Baptism and the Lords Supper.
<hi>Page</hi> 7 <hi>and Page</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>So then, although you talk of Gospel positive Laws, and
particularly that <hi>of coming to God by Christ;</hi> yet those which
you call first Principles of Morals, are of higher concern with
you, and more indispensible by far then this, this being a thing
of an indifferent Nature, and in it self absolutely considered,
is neither good nor evil; but the other is the life of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But a little to gather you up.</p>
            <p>The Morals, say you, are indispensible, and good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
<hi>but that of coming to God by Christ, a thing indifferent,
and in it self neither good nor evil.</hi> Wherefore though in this
your description, you talk of confirming to all those good and
practical Principles, that are made known either by Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Nature, or the use of Reason, yet in this your obedience
you reckon <hi>coming to God by Christ,</hi> but an act of a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:32067:11"/>
Nature, a thing if done <hi>not good in it self,</hi> neither evil
in it self, should a man leave it undone; and so consequently
a man may have in him the ground and essentials of Christianity
without; it may be saved, and go to Heaven without it: for
this I say, whatsoever is of an indifferent Nature in it self, is
not essential to the Christian Religion; but may or may not
be done without the hazard of Eternal Salvation; but say you,
this of coming to God by Christ, is one of the positive precepts,
<hi>Page</hi> 9. which are in themselves things indifferent, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good nor evil: therefore not of the substance of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
            <p>But Sir, <hi>where learned you this new Doctrine,</hi> as to reckon
coming to God by Christ, a thing of so indifferent a Nature,
a thing not good in it self, but with <hi>respect to certain Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi>
Page 7. Had you said this of Baptism and the Supper
of the Lord; I could with some allowance have born your
words, but to count coming to God by Christ a thing iudiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in it self, is a blasphemy that may not be born by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
it being too high a contempt of the Blood, and too great
a disgrace to the Person of the Lord, the King of Glory, of
which more hereafter, but to return.</p>
            <p>The intent of this your description is to set before us these
two things.</p>
            <p>1. What are the essentials of the Rule of that Holiness, which
by the Gospel we are immediately obliged to, if we would be
justified in the sight of God.</p>
            <p>2. What are the principles by which we act, when we do
these works aright.</p>
            <p>For the first you tell us, <hi>they are the first Principles of Morals, such
as are self evident, and therefore not capable of being properly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated;
as being no less knowable, and easily assented to, then any
proposition that may be brought for the proof of them,</hi> Page 8. Such
as are self-evident or evident of themselves; to what? To us
as men that know the Principles of Reason, and that are as
easily assented to as any proposition; such as may be as easily
known, as we know there is a day or night, Winter and Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
or any other thing that may be brought for the proof
of them. This Law therefore is none other, then that mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. which is the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>our</hi> Nature, or <hi>that</hi>
which was implanted in us in the day of our <hi>Creation,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:32067:12"/>
is said to be <hi>our selves,</hi> even <hi>Nature it self,</hi> 1 Cor.
11. 14.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Principle, say you, by which we act, and in
the strength of which we do this Law, it is the Principle of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or a reasonable compliance with this Law written in our
Hearts, and originally dictates of humane Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which
certain Principle, say you, is this, <hi>To count it most highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
all reasonable Creatures, to obey God in every thing
and as much disbecoming them, in any thing to disobey him,</hi>
Page 8.</p>
            <p>The sum is; this your Holiness both in root and act is no
other then what is common to all the men on Earth; I mean
so common as that for the first, is in <hi>their</hi> Nature, as the second
is also part of <hi>themselves,</hi> they being Creatures whose prime
or principal distinction from other, consisteth in that they are
<hi>reasonable,</hi> and such as have reason as a thing <hi>essential</hi> to them;
wherefore the excellency that you have discoursed of, is none
other then the excellency and goodness that is of this World,
such as in the first Principles of it is common to Heathens, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
Turks, Infidels: and that as evidently dictates to those
that have not heard the Gospel (I mean as to the Nature the
good and evil) as it doth in them that sit under the sound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and is the self same which our late ungodly Heriticks the
Quakers have made such a stir to promote and exal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>, only in
the description thereof you seem more ingenious then they:
for whereas they erroniously call it Christ, the light of Christ,
Faith, Grace, Hope, the Spirit, the Word that is nigh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you
give it the names due thereto, <hi>viz. A complexion or complicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and combination of all the virtue of the Soul, the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the dictates of it, the Principles of reason, such as are self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident,
than which there is nothing Mankind doth naturally
assent to,</hi> Page 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. only here as I have said, you
glorifie your errors also, with Names any Titles that are not to
be found, but in your own deluded Brains: As that the virtues
of the Souls can keep themselves <hi>incommixed,</hi> that there is yet
in us the <hi>purity</hi> of the humane Nature, of <hi>such</hi> a disposition,
that can both by light and power give a man to see, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
incline him to, and bring him under the government of
all those good and practical principles, that are made known
either by Revelation, Nature, or the use of Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:32067:12"/>
But I say, these principles thus stated by you, being the
principles, and the goodness of this World, and such as have
not faith, but the law, not the holy Ghost, but humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in them; they cannot be those which you affirm, was
or is the design, the great, the only, and ultimate design of
Christ, or his Gospel to promote, and propagate in the
World; neither with respect to our justification before God
from the curse; neither with respect to the workings of his
Spirit, and the faith of Jesus in our hearts, the true Gospel or
evangelical Holiness.</p>
            <p>First, It is not the righteousness that justifieth us <hi>before
God</hi> from the curse; because it is that which is properly <hi>our
own;</hi> and acted and managed by principles of <hi>our own,</hi> arising
originally in the roots of it, from <hi>our own.</hi> There is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Men, and the righteousness of God: that which
is the righteousness of Men, is that which we do work from
matter and principles of <hi>our own;</hi> but that which is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of God, is that which is wrought from matter and
principles purely Divine, and of the Nature of God. Again,
that which is our own righteousness, is that which is wrought
in and by <hi>our own persons as Men;</hi> but that which is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of God, is that which is wrought in and by the second
person in the Trinity, <hi>as God and Man</hi> in one person; and
that resideth onely in that person of the Son. I speak
now of the righteousness by which we stand just before God,
from the curse of the Law. Now this righteousness of ours,
<hi>our own</hi> righteousness, the Apostle always opposeth to the
righteousness of God, saying, <hi>They going about to establish
their OWN righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the
righteousness of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 19. 3.</note> Farther, This righteousness of <hi>our own,</hi>
Paul counts <hi>loss</hi> and <hi>dogs-meat,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 37, 8.</note>
in comparison of that other,
far more glorious righteousness, which he calleth as it is in
truth, <hi>the righteousness of God,</hi> which as I said but now, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideth
in the person of the Son.</hi> Therefore saith <hi>Paul,</hi> I cast
away my own righteousness, <hi>and do count it loss, and but dung,
that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having my own
righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the
faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith.</hi> The
righteousness therefore, that is <hi>our own,</hi> that ariseth from mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and principles of <hi>our own,</hi> (such as that which you have


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:32067:13"/>
described) justifieth us not <hi>before God</hi> from the curse.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The righteousness that you have described, jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth
us not, as before, because it is the righteousness which
is of the moral law, that is, it is wrought by us, as walking
in the law. Now it mattereth not, whether you respect the
law in its first principles, or as it is revealed in the table of the
ten Commandments, they are in nature but one, and the same,
and their substance and matter is written in our Hearts, as we
are Men. Now this righteousness, the Apostle casteth away,
as was shewed before; not having mine own righteousness,
(saith he) <hi>which is of the law;</hi> why? Because the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>aveth us from the wrath of God, is the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God; and so a righteousness that is without the law.
<hi>But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifest,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 21, 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
witnessed by the law and the prophets, even the righteousness
of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon
all them that believe.</hi> Rom. 3. The righteousness of God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the law; the righteousness of Christ who is naturally
God; wherefore such a righteousness, as was accomplished
by him, that was Lord, and the very God of the law; whose
nature was infinite, and not that which the law could command
or condemn; neither was the command of the law, the great
and principal argument with him, no, not in its first and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
principles, to do or continue to do it; but even that which
the law commanded of us, that he did, <hi>not by the law,</hi> but by
<hi>that spirit</hi> of life, that eternal Spirit, and God-head, which
was essential to his very being: He did naturally and infinitely
that which the law required of us, from higher, and more
mighty principles then the law could require of him: for I
should reckon it a piece of prodigious blasphemy, to say, that
the Law could command his God, the Creature, his Lord and
Creator: but this Lord God, Jesus Christ, even he hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
righteousness, even righteousness that is without,
that is above, higher, and better then that of the Law: and
that is the righteousness that is given to, and put upon all them
that believe. Wherefore the Lord Jesus Christ, in his most
blessed life, was neither prompted to actions of holiness, nor
managed in them, by the purity of humane nature, or those
you call first principles of morals, or as he was simply a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Creature; but being the natural Son of God, truly,


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:32067:13"/>
and essentially, eternal as the Father; by the eternal Spirit,
his God-head, was his man-hood governed, and acted, and
spirited to do and suffer.<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> 
               <hi>He through the eternal spirit offered
himself without spot to God;</hi> which offering respects not onely
his act of dying, but also that by which he was capacitated to
dye without spot in his sight; which was the infinite Dignity,
and Sinlessness of his person; and the perfect justice of his
Actions. Now this person, thus acting, is approved of, or
justified by the Law to be good: for if the righteousness of
the Law be good, which Law is but a creature, the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Lord, the God of this Law, must needs be much
more good; wherefore here is the Law, and its perfection
swallowed up, even as the light of a Candle, or Star is swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up by the light of the Sun. Thus then is the believer
made, not the righteousness of the Law, <hi>but the righteousness
of God in Christ;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> because Christ Jesus who is the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Christian, did walk in this world, in, and under
the Law; not by legal and humane principles, which are the
excellencies of men, but in, and by those that are divine, even
such as were, and are of his own nature, and the essence of
his eternal God-head. This is the righteousness <hi>without</hi> the
Law, accomplished by a person, and principles, far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
then is he, or those you make description of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
yours cannot be that, by which we stand just before the
justice of God <hi>without</hi> the Law; Now if it be a righteousness
<hi>without</hi> the Law, then it is a righteousness <hi>without</hi> Men, a
righteousness that cannot be found in the World; For take
away the Law, the rule, and you take away, not onely the
righteousness, but that by which men, as men, work righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
in the World: <hi>Mine own righteousness which is of the
Law.</hi> The righteousness then by which a man must stand just
in the sight of God from the curse, is not to be found in men,
nor in the Law, but in him, and him onely, who is greater,
and also, <hi>without the Law;</hi> For albeit, for our sakes he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
under the Law. even to the curse and displeasure of God;
yet the principles by which he walked in the World to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
they were neither humane, nor legal, but heavenly,
and done in the Spirit of the Son: Wherefore it is not the
righteousness you have described, by which we stand just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:32067:14"/>
Thirdly, The righteousness you have described, cannot
be that which justifieth us before God, because of its imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and that both with respect to the principle, and
the power with which it is managed: For though you have
talked of a sound complexion of Soul, the purity of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, and that with this addition of power, as to be
able to keep it self incommixt with that which is not of it self;
yet we Christians know, and that by the words of God, that
there is in man, as man, now no soundness at all, but from
the <hi>crown of the head, to the sole of the foot, Botches, and Boyls,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 1. 6.</note>
               <hi>Putrifactions, and Sores. We are ALL an unclean thing; and
our righteousness, as filthy vlcerous raggs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 64. 6.</note> 
               <hi>If there had been a
Law given that could have given life, verily,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 21.</note> 
               <hi>righteousness should
have been by the Law.</hi> Could a man perform the Law to the
liking of the justice of the eternal majesty, then would the
Law give life to that man; but because of the perfection of
an infinite justice, and the weakness and unprofitableness of
the Law through our flesh,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3,</note> therefore, though you speak yet
farther of the excellency of your sound complexion, and of
the purity of the humane nature, you must flie from your
self, to another righteousness for life, or at the last stick
in the jaws of Death and everlasting Desperation. <hi>For
by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified.</hi> Gal.
2. 16.</p>
            <p>It is therefore no better then error, thus to ascribe to poor
man, <hi>that hath drunk iniquity like water,</hi> a soundness of soul,
a purity of humane nature. Wherefore <hi>Jude</hi> saith of you,
and of all such naturalists, <hi>That even in the things that you
know naturally, as the bruit, in them you corrupt your selves.</hi>
Jude 10. even in the very principles, the first or original di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
of your nature, or humanity. There is none that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth
or is good, therefore there is none that doth good,
<hi>no not one:</hi> that is, none as continuing in a natural state;
none by the power or principles of nature; for he meaneth
here, in your own sense, as men by natural principles have to
do with the justice of the Law.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The righteousness which you have described,
cannot be that which justifieth us before God, because it is
that which is not of faith. <hi>The Law is not of faith, but the
man that doth them shall live in them.</hi> Gal. 3. The Apostle also


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:32067:14"/>
in the 10<hi>th. Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> tells us, that the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that is compleated by doing the Law is one, and another,
besides the righteousness of faith. For faith in the justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a sinner from the curse and wrath of God, respecteth
onely the mercy of God, and forgiveness of sins for the sake
of Christ. <hi>God for Christs sake hath forgiven him, that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to believe, that is, trust to, and venture the eternal concern
of his soul upon the righteousness that is no where to be found, but
in the person of the Son of God.</hi> For there is justice more then
answerable to all the demands of the Law, and the requirements
of the eternal justice of God, and he is our justice; He is made
unto us of God, righteousness, or justice; that is the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or justice that is in him; is by God accounted the mans
that shall accept thereof by faith, that he might be made the
justice or righteousness of God in him. For the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that saveth a sinner from damnation, must be equal to that
in the eternal Deity: but where can that be found but in him
that is naturally God, as is indeed the Son of the Father; in
him therefore, and not in the Law, there is a righteousness
fit for faith to apply to. Besides, the Law is not, neither can
be the object of faith to men; for that which is the object of
faith (I speak now as to justifying righteousness) it must be a
righteousness already compleated, and as I said, a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to be received, and accepted, being now perfected and
offered, and given to us by the kindness and mercy of God:
but a man may believe long enough in the Law, before that
performs for him a perfect righteousness. The Law can work
nothing unless it be wrath. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. No thou must <hi>work BY,</hi>
and not <hi>believe IN</hi> the Law. Besides, all that cometh out of the
mouth of the Law is,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in every
thing which is written in the book of the Law to do them;</hi> which no
man is capable of doing, so as to escape the curse by doing,
that hath once, or first transgressed the same. Wherefore it
is a vain thing, yea an horrible wickedness in you, thus to
abuse the Law, and the weakne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s of man, by suggesting that
the onely, the ultimate, or grand design of Christ Jesus was,
or is, the <hi>promoting of a righteousness by the Law,</hi> that is
performed by humane principles in us.</p>
            <p>I could double, yea ten times double the number of these
arguments against you, but I will pass from this to the second


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:32067:15"/>
               <hi>thing. The righteousness you have described, is not the true Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
inward holiness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I told you before, that the principles which you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
are not evangelical principles; and now I will adde,
that as they are not such in themselves, so neither do they
fetch in, or obtain by our adhering to them, those things
which alone can make, or work in the Soul, those truly Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
inward acts of holiness.</p>
            <p>There are three things which are essential to the inward
Gospel holiness; of which as your description is utterly desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
so, neither can they by that be obtained, or come into
the heart.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The holy Ghost.</item>
               <item>2. Faith in Christ.</item>
               <item>3. A new Heart, and a new Spirit.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Without these three, there is no such things as Gospel holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in Man, as before I have also hinted at. But now as there
is none of these three found in your discription of inward Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness;
so neither can you, or other, by all your inclinations,
either to those you call first principles of natural reason, or
the dictates of humane nature, obtain or fetch into the Soul,
the least dram of that which is essential, to that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
according to the Gospel description of inward Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
holiness: as will further be manifest in this that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
            <p>1. The holy Ghost is not obtained by your description, that
consisting only in principles of Nature, and in putting forth
it self in acts of Civility and Morality. When the Apostle
would convince the bewitched <hi>Galathians,</hi> that your Doctrine
which was also the Doctrine of the false Apostles, was that,
which instead of helping forward, did hinder, and pervert
the Gospel of Christ; he applieth himself to them in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
<hi>This onely would I learn of you;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Received you the Spirit
by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> By the
works of the Law, that is, by putting of your principles into
practice, Nay, may I not adde, by putting of your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
into practice, by a more bright, and clear rule, then in
the beginning of your description is inserted by you; for the
Law as written and engraven in stones, with the addition of all
the Mosaical precepts,<note place="margin">Rom. 3: 1, 2, 3.</note> was a more ample, and full discovery of


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:32067:15"/>
the mind of God, then can be obtained by your virtues of
Soul, your purity of humane nature, or the first principles
of morals, as they are written in the heart of man; and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
dictates of humane nature. Yet by these, by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these, by labouring to live up to the light of these, their
own experience told them, that they neither could, nor did
obtain the enjoyment of the holy Ghost; but that rather their
now declining the word of Faith, by which indeed they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it at first (whatever pretences of holiness, and godliness
were the arguments to prevail with them so to do) was
in truth none other but the very witch-craft, and inchantments
of the Devil.</p>
            <p>Farther, The Apostle sets this your Spirit and Principles;
and that which indeed is the Spirit of God, in aline <hi>Diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi>
opposite one against another; yea the receiving of the
one, opposeth the receiving of the other. <hi>Now we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi>
saith he, <hi>NOT the Spirit of the World</hi> (that is, your
Spirit, and principles of humanity) to walk by it, or live in
it; <hi>but the Spirit which is of God, that we may know the things
that are freely given us of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 12. But what is the
Spirit of the World? He tells us in the verse before, it is the
Spirit of a man; <hi>which Solomon calls, the Candle of the Lord;</hi>
that which searcheth all the inward parts of the Belly. <hi>Prov.</hi>
20. 27. by humane principles, good motions to moral duties,
workings of reason, dictates of nature to obey God as Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.
These things flow from the <hi>Spirit of a man,</hi> which is
the Spirit of <hi>all the World.</hi> They that preach, or speak by this
Spirit; they preach or speak <hi>of the World,</hi> of the virtues of
the World;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 5.</note> and the World, <hi>the whole World heareth them,</hi> or
know in themselves what they say.</p>
            <p>Now when this Spirit is received, imbraced and followed,
as the Spirit <hi>that is of God,</hi> then it must be branded with the
mark of the Spirit of error, and of Antichrist; because the
act in so doing, is most wicked; yea, and Christ himself is made
head against, by it.</p>
            <p>But I say, the holy Ghost is not obtained by these principles,
nor by the pursuit of them.</p>
            <p>2. Faith is not obtained by the pursuit of your principle;
but by hearing of another doctrine, He that presseth men to
look to, and live by the purity of humane nature, principles


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:32067:16"/>
of natural reason, or by the Law, <hi>as written in the heart, or
Bible;</hi> he sets the word of Faith <hi>out of the World;</hi> for these
doctrines are as opposite, as the Spirits I spake of before;
For <hi>Moses describeth the righteousness that is of the Law, that
the man that doth these things shall live by them.</hi> Now he that
receiveth this Law, to do, and live by; he hath set up, and is
in pursuit of a doctrine of another nature, then that which is
called the righteousness of faith; that being such, as for jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d deliverance from the curse, maketh no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at all of hearing the Law, or of doing good works; but
of hearing of the mercy of God, as extended to sinners; and
of its coming to us through the death, and resurrection of
Christ Jesus. <hi>The righteousness which is of Faith, speaketh on
this wise; say not in thine heart, who shall ascend into Heaven
(that is to bring Christ down from above) or who shall descend
into the deep, (that is to bring up Christ again from the dead) but
what saith it? The word is nig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h thee, even in thy mouth, and in
thy heart; that is the word of faith which we preach; That if

                  </gap>uth the Lord Jesus; and shall believe
in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt
be saved.</hi> Rom. 10. 5<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 9. This <hi>then</hi> is the doctrine of faith;
or the righteousness with which faith hath to do. Now as old
covenant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> works, are begotten in men <hi>by the doctrine of works;</hi>
so faith is begotten <hi>by the doctrine of faith.</hi> Therefore after he
had said, <hi>faith cometh by hearing;</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e insinuates it to be the
hearing the preaching of the Gospel of peace (peace by the
blood of the cross) and the glad tidings of good things, (<hi>ver.</hi>
14, 15, 16, 17.) of good things promised for the sake of the
Lord Jesus; not for the sake of good deeds done of us, by
humane principles, or the dictates of our nature.</p>
            <p>Faith, Then the second essential, comes into the heart, not
by the preaching, or the practice of your principles; but by
another, a higher, and far more heavenly doctrine. And
hence the Apostle compleatly puts the difference betwixt the
worker of good works in the Spirit of the Law; and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
that taketh hold of grace by Christ, that he may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thereby. The one he calls <hi>Them that are of the works of the
Law:</hi> the other,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> 
               <hi>They which are of Faith.</hi> This being done,
he tells us, that as they differ in the principles, to wit, of
Faith; and Works, so they shall differ in conclusion: <hi>For the


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:32067:16"/>
Law is not of faith; the promise is onely made to faith,
therefore they onely that are of faith, are blessed with faithful</hi>
Abraham.</p>
            <p>3. The third essential is, <hi>a new Heart,</hi> and <hi>a new Spirit</hi> or
<hi>mind,</hi> and this also comes not by your principle, that being
but the old covenant that gendreth to bondage, and that holds its
<hi>Ismaels</hi> under the curse for ever: there comes no new heart
by the Law, nor new Spirit. It is by the new Covenant, even
the Gospel, that all things are made now. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. <hi>Ezek.</hi>
36. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p>The Apostle after a large discourse of the two ministrations,
and their excellencies. (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.) tell us that the heart is
nothing changed, so long as it abideth in the works of the
Law; but remaineth blind, and ignorant; Nevertheless, saith
he, <hi>when it shall turn</hi> (from the Law) <hi>to the Lord, the vail shall
be taken away.</hi> But what is it to turn (from the Law) to the
Lord? Why even to leave, and forsake your Spirit, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
and works from those principles; and flie to the grace,
and merits; <hi>the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Now when the
heart is turned to Christ, then the vail of <hi>Moses</hi> is taken off;
wherefore then the soul <hi>with OPEN face, beholding as in a
glass the glory of the Lord, is changed from glory to glory, even
as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> 2 C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ct.</hi> But it seems a paradox to many, That a man should
live to the Law, that is devote himself to the works of the ten
Commandments, the most perfect rule of life; and yet not
be counted one changed, or new.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Though it seemeth an untruth, yet it is most true;
That by the works of the Law, no heart is made new, no man
made new. A man from principle of nature, and reason,
(which principles are of himself, and as old) may give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the goodness of the Law: Yet these principles are so
far off from being new, that they are as old as <hi>Adam</hi> in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise;
and come into the world with all the children of men.
To which principles the Law, or the first principles of morals,
so equally suit, that as you have said, page 8. <hi>they are self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident;
then which there is nothing ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>th more naturally
assent unto,</hi> page 11. Now Nature is no new principle, but an
old; even our own, and of our selves. The Law is no new


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32067:17"/>
principle, but old, and one with our selves (as also you well
have called it) <hi>first written in mens hearts, and originally dictates
of humane nature.</hi> Let a man then be as devout, as is possible
for the Law, and the holiness of the Law. Yet if the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
from which he acts; be but the habit of Soul, the purity
(as he feigns) of his own nature; principles of natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
or the dictates of humane nature; all this is nothing else
but the old Gentleman in his Holy-day-cloaths; the old
Heart, the old Spirit; the Spirit of the man, not the Spirit of
Christ is here.</p>
            <p>And hence the Apostle, when he would shew us a man
alive, or made a new man indeed; as he talketh of the holy
Ghost and faith, so he tells us such<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>are dead to the Law,</hi> to the
Law, as a Law of works; to the Law as to principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Wherefore my brethen you are also become dead to the Law</hi>
(the moral Law, and the ceremonial Law) <hi>by the body of Christ,
that you should be married to another</hi> (another then the Law)
<hi>even to him, who is raised from the dead, that we should bring
forth fruit unto God.</hi> Rom. 7. 4.</p>
            <p>Ye are become dead to the Law: dead to the Law! Why?
That you should be married to another: Married to another!
Why? <hi>That you should bring forth fruit unto God.</hi> But doth
not a man bring forth fruit unto God, that walketh orderly
according to the ten Commandments? NO, if he do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
faith in the Spirit of a man, by the dictates of humane
nature, respecting the Law, as that, by the obeying of which,
he must obtain acceptance with God. This is bringing forth
fruit unto himself; for all that he doth, he doth it as a man,
as a Creature, from principles natural, and of himself, his own
and for none other then himself; and therefore he serveth in
an old Spirit, the oldness of the letter, and for himself. But
now, (that is, <hi>ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> being dead to the Law, and married to Christ</hi>)
that (the Law) being dead; by which (while in our selves)
we were held; <hi>Now we are delivered from that law,</hi> both as to
its curse and impositions; as it stands a Law of works in the heart
of the world; we serve in newness of the Spirit, and not in
the oldness of the letter, <hi>v.</hi> 6. A man must first then, be
dead to your principles, both of nature, and the Law; if he
will serve in a new Spirit, if he would bring forth fruit unto
God. Wherefore your description of the principle of holiness


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:32067:17"/>
in man, and also the principles by which this holiness is put
forth by him into righteous acts; they are such as are altogether
void of the true essentials of inward Gospel-holiness, and
righteousness.</p>
            <p>But there is one, thing more in this description, or rather
effect thereof, which I shall also inquire into: And that is
saying, <hi>As it was the errand of Christ to effect our deliverance
out of that sinful state we had brought our selves into: so to put
us again into possession of that holiness which we HAD LOST.</hi>
page 12. The proof of this position is now your next busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
that is, if I understand your learning, the remaining
part of your book, which consisteth of well nigh 300 pages,
is spent for proof thereof; which I doubt not but effectually
to confute with less then 300 lines. Onely first by the way,
I would have my reader to take notice that in this last Clause.
[<hi>to put us again into possession of that holiness which we had lost</hi>]
is the sum of all this large description of his holiness in the
foregoing pages: that is, the holiness and righteousness that
Mr. <hi>Fowler</hi> hath been describing; and adds, that Christs
whole business when he came into the world was, as to effect
our deliverance from sin; <hi>so to put us again in possession of that
holiness which we had lost.</hi> The holiness therefore that here he
contendeth for, is that, and onely that which was in <hi>Adam</hi>
before the fall, which he lost by transgression; and we by
transgressing in him. A little therefore to inquire into this, if
perhaps his reader and mine, may come to a right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of things.</p>
            <p>First then, <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall, even in his best and most
sinless state, was but a pure natural man, consisting of body
and soul; these (to use your own terms) were his pure essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials:
In this mans heart,<note place="margin">page 11:</note> God also did write the Law; that
is, (as you term them) <hi>the first principles of morals.</hi> This
then was the state of <hi>Adam,</hi> he was a pure natural man;<note place="margin">page 8:</note> made
by God sinless; all the faculties of his Soul, and members of
his body were clean.<note place="margin">Eccle. 7:</note> 
               <hi>God made man upright.</hi> But he made
him not then a <hi>Spiritual man; The first</hi> Adam <hi>was made a living
Soul, howbeit that was not first which was Spiritual:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15:</note> 
               <hi>but that
which was natural, and afterwards that which is Spiritual. The
first man is of the earth, earthy.</hi> 1 Cor. 15<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> A living Soul he


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:32067:18"/>
was; yet but a <hi>natural man,</hi> even in his first and best estate:
but earthly, when compared to Christ; or with them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Christ. So then, the holiness of <hi>Adam in his last
estate,</hi> even that which he LOST, and we in him, it was
none other, then that which was natural, even the sinless-state
of a natural man. This holiness then was not of the nature of
that, which hath for its root the holy Ghost; for of that we
read not at all in him, he onely was indued with a <hi>living Soul;</hi>
his holiness then could not be Gospel, nor that which is a
branch of the second covenant: his acts of righteousness,
were not by the operations of the Spirit of Grace, but the
dictates of the Law in his own natural heart. But the Apostle
when he treateth of the Christian inherent holiness; first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
that in <hi>Adam,</hi> as earthly; he tells us, it is such as is
in Christ: <hi>As is the earthly, such are they, that are earthly;
and as is the heavenly such are they that are heavenly.</hi> Let then
those that are the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> in the state of nature as he,
though not so pure, and spotless as he, be reckoned to bear
his image and similitude: but let them that are the children of
Christ, though not so pure as he, bear the image and similitude
of Christ;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29.</note> 
               <hi>for they are conformable to the image of the Son of God.</hi>
The holiness therefore that was in <hi>Adam,</hi> being but that which
was natural, earthly, and not of the holy Ghost, cannot be that
which Christ came into the world to give us possession of.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Adam</hi> in his best, and most sinless state, was but
a type of figure:<note place="margin">Rom: 5. 14:</note> 
               <hi>The figure of him that was to come.</hi> A type
in what? A type or figure doubtless, in his sinless and holy
estate; a type and figure of the holiness of Christ: But if
Christ should come from heaven, to put us in possession of
this sinless holiness that was in <hi>Adam,</hi> or that we lost in him:
To what more would his work amount, then to put us into the
possession of a natural, figurative, shadowish, righteousness or
holiness. But this he never intended; therefore it is not the
possessing of his people with that holiness, that was the great
errand Christ came into the world upon.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The holiness and righteousness that was in (and
that we lost by) <hi>Adam</hi> before the fall; was such as stood in,
and was to be managed by his natural perfect compliance with
a covenant of works. For, <hi>Do not this sin and die,</hi> were the
terms that was from God to <hi>Adam.</hi> But Christ at his coming


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:32067:18"/>
brings in another, a better a blessed Covenant of Grace; and
likewise possesseth his Children, with the Holiness, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of that Covenant; Not with <hi>Adams</hi> heart nor <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
mind; but a <hi>new</hi> Heart, a <hi>new</hi> Spirit, a <hi>new</hi> Principle to
act by; and walk in a new Covenant. Therefore the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that was in <hi>Adam</hi> before, or that we lost in him by the
Fall, could not be the Holiness that Christ at his Coming
made it his great or onely business to put us in possession of.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Holiness that was in <hi>Adam</hi> before, and that
we lost in him by the Fall, was such as might stand with <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
ignorance of the Mediation of Jesus Christ:</hi> For Christ
was not made known to <hi>Adam</hi> as a Saviour, before that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
was a Sinner; neither needed he at all to know him to
be his Mediator, before he knew he had offended.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> But Christ
did not come-into the World to establish us in, or give us
possession of such Holiness as might stand with perfect Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his Mediatorship. No; The Holiness that we Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
have, and the righteous acts that we fulfil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 21, 22.</note> they
come to us,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 3.</note> and are done by us, through the knowledge of the
Lord Jesus, and of his being the Messias promised.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Holiness that was in <hi>Adam,</hi> was neither given
him <hi>through</hi> the <hi>Promise,</hi> neither encouraged <hi>by</hi> the <hi>Promise. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
had <hi>no</hi> promise to possess him with a Principle of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
it came to him by Creation: neither had he <hi>any promise</hi>
to strengthen or encourage him in Holiness. All he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>id was
<hi>Instructions</hi> concerning his Duty, and <hi>Death threatned if he did
it not:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 15, 16, 17.</note> But Christ came not, to give us possession of an holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Righteousness, that came to us by our Creation,
without a Promise; and that hath no promise to encourage
us to continue therein; but of an Holiness that comes to us
by the best of Promises, and that we are encouraged to by
the best of Promises. Therefore it was not his great Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand
when he came from Heaven to Earth, to put us in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of that Promiseless holiness that <hi>Adam</hi> had before, and
that was lost in him by the Fall.</p>
            <p>Lastly, In a word; The Holiness that <hi>Adam</hi> had before,
and that we lost in him by the Fall; it was a natural shadowish
old Covenant, promiseless holiness; such as stood and might
he walked in, while he stood perfectly ignorant of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator
Christ. Wherefore it is rather the Design of your <hi>Apollo</hi> the


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32067:19"/>
Devil, whom in <hi>Page</hi> 101. you bring forth to applaud your
Righteousness; I say; it is rather his Design then Christ, to
put men upon an indeavour after a possession of that: For
that which is truely Evangelical, is the Spiritual, Substantial,
New Covenant, promised holiness; that which cometh to us
by, and standeth in the Spirit, Faith and Knowledge of the
Son of God, not that which we lost in <hi>Adam.</hi> Wherefore
the Song which there you learnt of the Devil, is true, in the
sense he made it, and in the sense for which you bring it;
which is, to beget in men, the highest esteem of their own
humane nature; and to set up this natural, shadowish, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseless,
ignorant holiness, in opposition to that which is
truely Christs.</p>
            <q>
               <l>To dwell in Heaven doth not more please him, then</l>
               <l>Within the Souls of Pious mortal Men.</l>
            </q>
            <p>This is the Song; but you find it not in <hi>Matthew, Mark,
Luke,</hi> or <hi>John,</hi> but among the Heathens who were his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples;
and who were wont to enquire at his mouth, and
learn of him.</p>
            <p>Thus have I <hi>Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi> the foundation of your Book, even
by overthrowing the Holiness, and Righteousness, which by
you is set up, as that which is the onely true Gospel, and
Evangelical. Wherefore it remaineth, that the rest of your
Book, <hi>viz.</hi> whatever therein is brought, and urged for the
proof of this your Description of Holiness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is but the
abuse of Christ, of Scripture, and Reason; it is but a wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and corrupting of the Word of God, both to your own
destruction, and them that believe you.</p>
            <p>But to pass this, and to come to some other passages in
your Book; And first to that in Page 5<hi>th.</hi> where you say,
<hi>The Holiness, which is the Design of the Religion of Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
is not such as is subjected in any thing without us; or
is made ours by a meer external, or outward application,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>1. These words secretly smite at the Justification that comes
by the imputation of that most glorious Righteousness that
alone resideth in the Person of the Lord Jesus;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> and that is
made ours by an act of eternal Grace, we resting upon it by
the Faith of Jesus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:32067:19"/>
2. But if the Holiness of which you speak, be not subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to any thing without us, then it is not of all that fulness
which it pleased the Father should dwell in Christ: For
the Holiness and Righteousness, even the inward Holiness
that is in Saints, it is none other then that which dwelleth in
the Person of the Son of God in Heaven: Neither doth
any man partake of, or enjoy the least measure thereof, but
as he is united by Faith to this Son of God,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 8.</note> 
               <hi>The thing is as
true in him, in us; in him as the Head, and without measure;</hi>
and is originally seated in him,<note place="margin">Joh. 1. 16.</note> not in us. <hi>Of his fulness have
we all</hi> (Saints) <hi>received, and grace for grace.</hi> Wherefore the
holiness that hath its original from us; from the purity of
the humane nature (which is the thing you aim at) and that
originally, as you term it, is the dictates thereof, is the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the <hi>Socinians, Quakers, &amp;c.</hi> and not the Religion of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now I will come to your indifferent things,</hi> viz. <hi>those
which you call,</hi> positive Precepts; things, <hi>say you,</hi> of an
indifferent nature; and absolutely considered, are neither good
nor evil; but are capable of becoming so; onely by reason of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Circumstances: Of these positive indifferent Precepts, <hi>you
say,</hi> you know but three in the Gospel; but three that are purely
so <hi>viz.</hi> That of coming to God by Christ, the Institutions of
Baptisme, and the Lords Supper. <hi>This we have in</hi> Page 7.
<hi>and</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>1. These words, as I hinted before,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> are highly derogatory
to the Lord the King of Glory, and trample as much upon
the Blood of the Son of God, as words can likely do.</p>
            <p>For first, If coming to God by Christ, be in it self but an
Indifferent thing, then, as I also hinted before, it is not of
the substance of Christianity; but a man may be truely a
Christian without it; may be saved, and go to heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it; This is in truth the Consequence of your words: for
things purely of an indifferent nature, do not in themselves
either make or marre the Righteousness that justifieth us from
the Curse before God. Wherefore by your Argument, if a
man remain ignorant of that positive Precept, of <hi>coming to
God by Christ;</hi> he remaineth ignorant but of an Indifferent
thing, a thing that in its self is neither good nor evil, and
therefore not essentially material to his Faith or justifying
Righteousness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:32067:20"/>
2. An indifferent thing <hi>in it self</hi> is next to nothing, neither
good nor evil, then but a thing betwixt them both.</p>
            <p>Then is the Blood of the Lord Jesus, <hi>in it self,</hi> of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
at all; nor Faith in him, of it self, any more then a thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <hi>certain Circumstances</hi> that make them soo? For the indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the thing lyeth not simply in coming to God, but in
coming to him <hi>by Christ:</hi> Coming otherwise to <hi>God,</hi> even
in this mans eyes, being the All in All; but in <hi>this</hi> coming,
in coming to him <hi>by Christ,</hi> there lyeth the indifferency. <hi>I
marvel what injury the Lord Jesus hath done this man, that he
should have such indifferent thought of coming to God by him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But hath he no better thoughts of his own good deeds,
which are by the Law? Yes doubtless, <hi>for those</hi> (saith he)
<hi>are of an indispensible, and eternal obligation, which were first
written in mens hearts, and originally dictates of humane nature.

               </hi> 8. Mark, Not a dictate of humane nature, or neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
conclusion on deduction from it, is of an indifferent,
but of an indispensible; not of a transient, but of an eternal
obligation. It is onely <hi>going to God by Christ,</hi> and two other
things, that he findeth in the Gospel, that of themselves, are
of an indifferent nature.</p>
            <p>But how indifferent Even as indifferent in it self, as the
blood of a silly Sheep, or the ashes of an Heifer; for these
are his very words. <hi>SVCH</hi> (that is such ordinances as in
themselves are of an indifferent nature) <hi>were all the Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Prohibitions of the Ceremonial Law; and some few
SUCH we have under the Gospel.</hi> page 7. Then in <hi>page</hi> 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>he
tells you what these positive Precepts under the Gospel or
things indifferent are, <hi>THAT of going to God by Christ, is
one; and the other two, are Institutions of Baptisme; and the
Lords Supper. SVCH</hi> therefore as were the Ceremonies of
the Law, <hi>such</hi> (even) <hi>SVCH</hi> (saith he) <hi>is that of going
to God by Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wherefore he that shall lay no more stress upon the Lord
Jesus to come to God by, then this man doth, would lay as much
(were the old Ceremonies in force) upon a silly Sheep, as
upon the Christ of God. For these are all alike, <hi>positive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
such</hi> as were the Ceremonies of the Law, <hi>things in
themselves</hi> neither good nor evil, but absolutely considered; of
an indifferent nature,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:32067:20"/>
So that to come to God by Christ, is reckoned, of it self,
by him, a thing of a very <hi>indifferent</hi> nature, and therefore
this man cannot <hi>do it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> but with a very <hi>indifferent</hi> heart; his
<hi>great;</hi> and most <hi>substantial</hi> coming to God must needs be by
some <hi>other</hi> way:<note place="margin">Joh. 10. 1.</note> But why should this <hi>THIEF</hi> love thus
to <hi>Clamber,</hi> and seek to go to God by <hi>other</hi> Means; <hi>such</hi>
which he reckoneth of a more dispensible nature, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
seeing Christ onely (as indifferent as he is) is the <hi>onely</hi>
way to the Father. <hi>I am the Way</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Truth,
and the Life; No man cometh to the Father but by me.</hi> If he
be the <hi>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ly</hi> Way, then there is <hi>none</hi> other; if he be <hi>thus</hi> the
<hi>Truth,</hi> then is all other the <hi>Lye;</hi> and if he be here the <hi>Life,</hi>
then is all other the <hi>Death;</hi> let him call them indispensible
and eternal never so often.</p>
            <p>So then, how far off this mans Doctrine is, of sinning against
the Holy Ghost, let him that is wise consider it. For if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to God by Christ, be in it <hi>self,</hi> but a thing <hi>indifferent,</hi>
and onely made a <hi>Duty</hi> upon the account of certain <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:</hi>
then to come to God by Christ is a <hi>duty</hi> incumbent
upon us <hi>onely</hi> by reason of certain Circumstances, not that
the thing in it self is good; or that the nature of sin, and
the Justice of God layeth a necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>y on us so to. But what
be these certain Circumstances? For it is because of these,
(if you will believe him) that God the Father, yea, the
whole Trinity, did consult in Eternity, and consent, that
Christ should be the Way to Life: Now I say, it is partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by Him was the greatest safety, he being naturally, the
Justice, Wisdome, and Power of God; and partly, because
it would (we having sinned) be utterly impossible we should
come to God by other means and live. He that will call
<hi>these</hi> Circumstances, that is, things over and above besides
the Substantials of the Gospel, will but discover his unbelief
and ignorance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for your saying, That <hi>Calvin, Peter Martyr, Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus,
Zanchy,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> did not question, but that God
could have Pardoned sin, without <hi>any other</hi> Satisfaction, then

Here now let the Reader <hi>note,</hi> That the <hi>positive</hi> Precepts,
declarations of the arbitrary Will of God, in things of an

neither good nor evil; some few <hi>SUCH</hi> (say you) we have

            <p>Indeed in the seventh Chapter of your Book, you make a

Christ, as that it was <hi>a Sacrifice for sin,</hi> an <hi>expiatory,</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory</hi>
Sacrifice. (<hi>page</hi> 83.) Yet, he that well shall weigh

            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yea, but it is, <hi>from before the Face of God;</hi> and from the
Judgement and Curse of the Law; For before God the Guilt is
taken away, by the Death and Blood of his Son, immediately, for
all them that shall be saved; else how can it be said we are Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied

be: If notwithstanding, his Death and Blood, Sin in the Guilt, and
Consequently the Curse that is due thereto, should yet remain
in the sight of God.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.</note> But what saith the Apostle? <hi>God was in Christ
Reconciling the World to himself; not Imputing their Trespasses unto
them.</hi> Those that are but <hi>Reconciling,</hi> are not yet Reconciled:
I mean, as <hi>Paul,</hi> not yet come aright over in their own Souls by
Faith: Yet to these he imputeth not their Trespasses: Wherefore?
because they have none: or because he forgiveth them as they
Believe and Work: Neither of both; but because he hat, First,
made his Son to be Sin for them; and lay'd all the Guilt and
Curse of their Sin upon him; that they might be made the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of God in him. Therefore even because by him their
Sin and Curse is taken off, from before the Law of God; therefore,
God for the sake of Christ, seeketh for, and beseecheth the Sinner
to be Reconciled: That is, to believe in, and imbrace his Majesty.</p>
            <p>No <hi>(say you)</hi> The Actual Removing of Guilt, is not the necessary
and immediate Result of his Death; but Suspended vntil such time as
the forementioned Conditions, by the help of his Grace are performed
by us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Then may a Man have the Grace of God within him;
Yea, the Grace and Mercy of the New-Covenant, <hi>viz. Faith,</hi>
and the like, that <hi>yet</hi> remaineth under the <hi>Curse</hi> of the Law; and
so hath <hi>yet</hi> his Sins untaken away from before the Face of God:
For where the Curse is <hi>onely</hi> suspended, it may stand there: <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,</hi>
in Force against the Soul. Now, let the Soul stand ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed,
and his Duties must stand accursed: For, First, the Person,
and then the Offering must be accepted of God.<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> God accepted
not the Works of <hi>Cain,</hi> because he had not accepted his Person:


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:32067:23"/>
But having first accepted <hi>Abel</hi>'s Person, he therefore did accept
his Offering.<note place="margin">Hebr. 11</note> And here it is said, that <hi>Abel Offered by Faith:</hi> He
belived that his Person was accepted of God, for the sake of the
promised <hi>Messias;</hi> and therefore believed also that his Offering
should be accepted.</p>
            <p>2. Faith, As it respecteth Justification in the sight of God,
must know nothing to rest upon, but the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, through
Christ's Blood: But if the <hi>Curse</hi> be not taken away, <hi>Mercy</hi> also
hangeth in Suspence; yea, lyeth as drowned, and hid in the
bottom of the Sea. This Doctrine then of yours, overthroweth
Faith, and rusheth the Soul into the Works of the Law, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law; and so quite Involveth it in the fear of the Wrath of
God, maketh the Soul forget Christ, taketh from it the Object of
Faith; and if a Miracle of Mercy prevent not, the Soul must dye
in everlasting Desperation.</p>
            <p>But <hi>(say you)</hi> it is Suspended till such time as the forementioned
Conditions, by the help of his Grace, be performed by us, Pag. 92.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Had you said the <hi>Manifestation</hi> of it is kept from us;
it might, <hi>with some Allowance,</hi> have been Admitted<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> But yet the
<hi>Revelation</hi> of it <hi>in the Word,</hi> which in <hi>some Sence</hi> may be called a

Yea,<note place="margin">1 John 5. 11.</note> is seen by us; and also believed as a truth <hi>Recorded;</hi> before
the Injoyment thereof be with comfort in our own Souls.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>you Proceed and say,</hi> Therefore was the Death of Christ
Designed, to Procure our Justification, from all Sins past, that
we might by this means be Provoked to become New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That the Death of Christ is a mighty Argument to
perswade with the Believer, to Devote himself to God, in Christ,

being as Uncapable to make himself <hi>A-new,</hi> as a Child to Beget

that: All things are already, or before become New in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Man. But to return:</p>
            <p>After all the Flourish you have made about the Death of
Christ, even as he is an <hi>Expiatory,</hi> and <hi>Propitiatory</hi> Sacrifice; In


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32067:23"/>
Conclusion, you Terminate the Business far short of which it was
intended of God: For you almost make the Effects thereof but a
bare Suspension of present Justice, and Death for Sin: or that
which hath delivered us at present from a <hi>Necessity</hi> of dying;
that we might live unto God: That is, according as you have
Stated it; <q>That we might from Principles of Humanity, and
Reason, act towards the First Principles of Morals, &amp;c. till we
put our selves into a Capacity of Personal and Actual Pardon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Sum of your Doctrine therefore is, That Christ by
his Death onely holds the Point of the Sword of Justice, <hi>Not that
he Received it into his own Soul.</hi> That he Suspends the Curse from
us; <hi>Not that himself was made a Curse for us;</hi> that the Guilt might
be Remitted by our Vertues: <hi>Not that Sin was made to be our Sin:</hi>
But <hi>Paul</hi> and the New Testament,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> giveth us Account far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
<hi>viz.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
               <hi>That Christ was made our Sin, our Curse, and Death; that
we by him</hi> (not by the Principle of pure Humanity, or our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to your first Principles of Morals, &amp;c.) <hi>should be set free
from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any Object that Christ hath designed the Purifying our
Hearts and Natures; I Answer,</p>
            <p>But he hath not designed to Promote, or to Perfect that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
that is Founded on, and Floweth from, the Purity of our
Humane Nature: for then he must design the setting up Mans
righteousness; that which is of the Law: and then he must design
also the setting up of that which is directly in opposition, both
also, to the Righteousness, that of God is designed to Justifie us:
and <hi>that</hi> by which we are inwardly made Holy. As I have shewed
before.</p>
            <p>You have therefore, Sir, in all that you have yet Asserted,
shewed no other Wisdom then a Heathen, or of one that is short,
even of a Novice in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I might Trace you Chapter, by Chapter;
and at large Refute, not only the whole design of your Book,
by a particular Replication to them; but also sundry, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Errors, that like venome drop from your Pen.</p>
            <p>But, as before I told you in general, so here I tell you again,
That neither the Scriptures of God, the Promise, or Threatnings,
the Life, or Death, Resurrection, Assention, or coming again of
Christ to Judgement; hath the least Sillable, or Tendency in
them, to set up <hi>Your</hi> Heathenish, and Pagan Holiness, or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:32067:24"/>
Wherefore your whole Discourse is but a meer abuse
of, and Corrupting the Holy Scriptures, for the fastening, if it
must have been, your Errors upon the Godly. I Conclude then
upon the whole, that the Gospel hath cast out Mans Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Dogs: and Conclude that there is no such thing as a
Purity of Humane Nature, as a Principle in us, thereby to
Work Righteousness withal. Farther, It never thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
us again, to the Holineness we lost in <hi>Adam:</hi> or to make
our perfection to Consist in the Possession of so Natural, and Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
a Principle as that is, in all the things of the Holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel:
But hath declared another, and far better way, which you
can by no means understand by all the Dictates of your Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
            <p>I will therefore content my self at present, with gathering up
some few Errors, out of those abundance which are in your Book;
and so leave you to God, who can either Pardon these grievous
Errors, or Damn you for your Pride and Blasphemies.</p>
            <p>You pretend in the beginning of your Second Chapter, to prove
your Assertion; <hi>Viz. That the great Errand that Christ came upon,
was to put us again into possession of that Holiness which we had lost.</hi>
For Proof whereof you bring <hi>John</hi> the Baptist's Doctrine, and the
Angels saying to <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Malachi (Mat.</hi> 3. 12.
<hi>Luke</hi> 1. 16, 17. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3.) In which Texts there is as much
for your purpose, and no more, then there is in a perfect <hi>Blanck:</hi>
For which of them speak a <hi>Word</hi> of the Righteousness or Holiness
which we have lost? Or, where is it said, either by these mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
or by the whole Scripture, that we are to be restored <hi>TO,</hi> and
put again into Possession of <hi>that</hi> Holiness? These are but the
Dictates of your Humane Nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John's</hi> Ministry was, <hi>To make ready a People prepared for the Lord
Jesus:</hi> not to Possess them with <hi>themselves,</hi> and their <hi>own</hi> (but <hi>now</hi>
lost) Holiness. And so the Angel told his Father, saying, <hi>Many
of the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>shall he turn to the Lord their God:</hi> Not to
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Innocency, or to the Holiness that we lost by him. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>hesie that Christ at his coming
should put men again in Possession of the Holiness we had lost. And
I say again, As you here fall short of your Purpose, so I Challenge
you to produce but one piece of a Text, that in the least looketh to
such a thing. The whole Tenor of the Scripture, that speaks of
the Errand of Christ Jesus, tells us another Lesson, to wit, That


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:32067:24"/>
he <hi>himself</hi> came to <hi>save</hi> us, and <hi>that</hi> by his <hi>own</hi> Righteousness;
not <hi>that</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> or which we have <hi>lost</hi> in him, unless you can
say, and prove, that we had <hi>once,</hi> even <hi>before</hi> we were Converted,
the Holiness of Christ within us, or the Righteousness of Christ
upon us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you yet go on; and tell us,</hi> That this was also the Phrophesie
of the Angel to <hi>Joseph, (Pag.</hi> 14.) in these Words, HE <hi>(Jesus)</hi>
shall save his People from their Sins. Not <hi>(say you)</hi> from the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them: although that be a true Sence too: but not the Primary,
but Secondary, and implyed onely, and the Consequence of the former
Salvation, <hi>Pag.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus <hi>PEN</hi> the Quaker and you run in this, in one
and the self same Spirit: He Affirming that Sanctification is
antecedent to Justification, but not the Consequence thereof.</p>
            <p>2. But what Salvation? <hi>Why Salvation?</hi> say you: <hi>First from
the Filth:</hi> For <hi>that is the Primary and First Sence: Justification from
the Guilt, being the never-failing Consequence of this.</hi> But how then
must Jesus Christ, first save us from the Filth? You add in Pag. 16.
<hi>That he shall bring in, instead of the Ceremonial Observations, a far
more Noble,</hi> viz. <hi>An inward Substantial Righteousness: and by
Abrogating that</hi> (namely of the Cerimonies) <hi>he shall Establish onely
this inward Righteousness.</hi> This is, that Holiness, or Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
you tell us of, in the end of the Chapter going before, that
<hi>You</hi> acknowledge we had <hi>lost;</hi> so that the Sum of all that you have
said, is, <hi>That the way that Christ will take to save his People from
their Sins, is, First to Restore unto them, and give them Possession of
the Righteousness that they had lost in</hi> Adam: <hi>And having established
this in them, he would accquit them also of Guilt.</hi> But that this is a
shameless Error, and Blasphemy, is apparent from which hath
already been Asserted of the Nature of the Holiness, or Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
that we have lost: <hi>viz. That it was only Natural of the Old
Covenant, Tipical: And such as might stand with perfect Ignorance of
the Meditation of Jesus Christ:</hi> And now I add, That for Christ
to come to Establish this Righteousness, is alone; as if he should
be sent from Heaven, to overthrow, and Abrogate the eternal
Purpose of Grace, which the Father had purposed should be
manifested to the World by Christ: For Christ came not to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store,
or to give us Possession of that which was once our own
Holiness, but to make us Partakers of that which is in him,
<hi>That we might be made Partakers of HIS Holiness.</hi> Neither

(were it granted that you speak the truth;) is it possible for a
man to be filled with inward Gospel-Holiness,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
that yet abideth, as before the Face of God, under the
Curse of the Law, or the Guilt of his own Transgressions. The
Guilt must therefore, first be taken off, and we set free by Faith
in that Blood, that did it, before we can Act upon Pure Christian
Principles: Pray tell me the meaning of this one Text; which
speaking of Christ, saith, <hi>Who when he had by himself Purged our
Sins, sat down on the Right Hand of the Majesty on High,</hi> Heb. 1. 13.
Tell me, I say, by this Text, whether is here intended the Sins of all
that shall be saved? If so, what a kind of Purging is here meant,
seeing thousands, &amp; thousands of thousands, of the Persons intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by this Act of Purging were not then in being, nor their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Sins in Act? And note, he saith, he <hi>Purged them,</hi> before he sat
down at the Right hand of God: Purging then, in this place, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
First, and Primarily, Respect the Purging of the Conscience:
But the taking; the compleat taking of the Guilt; and so the
the Curse from before the face of God, according to other
Scriptures: <hi>He hath made him to be Sin, and accursed of God for us.</hi>
Now he being made the Sin which we committed, and the Curse
which we deserved; there is no more Sin nor Curse: I mean to
be charged by the Law, to Damn them that shall believe; not that
their believing takes away the Curse; but puts the Soul upon
trusting to him, that before Purged this Guilt, and Curse: I say,
before he sat down on the Right Hand of God: Not to Suspend,
(as you would have it) but to <hi>take away</hi> the Sin of the World.
<hi>The Lord hath LAID upon him the Iniquities of us all:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isaiah 53. 1 Pet. 2. 24.</note> 
               <hi>And he
BARE them in his own Body on the Tree: Nor yet that he should
OFTEN Offer himself; for then must he OFTEN have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
since the Foundation of the World:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb 9. 24. 25, 26.</note> 
               <hi>But NOW,</hi> (and that at)
<hi>Once) in the end of the World, hath he Appeared, to put away Sin, by
the Sacrifice of himself.</hi> Mark, he did put it away by the Sacrifice
of his Body and Soul, <hi>when</hi> he dyed on the Cross: but he could
not then put away the inward Filth of <hi>those,</hi> that then remained
Unconverted; or <hi>those</hi> that as yet wanted being in the World.
The putting away of Sin therefore, that the Holy Ghost here
intendeth, is, <hi>such</hi> a putting of it away, as respecteth the
Guilt, Curse, and Condemnation thereof, as it stood by the
Accusations of the Law, against all Flesh before the Face of
God; which Guilt, Curse, and Condemnation, Christ himself


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:32067:25"/>
was made in that day, when he dyed the Death for us. And this
is the First and Principle Intendment of the Angel, in that blessed
saying to Godly <hi>Joseph,</hi> concerning Christ; <hi>He shall save his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from their Sins;</hi> from the Guilt and Curse due to them, first:
and afterwards from the Filth thereof. This is yet manifest,
farther; because <hi>the Heart is Purified by Faith,</hi> and Hope, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.
15. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 3, 4. Now it is not the Nature of Faith; I mean,
of Justifying Faith; to have any thing for an Object; from which
fetcheth Peace with God? &amp; Holiness before, or besides the Christ
of God himself, for he is the way to the Father: and no Man can
come to the Father, but by him. Come; that is, so as to find
Acceptance, and Peace with him: The Reason is, because with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Blood, Guilt remains, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. He hath made Peace
by the Blood of his Cross: so then, Faith in the first place seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Peace: But why Peace First? because till Peace is fetched into
the Soul, by Faiths laying hold on the blood of Christ, Sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in the Guilt and Curse, though not in the sight of God,
yet upon the Conscience, through the Power of Unbelief:<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 18,</note> 
               <hi>He that
believeth not stands yet Condemned.</hi> Now, so long as Guilt, and the
Curse in Power remains, there is not Purity, but Unbelief: not
Joy, but Doubting: not Peace, but Peevishness: not Content, but
Murmuring, and Anger, against the Lord himself. <hi>The Law Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Wrath,</hi> Rom. 4. Wherefore, as yet there can be no Purity of
Heart; because that Faith yet wants his Object: But having once
found Peace with God by believing what the Blood of Christ
hath done, Joy followeth, so doth Peace, Quietness, Content, and
Love; <hi>Which is also the fulfilling of the Law:</hi> Yet not from such
Dungish Principles as yours: For so the Apostle calls them,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 3. But from the Holy Ghost it self; which God, by Faith,
hath granted to be received by them that believe in the Blood of
his Jesus.</p>

               <hi>But you add,</hi> That Christ giveth, First Repentance, and then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of Sins. <hi>Page</hi> 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This makes nothing for the Holiness which we lost in
<hi>Adam:</hi> for the Proof of which you bring that Text, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31.</p>
            <p>2. But for Christ to take away Guilt, and the Curse, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Face of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ods is one thing; and to make that discovery is
another.</p>
            <p>3. Again, Christ doth not give forgiveness for the sake of
that Repentance, which hath it's rise, Originally from the


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:32067:26"/>
Dictates of our own nature, which is the thing you are to prove;
for that Repentance is called the Sorrow of this World; and
must be again Repented of: But the Repentance mentioned in the
Text, is that which comes from Christ: But,</p>
            <p>4. It cannot be for the sake of Gospel Repentance, that the
forgiveness of Sins is Manifested, because both are his Peculiar
Gift.</p>
            <p>5. Therefore, both Faith, and Repentance, and Forgiveness of
Sins, are given by Christ; and come to us, for the sake of that
Blessed Offering of his Body, once for all: For after he Arose
from the Dead, having led Captivity Captive, and taken the
Curse from before the Face of God: therefore his Father gave
him Gifts for Men, even all the things that are Necessary, and
Effectual, for our Conversion, and Preservation in this World, &amp;c.
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Text therefore, with all the rest you bring, falleth short
of the least shew of Proof,</hi> That the great Errand for which Christ
came into the World wasâ€”to put us in Possession of the Holiness
that we had lost.</p>
            <p>Your Third Chapter is as Empty of the Proof of your Design,
as that through which we have passed: there being not one Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
therein Tited, that giveth the least intimation, that ever it
entred into the Heart of Christ to put us again into Possession of
that Holiness which we had before we were Converted: for such
was that we lost in <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You tell us the Sum of all is, <hi>That we are Commauded to add to, our
Faith, Vertue,</hi> &amp;c. Page 35. I suppose you intend a Gospel Faith,
which if you can prove <hi>Adam</hi> had before the fall, and that we lost
this Faith in him; and also that this Gospel Faith is none other,
but that which Origianally ariseth from, or is the Dictates of
Humane Nature, I will confess you have Scripture, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
beyond me. In the mean time you must suffer me to tell you
you are as far in this from the mind of the Holy Ghost, as if you
had yet never in all your days heard whether there be a Holy
Ghost, or no.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Add to your Faith.</hi> The Apostle here lays a Gospel Principle, <hi>viz.</hi>
Faith in the Son of God: which Faith layeth hold of the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Sins, alone for the sake of Christ: Therefore he is a great
way off, of laying the Purity of the Humane Nature, the Law,
as written in the heart of natural man, as the Prenciple of


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:32067:26"/>
Holiness; from whence is produced good Works in the Soul of
the Godly.</p>
            <p>In your Fourth Chapter also (Pag. 28.) even in the beginning
thereof; even with one Text you have overthrown your whole
Book.</p>
            <p>This Chapter is to prove, that the onely Design of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
and Threatnings of the Gospel, is to Promote, and put us
again in Possession of the Holiness we had lost: (For that the
Reader must still remember, is the onely Design of your Book,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 12.) Whereas the First Text you speak of,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.</note> maketh mention
of the Divine Nature, or of the Spirit of the Living God, which
is also received by the Precious Faith of Christ, and the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Knowledge of him; this Blessed Spirit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not the Dictates of Humane Nature, is the Principle that
is laid in the Godly: But <hi>Adam</hi>'s Holiness had neither the
Knowledge, or Faith, or Spirit of the Lord Jesus, as it's Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
or Principle: Yea, Nature was his Foundation; even
his own Nature was the Original, from whence his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and good Works arose.</p>
            <p>The next Scriptures also (<hi>viz.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.) over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
you; for they urge the Promises as Motives to stir us up
to Holiness. But <hi>Adam</hi> had neither the Spirit of Jesus, or Faith
in him, as a Principle; nor any Promises to him as Motives:
Wherefore this was not that to which, or which we Christians
are Exhorted to seek the Possession of; but that which is Operated
by that Spirit which we receive by the Faith of Jesus, and that
which is encouraged by those Promises, that God hath <hi>since</hi> given
to them that have closed by Faith with Jesus.</p>
            <p>The rest also, (in <hi>Pag.</hi> 29.) not one of them doth promise us
the Possession of the Holiness we have lost, or any mercy to them
that have it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You add:</hi> And whereas the Promises of Pardon, and of Eternal
Life, are Frequently made to believing; there is nothing more Evidently
declared, then that this Faith is such as Purifieth the Heart, and is
Productive of good Works, <hi>Pag.</hi> 30.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If the Promise be made <hi>at all</hi> to believing, it is <hi>not</hi> made
to us upon the account of the Holiness we had lost; for I tell you
yet again, that Holiness <hi>is not of Faith,</hi> neither was <hi>Faith the
Effect thereof.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:32067:27"/>
2. The Promises of Pardon, though they be made to such a
Faith as is Fruitful in good Works: Yet not to it, as it is Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in doing, but in receiving Good. Sir, the quality of Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Faith, is this, <hi>Not to Work, but to Believe,</hi> as to the Business
of pardon of Sin: and that not onely, because of the Sufficiency
that this Faith sees in Christ to Justifie, but also for that it knows
those whom God thus Pardoneth, <hi>he Justifieth as ungodly. Now to
him that Worketh not, but believeth;</hi> (Mark, here Faith and Works
are Opposed) <hi>Now to him that Worketh not, but Believeth in him
that Justifieth the Vngodly, his Faith is counted for Righteousness,</hi>
Rom. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You add farther,</hi> That the Promises may be Reduced to these three
Heads; that of the Holy Spirit, of Remission of Sins, and Eternal
Happiness, in the Injoyment of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If you can prove that any of these Promises were made
to the Holiness that we had lost, or that by these Promises we are
to be Possessed with that Holiness again; I will even now lay
down the Bucklers. For albeit, The time will come when the
Saints shall be absolutely, and perfectly Sin-less; yet then shall
they be also Spiritual, Immortal, and Incorruptible; which you
cannot prove <hi>Adam</hi> was, in the best of his Holiness, even that
which we lost in him.</p>
            <p>The Threatnings you speak of (<hi>Pag.</hi> 35.) are every one made
against Sin, but not one of them to drive us into a Possession of
that Holiness that we had lost: Nay, contrariwise, he that looks
to, or seeks after <hi>that,</hi> is as sure to be Damned, and go to Hell,
as he that Transgresseth the Law; because that is not the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of God, the Righteousness of Christ, the Righteousness of
Faith, nor that to which the Promise is made.</p>
            <p>And this was manifested to the World betimes, even in that
day when God drove the Man and his Wife out of <hi>Eden,</hi> and
placed Cherubines, and a Flaming Sword in the way by which
they came out, to the end, that by going back by <hi>that</hi> way, they
might rather be <hi>Killed</hi> and <hi>Dye,</hi> then lay hold of the <hi>Tree of Life,
Gen.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Which the Apostle also Respects, when he calleth the way of
the Gospel, the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Living</hi> Way, even that which is made
by the Blood of Christ; Concluding by this Discription of the
Way that is by Blood, that the other is <hi>Old,</hi> and the <hi>Way</hi> of
<hi>Death;</hi> even that which is by the <hi>Morral</hi> Law, or the Dictates of


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:32067:27"/>
our Nature, or by that fond Conceit of the Goodly Holiness of
<hi>Adam, Heb.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Your Fifth Chapter tells us that the Promoting of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
was the design of our Saviours whole Life and Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
among Men, <hi>Pag.</hi> 36.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Were this granted, it reacheth nothing at all the
Design, for which you in your way Present us with it: For,</p>
            <p>2. That which you have Asserted is, <hi>That the Errand about which
Christ came, was,</hi> as the Effecting our Deliverance out of that
Sinful State we had brought our selves into; <hi>so to put us again in
Possession of that Holiness which we had LOST:</hi> For that
you say, is the Business of your Book (<hi>Pag.</hi> 12.) Wherefore you
should have told us in the Head of this Chapter, not so much that
our Saviour Designed the Promoting of Holiness, in General,
by his life; <hi>but that the whole Design of our Saviours Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
was to put us again into Possession of THAT Holiness which
we had lost,</hi> into a Possession of <hi>that</hi> Natural, Old Covenant,
Figurative, Ignorant Holiness. But it seems you count that there
is no other, then that now lost, but never again to be obtained,
Holiness, that was in <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Farther: You also Faulter here, as to the Stating of the
Proposition; for in the Beginning of your Book you State it thus;
<hi>That the Enduing Men with inward Real Righteousness, or True
Holiness, was the Vltimate end of our Saviours coming into the World;</hi>
still meaning the Holiness we lost in <hi>Adam.</hi> You should therefore
in this place also, have minded your Reader, of this your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and made it manifest if you could, <hi>that the Vltimate End
of our Saviours whole Life and Conversation, was the Induing Men
with this Adamitish Holiness.</hi> But HOLINESS, and THAT
Holiness is alone with you; and to make it his End, and whole End;
his Business, and the whole Business of his Life, is but the same
with you.</p>
            <p>But you must know that the whole Life and Conversation of
our Saviour, was intended for another Purpose, then to drive us
back to, or to Indue us with such an Holiness, and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as I have Proved this to be.</p>
            <p>You have therefore in this your Discourse, put an unsuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Affront upon the Son of God, in making all his Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
to Center and Terminate in the Holiness we had lost:
As if the Lord Jesus was sent down from Heaven, and the Word


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:32067:28"/>
of God made Flesh; that by a Perfect Life and Conversation he
might shew us how Holy <hi>Adam</hi> was before he fell; or what an
Holiness that our Holiness was, which we had before we were
Converted.</p>
            <p>Your Discourse therefore of the Life and Conversation of the
Lord Jesus, is none other then Heathenish: For you neither Treat
of the Principle (his Godhead) by which he did his Works;
neither do you in the least, in one Sillable, Aver the First, the
main and Prime Reason of this his Conversation; only you
Treat of it so far, as a mean Man might have considered it. And
indeed it stood not with your Design to Treat a right with these
things: For had you Mentioned the First, though but once, your
Babel had tumbled about your Ears: For if in the Holy Jesus
<hi>did dwell the Word, One</hi> of the <hi>Three</hi> in Heaven; or if the Lord
and Saviour Jesus Christ, was Truly, Essentially, and Naturally
God; then must the <hi>Principle</hi> from whence his <hi>Works</hi> did <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,</hi>
be <hi>better</hi> then the Principle from whence Proceeded the
Goodness in <hi>Adam;</hi> otherwise <hi>Adam</hi> must be God and Man.
Also you do, or may know that the self same act may be done
from several Principles: And again, that it is the Principle from
whence the act is done, and not the bare doing of the act, that
makes it better or worse Accepted, or not in the Eyes either of
God or Men.</p>
            <p>Now then to <hi>shew you</hi> the Main, or Chief Design of the Life
and Conversation of the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> It was, not to shew us what an Excellent Holiness we
once had in <hi>Adam;</hi> But that thereby God, the Eternal Majesty,
according to his Promise, might be seen by, and dwell with
Mortal Men: For the Godhead being altogether in it's own
Nature Invisible, and yet desirous to be seen by, and dwell with
the Children of Men; therefore was the Son, who is the self same
Substance with the Father, closed with, or Tabernacled in our
Flesh; that in that Flesh the Nature, and Glory of the Godhead,
might be seen by, and dwell with us: <hi>The Word was made Flesh,
and dwelt among us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 14.</note> 
               <hi>(and we beheld his glory: What Glory? The
Glory, as of the onely Begotten of the Father) full of Grace and Truth.</hi>
Again,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 1. 2, 3</note> 
               <hi>The Life</hi> (that is, the Life of God, in the Works and
Conversation of Christ) <hi>was Manifest;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col 1. 15.</note> 
               <hi>and we have seen it, and
bear Witness, and shew unto you that Eternal Life which was with
the Father, and was Manifested unto us.</hi> And hence he is called


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:32067:28"/>
               <hi>the Image of the Invisible God;</hi> or he by whom the Invisible God
is most perfectly presented to the Sons of Men. Did I say before
that the God of Glory is desirous to be seen of us? Even so also,
<hi>have the Pure in Heart,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 14.</note> a desire that it should be so: <hi>Lord,</hi> say they,
<hi>shew us the Father, and it suffiseth us:</hi> And therefore the promise
is for their comfort,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> that <hi>they shall see God:</hi> But how then must
they see him? Why, in the Person, and by the Life, and Works of
Jesus. When <hi>Philip</hi> under a mistake, thought of seeing God some
other way, then in and by this Lord Jesus Christ; What is the
Answer? <hi>Have I been so long time with you,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>and hast
thou not known me</hi> Philip? <hi>He that hath seen me hath seen the Father,
and how sayest thou then, shew us the Father; Believest thou not that
I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The Words that I speak unto
you, I speak not of my self, but the Father, that dwelleth in me, he doth
the Works. Believe me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me; or
else Believe me for the very Works sake.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 14.</note> See here, that both the Words
and Works of the Lord Jesus, were not to shew you, and so to call
you back to the Holiness that we had lost, but to give us Visions
of the Perfections that are in the Father.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4 6.</note> 
               <hi>He hath given us the
Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Jesus Christ.</hi> And hence
it is that the Apostle, in that brief Collection of the wonderful
Mystery of Godliness,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> placeth this in the Front thereof, <hi>God was
Manifested in the Flesh:</hi> Was Manifested, <hi>viz.</hi> In and by the Person
of Christ: when in the Flesh he lived among us: Manifest, I say,
for this, as one Reason, that the Pure in heart, who long after
nothing more, might see him. I beseech thee, said <hi>Moses, shew
me thy Glory. And will God indeed dwell with Men on the Earth,</hi>
faith <hi>Solomon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to fullfil the desires of them that fear him, hath he shewed
himself in Flesh unto them; which Discovery Principally is
made by the Words and Works of Christ. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Christ by his Words and Works of Righteousness,
in the days of his Flesh, neither shewed us which was, nor called
us back to the Possession of the Holiness that we had lost; but did
Perfect, in, and by himself, the Law for us, that we had Broken.
Man being Involved in Sin and Misery, by reason of Transgression
Committed against the Law, or Ministration of Death, and
being utterly unable to Recover himself there-from, the Son of
God himself; Assumeth the Flesh of Man, and for Sin Condemned
Sin in that Flesh. And that, First, by walking through the Power


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:32067:29"/>
of his Eternal Spirit, in the highest Perfection to every point of
the whole Law, in it's most Exact and full Requirements; which
was to be done, not onely without Commixing Sin in his doing,
but by one that was perfectly without the least being of it in his
Nature: yea, by one that now was God-Man, because it was
God whose Law was broken, and whose Justice was offended.
For, were it now possible to give a Man Possession of that Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that he hath lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> that Holiness could neither in
the Principle, nor Act, deliver from the Sin by him before Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
This is Evident by many Reasons: First, because it is not
a Righteousness able to answer the Demands of the Law for Sin;
that requiring not onely a perfect abiding in the thing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
but a satisfaction by death, for the Transgression Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against the Law.<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
               <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death.</hi> Wherefore
he that would undertake the Salvation of the World, must be one
who can do both these things: One that can perfectly do the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of the Law, in Thought, Word, and Deed, without the
least Commixture of the least Sinful thought, in the whole
Course of his Life: He must be also able to give by Death, even
by the Death that hath the Curse of God in it, a compleat satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to the Law for the breach thereof. Now this could none
but Christ accomplish; none else having Power to do it. <hi>I have
Power,</hi> said he, <hi>to lay down my Life, and I have Power to take it
again: And this Commandment have I Received of my Father.</hi>
This Work then must be done, not by another Earthly <hi>Adam,</hi>
but by the Lord from Heaven; by one that can Abollish Sin,
Destroy the Devil, Kill Death, and Rule as Lord in Heaven and
Earth. Now the Words and Works of the Lord Jesus, declared
him to be such a one. He was first, <hi>without</hi> Sin; then he <hi>did no Sin;</hi>
neither could either the Devil, the whole World, or the Law, find
any Deceit in his mouth. But by being under the Law, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Law; by that Spirit which was the Lord God of the
Law, he not onely did always the things that pleased the Father,
but by that means in mans Flesh; he did perfectly accomplish,
and fullfil, that Law which all Flesh stood Condemned by. It is
a Foolish, and an Heathenish thing, nay worse, to think that the
Son of God should onely, or specially, fullfil, or perfect the Law, and the Prophets, <q>by giving more and higher Instances of
Morral Duties, then were before expresly given (<hi>Pag.</hi> 17.)</q> This 
would have been but the Lading of men with heavy Burthens. But


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:32067:29"/>
know then, whoever thou art that Readest, that Christ's Exposition
of the Law, was more to shew thee the Perfection of his own Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
then to drive thee back to the Holiness thou hadst lost. For
God sent him to fullfil it, by doing it, and dying, to the most
sore Sentence it could Pronounce: not as he stood a single Person,
but common, as Mediator between God and Man; making up in
himself the breach that was made by Sin, betwixt God and the
World. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He was to dye as a <hi>Lamb,</hi> as a <hi>Lamb</hi> without <hi>Blemish,</hi>
and without <hi>Spot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 12. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> according to the Type: <hi>Your Lamb shall be
without Blemish:</hi> But because there was none such to be found <hi>by,</hi>
and <hi>among</hi> all the Children of Men; therefore God sent <hi>his</hi> from
Heaven.<note place="margin">Iohn 1 29.</note> Hence <hi>John</hi> calls him <hi>the Lamb of God;</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> him
that was <hi>without Spot,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18, 19.</note> who Washed us by his Blood. Now wherein
doth it appear that he was <hi>without Spot,</hi> and <hi>Blemish,</hi> but as he
walked in the Law. These words therefore <hi>WITHOVT
SPOT,</hi> are the Sentence of the Law, who searching him could
find nothing in him, why he should be slain, yet he dyed because
there was Sin;<note place="margin">Isa. 53.</note> Sin! where? Not in him, but in his People; <hi>For
the Transgression of my People was he stricken</hi> (Isa. 53.) He dyed
then for our Sins, and qualified himself so to do, by coming Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
into the World, and by going Sin-less through it; for had he
not done both these, he must have dyed for himself. But being
God, even in Despite of all that stumble at him, he Conquered
Death, the Devil, Sin, and the Curse, by himself, and then sat
down at the Right Hand of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And because he hath a Second Part of his Priestly
Office to do in Heaven,<note place="margin">Heb 7.</note> therefore it was thus Requisite that he
should <hi>thus</hi> manifest himself to be Holy, and Harmless, Undefiled,
and Seperate from Sinners on the Earth: As <hi>Aron First</hi> put on the
Holy Garments, and <hi>then</hi> went into the Holiest of all. The Life
therefore, and Conversation of our Lord Jesus, was to shew us
with what a Curious Robe and Girdle he went into the Holy
Place. And not to shew us with what an Adamitish Holiness he
would Possess his own. <hi>Such an High Priest became us, who is Holy,
Harmless, and Vndefiled, SeperÃ te from Sinners, and made Higher
then the Heavens,</hi> that he might always be Accepted, both in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Offering, when he Presenteth his Blood to God, the
Attonement for Sin: Indeed in some things he was an Example
to us to follow him; but mark; It was not as he was <hi>Mediator,</hi>


               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:32067:30"/>
not as he was <hi>under the Law to God,</hi> not as he <hi>dyed for Sin,</hi> nor as
he <hi>maketh Reconciliation for Iniquity.</hi> But in these things Consist
the Life of our Soul, and the beginning of our Happiness. He
was then Exemplary to us, as he carried it Meekly, and Patiently,
and Self-denyingly towards the World: But yet not so neither,
to any, but such to whom he first offered Iustification by the means
of his own Righteousness. For before he saith <hi>Learn of me,</hi> he
saith, <hi>I will give you Rest;</hi> Rest from the Guilt of Sin, and fear of
Everlasting Burnings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. And so <hi>Peter,</hi> first tells us, <hi>he dyed
for our Sins:</hi> And next, that he left us an Example. But should
it be granted that the whole of Christ's Life, and Conversation
among men, was for our Example, and for no other end at all,
but that we should learn to live by his Example, yet it would
not follow, but be as far from truth, as the ends of the Earth are
assunder, that by this means he sought to Possess us with the
Holiness we had lost; for <hi>that</hi> he had not in himself; 'tis true, he
was born without Sin, yet <hi>born God and Man;</hi> he lived in the
World without Sin, but he lived <hi>as God-Man;</hi> he walked in, and
up to the Law, but it was <hi>as God-Man.</hi> Neither did his Manhood,
even in those acts of Goodness, which as to action, most properly
respected <hi>it;</hi> do ought without, but by, and in Conjunction with
his Godhead. Wherefore all, and every whit of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and good that he did, was that of <hi>God-Man;</hi> the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of <hi>God.</hi> But this was not <hi>Adam</hi>'s Principle, nor any Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that we had lost.</p>
            <p>Your Fifth Chapter, therefore Consisteth of Words spoken to
the Ayr.</p>
            <p>Your Sixt Chapter tells us, <q>That to make Men truly Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and Holy, was the Design of Christ's Unimitable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or mighty Works and Miracles; and these did onely tend
to Promote it, <hi>Pag.</hi> 68.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He neither did, nor needed, so much as one small piece of a
Miracle to perswade men to seek for the Holiness which they had
lost; or to give them again Possession of <hi>that:</hi> For <hi>that</hi> as I have
shewed, though you would fain have it otherwise, is not at all the
Christan, or Gospel Righteousness. Wherefore, in one word, you
are as short by this Chapter to prove your Natural, old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
Promise-less, Figurative Holiness, to be here Designed, as if
you had said so much as amounts to nothing. Farther, Christ <hi>needed</hi>
not to Work a Miracle to perswade men to fall in Love with <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>


               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:32067:30"/>
&amp; their own Natural Dictates; to perswade them that they
have a <hi>Purity</hi> of the Humane Nature in them; or that the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which they have lost, is the <hi>onely True,</hi> Real, and Substantial
Holiness: These things, both Corrupted Nature, and the Devil,
have of a long time fastned, and fixed in their minds.</p>
            <p>His Miracles therefore tend rather to take Men off of the
Pursuit after the Righteousness or Holiness that we had lost; and
to Confirm unto us the truth of a far more Excellent, and Blessed
thing; to wit, the Righteousness of God, of Christ, of Faith, of
the Spirit, which, <hi>that</hi> you speak of never knew: neither is it
possible that he should know it, who is hunting for your sound
Complexion, your Purity of Humane Nature, or it's Dictates, as
the onely True, Real, and Substantial Righteousness. <hi>They are
Ignorant of God's Righteousness, that go about to Establish their own
Righteousness;</hi> and neither have, nor can, without a Miracle,
submit themselves unto the Righteousness of God. They cannot
submit THEMSELVES thereto; talk thereof they may, notion
it they may, profess it too they may; but for a man to submit
<hi>himself</hi> thereto is by the mighty power of God.</p>
            <p>Miracles and Signs are for them that <hi>believe not:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 22.</note> Why for
them? That they <hi>might</hi> believe, therefore their State is reckoned
fearful,<note place="margin">Iohn 12. 37. 38, 39, 40.</note> that have not <hi>yet</hi> believed for all his wondrous Works.
<hi>And though he did so many Miracles among them, yet they believed
him not:</hi> But what should they believe? That Jesus is the true
<hi>Messias,</hi> the Christ that should come into the World. <hi>Do you say
that I Blaspheme</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>because I said I am the Son of
God; if I do not the Works of my Father believe me not; but if I do,
though you believe not me, believe the Works, that ye may know, and
believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him,</hi> John 10. 37, 38.
But what is it to believe that he is <hi>Messias,</hi> or Christ? Even to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that this Man, Jesus, was ordained, and appointed of God,
(and that before all Worlds) to be the Saviour of Men, by accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing
in himself an Everlasting Righteousness for them, and
by bearing their Sins in his Body on the Tree; that it was he that
was to Reconcile us to God, by the Body of his Flesh, when he
hanged on the Cross. This is the Doctrine that at the beginning
Christ Preached to that Learned Ignorant <hi>Nicodemus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 3. 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>As</hi> Moses
(said he) <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness, so must the Son of
Man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in him should not Perish,
but have Everlasting Life.</hi> The Serpent was lifted up upon a Pole;


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:32067:31"/>
               <hi>Christ was hanged on a Tree:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb 21 1 2, 3 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</note> the Serpent was lifted up for Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers:
<hi>Christ was hanged up for Sinners:</hi> the Serpent was lifted
up for them that were bitten with Fiery Serpents, the fruits of
their wicked Murmuring: <hi>Christ was hanged up for them that are
bitten with Guilt, the rage of the Devil, and the fear of Death, and
Wrath:</hi> the Serpent was hanged up to be looked on: <hi>Christ was
hanged up that we might believe in him, that we might have Faith in
his Blood:</hi> They that looked upon the Serpent of Brass lived;
<hi>They that believe in Christ shall be saved,</hi> and shall never perish.
Was the Serpent then lifted up for them that were good and
Godly? No, but for the Sinners: <hi>So God commended his Love to us,
in that, while we were yet Sinners Christ dyed for us.</hi> But what if
they that were Stung, could not, because of the swelling of their
face, look up to the Brazen Serpent? then without remedy they
dye: <hi>So he that believeth not in Christ shall be Damned.</hi> But might
they not be healed by humbling themselves? one would think
that better then to live by looking up onely: No, onely looking
up did it; when death swallowed up them that looked not. This
then is the Doctrine, <hi>Christ came into the World to save Sinners:</hi>
according to the Proclamation of <hi>Paul, Be it known unto you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Men and Brethren, that through this Man is Preached unto you
the forgiveness of Sins; and by him, all that believe are Justified
from all things, from which they could not be Justified by the Law of
Moses.</hi> The forgiveness of Sins: But what is meant by forgiveness?
Forgiveness doth <hi>strictly</hi> respect the Debt, or Punishment
that by Sin we have brought upon our selves. But how are we by
this Man forgiven this? Because by his Blood he hath answered
the Justice of the Law, &amp; so made amends to an offended Majesty.
Besides, this Man's Righteousness is made over to him, that looks
up to him for Life: Yea, that man is made the Righteousness of
God in him. This is the Doctrine, that the Miracles were wrought
to confirm, and that both by Christ, and his Apostles; and not that
Holiness, and Righteousness, that is the fruit of a feigned Purity
of our Nature.</p>
            <p>Take two or three Instances for all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> came round about him, and said unto him, How long dost
thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. Jesus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
them I told you, and you believed not; the Works that I do
in my Fathers name, they bear witness of me; but ye believe not, because
ye are not of my Sheep, <hi>John</hi> 10. 24, 25, 26.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:32067:31"/>
By this Scripture the Lord Jesus testifies what was the end of
his Words, and wondrous Works; <hi>viz. That men might know that he
was the Christ;</hi> that he was sent of God to be the Saviour of the
World: and that these Miracles required of them, first of all,
that they accept of him by <hi>believing:</hi> (a thing little set by, by our
Author) for in <hi>Pag.</hi> 299. he prefer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>eth his doing Righteousness
far before it, and above <hi>ALL</hi> things else; his words are Verbatim
thus, <hi>Let us exercise our selves unto Real and Substantial Godliness,</hi>
(such as he hath Described in the first part of his Book: <hi>viz.</hi> That
which is the Dictares of his Humane Nature, &amp;c.) <hi>and in keeping
our Consciences vsid of Offence, both towards God, and towards Men;
and in studying the Gospel to enable us, not to Discourse, or onely to
BELIEVE, but also and above ALL things to DOWELL.</hi>
But Believing, though not with this man, yet by Christ and his
wondrous Miracles, is expected first, and <hi>above ALL</hi> things,
from men; and to <hi>do well,</hi> in the <hi>best Sence</hi> (though his Sence
is the worst,) is that which by the Gospel <hi>is to come after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Go into all the World, and Preach the Gospel unto
every Creature; He that Believeth and is Baptized shall be saved;
and he that Believeth not shall be Damned. And these signs shall
follow them that Believe: In my Name shall they cast out Devils,
they shall speak with New Tongues, they shall take up Serpents, and
if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them, &amp;c. <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.
16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Mark you <hi>here,</hi> it is <hi>Believing, Believing;</hi> It is, I say, <hi>Believing</hi>
that is here required by Christ. Believing what? The Gospel;
even good Tydings to Sinners by Jesus Christ; good Tydings of
Good, glad Tydings of good things. Mark how the Apostle hath
it: the glad Tydings is, <hi>that through Jesus is Preached the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Sins; and by him all that BELIEVE are Justified from
ALL things, from which they could not be Justified by the Law of</hi>
Moses. Acts 13. 33â€”39.</p>
            <p>These Signs shall follow them that Believe: <hi>Mark, Signs</hi> before,
<hi>and Signs</hi> after; <hi>and all to Exite</hi> to, <hi>and Confirm the weight</hi> of
Believing. And they went forth and Preached every where; the Lord
working with them, and Confirming the Word with Signs following,
<hi>Amen. Mark</hi> 16. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the
things that we have heard, least at any time we should let them slip.
For if the Word spoken by Angels was stedfast, and every Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:32067:32"/>
and Disobedience received a just Recompence of Reward, how shall
we escape if we neglect so great Salvation? which at the first began to
be spoken by the Lord, and was Confirmed to us by them that heard him;
God also bearing them Witness with Signs and Wonders, and with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Miracles, and Gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Here we are Excited to the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Lord Jesus, under these
Words (<hi>so great Salvation.</hi>) As if he had said, <hi>Give earnest heed,</hi>
the <hi>most</hi> earnest heed, to the Doctrine of the Lord Jesus, because
it is <hi>SO great Salvation.</hi> What this Salvation <hi>is,</hi> he tells us, it is
that which was Preached by the Lord himself; <hi>That God so
loved the World, that he gave his onely Begotten Son, that whosoever
Believed in him should not Perish, but have Everlasting Life,</hi> John 3.
God <hi>SO</hi> Loved, that he gave his Son to be <hi>SO</hi> great Salvation.
Now as is expressed in the Text, to be the better for this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
is,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> to give heed to <hi>hear</hi> it; for <hi>Faith cometh by hearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He saith not, give heed to <hi>doing,</hi> but to the <hi>Word you have
HEARD;</hi> Faith (I say) cometh by <hi>Hearing,</hi> and <hi>Hearing</hi> by
<hi>the Word of God,</hi> Rom. 10. But that this <hi>hearing</hi> is the <hi>hearing of
Faith,</hi> is farther Evident:</p>
            <p>1. Because he speaketh of a <hi>great Salvation,</hi> accomplished by
the Love of God in Christ, accomplished by his <hi>Blood. By his own
Blood he entred into Heaven it self, having Obtained Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
for us,</hi> Heb. 9.</p>
            <p>2. This Salvation is set in Opposition to that which was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
before, by the Ministration of Angels, which Consisted
in a Law of Works; that which <hi>Moses</hi> received to give to the
Children of <hi>Israel.</hi> For the Law (a command to Works and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties)
was given by <hi>Moses; but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn 1.</note>
To live by doing Works is the Doctrine of the Law, and <hi>Moses:</hi>
but to live by <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> is the Doctrine of Christ, and the
Gospel.</p>
            <p>Besides, the threatning being pressed with an <hi>HOW shall we
escape?</hi> Respects still a <hi>Better,</hi> a <hi>Freer,</hi> a more <hi>Gracious Way of Life,</hi>
then either the <hi>Morral,</hi> or <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law; for both these were
long before; but here comes <hi>in another Way,</hi> not that Propounded
by <hi>Moses,</hi> or the Angels, but since by the <hi>Lord himself. How shall
we escape if we neglect so great Salvation?</hi> which <hi>at First began to be
spoken by the Lord, and was Confirmed to us by then that heard
him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:32067:32"/>
Now Mark, It is <hi>this</hi> Salvation, <hi>this SO</hi> great, and Eternal
Salvation, that was obtained by the Blood of the Lord himself:
It was this, even to Confirm <hi>Faith in this,</hi> that the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
himself came down, to Confirm by Signs and Wonders; <hi>God
bearing them Witness, both with Signs and Wonders, and with divers
Miracles, and Gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see, that to establish a Holiness that came from the
First Principles of Morrals in us, or that ariseth from the
Dictates of our Humane Nature, or to drive us back to that
Figurative Holiness that we had <hi>once,</hi> but <hi>lost</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> is little
thought on by Jesus Christ, and as little intended by any of the
Gospel Miracles.</p>
            <p>A Word or two more. The Tribute Money you mention,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 72. was not as you would clawingly Insinuate for <hi>no</hi> other
Purpose, then to shew Christs Loyalty to the Magistrate: But
First, and above all, to shew his Godhead, to Confirm his Gospel,
and then to shew his Loyalty, the which Sir, the Persons you
secretly smite at, have respect for, as much as you.</p>
            <p>Again, Also the Curse of the Barren Fig-Tree, mentioned,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 73. was not (if the Lord himself may be believed) to give
us an Emblem of a Person void of good Works; but to shew his
Disciples the Power of <hi>Faith,</hi> and what a wonder-working thing
that blessed Grace is. Wherefore when the Disciples wondred at
that sudden Blast, that was upon the Tree, Jesus answered not,
Behold and Emblem of one void of Morral Vertues; but, <hi>Verily,
I say unto you, if you have Faith, and doubt not, ye shall not onely do
this which is done to the Fig-Tree, but also if you shall say unto this
Mountain, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the Sea, it shall be done;
and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in Prayer, Believing, ye shall
Receive.</hi> Again, <hi>Mark</hi> saith, <hi>When</hi> Peter <hi>saw the Fig-tree,
that the Lord had Cursed, dryed up from the Roots, he said to his
Master, Behold the Fig-tree which thou Cursed'st is withered away.</hi>
Christ now doth not say as you, this Tree was an Emblem of a
Professor void of good Works; but, <hi>Have Faith in, or the Faith of
God; For, verily I say unto you, whosoever shall say unto this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the Sea, and shall not doubt
in his Heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall
come to pass, he shall have whatsoever he saith: Therefore I say unto
you, what things soever you desire when you pray, believe that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, and you shall have them.</hi> (Mat. 21. Mark 11.) Christ


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:32067:33"/>
Jesus therefore had a higher, and a better end, then that which
you propound, in his cursing the Barren Fig-tree, even to shew,
as himself Expounds it, the mighty power of <hi>Faith;</hi> and how it
lays hold of things in Heaven, and tumbleth before it things on
Earth. Wherefore your Scriptureless Exposition, doth but lay
you even <hi>Solomen</hi>'s Proverb, <hi>The Legs of the Lawe are not equal,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I might Inlarge; but enough of this; Onely here I add, that
the Wonders and Miracles, that attend the Gospel, were wrought,
and are Recorded, to perswade to Faith in Christ By Faith
in Christ, men are Justified from the Curse, and Judgement of
the Law. This Faith worketh by Love, by the Love of God
it brings up the Heart to God,<note place="margin">Ezek. 61.</note> and Goodness; but not by <hi>your
Covenant,</hi> not by Principles of Humane Nature, but of the Spirit
of God; not in a Poor, Legal, Old Covenant, Promiseless, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
Shadowish, Natural Holiness, but by the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>I come now to your Seventh Chapter; but to that I have
spoken briefly already, and therefore here shall be the shorter.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter you say, <hi>that to make Men Holy was the Design
of Christ</hi>'s Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But not with your Described Principles of Humanity,
and Dictates of Humane Nature: He Designed not, as I have
fully proved, neither by his Death, nor Life, to put us into a
Possession of the Holiness which we had <hi>lost,</hi> though the Proof of
that be the business of your Book.</p>
            <p>2. To make men holy, was Doubtless, Designed by the Death
and Blood of Christ: But the way and manner of the Proceeding
of the Holy Ghost therein, you write not of; although the First
Text you mention (<hi>Pag.</hi> 78. 79.) doth fairly present you with it:
For the way to make men inwardly Holy, by the Death and Blood
of Christ, is, First, to Possess them with the Knowledge of this,
that their Sins were Crucified with him; or that he did bear them
in his Body on the Tree: <hi>Knowing this, that our Old Man is Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with him, that the body of Sin might be Destroyed, that henceforth
we should not serve Sin,</hi> Rom. 6. 6. So he dyed for all, that they that
live, should not henceforth live unto themselves (as you would
have them) nor to the Law or Dictates of their own Nature, as
your Doctrine would perswade them; but to him that dyed for
them,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 14.</note> and rose again.</p>
            <p>There are two things, in the right stating of the Doctrine
of the Effects of the Death and Blood of Christ, that do Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:32067:33"/>
Effect in us an Holy Principle, and also a life becoming
such a Mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> For that by it we are set at liberty (by Faith therein)
from the Guilt, and Curse that is due to Guilt, from Death, the
Devil, and the Wrath to come: No Incouragement to Holiness,
like this, like the Perswasion, and Belief of <hi>this;</hi> because <hi>this</hi>
carrieth in it the greatest <hi>expression of Love,</hi> that we are Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Hearing, or Believing; and there is nothing that worketh
on us so Powerfully as Love. <hi>And herein is Love! not that we Loved
God, but that he Loved us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 4. 10.</note> 
               <hi>and gave his Son to be the Propitiation for
our Sins.</hi> He then that by Faith can see that the Body of his Sin did
hang upon the Cross, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> the Body of Christ, and that can see by
that action, Death and Sin, the Devil and Hell, destroyed for him;
'tis he that will say, <hi>Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within
me Bless his Holy Name,</hi> &amp;c. Psa. 103. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Moreover, the Knowledge of this giveth a man to
understand this Mistery, That Christ and himself are united in
one: For Faith saith, <hi>If our Old man was Crucified with Christ,</hi> then
were we also Reckoned in him, when he hanged on the Cross,
<hi>I am Crucified with Christ:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> All the Elect did Mystically hang upon
the Cross in Christ. We then are Dead to the Law, and Sin, First,
by the Body of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4. <hi>Now he that is Dead is free from
Sin; now if we be dead with Christ, we Believe that we shall live with
him, knowing that Christ being raised from the Dead, Dyeth no more,
Death hath no more Dominion over him; for in that he dyed, he
dyed unto Sin once; but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God:
Likewise reckon your selves also dead unto Sin, but alive unto God,
through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> This also <hi>Peter</hi> doth lively Discourse
of, <hi>Forasmuch then</hi> (saith he) <hi>as Christ hath suffered for us in the
Flesh, Arm your selves likewise with the same mind; for he that hath
suffered in the Flesh hath ceased from Sin,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 1, 2. By which
Words he Insinuateth the Mystical Union, that is between Christ
the Head, and the Elect his Body; Arguing; from the Suffering
of a <hi>Part,</hi> there should be a Sympathy in the whole: If Christ
then suffered for us, we were (even our Sins, Bodies and Souls)
reckoned in him, when he so suffered. Wherefore, by his sufferings,
the Wrath of God for us is appeased, the Curse is taken from us:
For as <hi>Adam</hi> by his acts of Rebellion, made all that were in him
Guilty of his Wickedness; so Christ by his acts, and doings of
Goodness, and Justice, made all that were reckoned in him


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:32067:34"/>
good, and Just, also: But as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Transgression did First, and
immediately Reside with, and remain in the Person of <hi>Adam</hi> onely,
and the Imputation of that Transgression to them that sprang
from him; so the Goodness, and Justice, that was accomplished
by the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> First, and Immediately Resideth in him, and
is made over to his also, by the Imputation of God. But again,
As they that were in <hi>Adam,</hi> stood not onely guilty of Sin, by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
but Polluted by the Filth that Possessed him at his fall;
So the Children of the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> do not onely (though first)
stand Just by Vertue of the Imputation of the Personal acts of
Justice, and Goodness done by Christ, but they also receive of
that inward quality, the Grace, and Holiness that was in him,
at the Day of his rising from the Dead.</p>
            <p>Thus therefore come we to be Holy, by the Death, and Blood
of the Lord: This also is the Contents of those other Scriptures,
which abusively you Cite, to Justifie your Assertion, to wit:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the great Errand of Christ in coming into the World, wasâ€”to
put us again into Possession of the Holiness which we had lost:</hi> And that
<hi>onely</hi> Designed the Establishing such a Holiness, as is Sealed Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
in our Natures, and Originally Dictates of the Humane
Nature. The rest of the Chapter being spoken to already, I pass
it, and Proceed to the next.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Eighth Chapter tell us,</hi> That it is onely the Promoting of
the Design of making Men Holy, that is Aimed at by the Apostles,
Insisting on the Doctrines of Christ's Resurrection, Assention, and
coming again to Judgement.</p>
            <p>Though this should be granted, as indeed it ought not; yet
there is not one Sillable in all their Doctrines, that tendeth in the
least to drive Men back to the Possession of the Holiness we had
lost; which is still the thing Asserted by you, and that, for the
Proof of which you make this noise, and adoe. Neither did Christ
at all Design the Promoting of Holiness, by such Principles as
you have Asserted in your Book; neither doth the Holy Spirit of
God, either help us in, or excite us to our Duty, <hi>Simply</hi> from such
Natural Principles.</p>
            <p>But the Apostles in these Doctrines you mention, had far other
Glorious Designs; such as were truly Gospel, and tended to
strengthen our Faith yet farther: As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> For the Resurrection of Christ; They Urge <hi>that,</hi> as an
Undeniable Argument, of his doing away Sin, by his Sacrificing,


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:32067:34"/>
and Death: <hi>He was delivered for our Offences,</hi> because he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the Room, and State of the Wicked, as undertaking
their Deliverance from Death, and the Everlasting Wrath of
God: Now putting himself into their Condition, he bears their
Sin, and dyes their Death; but how shall we know that by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
this Work he did accomplish the thing he intended? The
answer is, <hi>He was raised again for our Justification,</hi> Rom. 4. 25.
even to make it manifest that by the Offering of himself he had
Purged our Sins from before the Face of God. For in that he was
raised again, and that by him, for the appeasing of whose Wrath
he was delivered up to Death; it is evident that the Work for us,
was by him effectually done: <hi>For God raised him up again.</hi> And
hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> calls the Resurrection of Christ, <hi>the sure
Mercies of</hi> David, Act. 13. <hi>And as concerning that he raised him
up from the Dead, now no more to return to Corruption; he saith on this
wise, I will give thee the sure Mercies of</hi> David. For Christ having
Conquered and overcome Death, Sin, the Devil, and the Curse,
by himself, as 'tis manifest he did; by his rising from the Dead; what
now remains for him, for whom he did this, but Mercy and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for ever?</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Resurrection of Christ is that which Sealeth
the truth of our being delivered from the Wrath by his Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to his Ascention, they urge, and make use of that,
for divers weighty Reasons also.</p>
            <p>1. As a farther Testimony yet, of the Sufficiency of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
to Justifie Sinners withal: For if he that undertaketh
the Work, is yet entertained by him, whose Wrath he was to
appease thereby: What is it? but that he hath so compleated <hi>that</hi>
Work. Wherefore he saith, that the Holy Ghost shall Convince
the world, that he hath a sufficient righteousness, and that because
he went to the Father (<hi>John.</hi> 16.) And <hi>they saw him no more,</hi> because
he, went he Ascended up to the Father, was there Entertained,
Accepted, and Imbraced of God. That is an Excellent Word. <hi>He
is Chosen of God, and Precious:</hi> Chosen of God, to be the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
that his Divine Majesty is pleased with, and takes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency
in; God hath Chosen, Exalted, and set down Christ at
at his own Right Hand; for the sweet Savour that he smelled
in his Blood, when he dyed for the Sins of the World.</p>
            <p>2. By his Ascention he sheweth how he <hi>returned Conqueror,</hi> and
<hi>Victor</hi> over our Enemies. His Ascention was his going home, <hi>from


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:32067:35"/>
whence</hi> he came, to deliver us from Death: Now it is said<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that
when he returned home, <hi>or Ascended, he led Captivity Captive,</hi>
Eph. 4. that is, carried them Prisoners, whose Prisoners we were:
He rode to Heaven in Triumph, having in Chains the Foes of
Believers.</p>
            <p>3. In that he Ascended, it was, that he might perform for us,
the Second Part of his Priestly Office, or Mediator-ship. He is
gone into Heaven it self, there, <hi>now to appear in the presence of God
for us.</hi> Wherefore,<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 7.</note> he is able to save to the uttermost, all that
come to God by <hi>him,</hi> (as indifferent a thing as you make it to be)
<hi>seeing he ever-liveth (viz.</hi> in Heaven, whether he is Ascended)
<hi>to make Intercession for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. He Ascended, that he might be Exalted not onely above, but
be made head over all things to the Church. Wherefore now in
Heaven, as the Lord in whose hand is all Power, he Ruleth over,
both Men, and Devils, Sin, and Death, Hell, and all Calamities, for
the good and profit of his Body, the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20, 21.</p>
            <p>5. He Ascended to prepare a place for us, who shall live and
dye in the Faith of Jesus, <hi>John</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>6. He Ascended, because there he was to receive the Holy
Ghost, <hi>the great Promise of the New Testament;</hi> that he might
Communicate of <hi>that</hi> unto his chosen ones, to give them light to
see his wonderful Salvation, and to be as a Principle of Holiness
in their Souls: <hi>For the Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that
Jesus was not yet Glorified.</hi> But when he Ascended on High, even
as he led Captivity Captive, so he received Gifts for Men; by
which Gifts he meaneth the Holy Ghost, and the Blessed and
saving Opperations thereof, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to his coming again to Judgement, that Doctrine
is urged, to shew the benefit, that the Godly will have at that day,
when he shall gather together his Elect, and Chosen, from one
end of Heaven unto the other. As also to shew you what an end
he will make with those, who have not obeyed his Gospel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 8. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis true, all these Doctrines do Forcibly Produce an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and Heavenly life, but neither from your Principles, nor
to the end you Propound; to wit, that we should be put into
Possession of our first, Old Covenant Righteousness, and act from,
Humane, and Natural Principles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:32067:35"/>
Your Ninth Chapter is spent, as you as you suppose, to shew us the
Nature, and Evil of Sin; but because you do it more like a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Philosopher, then a Minister of the Gospel, I shall not much
trouble my self therewith.</p>
            <p>Your Tenth Chapter Consisteth in a Commendation of Vertue,
but still of that, and no other, though Counterfeited for another,
then at first you have Described, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.) even such, which is
as much in the Heathens you make mention of, as in any other
man, being the same both in Root, and Branches, which is Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to be found in all men, even as is Sin and Wickedness it self.
And hence you call it here, <hi>A living up to your feigned highest Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
like a Creature Possessed of a Mind and Reason.</hi> Again, <hi>While
we do thus, we act most agreeable to the right frame and temper of our
Souls; and Consequently most Naturally; and all the actions of Nature,
are confessedly very sweet and Pleasant;</hi> of which very thing you say,
<hi>the Heathens had a very great Sence.</hi> Pag. 113. 114.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No marvel, for it was their Work, not to search the
deep things of God, but those which be the things of a man, and to
Discourse of that Righteousness, and Principle of Holiness,
which was Naturally founded, and found within themselves,
as Men; or, as you say, <hi>as Creatures Possessed with a mind, and
Reason:</hi> But as I have already shewed, all this may be, where
the Holy Ghost and Faith is absent, even by the Dictates, as you
call them, of Humane Nature; a Principle, and actions, when
trusted to that, as much please the Devil, as any Wickedness, that
is committed by the Sons of Men. I should not have thus boldly
Inserted it, but that your self did (<hi>Pag.</hi> 101.) tell me of it: but I
believe it was onely Extorted from you; your Judgement, and
your <hi>Apollo</hi> suit not here, though indeed the Devil is in the right;
for this Righteousness and Holiness which is <hi>our own,</hi> and of <hi>our
selves,</hi> is the greatest enemy to Jesus Christ; the Post, against
his Post, and the Wall, against his Wall. <hi>I came not to call the
Righteous</hi> (puts you <hi>quite</hi> of the World) <hi>but Sinners to Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Eleventh Chapter, is, to shew what a miserable Creature
that man is, that is Destitute of your Holiness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> And I add, as miserable is he, that hath, or knoweth no
better: For such an one is under the Curse of God, because he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth
in the Law of Works, or in the Principles of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which neither can cover his Sins from the sight of God; nor
Possess him with Faith or the Holy Ghost.</p>

to be Imputed to an unrighteous man. <hi>Pag.</hi> 120.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To both which, a little briefly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> God doth not use to
Pardon <hi>Painted</hi> Sinners,<note place="margin">Tim. 1. 15.</note> but such as are <hi>Really so<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Christ dyed for
SINNERS,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> 
               <hi>and God Justifieth the VNGODLY,</hi> even
him that worketh not,<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 3, 4, 5.</note> nor hath no Works to make him Godly.
Besides, Pardon supposeth Sin; now he that is a Sinner<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
is a Wicked man;<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 18, Isa. 33 11.</note> by Nature a Child of Wrath, and as such
an Object of the Curse of God, because he hath broken the Law
of God. But such God Pardoneth; not because they have made
themselves Holy, or have given up themselves to the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or to the Dictates of their Humane Principles, but because
he will be Gracious, and because he will give to his beloved Son
Jesus Christ the benefit of his Blood.</p>
            <p>As to the Second Head<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> What need is there, that the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ should be <hi>Imputed,</hi> where men are Righteous
first? God useth not thus to doe; his Righteousness is for the
<hi>stout hearted, and for them that are far from Righteousness,</hi> Isa. 46.
12, 13.</p>
            <p>The Believing of <hi>Abraham</hi> was, while yet he was Uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
and Circumcision was added, not to save him by, but as a
Seal of <hi>the Righteousness of THAT Faith, which he had being yet
Vncircumcised.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> Now we know that Circumcision in the Flesh, was
a Type of Circumcision <hi>in the heart;</hi> wherefore the Faith that
<hi>Abraham</hi> had, before his outward Circumcision, was to shew us,
that Faith if it be right, layeth hold upon the Righteousness of
Christ, before we be Circumcised inwardly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and this must needs be
so; for if Faith doth <hi>Purifie</hi> the Heart; then it must be there <hi>before</hi>
the Heart is Purified. Now this inward Circumcision is a Seal, or
Sign of this; That that is the onely saving Faith, that layeth hold
upon Christ before we be Circumcised. But he that believeth, before
he be inwardly Circumcised, must believe in another, in a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
without him, and that as he standeth at present in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
Ungodly, for he is not Circumcised; which Faith, if it be
right approveth it self also, <hi>so to be,</hi> by an after Work of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising
inwardly. But, I say, the Soul that <hi>thus</hi> layeth hold on


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:32067:36"/>
Christ, taketh the onely way to please his God, because this is
that also, which himself hath determined shall be accomplished
upon us. <hi>But unto him that worketh, is the Reward, not reckoned of
Grace, but of Debt; but to him that Worketh not, but Believeth
in him that Justifieth the VNGODLY, his Faith is counted for
Righteousness,</hi> Rom. 4. He that is Ungodly hath a want of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
even of the inward Righteousness of Works: But what
must become of him? Let him Believe in him that Justifieth the
Ungodly; because for that purpose there is in him a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
We will now return to <hi>Paul</hi> himself; he had <hi>Righteousness</hi>
before he was <hi>Justified by Christ;</hi> yet he chose to be Justified, <hi>rather</hi>
as an unrighteous man, then as one Indued with so brave a Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.
<hi>That I may be found in him, not having mine own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi>
away with mine own Righteousness; I chuse rather to
be Justified as Ungodly by the Righteousness of Christ, than by
mine own, and his together, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>You Argue therefore like him that desireth to be a Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Law, (nay worse) that neither knoweth what he saith,
nor whereof he Affirmeth. But you say,</p>
            <p>Were it possible that Christ's Righteousness could be imputed to an
Vnrighteous man, I dare boldly affirm that it would signifie as little
to his Happiness, while he continueth so, as would a Gorgeous, and
Splendid Garment, to one that is almost starved, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ,</hi> 1. That Christ's Righteousness is Imputed to men, while
Sinners is sufficiently testified by the Word of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 1,â€”8.
<hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 1,â€”5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 6,â€”9.
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18,â€”21. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15, 16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
            <p>2. And that the Sinner, or unrighteous Man, <hi>is happy in this
Imputation,</hi> is also as abundantly Evident. For,</p>
            <p>1. The Wrath of God, and the Curse of the Law, are both taken
off, by this Imputation.</p>
            <p>2. The Graces, and Comforts of the Holy Ghost, are all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
to, and followers of this Imputation. <hi>Blessed is he, to whom
the Lord will not Impute Sin:</hi> It saith not, that he is Blessed that
hath not Sin to be imputed; <hi>but he to whom God will not Impute them,
he faith,</hi> Therefore the non Imputation of Sin, doth not argue a
non being thereof in the Soul, but a Glorious act of Grace, Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the sufficiency of Christ's Righteousness, to Justifie him
that is yet Ungodly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:32067:37"/>
But what Blessedness doth follow, the Imputation of the
Righteousness of Christ, to one that is yet Ungodly?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Even the Blessing of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to wit, <hi>Grace, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life: For Christ was made the Curse, and Death that was due to
us, as Sinners; that the Blessing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come upon the</hi>
Gentiles, <hi>through Faith in Jesus Christ: That we might receive the
Promise of the Spirit through Faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 13, 14. Now Faith
hath it's eye upon two things, with respect to it's act of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.
First, it acknowledgeth that the Soul is a Sinner, and then
that there is a sufficiency in the Righteousness of Christ, to Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it in the sight of God, though a Sinner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have Believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be Justified by the
Faith of Christ, and not by the Works of the Law. Therefore they that
believe aright,</hi> receive Righteousness, even the Righteousness
of another, to Justifie them, while yet in themselves they are
Sinners.</p>
            <p>Why do they believe in Christ? The answer is, That they
MIGHT be Justified, not because in their own Eyes they are.
They therefore at present stand Condemned in themselves,
and <hi>therefore</hi> they believe in Jesus Christ, that they <hi>might</hi> be set
free from present Condemnation. Now being Justified by his
Blood, as Ungodly, they shall be saved by his Life, that is, by his
Intercession: For whom he Justifieth by his Blood, he saveth by
his Intercession: For by that is given the Spirit, Faith, and all
Grace that preserveth the Elect unto Eternal Life and Glory.</p>
            <p>I Conclude therefore, that you argue not Gospelly, in that you
so boldly Affirm, <hi>that it would signifie as little to the Happiness of
one, to be Justified by Christ's Righteousness, while a Sinner; as would
a Gorgeous and Splendid Garment to one that is ready to perish.</hi> For
farther, Thus to be Justified is Meat and Drink to the Sinner; and
so the beginning of Eternal Life in him. <hi>My Flesh is Meat indeed,</hi>
said Christ, <hi>and my Blood is Drink indeed: And he that Eateth my
Flesh, and Drinketh my Blood, hath Eternal, or Everlasting Life.</hi>
He Affirmeth it once again. <hi>As the living Father hath sent me, and
I live by the Father, so he that Eateth me, even he shall live by me,</hi>
John 6. Here now is a Man an Hungred; what must he feed upon?
Not his pure Humanity, not upon the sound Complexion of his
Soul, nor yet on the Dictates of his Humane Nature, nor those
neither, which you call, <hi>truly Generous Principles:</hi> But upon the
Flesh, and Blood of the Son of God, which was once given for the


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:32067:37"/>
Sin of the World. Let <hi>those then,</hi> that would be saved from the
Devil, and Hell, and that would find a Fountain of Grace in
themselves, first receive, and feed upon Christ, as Sinners, and
Ungodly. Let them believe that both his Body, and Blood, and
Soul, was offered for them, as they were Sinners. The believing
of this, is the Eating of Christ; this eating of Christ, is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Eternal Life, to wit, of all Grace, and health <hi>in</hi> the Soul;
and of Glory to be Injoyed most perfectly in the next World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Twelfth Chapter is to shew,</hi> That Holiness being Perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is Blessedness it self; and that the Glory of Heaven Consisteth chiefly
in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But none of your Holiness, none of that inward Holiness
which we have <hi>Lost</hi> before Conversion, shall ever come to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:

and arising from another Root, then that we shall in Heaven

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Therefore not in the Injoyment of the Divine Nature it
self; For that which in <hi>Substance</hi> is but a bare <hi>Resemblance,</hi> though
it be a most perfect one, is not the thing it self, of which it is a
Resemblance. But the Blessedness that we shall enjoy in Heaven,
in the very <hi>Substance</hi> of it, Consisteth not wholly, nor Principally,
in a Resemblance <hi>of,</hi> but in the Injoyment of God <hi>himself; Heirs
of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 8.</note> Wherefore there shall not be in us a Likeness onely to, but
the very Nature of God: <hi>Heirs of God, and joynt Heirs with Christ,</hi>
Rom. 8. Hence the Apostle tells us, that he <hi>rejoyced in hope of the
Glory of God,</hi> Rom. 5. Not onely in hope of a Resemblance of it.
<hi>The Lord is my Portion, saith my Soul.</hi> But this is like the rest of
your Discourse. You are so in Love with your Adamitish Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that with you it must be God in Earth, and Heaven.</p>
            <p>Who they are that hold, our Happiness in Heaven, shall come
by a <hi>meer fixing our Eyes upon the Divine Perfections?</hi> I know not;
But thus I Read, <hi>We shall be like him:</hi> Why? or how? For we shall
see him as he is. Our Likeness then to God, even in the very
Heavens, will in great part come by the Visions of him. And to
speak the truth, our very entrance into eternal life, or the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of it here, they come to us thus, <hi>But we all</hi> (every one of us


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:32067:38"/>
that shall be saved, come by it onely thus) <hi>with open Face behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as in a Glass, the Glory of the Lord, are changed from Glory to
Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2. Cor. 3. 18.</p>
            <p>And whereas you tell us, <hi>Pag.</hi> 124. <hi>That the Devils themselves
have a large measure of some of the Attributes of God, as Knowledge,
Power,</hi> &amp;c. though themselves are unlike unto him.</p>
            <p>In this you most Prodigiously Blaspheme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Thirteenth Chapter is to shew,</hi> That our Saviours prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Business of making Men Holy, before any other, witnesseth,
that this is to do the best Service to God.</p>
            <p>But still respecting the Holiness, you have in your first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Described, which still the Reader must have his eye upon, it is
false, and a slander of the Son of God. He never intended to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
or Prefer, your Natural Old Covenant, Holiness, <hi>viz.</hi>
that which we had lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> or that which yet from him, in
the Dregs thereof, remaineth in Humane Nature; but that which

            <p>I shall not here again take notice of your 130 Page, nor with
the Error Contained therein, about Justification by Imputed
Righteousness.</p>
            <p>But one thing I observe, that in all this Chapter you have
nothing Fortified what you say, by any Word of God, no though
you Insinuate (<hi>Pag.</hi> 129. and <hi>Pag.</hi> 131.) that some Dissent from
your Opinion. But instead of the Holy Words of God, being as
you Feign, Conscious to your self, you cannot do it <hi>SO</hi> well, as
by another Method, <hi>viz.</hi> The Words of Mr. <hi>John Smith<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you Proceed with his; as he with <hi>Plato</hi>'s, and so wrap you up
the Business.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You come next to an Improvement upon the whole, where
you make a Comparison between the Heathens and the Gospel;
shewing how far the Gospel helpeth the Light the Heathens
had, in their Pursuit after your Holiness. But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of the Gospel, as you have vainly Dreamt, is, to make
Improvement, First of the Heathens Principles; such good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
say you, <hi>as were by the Light of Nature Dictated to them.</hi>
Pag. 133, 134, 135. As,
<q>
                     <p>1. That there is but one God, that he is Infinitely perfect, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>2. That we owe our lives, and all the comforts of them to him.</p>
                     <p>3. That he is our Soveraign Lord.</p>
                     <p>4. That he is to be Loved above all things.</p>
                  </q>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:32067:38"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Seeing all these are, and may be known, as you your
self confess, by them that have not the Gospel; and I add, nor yet the
Holy Ghost, nor any saving Knowledge of God, or Eternal Life:
Therefore it cannot be the Design of Jesus Christ, by the Gospel,
to Promote, or help forward this Knowledge, simply from this
Principle: <hi>viz.</hi> Natural Light, and the Dictates of it. My Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because when Nature is strained to the highest Pin, it is
but Nature still; and so all the improvement of it's Light, and
Knowledge, is but an increase of that which is but Natural. Now,
saith <hi>Paul, The Natural Man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
of God, for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know them,
because they are Spiritually discerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.</p>
            <p>But the Gospel is the Ministration of the Spirit; a Revelation
of another thing then is found in, or can be acquired to, by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish
Principles of Nature.</p>
            <p>I say, a Revelation of another thing; or rather, another disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the same. As,</p>
            <p>1. Concerning the Godhead; the Gospel giveth us another
discovery of it, then is <hi>possible</hi> to be obtained by the Dictates of
Natural Light, even, a discovery of a Trinity of Persons, and
yet Unity of Essence, in the same Deity. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 1, 5, 8.</p>
            <p>2. The Light of Nature will not shew us, that God was in
Christ, Reconciling the World to himself.</p>
            <p>3. The Light of Nature will not shew us, that we owe what
we are, and have, to God, because we are the Price of the Blood
of his Son.</p>
            <p>4. The Light of Nature will not shew, that there is such a
thing as Election in Christ.</p>
            <p>5. Or, that there is such a thing, as the Adoption of Children
to God, through him.</p>
            <p>6. Nor that we are to be saved by Faith in his Blood.</p>
            <p>7. Or, that the Man Christ shall come from Heaven, to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>These things, I say, the Light of Nature teacheth not; but
these things are the Great and Mighty things of the Gospel, and
those, about which it chiefly bendeth it self, touching upon other
things, still as those that are knowable, by a Spirit Inferior to
this of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Besides, as these things are not known by the Light of Nature,
so the Gospel, when it comes, as I also told you before, doth Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:32067:39"/>
in the Soul, another Principle, by which they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
and from which the Soul should act and do, both towards
God, and towards Men; as Namely, the Holy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>Ghost, Faith, Hope,
the Joy of the Spirit, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The other things you mention, <hi>Pag.</hi> 138, 140, 142, 143. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Immortality of the Soul.</p>
            <p>2. The Doctrine of Rewards, and Punishments in the Life to come.</p>
            <p>3. Of the forgiveness of Sin upon true Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> All these things may be Assented to, where yet the Grace
of the Gospel is not; but yet the Apprehension must be such, as is
the Light, by which they are discovered; but the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
cannot discover them, according to the Light and Nature
of the Gospel; because the Gospel Knowledge of them, ariseth also
from another Principle: So then, <hi>these Doctrines are not Cofirmed
by the Gospel, as the Light of Nature teacheth them:</hi> Wherefore,
<hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of the things of the Gospel, and so consequently
of these,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2, 13.</note> he saith, <hi>Which things also we speak, NOT in the
WORDS which MAN'S Wisdom teacheth, but which the
HOLY GHOST teacheth, comparing Spiritual things with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</hi>
As if he shoul say, We speak of God, of the Soul, of the
Life to come, of Repentance, of Forgiveness of Sins, &amp;c. Not as
<hi>Philosophers DO,</hi> nor yet in <hi>their</hi> Light; but as Saints, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and Sons of God; as such who have received, not the Spirit
of the World, but the Spirit which is of God; that we may know
the things that are freely given to us, of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you add (for the Glory of the Gospel)</hi> That we have other
things, which no man could, without Divine Revelation, once have
Dream'd of<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
               <hi>As,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That God hath made miserable Sinners the Objects of such
Transcendent Love, as to give them his onely begotten Son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I must confess, If this one Head had by you been handled
well, you would have Written like a Worthy Gospel Minister.
But you add, <hi>Pag.</hi> 146.</p>
            <p>1. That when Christ was sent, it was to shew us upon what terms
God was Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>nciled to us: viz. By laying before us all the Parts of<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
Holiness, which are necessary to Restore our Natures to his Likeness<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and most Pathetically, moreover to intreat us to do what lyeth or our<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
Parts to put them in Practice, that so to Eternity it may be well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>What these things are, you mention not here; therefore I shall
leave them to be spoken to, under the Third Head.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:32067:39"/>
2. <hi>A Second thing you mention is,</hi> That this Son of God Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon equal terms with Men, becoming the Son of Man, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>rn of a
Woman: (a great Demonstration that God hath a liking to the Humane
Nature.) <hi>But little to the purpose as you have handled it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That the Son of God taught men their Duty, by his own Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and did himself perform what he required of them; and that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
did tread before us EVERY step of that which he hath told us
leadeth to Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Answ. <hi>Now we are come to the point:</hi> viz. That the way to
Eternal Life, is, First of all to take Christ for our example, treading
his step: <hi>And the Reason, if it be true, is weighty;</hi> For he hath trod
every step before us, which he hath told us leads to Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Every step.</hi> Therefore he went to Heaven by Vertue of an
Imputative Righteousness; <hi>For this is one of our steps thither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Every step.</hi> Then he must go thither, by Faith in his own
Blood, for Pardon of Sin; <hi>For this is another of our steps thither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Every step.</hi> Then he must go thither, by Vertue of his own
Intercession at the Right Hand of God, before he came thither;
<hi>For this is one of our steps thither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Every step.</hi> Then he must come to God, and ask mercy for
some great Wickedness, which he had Committed; <hi>For this is also
one of our steps thither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But again, we will Consider it the other way.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Every step.</hi> Then we cannot come to Heaven, before we first
be made accursed of God; <hi>For so was he before he came thither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Every step.</hi> Then we must first make our Body and Soul
an Offering for the Sin of others; <hi>For this did he before he came
thither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Every step.</hi> Then we must go to Heaven for the sake of our
own Righteousness; <hi>For that was one of his steps thither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Sir! What will thy Gallant, Generous mind do here? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
you talk of his being an Expiatory Sacrifice forus, but you
put no more trust to that, then to Baptism, or the Lords Supper;
counting that, with the other two, but things indifferent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>You add again, <hi>That this Son of God being raised from the
Dead, and Ascended to Heaven, is our High Priest there:</hi> But you
talk not at all, of his sprinkling the Mercy Seat with his
Blood, but clap upon him, the Heathens <hi>Demons,</hi> Negotiating
the Affairs of Men with the Supream God; and so wrap up,


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:32067:40"/>
with a testification that it is needless to enlarge on the Point,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 150.</p>
            <p>But to be plain, and in one word to tell you; About all these
things you are Heathenishly dark; there hath not in these 150
Pages, one Gospel truth been Christianly handled by you; but
rather a darkening of truth, by Words without Knowledge.
What Man that ever had Read, or Assented to the Gospel, but
would have spoken (yet kept within the bounds of truth) more
Honourably of Christ, then you have done? His Sacrifice must
be stept over, as the Spider stradleth over the Wasp, his Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
is needless to be Inlarged upon. But when it falleth in your
way to talk of your Humane Nature, of the Dictates, of the first
Principles of Morrals within you, and of your Generous mind to
follow it: Oh what need is there now of Amplifying, Inlarging,
and Pressing it on Mens Consciences! As if that poor Heathenish,
Pagan Principle, was the very Spirit of God within us: And as
if Righteousness done by <hi>that,</hi> was <hi>that,</hi> and <hi>that</hi> onely, that would
or <hi>could</hi> fling Heaven Gates off the Hinges.</p>
            <p>Yea, a little after you tell us, <q>That the Doctrine of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ending
the Holy Ghost, was to move, and Excite us to our Duty; and
to Assist, Chear, and Comfort us in the Performance of it.</q> Still
meaning our close Adhering by the Purity of our Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to the Dictates of the Law, as Written in our hearts as Men.
Which is as false as God is true. For the Holy Ghost is sent into
our Hearts, not to Excite us to a Compliance with our Old and
Wind-shaken Excellencies, that came into the World with us, but
to Write new Laws in our Hearts; even the Law of Faith, the
Word of Faith, and of Grace, and the Doctrine of Remission of
Sins, through the Blood of the Lamb of God; that Holiness might
flow from thence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your</hi> 15th. <hi>Chapter is to shew,</hi> That the Gospel giveth for greater
helps to an Holy Life, then the Jewish Ceremonies did of Old <hi>I Answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Reader must here well weigh, that in the Gospel you
find also, some po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>sitive Precepts, that are of the same Nature
with the Ceremonies under the Law; of which, <hi>that of coming to
God by Christ,</hi> you call <hi>one,</hi> and Baptism, and the Lords Supper,
the other two. So then by your Doctrine, the Excellency of the
Gospel doth not lye in that we have a Christ to come to God by<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
but in things as you feign more substantial. What are they<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
               <q>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Principles of Holiness, <hi>Pag.</hi> 159. Spiritual Precepts, <hi>P.</hi> 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

That height of Vertue, and true Goodness, that the Gospel De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signeth
to raise us to: All which are General Words, falling from
a staggering Conscience, leaving the World, that are Ignorant
of his mind, in a Muse; but tickling his Brethren with the Delights
of their Morral Principles, with the Dictates of their Humane
Nature, and their gallant Generous Minds. Thus making a very
Stalking-horse of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of the Words of
Truth and Holiness, thereby to slay the silly one; making the
Lord of Life and Glory, instead of a Saviour, by his Blood, <hi>the
Instructer, and School-Master onely of Humane Nature, a Chaser
away of evil Affections, and an Extinguisher of Burning Lusts;</hi> and
that not so neither, but by giving perfect Explications of Morral
Precepts, (<hi>Pag.</hi> 17.) and setting himself an Example before them
to follow him, <hi>Pag.</hi> 297.</p>
            <p>Your Sixteenth Chapter Containeth an answer to those that
Object against the Power of the Christian Religion to make Men

            <p>

of the Unholiness of the Professors thereof (<hi>Pag.</hi> 171<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>) <hi>is to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</hi>
had it been Christianly Managed by you, as namely, Mens
Gross<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Unbelief of the truth of it; <hi>for it Effectually<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>Worketh in them
that Believe</hi> (1 Thes. 2. 13.) but that you onely touch, and away,
neither shewing what is the Object of Faith, nor the cause of it's
being so Effectual to that Purpose; neither to you at all treat of
the Power of Unbelief, and how all Men by Nature are shut up
therein, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 32. But presently, according to your Old and
Natural Course, you fall <hi>First,</hi> upon a supposed Power in Men, to
imbrace the Gospel, both by closing with the Promise, and shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the threatning (<hi>Pag.</hi> 172.) farther adding, <q>That mankind
is <hi>Indued with a Principle of Freedom,</hi> and that this Principle is
<hi>as Essential,</hi> as any other <hi>to the Humane Nature</hi> (Pag. 173.)</q> By all
which it is Manifest, that however you make mention of Unbelief,
<hi>because the Gospel hath laid the same in your way;</hi> yet our Old Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,
of the Purity of the Humane Nature, now broken out into
a <hi>freedom of Will,</hi> and that as an Essential of the Humane Nature,
is your great Principle of Faith, and your following of that, as it
Dictateth to you Obedience to the first Principles of Morrals,
the Practice of Faith, by which you think to be saved. That this
is so, must unavoidably be gathered from the good opinion you
have your self of coming to God by Christ: <hi>viz.</hi> That in the


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:32067:41"/>
Command thereof; it is one of these Positive Precepts, and a thing
in it self absolutely considered indifferent, and neither Good nor
Evil. Now he that looketh upon coming to God by Christ, with
such an Eye as this, cannot lay the stress of his Salvation upon
the Faith, or Belief thereof; <hi>Indifferent</hi> Faith, will serve for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi>
things: Yea, a Man must look beyond that, which he Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
is but <hi>one</hi> with the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Laws, but not the same with
Baptism, or the Lord's Supper; for with those you compare <hi>that</hi>
of coming to God by Christ. Wherefore Faith, with you, must be
turned into a Chearful, and Generous Complying with the
Dictate; of the Humane Nature, and Unbelief, into that which
Opposeth this, or that makes the Heart backward, and sluggish
therein. This is also gathered from what you aver of the Divine
Morral Laws, that they be of an Indispensible, and Eternal
Obligation (<hi>Pag.</hi> 8) things that are <hi>good in themselves</hi> (Pag. 9.)
Considered in an Abstracted Notion (<hi>Pag.</hi> 10.) Wherefore things
that are good in themselves, must needs be better then those that
are in themselves but <hi>Indifferent:</hi> neither can a Possitive Precept
make that which of it self is neither Good nor Evil, better then
that which in it's own Nature remaineth the Essentials of
Goodness.</p>
            <p>I Conclude then, by Comparing you with your self, by bringing
your Book to your Book, that you understand neither Faith, nor
unbelief, any farther then by obeying, or disobeying the Humane
Nature, and it's Dictates in Chief; and that of coming to God by
Christ, as one of the things that is indifferent in it self.</p>
            <p>But a little to touch upon your Principle of Freedom, which in
<hi>Pag.</hi> 9. you call <hi>an understanding and liberty of Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ. First,</hi> That there is <hi>no</hi> such thing in Man by Nature,
as <hi>Liberty of Will,</hi> or a Principle of <hi>Freedom,</hi> in the saving things
of the Kingdom of Christ, is Apparent by several Scriptures.
Indeed there is in Men, as Men, a willingness to be saved their
<hi>own</hi> way, even by following (as you) their own Natural Principles,
as is seen by the Quakers, as well as your self; but that there is a
freedom of will in Men, as Men, to be saved by the way wich God
hath Prescribed, is neither asserted in the Scriptures of God,
neither standeth with the Nature of the Principles of the
Gospel.</p>
            <p>The Apostle saith, <hi>The Natural Man receiveth not the things that
be of the Spirit of God.</hi> And the Reason is, not because, not Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:32067:41"/>
because he layeth aside a <hi>Liberty of Will,</hi> but because <hi>they
are foolishness to him</hi> (1 Cor. 2.) Because in his Judgement they are
things of no Moment, but things (as you have imagined of them)
that in themselves are but indifferent. And that this Judgement
that is passed by the Natural Man, concerning the things of the
Spirit of God (of which, that of coming to God by Christ, is the
chief) is that which he cannot but do as a Man; is Evident from
that which followeth; <hi>neither CAN he know them, because they
are Spiritually Discerned:</hi> Neither CAN he know them as a Man,
because they are Spiritually Discerned. Now if he cannot <hi>know,</hi>
them, from what Principle should he <hi>will</hi> them: For Judgement,
or Knowledge must be, <hi>before the Will can act.</hi> I say, again, a Man
must know them to be things in chief, that are Absolutely, and
Indispensibly Necessary, and those in which resteth the greatest
Glory; or else his <hi>Will</hi> will not Comply with them, nor Center,
and Terminate in them, as such, but still count themselves (as you)
though somewhat Convinced that he ought to adhere unto them)
things that in themselves, are onely indifferent, and absolutely
Considered neither Good nor Evil.</p>
            <p>A farther inlargement upon this Subject, will be time enough,
if you shall Contradict.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Another Reason, or cause (which you call an immediate
one of the unsuccessfulness of the Gospel, is, Mens unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
mistaking the Design of it (not to say worse) as to conceive
no better of it, then as a Science, and a matter of Speculation,
&amp;c. <hi>Pag.</hi> 173.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If this be true, you have shewed us the Reason, why
your self have so base and unworthy thoughts thereof: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
coming to God by Christ, be the very chief, first, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and most Essential part of obedience thereto; yet you have
reckoned this but like one of the Ceremonies of the Law, or as
Baptism with Water, and the Lord's Supper, <hi>Pag.</hi> 7, 8, 9. Falling
more Directly upon the Body of the Morral Law, as written in
the Heart of Men, and inclining more to the teaching, or Dictates
of Humane Nature, (which were neither of them both ever any
Essential part of the Gospel) then upon that which indeed is
the Gospel of Christ.</p>
            <p>And here I may (if God will) timely Advertise my Reader,

things;</hi> or, the Doctrine of the for giveness of Sins freely by Grace,
through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus. For to speak
strictly; neither is the Grace of Faith, Hope, Repentance, or
Newness of Life, the Gospel; but rather things that are wrought
by the Preaching thereof; things that are the Effects of it; or its
unseperable Companions, to all them that shall be saved.<note place="margin">Rom. 16</note> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Gospel is said to be Preached in all Nations, for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of Faith: Hope also is called, the Hope of the Gospel, not
the Gospel it self. So again, the Gospel is Preached that Men
should repent, but it is not Preached that men should Gospel.</p>
            <p>But your Gospel, which Principally, or Chiefly Centers in the
Dictates of Humane Nature, and your Faith, which is chiefly a
subjecting to those Dictates, are so far off from being at all, any
near attendants of the Gospel, that they never are urged in the
New Testament, but in order to shew men they have forgotten to
act as men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20, 21. Chap. 2. 14, 15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Your last Reason is, because of several untoward opinions,
the Gospel is very unsuccessful, <hi>Pag.</hi> 175.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But what these opinions are, we hear not; nor how to
shun them you tell us <hi>here</hi> nothing at all. This I am sure, there
are no Men in this day have more opposed the Light, Glory, and
Lustre of the Gospel of Christ, then those (as the Quakers and
others) that have set up themselves, and their own Humanity, as
the Essential parts of it.</p>
            <p>You in Answer to other things add many other Reasons to
prove they are mistaken that count the Gospel a thing of but
mean Operation to work Holiness in the heart: at which you
ought your self to tremble, seeing the Son himself, who is the Lord
of Gospel, is of so little esteem with you, as to make coming
to God by him so trivial a business as you have done.</p>
            <p>Your large Transcript of other mens sayings, to prove the good
success of the Gospel of Old, did better become that People and
age, then you &amp; yours; they being a people that lived in the power
thereof, but you such Bats as cannot see it. That Saying, you
mention of <hi>Rigaltias,</hi> doth better become you and yours: <hi>Those
now adays do retain the Name, and the Society of Christians, which
live altogether Antichristian Lives: For take away Publicans, and
a wretched Rable,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And your Christian Churches, will be la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:32067:42"/>
I shall add to yours another reason of the unsuccessfulness of the
Gospel in our days, and that is, because so many ignorant Sir <hi>Johns,</hi>
on the one hand, and so many that have done Violence to their
former Light, and that have Damned themselves in their former
Anathematizing of others, have now for a long time, as a Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God, been permitted to be, and made the mouth to the
People: Persons whose Lives are Debauched, and who in the
Face of the World, after seeming serious Detestings of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
have for the Love of filthy Lucre, and the Pampering their
idle Carcasses, made Shipwrack of their former Faith, and that
Feigned good Conscience they had. From which number if you,
Sir, have kept your self clear, the less Blood of the Damned will
fall upon your head: I know you not by Face; much less your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Practice; yet I have heard as if Blood might pursue you, for
your Unstable Weathercock Spirit, which doubtless could not but
stumble the Weak, and give advantage to the Adversary to speak
Vilifyingly of Religion.</p>
            <p>As to your Seventeenth and Eighteenth Chapters, I shall say
little, onely I wish that your Eighteenth had been more express
in discovering how far a man may goe, with a notion of the
truth of the Gospel, and yet perish because he hath it not in
Power.</p>
            <p>Onely in your <hi>Inveighing</hi> so much against the <hi>Pardon</hi> of Sin,
while you seem so much to <hi>cry</hi> up <hi>Healing;</hi> you must know that
Pardon of Sin is the beginning of Health to the Soul: <hi>He Pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
our Iniquities, and Healeth all our Diseases,</hi> Psa. 103. 3. And
where he saith, by the stripes of Christ we are healed, it is Evident
that healing beginneth at Pardon, and not Pardon after healing,
as you would rather have it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 24. compare, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. As for
your Comparison of the Plaister, and the Physitians Potion,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 217. I say, you do but abuse your Reader, and muddy the
way of the Gospel. For the first thing of which the Soul is sick,
and by which the Conscience receiveth wounding, it is the guilt
of Sin, and fear of the Curse of God for it. For which is provided
the wounds and Precious Blood of Christ, which Flesh and Blood,
if the Soul eat thereof by Faith, giveth deliverance there-from.
Upon this the filth of Sin appears most odious, for that it hath
not onely at present Defiled the Soul, but because it keeps it from
doing those Duties of Love, which by the Love of Christ it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to endeavour the perfecting of. For Filth, appears Filth;


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:32067:43"/>
that is irksome, and odious to a contrary Principle now implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Soul; which Principle had its Conveyance thither by
Faith in the Sacrifice and death of Christ going before. <hi>The Love
of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge; That if one dyed for
all, then are all Dead; and that he dyed for all, that they which live
should not henceforth live unto themselves, but to him that dyed for
them, and rose again,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14. The man that hath received
Christ, desireth to be Holy, because the Nature of the Faith that
layeth hold on Christ (although I will not say as you, it is of a
Generous mind) worketh by love, and longeth, yea, greatly
longeth that the Soul may be brought, not onely into an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Conformity to his Will, but into his very likeness; and because
that State standeth not with what we are now, but with what we
shall be hereafter: Therefore in this we groan, being burthened
(with that which is of a contrary Nature) to be cloathed upon
with our House which is from Heaven:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 3 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> Which state is not that of
<hi>Adam</hi>'s Innocency; but that which is Spiritual, and Heavenly,
even that which is now in the Lord in Heaven.</p>
            <p>But I will Descend to your Nineteenth. Chapter, it may be
more may be discovered there.</p>
            <p>Your Nineteenth Chapter is to shew; <hi>That a right understanding
of the Design of Christianity (viz.</hi> as you have laid it down) <hi>will
give satisfaction concerning the true Notion.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Of Justifying Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, <hi>Pag.</hi> 221.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Of Justifying Faith;</hi> It is (<hi>say you</hi>) such a Belief of the
truth of the Gospel, as Includes a sincere Resolution of Obedience to all
it's Precepts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> To this I shall Answer; First, that the Faith which we call
Justifying Faith,<note place="margin">2 Pet 1. 1. Iude 20.</note> 
               <hi>is like Precious Faith with all the Elect,</hi> and that
which <hi>is most Holy:</hi> but those Acts of it, <hi>which Respect our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with God from the Curse of the Law that is due for Sin;</hi> are such,
as respect not any good Work done <hi>by us,</hi> but the Righteousness
that <hi>Resideth</hi> in the Person of Christ; and is made ours by the
imputation of Grace. This Faith I say, accounteth him in whom
it is now a Sinner, and without Works; yea, if he have any that
in his own eyes are such, this Faith rejects them, and throweth
them away; for it seeth a Righteousness in the Person of Christ
sufficient; even such as is verily the Righteousness of God. <hi>Now to
him that worketh not, but believeth. Works</hi> and Faith are put <hi>here</hi> in


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:32067:43"/>
oppposition, Faith being considered as Justifying, in the sight of
God from the Curse. The Reason is, because the Righteousness by
which the Soul must thus stand Justified, <hi>is a Righteousness</hi> of God's
<hi>appointing,</hi> not of his <hi>Prescribing us;</hi> a Righteousness that <hi>Intirely</hi>
is Included in the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ. The Apostle also, when he
speaks of God's saving the Election, which hangeth upon the same
Hinge, as this of Justification doth, to wit, on the Grace of
God; he opposeth it to Works; and that, not to this or that sort
onely, but even to <hi>Work,</hi> in the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Work (Rom.</hi> 11.) <hi>If it
be of Grace, then it is no more of Works; otherwise Grace is no more
Grace; but if it be of Works, then it is no more of Grace; otherwise
Work is no more Work.</hi> By this Text, I say, the Apostle doth so
throughly Distinguish between Grace and Works, as that which
so ever standeth in the Case, the other must be Annihilated: If it be
by Grace, then must <hi>Works</hi> be no more, <hi>then it is no more of Works:</hi>
but if it be of Works, then is <hi>Grace</hi> no more, <hi>then it is no more of
Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this, notwithstanding, you urge farther; <hi>That Faith Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,
as it includes, a sincere Resolution,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Although, as I have said before, the <hi>Faith</hi> which is the
<hi>Justifying Faith,</hi> is that of the Holiest Nature, yet in the <hi>Act, by</hi>
which it layeth hold of <hi>Justifying</hi> Righteousness, it respects it,
simply, as a Righteousness offered by <hi>Grace,</hi> or given unto the
Person that by Faith layeth hold thereon as he stands yet ungodly
and a Sinner.</p>
            <p>Faith Justifieth not seperate from the Righteousness of Christ
as it is a Grace in us, nor as it subjecteth the Soul to the obedience
of the Morral Law, but as it receiveth a Righteousness <hi>offered</hi> to
that Sinner, that as <hi>such</hi> will lay hold on, and accept thereof.
<hi>Christ Jesus came into the World to save Sinners,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 30.</note> 
               <hi>by being their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and Righteousness himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you add,</hi> The Faith that Intaileth the Sinner to SO High a
Priviledge as that of Justification, must needs be such as complyeth with
all the purposes of Christ's coming into the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By this supposition, <hi>Faith Justifieth, not by receiving of
the Righteousness that Christ by himself accomplished for Sinners;</hi> but
by falling in with <hi>all</hi> good Works, which because they cannot be
<hi>known,</hi> much less <hi>done,</hi> by the Soul at first, his Faith being
then, as to the perfection of knowledge of Duties, weak, he
standeth still before God unjustified, and so must stand until


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:32067:44"/>
he doth comply with <hi>all</hi> those purposes of Christ's coming into
the World.</p>
            <p>But yet again you recall your self, and distinguish <hi>one</hi> purpose
from the <hi>rest,</hi> as a <hi>grand</hi> one, <hi>Pag.</hi> 222. <hi>And that is to receive Christ
as Lord,</hi> as well as a Saviour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Although the Soul that in truth receiveth Christ,
receiveth him wholly, and intirely as Christ, and not as chopt,
and pul'd in Pieces: Yet I distinguish between the act of Faith,
which layeth hold of Christ for my Justification from the Curse
before God, and the consequences of that act, which are to engage
me to newness of Life. And indeed, as it is impossible for a Man
to be a new Man, before he be Justified in the sight of God; so it
is also as impossible, but that when Faith hath once layed hold on
Christ for Life, it should also follow Christ by Love. But,</p>
            <p>2. Christ may be received at first as Lord, and that in our
Justification, and yet not at all be considered as a Law-giver, for
so he is not the Object of Faith for our Justification with God,
but a requirer of Obedience to Laws, and Statutes of them that
already are Justified by the Faith that receiveth him as Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.
But Christ is as well a Lord <hi>for</hi> us, as <hi>to,</hi> or <hi>over</hi> us, and
it <hi>highly</hi> concerneth the Soul, when it believeth in, or trusteth to
the Righteousness of Christ, for Justification with God, to see
that this Righteousness <hi>Lords it</hi> over Death, and Sin, and the
Devil, and Hell for us: The Name wherewith he shall be called,
is,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord our Righteousness.</hi> Our Righteousness, then is <hi>Lord,</hi>
and Conquerour over all, and we more then Conqerours
through this Lord that loved us. The Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> calls
him <hi>King of Righteousness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> because by his Righteousness he ruleth
as <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> and can reign and <hi>Lord it,</hi> at all times over
all those that seek to seperate us from the presence, and Glory of
God.</p>
            <p>Now, how you will brook this Doctrine I know not; I am sure he
stands in need thereof, that is <hi>Lorded over by the Curse of the Law,
the guilt of Sin, the Rage of the Devil, and the fear of the Death and Hell;</hi>
He, I say, would be glad to know that in Christ there is a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
that <hi>Lords it,</hi> or that Christ, as he is Righteousness, <hi>is
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore Reader, when thou shalt Read or Hear, that Jesus
Christ is Lord, if thou art at the same time under guilt of Sin,
and fear of Hell, then do thou Remember that Christ is Lord


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:32067:44"/>
more ways then one, he is Lord <hi>as he is Righteousness;</hi> he is Lord

Of the same import is that also, <hi>he is a Prince, and a
Saviour,</hi> he is a Prince <hi>as</hi> he is a Saviour; because the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
by which he saveth, <hi>beareth Rule in Heaven, and Earth:</hi> And
hence we Read again, that even when he was in the Combat with
our Sins, the Devils, the Curse, and Death, upon the Cross, he
even in that place made <hi>a shew of them openly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Colos. 2. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>and triumphed over
them.</hi> Now in these things he is Lord <hi>for us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph 4. 8, 9.</note> and <hi>the Captain of
our Salvation;</hi> as also in that he hath Led Captivity Captive;
all which places, with many more, being Testimonies to us, of the
sufficiency of that Righteousness which saveth us from the Justice
of the Law and Wrath of God. But you respect not this his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Lording;</hi> but will have him be a Saviour, as he giveth Laws,
especially those you call <hi>Indispensible,</hi> and <hi>Eternal,</hi> the Morral
Law. You would have him a <hi>Saviour,</hi> as he bringeth us back <hi>to
the Holiness we had lost.</hi> But this is none other then Barbarous
Quakerisme, the stress of their Writing, also tending to no other
purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you tell us,</hi> That you scarcely admired at any thing more in all
your Life, then that any, worthy Men especially, should be so difficulty
perswaded, to receive or imbrace this account of Justifying Faith, and
should perplex, and make intricate, so plain a Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> And doubtless they far more groundedly stand amazed
at such as you, who while you pretend to shew the design of the
Gospel, make the very Essential of it, <hi>a thing in it self indifferent;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12.</note>
               <hi>and absolutely considered neither good nor evil, that makes obedience to
the Morral Laws, more Essential to salvation, then that of going to God
by Christ,</hi> that maketh it the great Design of Christ, <hi>to put us into a
Possession of that promiseless, natural old Covenant holiness which we had
lost long since in Adam,</hi> that maketh as if Christ, rejecting <hi>all other</hi>
Righteousness,<note place="margin">Page 16.</note> or Holiness, <hi>hath Established onely this:</hi> Yea, that
maketh the very Principle of this Holiness to consist <hi>in a sound
Complexion of Soul, the Purity of Humane Nature in us, a habit of
Soul, truly Generous Motives and Principles, Divine Morral Laws,
which were first written in Mens Hearts, and Originally Dictates of
Humane Nature.</hi> All this Villany against the Son of God, with
much more as bad, is Comprised within less then the first sixteen

               </gap>ages of your Book.</p>
            <p>But, say you, what pretence can there be for thinking that Faith is the


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:32067:45"/>
Condition, or Instrument of Justification, as it complyeth with onely
the Precept of relying upon Christ's Merits, for the obtaining of it:
especially when it is no less manifest then the Sun at Noon-day, that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the other Precepts must go before obedience to this: And that
a Man may not rely upon the merits of Christ, for the forgiveness of his
Sins, and he must be presumptuous in so doing, and puts an affront
upon his Saviour too, till he be sincerely willing to be reformed from
them, <hi>Pag.</hi> 223.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That the Merits of Christ, for Justification, are made
over to <hi>that</hi> Faith that receiveth them, while the Person that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
it, stands in his own account, by the Law a Sinner, hath
already been shewed. And that they are <hi>not</hi> by God appointed
for another purpose, is manifest through all the Bible.</p>
            <p>1. In the Type, when the bloody Sacrifices were to be offered,
and an Atonement made for the Soul, the People were <hi>onely</hi> to
confess their Sins over the head of the Bullock, or Goat, or Lamb,
by laying their <hi>Hands</hi> thereon, and <hi>so</hi> the Sacrifice was to be
slain. They were onely to acknowledge their Sins. And observe
it, in the day that these offerings were made, they were <hi>not to
Work all; For he that did any Work therein, was to be cut off from
his People,</hi> Lev. 4. ch. 16. ch. 23.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>In the Antitype thus it runs;</hi> Christ dyed for our Sins; Christ
gave himself for our Sins; He was made to be Sin for us; Christ was
made a Curse for us.</p>
            <p>Yea, but, <hi>say you,</hi> What pretence can there be, that Faith is the
Condition, or Instrument of Justification, as it Complyeth with onely the
Precepts of relying upon Christ's Merits; <hi>that is, first, or before the
Soul doth other things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I say (avoiding your own Ambiguous terms) that it is the
Duty, the indispensible Duty of all that would be saved, <hi>First,
Immediately, now</hi> to close in by Faith with that work of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which Christ by his blood hath purchased for them, as they
are Sinners.</p>
            <p>1. Because God doth <hi>hold it forth,</hi> yea, hath <hi>set</hi> it forth to be
received by us, as such, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23. to 27.</p>
            <p>2. Because God hath <hi>Commanded us</hi> by Faith to receive it as
such, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>And I add, If the Jaylor was altogether ignorant of what
he must do to be saved; and <hi>Paul</hi> yet bids him <hi>then,</hi> before he knew
any thing else, <hi>Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and he should be


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:32067:45"/>
saved,</hi> that then Believing (even Believing on Christ for a
Righteousness to justifie, and save him) must go <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>may,</hi> nay
<hi>ought to be pressed,</hi> even then, when the Soul stands ignorant of what
else he ought to do, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 30, 31, 32.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>you say,</hi> It is evident as the Sun at Noon-day, that obedience
to the other Precepts must go before obedience to THIS; that is, before
Faith in Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This you say; But <hi>Paul</hi> said to the ignorant Jaylor,
that knew nothing of the mind of God in the Doctrine of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
that he should <hi>first</hi> believe on the Lord Jesus Christ; and
<hi>so</hi> should be saved. Again when <hi>Paul</hi> Preached to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
The <hi>first</hi> Doctrine that he delivered unto them was, <hi>That Christ
dyed for their Sins, according to the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 15. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>But what be these other Precepts? Not Baptism, nor the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Lord; for these you say are (as poor and inconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able)
as that of coming to God by Christ, even all three, things
in themselves neither good nor evil, but of an indifferent Nature;
they must be therefore, some more weighty things of the Gospel,
then these possitive Precepts. But what things are they? It is good
that you tell us, seeing you Tacitely forbid all men upon pain <hi>of
Presumption,</hi> and of doing <hi>affront to Jesus Christ,</hi> that they rely not
on the merits of Christ for forgiveness, till they be sincerely willing
to perform them first; yet I find not here one particular Precept
instanced by you: But perhaps we shall hear of them hereafter,
therefore now I shall let them pass.<note place="margin">Page 223.</note> You tell us farther, <hi>that such
a relyance as that, of acting Faith, First, on the Merits of Christ for
Justification, is ordinarily to be found amongst Vnregenerate, and even
the worst of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is but a falshood,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 3.</note> and a slander, for the Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
know him not; how then can they believe on him: Besides,
the worst of men, so far as they pretend Religion, set up <hi>your</hi> Idol
in their hearts; <hi>viz.</hi> their own good meanings, their own good
Nature, the Notions and Dictates of their Nature, living that
little which they do live upon the Snuff of their own Light, the
Sparks of their own fire, and therefore woe unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you add,</hi> How can it be otherwise, then that that act of Faith
must needs have a Hand in Justifying, and the special Hand too, which
distinguisheth it from that which is found in such Persons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. There is no Act of Faith doth more distinguish true
Faith from false, and the Christian from the painted Hypocrite,
then that which first lays hold on Christ, while the Person that


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:32067:46"/>
hath it stands in his own esteem, ungodly; all other like your self,
being fearful and unbelieving (<hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 8.) despise it, and wonder,
and perish (<hi>Act.</hi> 13. 40, 41.)</p>
            <p>2. And this Faith, by thus acting, doth more subdue Sin (though
it doth not Justifie, as subduing, but as applying Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness)
then all the Wisdom and Purity of Humane Nature, or
the Dictates of that Nature, that is found in the whole World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you add farther; What</hi> good ground can Men have for this
fancy, when as our Saviour hath Merited the Pardon of Sin for this
end, that it might be an Effectual motive to turn from it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Although you speak this in great Derision to Faith when
it worketh right, yet know that therefore (seeing you would hear
it) I say, therfore, hath our Saviour merited pardon, and bestowed
it on men freely, and bid them believe or receive it, and have it;
that thereby they might be incouraged to live to him, and
love him, and comply with his commandements. <hi>For scarcely for
a Righteous Man will one dye, yet for peradventure for a good Man
some would even dare to dye: But God commended his love to us, in that
while we were yet Sinners Christ dyed for us. Much more then being
NOW Justified, we shall be saved from Wrath through him.</hi> Now,
as here we are said to be Justified by his Blood, that is, as his
Blood appeaseth the Justice of God; so again, it is said that this
Blood is set forth by God for us to have Faith in it, by the term
of a Propitiation. <hi>Whom God hath set forth to be a Propitiation</hi>) or a
Sacrifice to appease the displeasure of God) <hi>through Faith in his
Blood. To declare at this time his Righteousness, that he might be Just,
and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus,</hi> Rom. 3.</p>
            <p>Again, As we are thus Justified by Blood in the sight of God, by
Faith in it, so also it is testified of his Blood, that it sprinkleth
the Conscience of the faithful, but still onely as it is received by
Faith. But from what is the Conscience sprinkled, but from those
dead Works that remain in all that have not yet been Justified by
Faith in this Blood. Now if Faith in this Blood doth sprinkle the
Conscience, and so doth purge it from all dead Works, then must
Faith go first to the Blood of Christ for Justification, and must
bring this home to the Defiled Conscience, before it be delivered
from those dead Works that are in it, and made Capable of
serving the Living God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7, to 10. <hi>ch.</hi> 3. 24, 25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.
<hi>ch.</hi> 10. 19, 20, 21, 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But you say,</hi> you will never trust your discoursive faculty so long
as you live, if you are mistaken here, Pag. 224.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:32067:46"/>
Tell not me of your discoursive faculty: The Word of God is
plain: And never challenge Man, for he that Condemneth your
way to Heaven, to the very Pit of Hell, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, can yet set
forth a better.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Second thing; <hi>viz.</hi> The Doctrine of the
imputation of Christ's Righteousness, which you thus Expound.</p>
            <p>It Consists in dealing with sincerely Righteous Persons, as if they
were perfectly so, for the sake, and upon the account of Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
Pag. 225, 226.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Any thing but truth; But I would know how sincerely
Righteous they were that were Justified without Works? or how
sincerely Righteous they were, whom God Justified, as Ungodly?
<hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>2. Your Explication of the imputation of Christ's Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
makes it respect our <hi>Works</hi> rather then our <hi>Persons; It Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists,</hi>
say you, <hi>in dealing with sincerely Righteous Persons, as if they
were Perfectly so:</hi> That is, it Justifieth their imperfect Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
First, and so Secondarily their Persons for the sake of that.</p>
            <p>But Observe a few things from this Explication.</p>
            <p>1. This Concludeth that a man <hi>may</hi> be sincerely Righteous
in God's account, WITHOUT the Righteousness of Christ:
for that is to be imputed to <hi>such,</hi> and <hi>none</hi> but such.</p>
            <p>2. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> Concludeth that Men <hi>may</hi> be sincerely Righteous,
BEFORE Christ's Righteousness is imputed: For this sincere
Righteousness is Precedent to the Imputation of Christ's.</p>
            <p>3. This Concludeth that a Man <hi>may</hi> have <hi>true,</hi> yea, <hi>saving</hi>
Grace in great and mighty action in him, before he hath Faith in
the Righteousness of Christ. For if a Man must be sincerely
Righteous first; then he must not onely have that we call the
<hi>Habit,</hi> but the powerful <hi>Acts</hi> of Grace.</p>
            <p>Besides, if the Righteousness of Christ is not to be looked to
<hi>First,</hi> but Secondarily; not <hi>before,</hi> but after we be made sincerely
Righteous; then may not Faith be thus acted if a man should
have it, until he be first a sincerely Righteous Person.</p>
            <p>4. This Concludeth that a Man may be brought from under
the Curse of the Law in God's sight, before he have Faith in the
Righteousness of Christ, yea, before it be imputed to him: For
he that in God's account is reckoned sincerely Righteous, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of his God.</p>
            <p>5. This Concludeth that a Man may be from under the Curse


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:32067:47"/>
of God, without the Imputation of the Righteousness of Christ:
For if a Man must be sincerely Righteous in God's account with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, then he is from under the Curse of God without it.</p>
            <p>6. This Doctrine teacheth farther, that Christ came to call, and
Justifie the Righteous, contrary to his express Word. In short,
By this account of things, first, we must be healed, and then the
Plaister comes.</p>
            <p>Yea, so Confident is this Man in this his Assertion, that he
saith, <hi>it is not possible any other notion of this Doctrine should have truth
in it,</hi> Pag. 226. O this Jesus! this Rock of offence! But he that
believeth on him shall not be Confounded.</p>
            <p>But Blessed be God for Jesus Christ, and for that he took our
Nature, and Sin, and Curse, and Death upon him: And for that
he did also by <hi>himself,</hi> by <hi>one</hi> Offering Purge our Sins. We that
have <hi>believed</hi> have found <hi>rest,</hi> even <hi>there</hi> where God and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath smelled <hi>a sweet savour of rest;</hi> because we are presented
to God, <hi>even now</hi> compleat in the Righteousness of him, and stand
discharged of guilt, even by the Faith of him: Yea, as Sins past,
so Sins to come, were taken up and satisfied for, by that offering
of the Body of Jesus, we who have had a due sence of Sins, and
of the Nature of the Justice of God, we know that <hi>no</hi> Remission
of the guilt of <hi>any one</hi> can be, but by Attonement made by
Blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 22. We also know that where Faith in Jesus
Christ is wanting, there can be neither <hi>good Principle,</hi> nor <hi>good
Indeavour;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14.</note> for Faith is the first of all Graces, and without it
there <hi>is nothing but Sin.</hi> We know also, that Faith as a Grace in us,
severed from the Righteousness of Christ, is onely a beholder of
things, but not a Justifier of Persons, and that if it lay not hold of,
and applyeth not that Righteousness which is in Christ, it carrieth
us no farther then to the Devils. We know that this Doctrine kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
Sin,<note place="margin">Zech. 12 10.</note> and curseth it, at the very roots; I say, we know it, <hi>who have
mourned over him whom WE have pierced,</hi> and who have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
to see that God by his Blood should be pacified towards
us,<note place="margin">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>If any man Sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus
Christ the Righteous, who is the Propitiation for our Sins;</hi> Yet this


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:32067:47"/>

more an abhorrence of it:<note place="margin">Luk. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Yea, she weeps, she washeth his Feet, and wipeth them with the
hairs of her Head, to the confounding of <hi>Simon</hi> the Pharisee,
and all such ignorant Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>But I pass this, and come to the Twentieth Chapter, which is
to learn us by what Measure, and Standard we are to Judge of
Doctrines; and that is, <hi>by the Design of Christianity,</hi> as stated, you
must know, by Mr. <hi>Fowler:</hi> Wherefore it will be requisite here
again, that a Collection of Principles, and Doctrines be gathered
out of this Book, that the Man that hath a short Memory may be
helped the better to bear them in mind, and to make them, if he
shall be so bewitched by them, instead of the Bible, a Standard for
Truth, and a Rule for him to obtain Salvation by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Then he must know that the Principle by which he must
walk, must be the Purity of the Humane Nature, a Divine or
God-like Nature, which yet is but an Habit of Soul, or more
plainly the Morral Law, as Written in the Heart, and Originally
the Dictates of Humane Nature, a Generous Principle, such an
one as although it respects Law, yet acts in a Sphere above it;
above it as a Written Law, that acts even in the first Principles of
it, <hi>Pag.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He must know, that the Holiness Christ designed
to Possess his People with, is that which we had lost in <hi>Adam,</hi>
that which he had before he fell, that Natural Old Covenant
Christ-less Holiness, <hi>Pag.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He must put a difference between those Laws of the
Gospel that are Essential to Holiness, and those Positive Precepts
that in themselves are indifferent, &amp; absolutely considered neither
good nor evil; but must know also that of these Possitive Precepts
he alloweth but three in the Gospel, but three that are purely
such; to wit, <hi>that of coming to God by Christ,</hi> the Institutions of
Baptism, and the Lord's Supper, <hi>Pag.</hi> 7, <hi>and</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He must hold for certain, that the Faith which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituleth
a Sinner to so high a Priviledge as that of Justification,
must needs be such as Complieth with all the purposes of Christ's
coming into the world; (whiter at present it understands them or
not) &amp; it is no less necessary it should Justifie as it doth so, <hi>P.</hi> 222.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He must know that a Man may not rely upon the Merits
of Christ for the forgiveness of his Sins, before he have done other
good Works first, <hi>Pag.</hi> 223.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:32067:48"/>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> And that the right explication of the imputation of
Christ's Righteousness, is this, that it Consisteth in having to do
with persons that are sincerely Righteous, <hi>Pag.</hi> 225. For it is
not possible for Christ's Righteousness to be imputed to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
Man, <hi>Pag.</hi> 120.</p>
            <p>These things, with many like to them, being the main points
by this Man handled, and by him asserted to be the design of
Christianity, by these we must, as by a Rule, and Standard, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
how to Judge of the truth of Doctrines. And (saith he)
<hi>Seeing the Design of Christianity is to make Men Holy,</hi> (still meaning
from Principles of Humanity, and by Possessing us again, with the
often repeated Holiness which we had lost) <hi>whatsoever opinions
do either directly, or in their evident Consequences obstruct the promoting
of it, are perfectly false.</hi> Pag. 227, 228.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Thus with one Word, as if he were Lord, and Judge
himself, he sendeth to the Pit of Hell, all things that Sanctifie, or
make Holy the hearts of Men, if they oppose the Design of <hi>his</hi>
Christianity. But what if the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> will become a Principle
in the hearts of the Converted, and will not now suffer them to
act <hi>simply,</hi> and <hi>alone,</hi> upon the Principles of <hi>pure Humanity;</hi> or
what now if <hi>Faith</hi> will become a Principle to act by, instead of
these that are Originally Dictates of Humane Nature? Or, what
if a Man should act now as a <hi>Son,</hi> rather then simply as a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
indued with a Principle of Reason? I question here, whether
these things thus doing do not obstruct, put by, yea, and take the
way of his Pure Humanity, Dictates of Humane Nature; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
thereof, Act, and Govern the Soul by, and with their own
Principles. For albeit, there be the Dictates of Humane Nature
in the Sons of Men, yet neither is this Nature, nor yet the Dictates
of it, laid by Jesus Christ as the truly Christian Principles in his.
But you add:</p>
            <p>Those Doctrines which in their own Nature do evidently tend to the
serving of THIS design of Christianity, we may conclude are most
True, and Genuine, <hi>Pag.</hi> 229.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Holiness which you so often call the Design of
Christianity, being by your self said to be that which we had
lost, (for this one Sentence is it, on which your whole Book is built
(<hi>P.</hi> 12.) whatsoever Doctrine, or Doctor it be that asserts it, both
that Doctrine is of the Devil, and that Doctor an Angel of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or rather a Minister of Satan, become as a Minister of


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:32067:48"/>
Rigteousness. For where is it said in all the whole Book of God,
that ever the Lord Christ Designed, yea made it his Errand from
Heaven, to put us again in Possession of the Holiness which we
had lost? Yet this you affirm, and tell us the business of your
Book is to prove it: But blessed be God, your shifts are disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
and your Fig-leaves rent from off you, and the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or Holiness so much cryed up by you, proved to be none of
the Holiness of the Gospel, but that which stood with perfect
ignorance thereof. I might speak to what yet remains of falshood,
in the other part of this Chapter; but having overthrown the
Foundation, and broken the Head of your Leviathan; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
falleth of it self, and dyeth of it's own accord.</p>
            <p>What you say of Modes, or Forms, and Sticklers for little
Trifles, such as place their Religion in meer Externals, you may
fasten them where of due they belong: Yet I tell you, the least of
the Commandments of Christ is better then your Adamitish
Holiness.</p>
            <p>Your Twenty first Chapter tells us (if we will believe you) how
we shall Judge of the necessity of Doctrine, to be imbraced, or
rejected; also, you say, it giveth us a brief discourse of the Nature
of Fundamentals. But because your discourse of them is general,
and not any one Particularized, I might leave you in your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
till you dealt more Candidly, both with the Word of God,
and your abused Reader.</p>
            <p>Indeed you tell us of Primary Fundamentals, such as without the
Knowledge, and belief of which it is impossible to acquire that inward
Righteousness, and Holiness which the Christian Religion Aimeth at;
but the Particulars of these, <hi>say you,</hi> I shall not enumerate, because (as
will appear from what will be said anon) it is not needful to have a just
table of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Deep Divinity! <hi>First,</hi> They are such as without the
Knowledge and Belief of them, it is not possible we should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
your true Holiness; and yet for all that it is not needful
that we be told what they are, or that we should have a just Table
of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> But if they be things necessary, things without the
Knowledge of which it is impossible we should be truly Holy,
then is it needful that we understand what they are: Yea, then is
it needful that they be written, and presented one by one unto us,
that our Knowledge of them being distinct and full, we may the


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:32067:49"/>
better be able to obtain or acquire your Glorious (so pretended)
Holiness.</p>
            <p>But I know your Primary Fundamentals, they are your first
Principles of Morrals, not Faith in the Righteousness of Christ,
for that is comprehended in your possitive, and in themselves
indifferent things: Your Morrals are the things in themselves
absolutely necessary, of an indispensible and Eternal Obligation,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
            <p>But Secondly you tell us of Points of Faith that are Secondarily
Fundamental; the disbelief of which cannot consist with true Holiness,
in those to whom the Gospel is sufficiently made known.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Secondary Fundamentals also, are all kept close,
and hid; and not otherwise to be understood, but by implication;
however the disbelief of these is not of so sad a consequence as is
that of the former; because, say you, <hi>They are not in their own
Nature, Holiness,</hi> Pag. 235. Yea, he insinuateth that the disbelief
of them may stand with true Holiness in those to whom the
Gospel is not sufficiently made known.</p>
            <p>Of these Secondary Fundamentals therefore, (whatever is their
number) this is one, even coming to God by Christ; for as in
Page 7, and 9. he calleth it a Possitive Precept, a thing that in
it self is neither good nor evil; so here he speaks of such as are
not in their own Nature Holy; not such, as that Holiness is not
in some degree or other attainable without the belief of them.</p>
            <p>That one of these Secondary Fundamentals is intended by
Mr. <hi>Fowler, that of coming to God by Christ;</hi> I farther gather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>e saith, that <hi>in the number of these, are all such Doctrines, as
are with indisputable clearness revealed to us</hi> (that is, by the Holy
Scriptures of the New Testament, <hi>Pag.</hi> 235.) For therein is this
Revealed to be a Fundamental; but he saith, not a Primary one,
because, that in it self it is but indifferent, and not in it's own
Nature good. <hi>Now the belief of these;</hi> saith he, <hi>though it is not in
it self any more, then in higher, or lower degrees profitable,</hi> (Confusion!
Darkness! Confusion!) <hi>yet it is absolutely necessary from an Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
cause:</hi> That is, with such abundant clearness, as that nothing
can cause men to refuse to admit them, but that which argueth
them to be stark naught.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Then, hence it seems<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that the reason why you admit
these Secondary sort of Fundamentals, is not from any Internal
Power, but an External Declaration onely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:32067:49"/>
2. Nay, and you do but ADMIT them neither, and that
too, for some External cause; not because of the worthiness of
the Nature of the points themselves.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>And were it not, but that you are loath to be counted stark
naught in the eyes of Men, so far as I can descern, you would not
at all make profession of them, with pretence as unto God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> For,
say you,</hi> We must take notice here, that all such Points (viz. these
Fundamentals) are not of equal necessity to be received by all Christians,
because that in regard of the Diversity of their Capacities, Education,
and other means and advantages, some of them may be most plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by some to be delivered in the Scriptures, which cannot be so by
others, with the like ease.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> From these words I take notice of four things.</p>
            <p>1. That by this Universal <hi>(all Christians)</hi> is Comprehended
the Heathen, and Pagan People, that give heed to, and mind to
follow that light, that Originally, and Naturally stirreth them to
Morral Duties. These be they that want the Education, and
Vantages of other, and are not in such a Capacity, as they to
whom these things are delivered by the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>2. That this People, notwithstanding they want a Scripture
Revelation of these Secondary Fundamentals, yet have the more
necessary, the first sort of Fundamentals: For the secondary sort,
say you, are not in their own Nature such, as that Holiness is
not in some degree or other attainable without the belief of them.</p>
            <p>3. That therefore these Secondary sort of Fundamentals, are
onely necessary to be believed by them that have the indisputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
(the Scripture) Revelation of them; and that in truth the
others may be saved without them.</p>
            <p>4. But yet, even those that are made capable by education, and
other advantages, to obtain the belief of them, ought notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
not to have the same respect for them, as for those of
the first sort of Fundamentals, because they are not in their own
Nature such.</p>
            <p>But will this man know that Christ is not onely a Fundamental,
but the very foundation of all other Fundamental truths, reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both in the Old Testament, and the New? and that his pure
Humane Nature, with the Dictates of it, with his feigned Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitish
Holiness is no Fundamental at all; I mean no Fundamental
of Faith, no Gospel Fundamental, 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19, 20.
Yea, will he know that from Heaven there is none other Name


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:32067:50"/>
given, then the Name of Jesus Christ, whereby we must be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
none other Name given under the whole Heavens, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12.</p>
            <p>Oh the Witchcrafts by which some Mens Spirits are Intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted!
and the strength of delusion, by which some are infatuate,
and turned aside from the simplicity that is in Jesus Christ! But I
proceed:</p>
            <p>Your great Question, or rather Urim and Thummim, by which
you would have all men make Judgement of their saveable, or
damnable state, <hi>Pag.</hi> 236. is according to your description of
things, most Devilish and Destructive. For to obey God and Christ,
in all things with you, is to do it from Principles purely Humane
in the Faith of this; that Christ hath designed to possess us
again with that Holiness we had lost. Again, to obey God, and
Christ with you, is, so to obey all their Laws, as respecting
the first Principles of Morrals, and our obedience to them, far
more indispensible then that of coming to God by Christ. Farther,
he that obeys them in all things with your directions, must not
look upon Faith in the Blood of Christ, and Justification by
his Righteousness, as the main and first, but the second part of
our duty; other Commands or Precepts more naturally Holy,
and Good, first being imbraced, and lived in the practise of by,
us.</p>
            <p>This, I say, being the Doctrine you have asserted, and the
Foundation on which your Urim and Thummim stands; the
Foundation, with your tryal are both from the Devil and Hell,
as hath at large been proved, and discovered in this Book.</p>
            <p>And I now will add (and bid you take your advantage) that
should a man with all his might strive to obey all the Morral
Laws, either as they are contained in the first Principles of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
or in the express Decalogue, or Ten Commandments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Faith, First, in the Blood, and Death, and Resurrection of
Christ, &amp;c. For his Justification with God; his thus doing would
be counted Wickedness, and he in the end accounted a Rebel
against the Gospel, and shall be Damned for want of Faith in the
Blood of the Lord Jesus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Twenty Second Chapter saith</hi> That the Design of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity

to be most Zealous for, or against, <hi>Pag.</hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> But there is not by that (it being rightly stated) one
Sillable that tendeth to incourage any Man, to have lower


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:32067:50"/>
thoughts of <hi>coming to God by Christ,</hi> then of keeping the Morral
Law. For even the first Text you bring, doth utterly overthrow
it. <hi>Contend, say you, for the Faith:</hi> I Answer then, not for the
Law of Work; for the Law is <hi>not of Faith,</hi> but the Man that doth
these things shall live in them, by them. <hi>Contend earnestly</hi> for the
Faith, <hi>for there are certain men crept in unawares, which were before
of old ordained unto this Condemnation;</hi> even the Condemnation
that is to come upon them that Contend against the Faith;) for
these ungodly Men turn the Grace of God into Lasciviousness,
and deny the onely Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ. Now
these creeping ungodly Men, may be divided into three Rancks.</p>
            <p>1. Such as by Principle, and Practice both, say, <hi>Let us do
evil, that good may come thereon;</hi> and their Damnation in Just,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>2. Such as by Practice onely, appear to be such, denying to
profess the Principle thereof, such are they that made excuse and
delay, when invited to come to the Wedding, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 1, 2, 3.
<hi>Luke</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>3. There is yet <hi>another</hi> sort; And they are <hi>such</hi> as seem to deny
it, both in Principle, and Practice also; onely they do it <hi>Covertly,
PRIVILY bringing in Damnable Heresies,</hi> even denying the
Lord that bought them. <hi>These bring upon themselves swift de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi>
2. Pet. 2. 1.</p>
            <p>This Third sort, make of the Doctrine of Grace, and of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of Sins, through the Faith of the Righteousness of Christ,
a Loose, and Liscentious Doctrine, or a Doctrine that giveth
liberty to the Flesh: By reason of THESE <hi>the way of truth is
evil spoken of,</hi> and the Hearts of Innocent ones Alienated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from:
<hi>These</hi> will not stick to charge it upon the very chief of the
Brethren, if they shall say, As Sin abounded, Grace hath much
more abounded; that they press men to do evil, that good may
come of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8, 9. But (as I said) these Vilisie Christ, not
with <hi>open</hi> Words, but <hi>Covertly;</hi> PRIVILY they bring in their
Blasphemy under a <hi>Cloak,</hi> crying, the <hi>Law, Holiness, Strictness,
good Works,</hi> &amp;c. Besides, <hi>these</hi> cloath their Doctrines with <hi>Names</hi>
and <hi>Notions</hi> that belong not at all unto them; as of <hi>Christ, Grace,</hi>
the <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Gospel,</hi> when there is onely there, the <hi>Devil,</hi> and
his <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Errours;</hi> as Angels of Light, and Ministers of
Righteousness. Of this last sort, are you, and the subject matter
of your Book; for you bring into the World an Antigospel Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:32067:51"/>
Holiness, Antigospel Principles, and Antigospel Fundamentals;
and that these things might be Worshiped by your Disciples, you
give them the Name of Holiness, the Design of Christ, and of
Christianity; by which means you remove the Christ of God, from
before, and set him behind, <hi>forbiding Men to believe on him, till they
have Practiced your things first:</hi> Nay, after they have Practiced
yours, they then must come to God by him; still respecting the
Principles and Dictates of Humanity, as things of the <hi>greatest
weight,</hi> things that are <hi>good in themselves;</hi> 
               <q>Still considering that
<hi>coming to God by Christ,</hi> is not good in it self, but so, onely upon
the account of certain Circumstances; a thing in it self of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Nature, and absolutely considered neither good nor
evil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, Sir, laying aside all fear of men, not regarding what
you may procure to be inflicted upon me, for this may plain deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with you, I tell you again, that your self is one of them, that
have <hi>Closely, Privily,</hi> and <hi>Devilishly,</hi> by your Book, turned the
Grace of our God into a Lascivious Doctrine, bespattering it
with giving liberty to looseness, and the hardening of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
in Wickedness, against whom shall you persist in your
Wickedness: I shall not fail (may I live, and know it, and be
helped of God to do it) to discover yet farther the rottenness of
your Doctrine, with the accursed tendencies thereof.</p>
            <p>What you say about <hi>doubtful Opinion, alterable Modes, Rites,
and Circumstances in Religion,</hi> Pag. 239. I know none so wedded
thereto as your selves, even the whole gang of your rabling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Clergy; who generally like the <hi>Ape</hi> you speak of, lye
blowing up the Aplause and Glory of your Trumpery, and like
the <hi>Tail,</hi> with your Foolish and Sophistical arguings, you cover
the filthy parts thereof; as you sweetly argue in the next Chapter,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 242. saying, <hi>Whatsoever of such are Commended by the custome
of the place we live in, or commanded by Superiours, or made by ANY
Circumstance convenient to be done, our Christian liberty Consists in
this, that we have leave to do them.</hi> So that do but call them things
indifferent, things that are the customs of the place we live in,
or made by ANY Circumstance convenient, and a man may not
doubt but he hath leave to do them, let him live at <hi>Rome</hi> or
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> or amidst the greatest Corruption of Worship

                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap> doubtless, a <hi>Third</hi> sort of
Fundamentals, by which you can <hi>Wrastle</hi> with Conviction of


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:32067:51"/>
Conscience, and stifle it; by which you can suit your self for every
Fashion, Mode, and Way of Religion. Here you may hop from
Presbiterianism, to a Prelatical Mode; and if time and chance
should serve you, backwards, and forwards again: Yea, here you
can make use of several Consciences, one for this way now, another
for that anon; now putting out the Light of this by a Sophistical
Delusive Argument, then putting out the other, by an argument
that best suits the time. Yea, <hi>how oft is the Candle of the Wicked
put out,</hi> by such glorious Learning as this. Nay, I doubt not,
but a man of your Principles, were he put upon it, would not
stick to count those you call Gospell-possitive Precepts, of no
Value at all in the Christian Religion; for now, even now, you
do not stick to say that, <hi>that</hi> even <hi>that</hi> of going to God by Christ,
is one of these, and that such an one, as if <hi>absolutely Considered</hi> in
it self, is neither good nor evil. How then, if God should cast
you into <hi>Turky,</hi> where <hi>Mahomet</hi> Reigns <hi>as Lord?</hi> It is but recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that it is the Religion, and Custome of the Country, and
that which is Authorized by the Power that is there; wherefore it
is but sticking to your Dictates of Humane Nature, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
that coming to God by Christ is a thing of an <hi>indifferent</hi>
Nature in it self, and then for peace sake, and to sleep in a whole
skin, you may comply, and do as your Superiour commands. Why?
Because in <hi>Turky,</hi> are your first sort of Fundamentals found:
There are Men that have Humane Nature, and the Law of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
written in their hearts; they have also the Dictates thereof
written within them, which teach them, those you call the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Laws of Righteousness; wherefore you <hi>both</hi> would agree in
your Essential, and immutable differences of good and evil,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 6. and differ onely about these possitive Laws, <hi>Indifferent
things.</hi> Yea, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> also for the time, because by a custome
made convenient, might be now accounted worshipful, and the
Circumstances that attend his Worship, especiall <hi>those</hi> of them,
that <hi>clash</hi> not with the Dictates of <hi>your</hi> Humane Nature, might
also be swallowed down.</p>
            <p>Behold you here then (good Reader) a glorious Latitudinarian,
that can, as to Religion, turn and twist like an Eel on the Angle;
or rather like the Weather-cock that stands on the Steeple.</p>
            <p>But (<hi>saith he</hi>) our refusing to comply with these can hardly proceed
from any thing better then a proud affection of singularity, or at best,
from Supersticious Scrupulosity, <hi>Pag.</hi> 242.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:32067:52"/>
Do but believe him therefore in what he saith, and you cannot
chuse but be ready with him to comply with all Modes, that may
serve for advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Besides, he saith,</hi> that the Word Superstition, in the <hi>Greek</hi> imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
a frightful, and over-timerous apprehension of the Divine Nature;
and consequently abase and under-valuing conception of it.</p>
            <p>So that to be tender of Conscience, especially in things of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship, binding up the Soul to the words of the everlasting
Testament, in such things especially, as a Fool can call little, and
insignificant trivial matters, rendreth a man such an one as hath
a very Erronious Conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But he would not be understood (<hi>Pag.</hi> 244.) as if he here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to vilifie things that are plainly commanded,</q> or to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
that which is plainly forbidden, onely he would have all
things that may fall within the reach of these two general Heads,
be examined by this general Rule, HIS discription <hi>of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Christianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But I could tell him, that whatsoever is imposed as a
part of God's Worship, is Judged by a better rule then his, both
as to it's goodness and badness, neither can we account any thing
indifferent that is a part thereof. Besides, whatsoever is reputed
a part of God's Worship, layeth hold on the Conscience of the

                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ly: Although a ranting Latitudinarian may say, <hi>If the Devil
should Preach, I would hear him, before I would suffer Persecution:</hi>
(As a brave fellow which I could name, in his Zeal was pleased to
declare.)</p>
            <p>But <hi>what</hi> trust should any man put to the rule to which you
direct him for help, and relief therein; <hi>seeing</hi> that from the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
to the <hi>end,</hi> from the <hi>top</hi> to the <hi>bottom,</hi> it is a cursed Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Book; a Book that more vilifieth Jesus Christ, then many
of the Quakers themselves: for which of them said worse of him,
and make coming to God by him, a more insignificant thing,
then you by your pretended design of Christianity have done.</p>
            <p>We have therefore a more sure <hi>Word of the Prophets,</hi> to the
which <hi>we do well to take heed;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 19.</note> by which, both your Doctrine,
and practice, is already judged to be naught, as will be farther
discovered time enough, when you shall Justifie or Condemn
Particulars.</p>
            <p>Your Twenty Fourth Chapter I shall now pass by, until I can
better compare you and Popery, against which you there so stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diggle together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:32067:52"/>
               <hi>Your Twenty Fifth Chapter carrieth in it an hideous outcry
against many of</hi> your <hi>Ministers and</hi> Guides, <hi>complaining, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing,</hi>
That nothing hath so conduced to the Prejudice of your Church of
<hi>England,</hi> and done the seperating parties so much service, as the <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous</hi>
lives of some that exercise your Ministerial Function, <hi>P.</hi> 258.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I will grant it, if you respect these poor carnal People,
who yet have been shamed from your Assemblies, by such Vicious
Persons you mention: But the truly Godly, and Spiritually Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
have left you from other Arguments, of which I shall not
here Dilate.</p>
            <p>But from Page 261. to the end of the Chapter, you take upon
you to particularize other of your Ministers that are an offence
to you, and to the Design of your Christianity.</p>
            <p>1. Such as affect to make people stare at their high flown bumbast
Language, or to please their Phantacies with foolish Jugglings, and
Poedantick or Boyish wit; or to be admired for their ability in dividing of
an hair, their Metaphysical Acuteness, and Scholastick subtilety, or for
their Daughty Dexterity in Controversial Squabbles. <hi>And I add, had
you joyned herewith, such as vilifie, and trample upon the Blood
of the Lord Jesus, preferring the Snivel of their own brains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, you had herein but drawn your own Picture, and given
your Reader an Emblem of your self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Second sort you blame, are <hi>such as seek to approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to their Auditories to be Men of</hi> Mysteries, <hi>and endeavour to
make the plain and easie Doctrines of the Gospel as</hi> Intricate <hi>and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure
as ever they are</hi> Able. I will add to these, such as take away
the Doctrine of Faith, and that set themselves and their Works
in the room thereof: Such as have sought to overturn the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
Jesus Christ, and have made coming to God by him, in
it self of a far more indifferent Nature then the Dictates of our
Humanity.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Another sort (you say) are</hi> such as Preach upon free Grace, and
Christian Priviledges, otherwise then as Motives to cite to obedience,
and never scarce insist upon any Duties, but those of believing, laying
hold on Christ's Righteousness, applying the promises, and renouncing
our own Righteousness, which they that have none at all to renounce,
have a mighty kindness for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Who they are that Preach free Grace in your
Church, to excite Men to uncleanness, you may know better then
I. But if these Words (otherwise then to Cite men to obedience) be


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:32067:53"/>
thus thrust in, of purpose thereby to speak evil of the Preachers
of free Grace, and the exalters of the imputed Righteousness of
Christ, then look to it; for such venome Language as this, doth
but involve you within the bowels of that most dreadful Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
concerning the false Prophets of the last days, that shall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
bring in damnable Heresies, even denying the Lord that
bought them.</p>
            <p>2. The Preaching of free Grace, pressing to believing, and
laying hold on Christ's Righteousness, is the most available means
under Heaven, to make Men Holy, and Righteous: 1. Before
God. 2. Then before Men.</p>
            <p>3. The Phreaching of these are first, and principally to <hi>beget</hi>
Faith, to <hi>beget</hi> Life, to <hi>beget</hi> Souls to God; yea, to <hi>beget</hi> in Men
such a Principle, whereby they may serve God acceptably, with
reverence and Godly fear.</p>
            <p>4. But to Preach <hi>free Grace,</hi> doth much condemn your <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will;</hi>
to Preach <hi>Christ's Righteousness</hi> doth utter Curse, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<hi>yours;</hi> and to Preach the <hi>Promise</hi> of Grace, doth quite shut
out a <hi>Covenant of Works:</hi> Therefore no marvel if you, who are
so Wedded to these things, be such an Enemy to free Grace, the
Righteousness of Christ, and the Gospel-promises, that you make
even these things a Characteristical note (first abusing the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of them) of a Church-troubling-Preacher.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>You tauntingly proceed, saying,</hi> Such Preachers also press us
to renounce our own Righteousness, which they that have none at all to
renounce, have a mighty kindness for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Indeed those that have a Righteousness of their own,
as the Pharisees, and Hyprocrites of old, had never much kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for the Doctrine of Grace, and the Ministers of Christ, but
the Publicans and harlots had: and therefore these (while they that
had Righteousness stumbled and fell) entred into the Kingdom of
Heaven. <hi>The Publicans and Harlots entred the Kingdom of Heaven,
before you.</hi> But what Righteousness have you of your own, to
which you so dearly are Wedded, that it may not be let go, for
the sake of Christ?<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note> seeing also so long as you go about to establish
it, <hi>you submit not your self to the Righteousness of God:</hi> Yea, Why
do you taunt those Ministers that perswade us to Renounce our
own Righteousness, and those also that follow their Doctrine?
seeing this was both the Doctrine and Practice of <hi>Paul</hi> and all
others, save onely those that had <hi>Moses</hi> Vail over their Hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:32067:53"/>
               <hi>Another sort of Ministers that you say are Enemies to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of Holiness, are</hi> such as are never in their Element, but when
they are talking of the <hi>Irrespectiveness</hi> of God's Decrees, the <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luteness</hi>
of his promises, the <hi>utter</hi> disability, and <hi>perfect</hi> impotency of
Natural Men, to <hi>do</hi> any thing towards their <hi>own</hi> Conversion, and that
insists with great Emphasis, and Vehemency, upon such like <hi>false,</hi> and
<hi>dangerous</hi> opinions. <hi>Pag.</hi> 262.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Men that Preach these things, being rightly stated,
Preach the truth of God, if the Scriptures may bear sway; they
having all been prooved the truth of the Gospel, both by the
Prophets and Apostles: And when you shall think meet by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to contradict them, either I, or some other may shew you
the folly of your undertaking. In the mean time let the Reader
take notice that here you have judged not by Scripture, nor by
Reason, but upon a bare Presumption, a rising from your Pride or
Ignorance. Wherefore pray you in your next, shew us.</p>
            <p>1. What is in Man that the decree of Election should respect
as a thing fore-seen of God, to prevail with him to predestinate
him to Eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
            <p>2. Make it manifest that in the Word of God there neither is,
nor can be any absolute promise contained.</p>
            <p>3. Shew us what ability there is in a Natural Man, as such,
to do things towards his own Conversion; I mean things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
tending to, and that must infallibly consummate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and let us see what things they are: And know that when you
have well done all this, according to the Scriptures of truth, that
then it will be time enough to condemn the contrary, for false, and
dangerous opinions.</p>
            <p>But shall I speak the truth for you? The reason of this your
presumptuous exclamation, and condemnation of these things,
is because they stand in the way of promoting your ignorant, tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering,
promiseless, and Gospelless Holiness; they stand in the
way of old <hi>Adam,</hi> they stand in the way of your dunghil rebellious
Righteousness, they stand in the way of your freedom of will, and a
great rable more of such like pretended Vertues. Yea, they do, and
must, and shall stand there, when you and the rest of the <hi>Socinians,</hi>
and <hi>Quakers,</hi> have said their all against them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is yet another sort of Preachers whom you condemn, and
so do I as well as you, though not in your Spirit, nor to advance
your Pestiferous Principles: and they are</hi> such as make it their


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:32067:54"/>
great business, to advance the petty interest of any party whatsoever,
and concern themselves more about doing this, then about promoting,
and carrying on that, wherein consists the chief good of all Mankind,
and are more Zealous to make Prosilites to their particular Sects,
then Converts (<hi>I will add first to Jesus Christ, and then</hi>) to an Holy
Life, and press more exact and ridged conformity to their Modes and
Forms, then to the Laws of God, and the Essential Duties of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the Caution which you give to Ministers, because there
wanteth for it, among <hi>you,</hi> a Foundation, is to be esteemed but
an Error, and an abuse of the words, and practices of the Apostle.
And as for your subtile and close incensing the power to persecute
Non-conformists, know that we are willing, God assisting, to
overcome you with truth, and patience, not sticking to Sacrifice
our lives, and dearest concerns in a faithful Witness-baring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
your filthy errors, Compiled and Foisted into the World,
by your Devilish design to promote Paganism, against Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<hi>Pag.</hi> 265, 266.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I come now to your Twenty Sixth Chapter, which is spent to
prove,</hi> that an obedient temper of mind is a necessary, and excellent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
to prepare men for a firm belief, and a right understanding of
the Gospel of Christ, <hi>Pag.</hi> 267.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. For as much as the obedient temper you mention, is
<hi>Precedent to,</hi> or <hi>before Faith,</hi> and the right understanding of the
Gospel, it must needs be also, that which stands with unbelief, and
ignorant of the same. Now that this should be an excellent, and
necessary qualification, to a firm belief, and right understanding
of the Gospel, is altogether without proof, and truth. But this
is affirmed for the farther promoting of your Humane Nature,
and the things that Originally are Dictates thereof. But,</p>
            <p>2. The obedience or inclination to obedience that is before
Faith, or the understanding of the Gospel, is so far off from being
an excellent preparative, or good qualification for Faith, and the
knowledge of the Gospel, that in its own Nature (which is more
then in its Consequences) it is a great obstruction thereto.</p>
            <p>For, while a Man remains faithless and ignorant of the Gospel,
to what doth his obedient temper of mind incline? Not to Faith,
nor the Gospel of Christ; for with these, as yet you suppose he
hath not to doe; therefore he inclineth to the Law of Morrals,
either as it was delivered in Tables of Stone from <hi>Sinai,</hi> or as

written in the hearts of all the Children of Men, to it under the
last consideration, (which is in truth the most Heathen and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan)
to it, as so you intend your obedient temper of mind should
incline, <hi>Pag.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Now this Doctrine being in it self of quite another Nature
then the Doctrine of Faith, and also, <hi>as such,</hi> a Covenant by it
self, it requireth the mind by vertue of it's Commands, to stand
to THAT, and to rest in THAT: For of necessity the heart
and mind of a Man, can go no farther, then it seeth, and hath
learnt; but by this Morral Doctrine, the heart and mind is bound
and limited to it self, by the power of the Dictate to obedience,
and the promise of obtaining the Blessing,<note place="margin">2 Cor 3.</note> when the preceptive
part of it is fulfilled. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that though that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
that was <hi>Written, and Ingraven in Stones,</hi> (which in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the same with this) <hi>is glorious,</hi> yet these imperfections at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
the Man that was in it.</p>
            <p>1. He was but within the bounds of the <hi>Ministration of Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. In this estate he was <hi>blind,</hi> and could not see how to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
therefrom: <hi>The vail is over their h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>art,</hi> so that they could
not heretofore, neither can they now see to the <hi>end</hi> of that which
was commanded, neither to the perfection of the command, nor
their own insufficiency to do it, nor to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Death and Curse of
God, that attended him, that in every thing continued not in
that was Written in the Book of the Law to do them.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Every Lecture, or Reading of this Old Law, is as a fresh
Hood-winking of it's Disciples, and a doubling of the hindrance
of their coming to Christ for life.</hi> But their minds were blinded,
for until this day the same Vail remaineth untaken away, in reading
of the Old Testament, which Vail is done away in Christ; But even unto
this day when <hi>Moses</hi> is read, the Vail is over their Hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6,
<hi>to</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>And let the Reader note, that all these things attend the
Doctrine of Morrals;<note place="margin">Gal. 3 24.</note> the Ceremonies being in themselves more
apt to instruct Men in the Knowledge of Christ, they being by
God's Ordaination, Figures, Shadows, Representations, and
Emblems of him; but the Morrals are not so, neither as Written
in our Natures, nor as Written and Engraven in Stones. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your so highly commended obedient temper of mind (you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
thereby an hearty complyance before Faith, with Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
for Righteousness) is so far off from being an excellent


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:32067:55"/>
temper, and a necessary qualification, to help a Man to a firm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
and right understanding of the Gospel; that it is the most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
way of all ways in the World, to keep a man perpetually blind,
and ignorant thereof. Wherefore the Apostle saith, <hi>that the Vail,</hi>
the Ignorance cannot be taken away, but when the Heart shall
turn to the Lord, that is from the Doctrine of Morrals as a Law
and Covenant in our Natures, or as it was Written, and Ingraven
in Stones, to Christ for mercy to pardon our transgressions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, and for imputative Righteousness to Justifie us from it.
<hi>While</hi> Moses <hi>is Read, the Vail is over the Heart;</hi> that is, while Men
with their minds stand bending also to do it: But mark, <hi>when it,
the Heart, shall turn to the Lord,</hi> or to the Word of the Gospel,
which is the Revelation of him, <hi>then the Vail shall be taken away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence it will not be amiss, if again we consider how the
Holy Ghost compareth, or setteth one against another, these
two Administrations.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Law</hi> he calls the <hi>Letter,</hi> even the Law of Morrals, that
Law that was Written and Engraven in Stones. The other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
he calls the Ministration of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> even that which
Christ offered to the World, upon believing.</p>
            <p>Again, he denyeth himself to be a Minister of <hi>the Law</hi> of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.
He hath made us able Ministers of the New<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Testament; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>
of the <hi>Letter</hi> (or Law) but of the <hi>Spirit</hi> (or Gospel.) The reason
is, for the <hi>Letter,</hi> or Law, can do nothing but kill, Curse, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn,
but the Spirt or the Gospel, giveth life. Farther, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring,
he calls the Law, the <hi>Ministration of Death;</hi> or that which
layeth Death at the Doors of all Flesh; but the Gospel the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of Righteousness, because by this Ministry there is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
of <hi>that</hi> Righteousness that is fulfilled <hi>by the Person</hi> of
Christ, and to be imputed <hi>for Righteousness</hi> to them that believe,
that they might be delivered from the Ministration of death. How
then? hath the Ministration of God <hi>no</hi> Glory? Yes, forasmuch as
it is a Revelation of the Justice of God, against Sin. But yet again,
it's <hi>Glory</hi> is turned into no Glory, when it is compared with that
which <hi>excelleth. For if the Ministration of Death, Written and
Graven in the Stones was glorious, so that the Children of Israel coul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
not stedfastly behold the face of</hi> Moses, <hi>for the Glory of his countenanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
which Glory was to be done away: how shall not the Ministratio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
of the Spirit be rather Glorious: For if the Ministration of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
be Glory, much more doth the Ministration of Righteousness


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:32067:55"/>
exceed in Glory: For even that which was made Glorious hath no Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
in this respect, by reason of the Glory that excelleth,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 9, 10.</p>
            <p>So then, your obedient temper of mind, forasmuch as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth
the Law of Morrals, and that too, <hi>before</hi> Faith, or a
<hi>right</hi> understanding of the Gospel, is nothing else but an obedience
to the Law, a living to Death, and the Ministration of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and is a perswading the World, that to be obedient to
that Ministration, that is not the Ministration of the Gospel, but
holdeth it's Disciples in blindness and ignorance, <hi>in which</hi> it is
impossible Christ should be revealed, is an excellent, yea, a
necessary qualification to prepare Men for a firm belief, and a
right understanding of the Gospel of Christ, which yet even
blindeth, and holdeth all blind that are the followers of that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.
I come now to your <hi>Proof,</hi> which indeed is <hi>no</hi> Proof of this
Antigospel Assertion, but Texts abused, and wrestled out of
their place, to serve to underprop your erronious Doctrine. The
First is, <hi>If any Man will do his will, he shall know of the Doctrine,
whether it be of God, or whether I speak of my self,</hi> John 7. 17. <hi>P.</hi> 268.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This Scripture respecteth not at all the Morral Law,
or obedience to the Dictates of Humane Nature, as an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
qualification precedent to Faith, or that, for the sake of which
God will give Men Faith in, and a right understanding of the
Gospel; <hi>but is it self an immediate exhortation to believing, with a
promise of what shall follow;</hi> as who shall say, The Father hath
sent me into the World to be Salvation to it, through Faith
in my Blood: My Fathers will therefore is, <hi>that Men believe in
me;</hi> and if any will do his will, <hi>he shall know of the Doctrine,</hi> he shall
feel the power thereof, by the peace and comfort that will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
possess the Soul, and by the holy effects that follow.</p>
            <p>That this is the true exposition of this place, will be verified if
you consider, that to do the will of God, in a New Testament
sence, is to be taken under a double consideration. 1. As it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth
Christ. 2. Man.</p>
            <p>1. As it respecteth Christ, so it concerns his compleating the
Redemption of Man by himself, by his own personal performances,
<hi>John</hi> 6. 38, 39. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>2. As it respecteth Man, it doth first, and immediately respect
our believing on him for Remssion of Sins, and Eternal Life.
<hi>And this is the Will of the Father which sent me,</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>that
every one that seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:32067:56"/>
Life, and I will raise him up at the last day,</hi> John 6. 40. This then is
the will of God; That Men do believe in Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Again, when the <hi>Jews</hi> asketh Jesus Christ what they should do,
that they might work the works of God, he did not send them first
to the Morral Precept, or to it's first Principles in the hearts of
Men, by obeying that, to fit themselves for Faith; but immediately
he tells them, <hi>This is the Work of God, that ye believe in him whom he
hath sent,</hi> John 6. 29. <hi>This</hi> is the Work of God; that is, <hi>this is
his Commandement, that we believe in the Name of his Son Jesus
Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and love one another as he gave us Commandement.</hi>
1 John 3. 23. If any Man will do his will, he shall know of the
Doctrine, that is, (as I have said) he shall feel, and have the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thourity
of this Faith in his heart, both to give Peace, and Joy
in his heart, and assurance, and the Sealing of his Soul to Glory.
For all these things come in upon believing, <hi>First</hi> in Christ.</p>
            <p>1. By <hi>Faith</hi> we have <hi>Peace</hi> with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
            <p>2. We have <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> through <hi>Believing, Rom.</hi> 15. 13.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Assurance</hi> comes also through <hi>Believing,</hi> Joh. 6. 69. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22.</p>
            <p>4. Yea, and the Sealings up to Eternal Life; <hi>In whom also after
that ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise,</hi>
Eph. 1. 13.</p>
            <p>5. Sanctification, and a right obedient temper, is not to be
found in Men <hi>before,</hi> but <hi>after</hi> they have believed; <hi>He purified their
hearts by Faith.</hi> Yea, Heaven and Eternal Happiness is promised
to them who are Sanctified <hi>by Faith</hi> which is in Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9.
Chap. 26. 18.</p>
            <p>This <hi>First</hi> Text therefore, hath been by you abused, in that you
have ungodly strained it, (but in vain) to make it warrant your
Heathenish preparations to Faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Second <hi>Scripture;</hi> He that is of God heareth Gods Words; ye
therefore hear them not, because you are not of God, <hi>John</hi> 8. 47.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This Scripture supposeth Men must first be of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can hear God's Word; before they can hear it with
the hearing of Faith; and therefore nothing respecteth those
that before they have Faith, live in the Law of Works; and
least of all, those that become obedient thereto, that thereby they
may obtain everlasting life: For <hi>these</hi> are <hi>not</hi> of God, <hi>not</hi> of him
in a <hi>New Testament</hi> Sence; not <hi>Sons,</hi> because they are born
of Men, of the will of Men, of the Law, and according to the
Wisdom of Flesh and Blood, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:32067:56"/>
               <hi>Your Third Scripture is;</hi> And as many as were ordained to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Life, believed, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48. <hi>Which Text you thus expound:</hi>
That as many of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as were disposed, or in a ready prepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for Eternal Life, believed; that is those which were Proselites of
the Gate, who were admitted by the <hi>Jews,</hi> to the hope of Eternal Life,
and to have a Portion in the Age to come, without submitting to the whole
Law, or any more then owning the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and observing the
Seven Precepts of <hi>Noah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. That obedience to the Morral Law, is not a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
to Faith, or an excellent and necessary qualification to the
right understanding of the Gospel I have proved.</p>
            <p>2. That to be a Jewish Proselite, was to live in the Faith of
<hi>Messias</hi> to come, is the strain of all the Scriptures that have to
deal with them.</p>
            <p>3. But that ordaining men to Eternal Life, respects an act of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> or that the <hi>Jews</hi> did dispence with the <hi>Gentile</hi> Proselites, in
their casting off all their Laws, but the <hi>seven Precepts of</hi> Noah.</p>
            <p>4. Or that God counted this a fit, or forerunning qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Faith in Jesus Christ, neither stands with the Word of God,
nor the Zeal of that People.</p>
            <p>5. Besides, the Words presently following seem to me to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
more; <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Jews,</hi> and Religious Proselites, that
adhered to <hi>Paul,</hi> at his first Sermon, <hi>verse</hi> 43. did Contradict and
Blaspheme at his second, <hi>verse</hi> 45. And moreover, that it was
they that raised Persecution upon him, and expelled him out of
their Coasts, <hi>verse</hi> 50. When the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> even those that were
more Barbarously ignorant at his coming, when they heard that
by Christ there was offered to them the forgiveness of Sins, they
believed, <hi>verse</hi> 48. and Glorified the Word of the Lord. The Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven so disposing such of their hearts, that were before
by <hi>him,</hi> not by <hi>Jews,</hi> ordained to Life. <hi>And as many as were ordained
to Eternal Life, believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you come again in <hi>Pag.</hi> 269. to the Scripture first urged
by you; <hi>If any man will do his will,</hi> &amp;c. and you tell us, That this
must also needs be <hi>implyed, he shall rightly understand the Doctrine
too.</hi> Which word (understand) you so carry, as may best help you, in
case you should meet with an Adversary. As if any should thus
object, that here you have granted that the Words make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of an understanding of the Gospel; yea, require in it the
very <hi>first act of the will;</hi> then you readily shift it, by saying, That


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:32067:57"/>
this is <hi>implyed</hi> onely, suggesting that obedience to Morrals is
<hi>expressed,</hi> and therefore muh <hi>first</hi> be thought on, and done. But if
one of your Brotherhood stop here, and make the objection; then
you add, <q>It is Knowledge, at least, in all the necessary points
thereof, absolutely necessary, and Essential parts;</q> from among
which, you long since did cast out, <hi>Coming to God by Jesus Christ:</hi>
Yea, you add; <hi>That by</hi> (that which you call) <hi>the design of the Gospel,
it may be presumed, that whosoever considereth it, with a design of
being so,</hi> (that is, of living up to Humane Principles, and that
desireth to be possessed again of the Holiness he hath lost; for that
is it, for the proof of which you have Written above 300 Pages,)
<hi>he must needs believe the Gospel to have come from God, and also be
inlightned in the true Knowledge of, at least the necessary points of it;
viz.</hi> All Morral Duties contained therein, which are never a
one of them as such an Essential of the Gospel, but are such Duties
as are consequential to the belief thereof.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (although you feign it) <hi>this honest temper,</hi> as you
call it, will not help you, 1. To judge of the Gospel without
Prejudice; nor, 2. To evidence it with satisfaction; nor, 3. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
those in whom it is, from Error and Delusion; No Man being
more Bruitish or Heathenish, nor so void of satisfaction about it,
nor more involved in Error concerning it, then your self; being
truly what you charge upon others. 1. Grosely ignorant. 2. Too
highly Opinionate. 3. Proud in affection. 4. Lignorish. 5. A
Self-Lover. 6. And for your Blasphemy under the just Judgement
of God. <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost: In whom
the God of this World hath blinded the minds of them that believe not;
least the light of the Glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of
God, should shine unto them,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am come now to your last Chapter,</hi> Pag. 281. <hi>which tells us
wherein</hi> the essence and life of Christianity Censisteth: <hi>viz.</hi> In a good
state and habit of mind, in a holy frame and temper of Soul.</p>
            <p>Answ. 1. <hi>It consisteth in a</hi> Life of Faith, <hi>when I live in the</hi> belief
<hi>of</hi> this, <hi>that Christ loved me, and gave himself for me.</hi> The Life
that I now live in the Flesh (<hi>saith</hi> Paul) it is by the Faith of the Son
of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me:</p>
            <p>2. And besides, a good state and habit of mind, or an Holy frame
and temper of Soul, in your notion of them, which respecteth
purely obedience to Morrals, from Natural Impulses, or Dictates
of our Humanity, they are rather Heathenish then Christian,


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:32067:57"/>
and being alone, end in Death, rather then Life. <hi>As many as are
of the Works of the Law, are under the Curse;</hi> (he saith not, they
that Sin against it, but they that are OF the Works of it) such
as do Justice, Righteousness, Charity, Goodness, Mercy, Patience,
and all kind of Morral Duties, from Principles Humane, Natural,
or as Men, they are under the Curse, because they have sinned
first, and also are in firm and weak in their pursuit after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
they desire. <hi>These follow after Righteousness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 9. 30, 31, 32.</note> but that <hi>flyes</hi>
from them; wherefore they do not obtain it, because they seek it
not by Faith in Christ, but as it were by the Works, the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Good, and Holy Works of the Law. But you add;</p>
            <p>It is such a habit of mind, such a frame<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and temper of Soul, as
esteemeth God as the chiefest good, and preferreth him and his Son Jesus
Christ before all the World; and that prizeth above all things an interest
in the Divine Perfections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. God must needs be esteemed the chiefest good, by
all that have but, and are ruled by the light of Nature; because
they see him by his Works, to be Almighty; Merciful,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 20.</note> and Eternal;
but this may be where the Knowledge of the Man, the Mediator is
not, therefore this, in <hi>this,</hi> and in <hi>your</hi> sence, cannot be of the
Essence of Christianity, for that it is common to all the World.
That estimation of God, which is common to Natural Men, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be of the Essence of Christianity, because they want that
knowledge of him, that comes by Jesus Christ, and so are not
capable to esteem of him under a Christian consideration.</p>
            <p>But; <hi>you say,</hi> it is that good habit, and temper of mind, that prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
God, and his Son Jesus Christ, before all the World.</p>

Law; no, not before your obedience to it, although but by
Humane Principles; Yea, you have accounted the Command of

               <hi>Answ.</hi> Seeing by these expressions you onely intend Morral
Vertues, and those that are inherent in you, and originally ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations

receiveth it after a Gospel manner. For they as Justified persons
are dead to the Law,<note place="margin">Rom 7. Gal. 2 19.</note> as a Covenant of Works, by the Body of
Christ, that they might live to another, even to him that is raised
from the Dead. But you by this Scripture intend not this
Doctrine, for you make Justification by Christ, come after, not
before obedience to the Law: Yea, you make obedience thereto,
the Essential, <hi>and coming to God by Christ,</hi> but a thing of a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote

            <p>
               <hi>In Page</hi> 283. <hi>you speak again of the old Principle, and thus
you comment,</hi> A Principle of Holiness that respecteth Duty, as with
respect to the Nature of the Command, so not with respect to the Duty
as occasioned by certain External Inducements, and Motives, but from
a good temper, and disposition of Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This I say, still respecting your old Principle of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:32067:58"/>
and the Purity of your Nature, the most amounts but to this:
Your Principle is confined to a liberty of Will and Affections,
with respect to doing of the Law of Work, which many have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
to <hi>have,</hi> and <hi>do,</hi> before you, and yet have come short of the
Glory of God. For as I told you before, I tell you now again, that
the Gospel-Principles are the Holy Ghost and Faith, which help
that Soul in whom they dwell, to count believing in Jesus Christ
the great &amp; Essential part of our Christianity, and our reckoning
our selves pardoned, for the sake of him: <hi>And thus being set free

            <p>Your description of a Child of <hi>Abraham,</hi> you meaning in a new

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, That there is, and that which more immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth
our Justification with God, then Ten Thousand such
Commandements; and that is Faith in Christ. Alms-Deeds is also
a blessed Command; yet but <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Second</hi> Table, such as must
flow from Faith going before; Faith I mean that layeth hold on
Christ's Righteousness, if it be accepted of God. For before the
Heart be good, the Action must be naught; now the Heart is good
by Faith, because Faith, by applying Christ's Righteousness,
makes over whole Christ to the Soul, of whose fulness it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth,
and Grace, for Grace, <hi>John</hi> 1. 16. Many things in this
last Chapter, are worthy Reprehension, but because you tell us, in
the last two Pages thereof, is the Sum of all that need to be said,
I will immediately apply my self to what is there contained.</p>

Now I say, as Jesus stood in this Capacity, he dealt with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lse
Law in it is greatest force, and severity, as it <hi>immediately</hi> came
from God, <hi>without</hi> the advantage of a <hi>Mediator;</hi> and stood by his
perfect complying with, and fulfilling every Title thereof. Besides,
as Jesus Christ had <hi>thus</hi> to do with the Law, he did it in order to
his <hi>finishing transgression,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 9. 24.</note> 
               <hi>and putting an end to Sin;</hi> and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
as Mediator, and Undertaker for the World: For his
perfect complying withal, and fulfilling every Title of the Law,
respected nothing his own private person, that he for himself
might be Righteous thereby; for in himself he was eternally Just
and Holy, even as the Father, but it respected us, even us; For
US he was made under the Law,<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4, 5.</note> that <hi>we,</hi> by his fulfilling the
Law, might by him be Redeemed from under the Law, and also
receive the Adoption of SONS. For we having sinned, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
               </gap>nd
transgressed the Law, and the Justice of God, yet requiring
obedience thereto, and the Law being too weak through our Flesh
to do it, God therefore <hi>sent his own Son in the likeness of sinful Flesh;</hi>
who himself for <hi>us</hi> did first of all, Walk in the Law, and then for
Sin suffered also in his Flesh, the Sentence, and Curse pronounced
against <hi>us</hi> by the Law: For it was nothing less necessary, when the
Son of God became undertaker for the Sin of the World, that he
should walk in obedience to the whole of the Precepts of the Law,
to deliver us from the Judgement of the Law; I say it was no less
necessary he should so do, then that he should bear our Curse and
Death: For it would have been <hi>impossible</hi> for him to have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the <hi>last,</hi> if he had not been <hi>Spotless</hi> touching the <hi>first:</hi> For
<hi>therefore</hi> it was impossible he should be <hi>holden</hi> of Death, because he
did <hi>nothing worthy</hi> of Death; <hi>no,</hi> not in the Judgement of the <hi>Law,</hi>


               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:32067:59"/>
to which he <hi>immediately</hi> stood. Now as Christ Jesus stood thus <hi>to,</hi>
and walked in the Law, it is Blasphemy for any to presume to
<hi>imitate him;</hi> because thus to do, is to turn <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker</hi>
for the <hi>Sin</hi> of the World. Besides, whoso doth attempt it,
undertakes an <hi>impossibility,</hi> for <hi>no</hi> Man can stand by the Morral
Law, as it <hi>immediately</hi> comes from the Divine Majesty; he having
<hi>Sinned</hi> first; even <hi>before</hi> he goeth about to fulfil it: And in this
sence is that to be understood, as many as are of the Works of the
Law; are <hi>under</hi> the Curse, held accursed, because they have sinned
first; accursed in their <hi>performances,</hi> because of <hi>imperfection,</hi> and
therefore <hi>assuredly</hi> accursed at <hi>last,</hi> because they come <hi>short</hi> of the
Righteousness thereof.</p>
            <p>1. Christ Jesus did never set himself forth for an example, that
we by imitating his steps in <hi>Morrals,</hi> should obtain Justification
with God, from the Curse of that Law; For this would be to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw,
and utterly abolish the Work which himself came into
the World to accomplish, which <hi>was</hi> not to be our example, that
we by treading his steps might have Remission of Sins, but that
through the Faith of him, through Faith in his Blood we might
be reconciled to God.</p>
            <p>2. Besides, thus to <hi>imitate</hi> Christ, is to make of him a Saviour,
not by <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> but by <hi>example:</hi> Nay, to speak the whole, this
would be to make his <hi>Mediatorship</hi> wholly to center, rather in <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing</hi>
of <hi>Rules,</hi> and <hi>exacting</hi> obedience to <hi>Morrals, then in giving
himself aransome for Men.</hi> Yea, I will add, to <hi>imitate</hi> Christ, as <hi>you</hi>
have prescribed, may be done by <hi>him,</hi> that yet may be ignorant of
the excellency of his Person, and the chief end of his being made
Flesh: For in all these things which you have discoursed in that
fifth Chapter of him; you have onely spoken of that, <hi>something</hi> of
which is apprehended by the light of Nature. Yea, Nature it self
will teach, that men should trust in God, which is the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
Particular that there you mention: Wherefore our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
himself foreseeing, that in Men there will be a proudness, to
contentent themselves with that Confidence, he intimateth that it
would be in <hi>us</hi> insignificant, if it stand without Faith in himself;
<hi>Ye believe naturally in God;</hi> saith he,<note place="margin">John 14. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>Believe also in me.</hi> Faith in Jesus
is as absolutely necessary as to believe immediately in the Divine
being: Yea, without Faith in Jesus, whosoever believeth in God
is sure to perish, and burn in Hell. <hi>If you believe not that I am he,
ye shall dye in your Sins.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 8. 24.</note> And to take Jesus in <hi>Morrals</hi> for <hi>example,</hi>


               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:32067:60"/>
is no where <hi>called</hi> believing <hi>in</hi> him; neither is there one promise of
eternal life, annexed to such a practice. But you say, <hi>If we tread
in his blessed steps, and be such, according to our measure, and capacity,
as we have understood he was in this World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I say, for a Man to confine himself, onely to the life of
the Lord Jesus for an example, or to think it enough to make him,
in his life, a pattern for us to follow, leaveth us, through our
shortness in the end, with the Devil and his Angels, for want of
Faith in the Doctrine of Remission of Sins: For Christ did no
where make another Mediator between God and him, nor did he
ever trust to another Man's Righteousness, to be thereby Justified
from the Curse of the Law, neither did he at all stand in need
thereof, without which <hi>WE must be Damned,</hi> and Perish: Now I
say, these things being no where practiced by him, he cannot
therein be an example to us: And I say again, seeing that in these
things, by Faith in them, is <hi>immediately</hi> wrapped up <hi>our</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with God, it followeth, that though a Man take the
Lord Christ in his whole life, for an <hi>example</hi> in the end, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
he abideth unreconciled to God. Neither will that
clause (and be such) help such a person at all: For Justification
with God, comes not by imitating Christ as exemplary in Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
but through Faith in his Precious Blood. In the Law I read,
that the Paschal Lamb was neither to be eaten <hi>Sodden,</hi> nor <hi>Raw,</hi>
but <hi>Roast</hi> with fire, must it be eaten, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. Now to make Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
Principally to depend upon imitating Christ's Life; it is
to feed upon him <hi>Raw,</hi> or at most as <hi>Sodden;</hi> or Sanctified and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
But the precept is, <hi>Eat it Roast with fire;</hi> is; the Antitype,
as accursed of God for Sin,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> and induring the punishment for
it.<note place="margin">Deut. 33. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> The Law is compared to fire, and it's Curse to a <hi>burning Oven:</hi>
Now under the Curse of this fiery Law,<note place="margin">Mal. 4. 1.</note> was the Lord Jesus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
for the Sins of the World: Wherefore, as <hi>so</hi> considered, our
Faith must lay hold upon him, for Justification with God. <hi>This is
the Law of the Burnt Offering (which was the Offering for Sin;) It is
the Burnt Offering, because of the burning upon the Altar all night, unto
the morning, and the fire of the Altar shall be burning in it,</hi> Levit. 6. 9.
But now I would inquire; Had <hi>Israel</hi> done the Commandment, if
they had eaten the Passover Raw; or Boiled in Water? or if they
had offered that Offering; that was to be burnt as a Sin Offering,
<hi>otherwise</hi> then it was commanded? Even so, to feed upon Christ,
as he is Holy<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and of <hi>good</hi> life <hi>onely;</hi> and also as taking him <hi>therein</hi>


               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:32067:60"/>
for an example to <hi>us,</hi> to follow <hi>his</hi> steps for <hi>Justification with God;</hi>
this is to eat the Passover <hi>Raw,</hi> and not as <hi>Rost</hi> with <hi>Fire;</hi> this is
to <hi>feed</hi> upon Jesus, without respecting him as accursed of God
for our Sin, and so consequently to miss of that eternal life, that
by his Blood he hath obtained for every one that believeth on him.
I have been pleased with this observation, <hi>that none of the Signs
and Wonders in Aegypt, could deliver the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>thence, till
the Lamb was slain, and Roast with fire,</hi> Exod. 12. 1. And I have been
also pleased with this, <hi>that the Father, not</hi> Moses, <hi>gave the Manna
from Heaven, which was a Type of the Flesh, and Blood of Christ,</hi> that
whoso feedeth on, shall live for ever, <hi>John</hi> 6. 32. Yea, Circumcision
also, which was a Type of inward, and Heart-Holiness, <hi>was not of</hi>
Moses, <hi>but of the Fathers,</hi> and Principally a <hi>consequence</hi> of <hi>the Faith
of</hi> Abraham, John 7. 22. Whence I gather, That no Wonder, but
the Blood of Christ can save: That no Kindess, but the Mercy of
God can <hi>give</hi> this to us: And that no <hi>Law,</hi> but the <hi>Law</hi> of Faith,
can make us <hi>truly Holy in heart.</hi> But you add, <hi>Those that sincerely,
and industrously indeavour to imitate the Holy Jesus in his Spirit, and
Actions, can never be ignorant what it is to be truly Christians.</hi> Those
that follow Jesus in his Spirit, must first receive that Spirit from
Heaven, which Spirit is received, as I have often said, by applying
first, by Faith, the Merits of Christ to the Soul, for Life, and Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
with God. The Spirit is <hi>not</hi> received by the <hi>Works</hi> of the
Law, but by the <hi>hearing of Faith;</hi> neither <hi>comes</hi> it in the <hi>Ministry,</hi>
or Doctrine of <hi>Morrals,</hi> but in and by the <hi>Ministry of Faith; and
the Law is NOT of Faith.</hi> Wherefore seeing you have, in Page
223. of your Book, forbidden Sinners to come first to Jesus for
Justification with God; the Spirit you talk of, however you call
it the Spirit Jesus, can be no other then the Spirit of a Man; which
you also your self, in Pag. 7, 8, 9. call the <hi>Purity of Humane Nature,
a Principle of Reason, the first Principles of Morrals, or those that are
Originally Dictates of Humane Nature.</hi> Wherefore by these Words
(in his Spirit) you do but Blaspheme the Holy Ghost, and abuse
your ignorant Reader; calling now (Quaker-like) the Dictates
of your Humanity, and your Socinian Complyances therewith,
the Spirit of Holy Jesus. I conclude therefore, that the way of
Salvation, or the design of Christianity as prescribed by you, is
none other then the Errors of your own brain, the way of Death,
the Sum and Heart of Papistical Quakerism, and is quite denyed
by the Lord Jesus, and by his blessed Testament: And now go your


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:32067:61"/>
ways, and imitate the Lord Jesus, and take the whole History of
his life for your example, and walk in his steps, and be such as
much as you can, yet without Faith in his Blood, first; yea, and if
you stand not Just before God through the imputation of his
Righteousness, your imitating will be found no better then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
because by that, instead of Faith in his Blood, you hope to
obtain remission of Sins, thrusting him thereby from his Office,
and Work, and setting your dunghil Righteousness up, in his stead.</p>
            <p>I come now to Your Conclusion. First, in Page 198. <hi>You pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

You cannot leave off to Contemn and Blaspheme the Son of God.
Do you not yet know that the Righteousness of Christ, on which
the sinner ought to rely for life, is such, as consisted in his standing
to, and doing of the Law, without a Mediator? And would you be
doing this? What know you not, that an Essential of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
he accomplished for Sinners when he was in the World? is,
<hi>That he was Conceived by the Holy Ghost, Born without Sin, did all
things in the Power of, and Vnion with his own eternal God-head.</hi> And
are you able thus to imitate him? Again, the Righteousness on
which we ought to rely for life, is that which hath in it the <hi>Merit
of Blood:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>We are Justified by his Blood, through Faith in his Blood: Is this
the Righteousness you would imitate?</hi> Farther, the Righteousness on
which poor Sinners should rely, is that, for the sake of which, God
forgiveth the Sins of him, that resteth by Faith thereupon. But
would you be imitating of, or accompishing such a Righteousness?</p>
            <p>Your Book Sir is begun in Ignorance, mannaged with Errour,
and ended in Blasphemy.</p>
            <p>Now the God of Glory, if it may stand with his Glory, give you a sight
of your Sins, against the Son of God, that you may as <hi>Saul,</hi> lye trembling,
and being astonished cry out, to be Justified, with the Righteousness of
God, <hi>without</hi> the Law, even <hi>that</hi> which is by Faith of Jesus Christ,
<hi>unto all,</hi> and <hi>upon all</hi> them that believe.</p>

that in those very Principles that are the main (I say,)
and that most immediately concern Christ, Faith, and

Justifying Faith is such a belief of the truth of the Gospel as includeth

Of the Imputation of Christ's Righteousness, this is the true
Explication; It consisteth in dealing with sincerely Righteous
Persons: as if they were perfectly so, for the sake and upon the
account of Christ's Righteousness: The grand intent of the Gospel
being to make us partakers of an inward real Righteousness; and
it being a Secondary one, that we should be accepted, and rewarded,
as if we were compleatly Righteous.</q>

What pretence can there be for thinking that Faith is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
