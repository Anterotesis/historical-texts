            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>FIRST, <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N that by the Order it appoints for the reading of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the greateſt part of Canonicall Scripture is never to be read to the Congregation.</p>
               <p>Contrary to the practiſe of the Church of the Jewes before Chriſt, and of the Primitive Church in the Age next ſucceeding after Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, and of all the beſt Reformed Churches at this day; in none of all which, any part of the Canonicall Scripture was ever commanded to be left out in publike Reading.</p>
               <p>And contrary to the Opinion of Biſhop <hi>Jewell,</hi> who affirmeth <note place="margin">Reply art. 15. Diviſ. 16. pag. 543.</note> that to limit and diet the people what they ought to reade, and what they ought to leave, was ſometimes the Superſtitious diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Rabbins;</hi> herein, ſaith he, wee may ſay, as <hi>Hilary</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95023:3"/>
the Sonne of God hath revealed to us no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And that by the Order it appoints many of the firſt Leſſons are to be taken out of the Apocryphall Books and that under the name of the holy Scripture of the old Teſtament, without any note of difference from the Canonicall, and Commands the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Suſanna</hi> to be read under the name of <hi>Dan.</hi> 13. In which Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Jewes in Babylon are ſaid to have had Judges of their own, and power to put offenders to death, and <hi>Daniel</hi> is ſaid to have beene a young childe when hee executed judgement upon the two falſe witnrſſes; and this is ſaid to have beene done immediatly before the reigne of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and to have bin the meanes wherby <hi>Daniel</hi> grew famous: all which doe evidently ſhew this Story to be fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and untrue, as is obſerved by <hi>Iuntus Lubbertus,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fulke,</hi> Dr. <hi>Whitakers,</hi> Dr. <hi>Willet,</hi> and others.</p>

               <p n="4">4. In that the <hi>Booke of Common Prayer</hi> miſapplyeth ſundry places of Scripture, and that to the countenancing of ſome points of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Doctrine; as for example, to inſtance in one for many, that in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 15. is applied to thoſe children whom <hi>Herod</hi> murdered, which is alſo made more plaine by the Collect which calleth them the witneſſes of God, which confeſſed and ſhewed forth his praiſe.</p>

               <p>And as this might be made manifeſt by Arguments drawne from holy Scriptures, ſo alſo is it confirmed by the judgement of the godly learned of all Churches and ages, to wit, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians

are bound to caſt off the Ceremonies and Religious Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of Pagans, Jewes, Idolators, and Hereticks, and are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ſhun all conformitie with them therein; as we might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the teſtimonies of ancient Fathers, and Counſells; but we will onely produce the judgements of moderne Writers.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p>

of the moſt famous Divines of other Nations, which for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſake I will not ſo much as name.</p>
               <p>Our late Queenes injunctions, require that all Monuments of <note place="margin">Injunc. 23.</note> Idolatry and Superſtition, be ſo utterly extinguiſhed and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there may remaine no memory of them, either in our Churches or houſes.</p>

               <p>Biſhop <hi>Pilkinton</hi> miſliked that we were ſo like the Papiſts in marriage and many other things.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Humphry</hi> profeſſeth plainely, both his deſire and hope of the utter aboliſhing of the Ceremonies, and of all Monuments of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh <note place="margin">In Epiſt. Dedica. vit. Iewell.</note> Superſtition that yet remaine in our Church.</p>
               <p>We abhorre, ſaith Dr. <hi>Fulke,</hi> whatſoever hath but a ſhew of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, we might alſo produce the judgements of Dr. <hi>Andrewes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Greenham,</hi> and others of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Moderne Divines for the proofe of this point in generall. But it will better appeare if we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe three Ceremonies in queſtion ſeverally.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Surplice is notoriouſly knowne to be by the Papiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed <note place="margin">Miſſal. Rom. 3. part. 1. pag. 100.</note> to Superſtition and Idolatry, for the Biſhop when hee hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth any of them, he uſeth to pray thus, that the Prieſt wearing this holy Veſture, may deſerve to be ſhielded and defended, from all aſſaults and temptations of wicked ſpirits.</p>
               <p>And this garment is injoyned to all that are admitted to the very loweſt degree of their Clergie, which they call <hi>primam tonſuram,</hi> and this was it which firſt brought in that cuſtome into the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, that every Student ſhould at certaine times weare the Surplice in <hi>Divine Service,</hi> becauſe they did in their matriculation receive this <hi>Primam tonſuram,</hi> and firſt entrance into the Clergie.</p>
               <p>Neither is the Surplice, onely a badge and ornament of their Prieſthood, but the uſe of it is alſo injoyned in their Idolatrous Maſſe. For all Prieſts that are at Maſſe muſt needs have their Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice on, and indeede ſome Prieſts cannot ſay Maſſe without it, yea they glory in it, as a garment peculiar to their Religion. And therefore have the moſt learned and Judicious of our Divines judged the Surplice to be a Popiſh Maſſing garment, and by this Reaſon they have condemned the uſe of it in thoſe Churches that profeſſe the Goſpell, as namely <hi>Peter Martyr, Bullenger, Brentius, Beza Gualther, Zanchius,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Farrer,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Jewell,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Pilkinton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Humphry,</hi> Dr. <hi>Reynoilds,</hi> and others.</p>

The Signe of the Croſſe alſo is notoriouſly knowne to be abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to Superſtition and Idolatry by the Papiſts; for both <hi>Stapleton,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> doe make it the ſpeciall badge of their Idolatrous Religion, and profeſſe that it is one of the Images to which they give Religious Adoration, yea, they teach, that it is to be worſhipped but they doe no where more abuſe it to Idolatry, than in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, for in Baptiſme they hold that the water hath no ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vertue till it be ſanctified by it, they marke the childe with it as a meanes to drive away the devill, they hold that none can be rightly Baptized, nor have his perfect Chriſtendome without it; and this hath cauſed many of our chiefe Divines to condemne the uſe of it in Baptiſme, as <hi>Beza, Zanchius, Polanus, Napier,</hi> Dr. <hi>Pulke,</hi> Dr. <hi>Reynolds, Thomas Rogers,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>The geſture alſo of kneeling in the very act of receiving the Bread and Wine in the Lords Supper is notoriouſly knowne to have been of old, and ſtill to be abuſed unto Idolatry by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts; for it grew firſt from the perſwaſion of the Reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p>And for this cauſe alſo have our Learned Divines, condemned that geſture, as namely, <hi>Calvin, Peter Martyr,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> Mr. <hi>Beza,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>And beſides this, that theſe Ceremonies have beene abuſed to Idolatry, the evill of them is manifeſt in that they are neither need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nor profitable in the Church, neither unto edification, nor unto the more comely and orderly performance of the duties of Gods Service, and this may appeare, both by the experience of many yeares, whereby it is found, as Mr. <hi>Bucer</hi> alſo obſerved in his time, that there hath been farre leſſe growth of Knowledge and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in thoſe Congregations; where they have beene moſt preciſely obſerved, yea though they enjoyed a Miniſtry of greater learning and gifts, then in thoſe where they have beene wholely left, and eſpecially by this, that neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles, who doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe did performe every thing in their Miniſtry in that manner that was moſt decent and fit for edification, did uſe them.</p>
               <p>And it cannot but grieve many of the godly to ſee theſe things brought into the Service of Chriſt, which have beene ſo defiled by Antichriſt: and of this judgement, is both <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> yea many of our owne Biſhops, and that of late dayes as Dr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi> late Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Dr <hi>Chaderton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Vaughan</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and others in Eccleſiaſticall dignity, doe profeſſe that the Church might well be without them, and that they could wiſh they were taken away, and have ſpoken

very baſely of them, and in their owne Congregations have beene accuſtomed oft times to omit the uſe of them; by all which they have evidently declared, that they doe not in their conſcience thinke them fit or profitable to edifie the Church by the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or orderly performance of the Service of God.

The 36 Article of Religion. Touching the Booke of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of Archbiſhops and Biſhops, and of ordering Prieſts and Deacons, it is not to be allowed, nor acknowledged, to be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Word of God, For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not one Miniſter of forty, doth know what that booke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth, nor how to come to the ſight of it. <note place="margin">Few have ſeene the Book Defects.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It doth not (whereas that Article ſaith it doth) containe all things that are neceſſary, but omitteth ſundry things which (by the Ordinance of God) ought to be obſerved in the Ordination of Miniſters. For</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The examination of the life and learning of the Deacon and Prieſt, is committed onely to the Arch-deacon.</item>
                  <item>2 The voices and conſent of the people, over whom the Miniſter is to be ſet, is not (by this Book) required to his election and calling.</item>
                  <item>3. The Ordination of the Deacon by impoſition of hands, is permitted to one man, viz. the Biſhop.</item>
                  <item>4. The Prieſt receiveth in his Ordination no authority to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne the flocke and exerciſe the Diſcipline of Chriſt, but onely to Preach the Word, and adminiſter the Sacraments.</item>
                  <item>5. Some manifeſt untruths are avouched in it, (whereas the Article ſaith, it hath in it nothing that is of it ſelfe ungodly.) As</item>

               <p n="1">1. When it is ſaid, that it is evident to all men diligently reading <note place="margin">Manifeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths.</note> the holy Scriptures, and ancient Writers, that from the Apoſtles times, there have beene theſe Orders of Miniſters in Chriſts Church, <hi>viz.</hi> Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Where it is ſaid, that this Realme hath received the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Chriſt, as the Lord hath commanded; whereas God hath commanded there ſhould be governing Elders to exerciſe the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of Chriſt in each Congregation, which our Realme hath not as yet received.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where it is ſaid, that God did inſpire the holy Apoſtles to chooſe S. <hi>Steven</hi> into the Order of Deacons which is mentioned in this Booke, and that the Deacons, then to be ordered, are called to the like Office and adminiſtration that <hi>Steven</hi> was called unto.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some places of holy Scripture are perverted in it. As <note place="margin">Scripture perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>

               <p n="3">3. It containeth ſundry Popiſh errors and Superſtitions, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <note place="margin">Popiſh errors and Superſtitions.</note> the Article ſaith, it hath in it nothing, that of it ſelfe is Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. As</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95023:8"/>
1. That it alloweth and eſtabliſheth the Offices of Archdeacons and <hi>Archbiſhops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Deacons, Prieſts, Biſhops,</hi> and Archbyſhops are made ſeverall Orders, and degrees of Miniſtery.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Miniſter of the Goſpell is uſually called Prieſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That it ordaineth an Office of Deaconſhip with charge to read Homilies, preach the Word, and adminiſter Baptiſme.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the Lords Supper is dignified above Baptiſme, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation above both, when the Deacon is permitted to baptiſe, and not to adminiſter the Lords Supper, the Prieſt to Miniſter both Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, the Biſhop only to confirme.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That private and ſecret prayer is preferred before publike, and that in a publicke place and action. For the Congregation is deſired (even in the midſt of the ſolemne action in Ordination of a Prieſt) ſecretly in their prayers to make humble Supplications to God for the foreſaid things. For the which Prayers there ſhall be a certaine ſpace kept in ſilence: that done, the Biſhop is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to pray againe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Sundry things in it are abſurdly ſpoken and directly againſt <note place="margin">Abſurdities.</note> that which is done and practiſed (and to ſpeake ſo ſpecially in ſo holy and ſolemne an action is a wicked thing.) As</p>
               <p n="1">1. When in the Ordination of a Deacon, it is ſaid, <hi>Take thou au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to preach, if thou ſhalt be called thereunto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. When both in the Ordination of the Deacon &amp; of the Prieſt, the B. requireth the Congregation to deliver whether they can ſay ought againſt the party to be ordained, whereas it is wel known, that the Biſhop uſeth ſeldome or never to give orders in a publike Congregation; and if hee doth at any time, it is in ſuch an one, where the people is altogether unacquainted with the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them that are to be ordained.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the Prieſt is asked whether he will give his faithfull diligence alwayes to miniſter the Doctrine and Sacraments, and Diſcipline of Chriſt, as the Lord hath commanded, whereas it is well known that no Miniſter is allowed to exerciſe the diſcipline of Chriſt, as the Lord hath commanded.</p>
               <p>And theſe faults there are in that Booke of Ordination which is of the laſt Edition and moſt reformed. In the former Edition (which ſeemes by the words of the 36. Article to be, that we are required to ſubſcribe unto, and which it may be, ſome of the Biſhops doe ſtill uſe) there are other corruptions, As</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Cope, Albe, Surplice, Tunicle, and Paſtorall Staffe are appointed to be uſed in Ordination and conſecration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Oath of Supremacy is thus concluded. <hi>So helpe mee God and all Saines, and the holy Evangeliſts.</hi>
