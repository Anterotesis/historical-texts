         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>And therefore
I deſire thee, Reader, to keep thy Mind near to the Light of Jeſus

                     </gap>ks</hi> do greater
wonders, than ever did <hi>Puntaeus</hi> with his Balſam, or Ointment, and that

ſpare thee a few Ounces of this choice Medicine, call'd <hi>Light Within,</hi>
prize it above <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> or the <hi>Philoſophers Stone.</hi> But if he will

it thy ſelf. Strip thy ſelf of Lace, Ribbons, and all other <hi>Babyloniſh-Garments,</hi>
               </q>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay little of This, but that I Abhor it, as Open <hi>Blaſphemie:</hi> For
moſt certainly there is no Other GOD, but He who is <hi>The Light Within.</hi>
To Scoff thus at <hi>The Light within,</hi> plainly ſhews that the Scoffer is under
the <hi>Power of Darkneſs;</hi> that He moſt Shamefully, and Dangerouſly <hi>Errs, not
Knowing the Scriptures, nor the POWER of God.</hi> The <hi>Light Within</hi> is
Indeed the Only True <hi>Catholicon:</hi> If Our <hi>Self-Will</hi> do not Hinder its
<hi>Operation,</hi> It will moſt certainly Cure All our <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> and make us at length
Fully, and Perfectly to Partake of the only True, and Eternal <hi>Felicity.</hi>

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 12. It ſeems convenient, that I ſhould Animadvert upon what I find
in this Page, before I ſay any thing of what I Obſerve in ſome of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
Pages.: <q>Rare edifying Diſcourſe, ſays <hi>the Man in the Dark,</hi>
Chriſt is the only Rule. The Gift of God's Spirit in our Hearts is the
Rule. And the Light of Jeſus is the Rule. And all theſe are one, and the
ſame Rule. There is no difference (if you believe theſe acute, and ſubtil
Doctors) between Chriſt, and the Light Within. Chriſt, and the Spirit,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109242:3"/>
are one, and are in every Man's Heart: and yet they pretend to own
the Doctrin of the Trinity.</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They hold indeed, <hi>that Chriſt, and
the Spirit, or the Holy Ghost, are One in Eſſence, and are in Every Man's
Heart, Converting, or Convincing him in order to his Converſion; or, (in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the Repugnancy he makes againſt the Divine Illumination) Torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him,</hi> &amp;c. as I have ſaid in a Letter to a very Learned Man of Our own
Communion. What does the man mean, by ſaying, <q>And yet they pretend
to own the Doctrin of the <hi>Trinity?</hi>
               </q> Would he have us Believe, that the
Doctrin of the Trinity is Inconſiſtent with this Aſſertion, that <hi>Chriſt
and the Spirit are One, and are in Every Man's Heart? If The Father, The
Son, and The Holy Ghoſt,</hi> be The Only True God, is not Chriſt and the
Spirit One? If GOD be The ONE ABSOLUTELY INFINITE, He
Is In All Creatures, and in a Peculiar Manner in <hi>All Rational Souls.</hi> When
we ſay, CHRIST is the Rule; our Meaning is, that He is the <hi>Grand
Exemplar,</hi> or <hi>Pattern;</hi> that by the <hi>Idea, Image,</hi> or <hi>Manifeſtation,</hi> which
He Gives us of The Only True GOD, The ONE Infinite in All Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;

our <hi>Duty</hi> both towards GOD, and towards Men: and to Order, and
Regulate our <hi>Wills,</hi> and All our <hi>Affections.</hi> I ſhall leave it to any Syncere
Chriſtian, to Judge, whether this <hi>Anonymus</hi> be not Guilty of much Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs,
