         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Treaſon is judged worthy of. Let me inſtance in two or three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
briefly; for I muſt but point at the miſeries of Proteſtants
in ſuch a ſtate, not give a full proſpect of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Infamy</hi> is one of them (that I may begin with the leaſt). He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks

               <hi>Suarez) that
Hereticks both by common and civil Law are infamous,</hi> for which he

of Hereticks, if they repent not within a year; and to
their Children for ſome generations, if their Parents dyed pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.</p>

               <hi>Doctors con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
In quo Authores ferè conveniunt,</hi> proving it from the very words
of the Law aforementioned.</p>
            <p>Let me mention ſome of the particulars comprized in this Legal
Inſamy: Proteſtants are hereby excluded from all publick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
and ſo from Parliaments; being uncapable of either chuſing,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49064:3"/>
or being choſen thereto. This is the Decree of a <hi>General</hi>

               <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
beſides ſeveral Conſtitutions for it in the <hi>Canon-Law.</hi> So that
all the Lords and Commons in <hi>England</hi> would be by Law (while
they are Proteſtants) debarred from having any place in Parliament;
and all the Freeholders from chuſing any; and that by a Law para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to any Civil Law, or National Conſtitution: and this alone
would be enough to ruine and enſlave this, or any people whoſe
Liberty depends upon Parliaments. They are excluded from all
Dignities, this is Eſſential to the penalty; for it is a<note n="h" place="bottom">Regul. Juris 87. in 6.</note> Rule in
their Law, <hi>Infamibus Portae non pateant dignitati;</hi> particularly No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
are degraded from their Nobility, and deprived of all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<note n="i" place="bottom">De haereticis cap. ut Commiſſ. in 6.</note>, this by the ſame Law: and it is extended to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by many of their<note n="k" place="bottom">Faber Teraquillus, Cantera, Otalora in Sanchez. ibid. l. 2. c. 29. n. 1.</note> Authors, who ſay expreſly, that the
<hi>Iſſue of Traytors, Civil or Spiritual, loſe their Nobility,</hi> both that
which they had by Priviledge, and that which comes by deſcent
from their Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>They are deprived not only of all Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, but of
all Secular Offices, which is expreſſed in the Law forequoted; Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
it is decreed<note n="l" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. Sect. Haeretic. de baereticis in 6.</note> that <hi>Hereticks be not admitted into any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Office, or Benefice; but if they be, it is null and void.</hi> Nor can they

By the Conſtitution of <hi>Gregory</hi> 9, an Heretick is deprived of all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, whether Natural, Civil, or Politick. <hi>Simanca</hi> Inſtit. tit. 46. ſect. 74. <hi>Juxta Conſtitutiones Gregorii</hi> 9, &amp;c.</note>
Authors commonly determine: and upon this account they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all our Judges, Juſtices and Magiſtrates, that are Proteſtants,
to be incompetent, ſuch as have no more Juriſdiction than the
Bench they ſit on, and think not themſelves at all obliged to anſwer
them; or if they condeſcend to give them an anſwer, yet not to
ſpeak the truth before them, although they be ſworn to it.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, all that owe any duty to Hereticks are diſcharged from
the obligation, and exempted from paying any. In their Canon Law
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49064:4"/>
it is decreed<note n="n" place="bottom">Cap. Final. de Haretecis.</note> that all <hi>who are bound to Hereticks by any obligation,
whether of Oath, or Fealty, or Service, or any other Agreement, or
promiſe, are freed there from.</hi> Subjects owe no Allegiance to their
Prince, nay they may lawfully kill them, as their Authors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
conclude. Servants owe Maſters no Faithfulneſs, no ſervice;
though they be ſlaves, and purchaſed with their money, yet they
are diſcharged; and if they diſcover their Maſter's Hereſie, and ſo
ſeek to take away his life, though they be not Chriſtians, it's reaſon
(they hold) that they have abſolute freedom when none but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
ſlaves may have it, ſave upon ſuch a treacherous<note n="o" place="bottom">Azon. Inſtit. Moral. Tom. 1. l. 8. c. 12. q 7. Penna, Molina &amp; Sanchez. Ibid c 24. m, 10. 11.</note> account.
Parents loſe authority over their Children, ſo their Law<note n="p" place="bottom">Cap. 2. ſed. final. de Haereticis <hi>in</hi> 6.</note> will
have it: and Children owe no duty to ſuch Parents, only they are
bound under mortal ſin to denounce them, that is, to diſcover their
Hereſie; which is the way to deprive their Parents of their lives.
And they give this reaſon for it, becauſe <hi>it is lawful for a Child to
kill his Father, if he be an enemy to the Common-wealth; and therefore
he may much more lawfully in this caſe</hi> deal thus with his Father, that
is, betray him to death. This is an <hi>act worthy of honour and praiſe,</hi>
as is proved by the Conſtitutions of ſeveral Popes, and ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               </note> Writers, that it may paſs for their common Doctrine; nor
can they be ſecured from ſuffering for their Parents Hereſie, without
detecting them, as<note n="*" place="bottom">7 Decret. de heretic. c. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Innocent 4th</hi> decrees.</p>
            <p>We ſee a little to what condition the admiſſion of the Papal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
would reduce us; it would expel nature and humanity, and
make the deareſt Relatives unnatural and barbarous to one another;
it would leave no Proteſtant either Dignity or Authority, either
Safety or Liberty; by theſe Law (which muſt then be ours) our
Nobles are ſentenced to be Peaſants, and Peaſants muſt be no better
than ſlaves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Another penalty to which Hereticks are condemned
by their Laws, is <hi>Confiſcation of all their Eſtates or Goods.</hi> And this
they incur, <hi>Ipſo jure, &amp; ipſo facto,</hi> that is immediately, as ſoon as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49064:4"/>
they ſhew themſelves Hereticks, <hi>before the ſentence of any Judg.</hi>

               <hi>Hereticks do agree;</hi>

            <p>By vertue of this Confiſcation, Hereticks, as ſoon as ever they
diſcover it, are deprived of all Propriety and Title to their Eſtates,
before any ſentence paſſed againſt them. <hi>Suarez</hi>
               <note n="u" place="bottom">Ibid. ſect. 3. n. 1.</note> ſaith, This is
the <hi>Common Doctrine. Sanchez</hi>
               <note n="x" place="bottom">Ibid. cap. 22. n. 2.</note> muſters up multitudes of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors

               <hi>Corduba</hi> tells us, that all their Doctors in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
both Canoniſts and Divines maintain it.</p>
            <p>But though they generally agree that Proteſtants by Law have
loſt all propriety, and have no title at all to any eſtate; yet there is
ſome difference among them about the poſſeſſion of what is thus
confiſcated. For many of them hold, that Hereticks before any Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
are bound in Conſcience to quit the poſſeſſion of all they
have, and ſin damnably if they do not; eſpecially if their hereſie
be publick and notorious, as it is in all profeſſed Proteſtants: and
their reaſons are good enough, if the principles upon which they
proceed were ſo. For the Sentence which ſome count pre-requiſite,
is not pretended to be <hi>damnatory,</hi> to condemn to the puniſhment,
for that is already done by Law; but only (as all agree) <hi>declarative</hi>
of the crime, that the crime may be evident, and who are guilty
of it; which is needleſs when it is evident and notorious before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49064:5"/>
Others of them teach that Hereticks may keep poſſeſſion, and are
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot to be deprived of it, before the ſentence declarative of the crime.
But though this latter ſeem more favourable, yet it is of little or no
advantage to Proteſtants, ſince thoſe that have a mind to their
forfeited eſtates, may ſoon procure ſuch a Sentence; for an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Biſhop, or other Eccleſiaſtical perſon may paſs it, as the Law
it<note n="y" place="bottom">De Haereticis. <hi>Cap.</hi> cum ſecundum Legis. in 6.</note> ſelf declares. For example: <hi>Corker</hi> the <hi>Benedictine,</hi> lately
arraigned, was ordered by the Pope to be Biſhop of <hi>London;</hi> if
their Plot had ſo far ſucceeded, that the Popes Orders had taken
place, he might in his Spiritual Court have declared all the known
Proteſtants in <hi>London,</hi> and his whole Dioceſs to be Hereticks;
which done, all the Nobles, Citizens and others in his Dioceſs, might
have been turned immediately out of poſſeſſion, and ſtript of all
they had; and this by Law. The effects of this Confiſcation,
wherein they all agree, make the ſeverity of the Law apparent;
and the forbearance of ſeizure before ſentence of little conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
if they thought themſelves obliged not to ſeize ſuch Eſtates
before.</p>
            <p>Firſt, All the profits made of the Eſtate from the firſt day of
their guilt are to be refunded, if they be extant and found among
their<note n="z" place="bottom">Suarez, De Fide. Diſp. 22. ſect. 4 n. 11. Sanchez ubi ſupra, c. 21. n. ult.</note> Goods, <hi>Formally,</hi> or but ſo much as <hi>equivalently;</hi> nay,
ſome<note n="a" place="bottom">Simancha, Vaſquez in Suarez, Ibid. <hi>n</hi> 11, 12.</note> will have them reſponſible for the mean profits, though

when they ſpent them: or being ſpent, if the Eſtate be any

all that hath been ſo diſpoſed of by the Hereticks to others
where ever they be, or in whole poſſeſſion ſoever they be found, or

<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſally embraced by all their Doctors of Law, and all their

               <hi>Sanchez</hi>
tells us. Nay it is a ſin<note n="e" place="bottom">Idem. ibid. n. 61.</note> for him to fell any part of his Goods
or Eſtate, without diſcovering to the Purchaſer his hazard, in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is by Law confiſcated. And in this caſe the Purchaſe will
be forced from him without reſtoring the price he paid for it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be found among the Hereticks Goods, for which the ſame
<hi>Jeſuit</hi> alledgeth above Thirty<note n="f" place="bottom">Ibid. n. 68.</note> Doctors. Nor are thoſe to
whom the Eſtate is Eſcheated any way obliged, to pay any of the
Hereticks Debts<note n="g" place="bottom">Ibid. n. 76.</note>, which were contracted ſince his Hereſie, and
ſo his Creditors (not excepting <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks) may be lawfully
ruined, as well as himſelf.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Children and Heirs of Hereticks are deprived of
their Portions. And though this ſeem hard in their own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
that they ſhould be ruined and reduced to poverty for their
Parents fault; yet what they ſuffer is not to be conſidered, becauſe
the Child is not here puniſhed by or in himſelf, but by accident,
and in another. And this is all the ſatisfaction the beſt of them give
in this pitiful caſe, <hi>Suarez ibid.</hi> Nor will their Law admit that any
Commiſeration of the Innocent ſhould be any impediment to the
ſeverity of the Execution; but provides againſt it in theſe words,
<hi>Neither ſhall this ſevere Cenſure, for the diſinheriting of Orthodox
Children be any way hindred, by the pretence of compaſſion; ſince in
many caſes by Divine Judgment, the Children are temporally puniſhed
for their Fathers; and according to Canonical Sanctions, vengeance
may be ſometimes taken, not only upon the Authors of wickedneſs,</hi> but
their poſterity, <hi>Cap. vergentis, Tit. de Haereticis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what if the Children to whom the Eſtate is left, be <hi>Roman</hi>
Catholicks, are they to be thruſt from an Eſtate left them by their
Heretical Parents? This ſeems impolitick, ſince hereby no hopes are
left to any for ſecuring their Eſtates by turning Papiſts; and not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49064:6"/>
only ſo, but they confeſs it ſeems to be againſt Piety, and in the 4<hi>th</hi>
Synod of <hi>Toledo</hi> there is a limitation for the ſecurity of ſuch Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents;
but by the Canon Law in after-times that Limitation was
exploded, and the Catholick Deſcendents of Hereticks excluded
from having any advantage<note n="h" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> Vergentis. de Haereticis.</note> by their confiſcated Eſtates. This
is expreſſed in the <hi>Text</hi> of their Law, and more fully in an Original
Epiſtle of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third. <hi>Suarez. ibid. pag.</hi> 775.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe the Poſterity of a Proteſtant or his Children, being
ſtill Papiſts, have continued in the poſſeſſion of the Eſtates ſo left
them for many years together (Forty or an hundred years), will
not this create them a title? ſince Preſcription may do it where
there is no other right, and is allowed ſo to do both by <hi>Civil</hi> and
<hi>Canon</hi> Law; and an hundred years is confeſſed to be ſufficient for
Preſcription<note n="i" place="bottom">Menochius &amp; alii in Diana. Sum. V. Praeſcrip. N. 2.</note> againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in other caſes?</p>
            <p>No, an hundred years will not ſuffice in this caſe, if the Poſſeſſors,
or their Fathers knew that he who left them the Eſtate was an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
and if he was at any time ſuſpected to be ſo while he lived; or
if he was reputed a Catholick all his days; yet if any time within
40 years after his deceaſe, it appears he was an Heretick, there is
no place left for Preſcription: but then they will have the Eſtate
ſeiſed, in whoſe hands ſoever it be ſound, and the<note n="k" place="bottom">Sanchez. l. 2. c. 22. n. 41.</note> Poſſeſſors
thruſt out, though they be <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks.</p>
            <p>Hereby it appears, that as ſoon as the Papacy is admitted, all Title
and Property is loſt and extinct among us by the Law which will
then be in force, unleſs in thoſe few Families who never had a
Proteſtant Proprietor; nor are they ſecure as to any part of their
eſtate, which ever belonged to Hereticks: And therefore we
muſt not think his Holineſs acted extravagantly, when he declared
<hi>all his Majeſties Territories to be his own as forfeited to the Holy See
for the Hereſie of Prince and People:</hi> for herein he proceeded regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,
and according to that which they eſteem the beſt Law in the
World. Not only Abbey Lands are in danger, who ever poſſeſs
them, but all Eſtates are forfeited to his Exchequer, and legally
confiſcated: All is his own which Proteſtants in theſe Three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have, or ever had, if he can but meet with a Prince ſo wiſe, as
to help him to catch it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49064:6"/>
Thus we ſee the proceſs of their Law againſt Proteſtants muſt not
end with their Lives, but follow them many years beyond Death
and the Grave; and ruine their Children, and Childrens Children,
when they are gone: And when they have left a Heretick nothing
of his own to ſubſiſt on, it is provided alſo that he ſhall have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
from others: for this is part of his Penalty<note n="l" place="bottom">Zanardus, Director. pars 2. p. pag. 126.</note> that <hi>none ſhall
receive him into their houſes, nor afford him any help, nor ſhew him any
favour, nor give him any counſel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We in <hi>England</hi> are zealous for Property, and all the reaſon in the
world we ſhould be; but we muſt bid adieu to this when we once
come under the Popes Authority; for as ſoon as this is admitted,
<hi>all the Proteſtants in theſe Nations are Beggars by Law,</hi> by the Laws
of that Church (which will then be ours), diveſting us of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
and Title to what ever we count our own.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The laſt <hi>Penalty</hi> I ſhall inſiſt on, which their Law will
have inflicted on Hereticks, is Death.</p>
            <p>This is the Sentence of the <hi>Canon Law. Hereticks</hi>
               <note n="m" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> ad abolendum. de Haereticis. Vide Suarez ubi ſupra. Diſp. 23. ſect. 2. n. 1. &amp; 3.</note> 
               <hi>are to be
delivered to the Secular Power to undergo due puniſhment,</hi> and that is
Death, as appear by many <hi>Papal Bulls</hi> approving and receiving the
Civil Laws, which have adjudged Hereticks to death: For though
thoſe Laws were Originally intended, againſt ſuch only which were
Hereticks indeed: yet ſince the <hi>Roman</hi> Church will have all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
to be Hereticks, they muſt ſuffer Death by vertue thereof,
how far ſoever they be from Hereſie.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Canon Law</hi> further determines, that Secular Judges can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
remit the Penalty, as appears by the Text, Cap. <hi>ut Officium,</hi> and
is more fully explained in the <hi>Bull of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> and in another
of <hi>Innocent 4th.</hi> Hereupon<note n="n" place="bottom">Direct. pars 2da. pag. 754.</note> 
               <hi>Zanardus</hi> takes it for granted,
<hi>that all Laws will have every Heretick put to Death;</hi> and their Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical

others, may be juſtly killed by Secular Judges, and bereaved of all they
have, rather than ſuch as are guilty of High-Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there were need to cite particular Doctors, <hi>Suarez</hi> aſſures us,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49064:7"/>
that it is the judgment of all their Doctors, <hi>Ita docent omnes Docto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.</hi>

if they are, or ſhall hereafter be Hereticks. Particularly it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
that <hi>they are therefore deprived wholly and perpetually of their
Baronies, Marqueſats, Dukedoms, Kingdoms, Empires, and rendered
uncapable hereof, ſo as they ſhall never be reſtored.</hi> And to make ſure

Law for it, yet the Uſe and Cuſtom of their Church hath the
ſorce of a Law; and makes it as lawful and neceſſary for them to
burn I roteſtants, as it is to burn Faggots when they are cold; and
that it is the cuſtom of the Church, they have the teſtimony of
all Nations round about us. We need go no further than our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Countrey, where in the days of the laſt Popiſh Succeſſor it is
proved by near 300 Witneſſes, that their Laws will have all ſorts of
us burnt alive, without regard of Age, Sex, or Quality. And if
we will not be ſatisfied that they may lawfully burn us, Man, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

The Proceſs againſt Hereticks in the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> is remarkably merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
for there a Proteſtant ſhall not have the favour to be burnt at
firſt<note n="x" place="bottom">Zanardus, Director. 2 da pars. pag. 755.</note>, and dye once; but muſt ſuffer many Deaths before, by
enduring divers tortures more grievous than Death, before he
be brought to the Fire. One that hath the ſpirit of a Chriſtian,
and reads the account of the Tortures there in uſe, would ſcarce
think that any but the Devils could be either the Inventors or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners

the <hi>inſpiration of the Holy Ghost;</hi> and there is no doubt but
his Succeſſors would attribute it to the ſame inſpiration, if they
could get it ſetled in <hi>England.</hi> And they are highly con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49064:8"/>
to endeavour it, If they believe the Words of a dying Pope.
For<note n="y" place="bottom">Onufrius, Vita Pauli 4.</note> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>4th</hi> in a Speech before his Death (and ſo before his
Infallibility expired) declared to the Cardinals, <hi>that the Authority
of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church depends only upon the Office of the Inquiſition.</hi>
And indeed it is very fit, that ſuch an Authority ſhould have ſuch a
foundation. Nor can any queſtion that it is neceſſary and pious to
exerciſe all the cruelties of the Inquiſition upon us, without ſhaking
the whole foundation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and all the Authority
of it.</p>
            <p>Hereupon how are we concerned to look about us? We ought
to remember (for they are not like to forget it), that as ſoon as ever
the Papal Authority is admitted among us, <hi>all the Proteſtants in theſe
Nations are dead men in Law;</hi> being under a Law that hath ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
us already to be burned alive, and under a power that hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
it neceſſary that no one of us eſcape with Life.</p>
            <p>But they are not yet quite ready for burning us, though they are
impatient till they be ſo; and ſhew what deſign they have upon our
perſons, by turning our houſes and Goods into flames. For this

the Law in their hands, and Power to Murder us by a judicial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
Where Proteſtants are numerous and potent, the way they
then take for diſcharging the obligation that is upon them to deſtroy
us, is by treacherous Maſſacres, or open Wars or Aſſaſſinations.
They hold it lawful to make War upon Hereticks for their Hereſie.

the Proteſtants: And this not more from the ſavageneſs of

Tragedy in <hi>Paris,</hi> and other Cities, where ſo many Thouſand

The Pope would not have ſo great delight as he took therein

Triumphs were made by the Papiſts almoſt every where, as a moſt

Actors had more highly merited; for that merits moſt, which
moſt promotes the Catholick Intereſt, which is moſt promoted
when Hereſie and Hereticks are quite extirpated; and ſo to kill
all Hereticks, is moſt meritorious.</p>

it muſt be. And then who can deny but that Papiſts are the moſt
Charitable Perſons under the Cope of Heaven, ſince they will not

barbarous deſign that ever the Devils helped any of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumants
to contrive, is ſo tranſcendently both meritorious and
ſatisfactory! yet this is not a private ſpirit, but that by which
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſeems generally inſpired. This was but a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49064:10"/>
more compendious way, of executing the Laws of their Church
againſt Proteſtants. And <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks are left to deviſe what
expedient they can, for the execution of them; when they are
not in a capacity of proceeding the ordinary way, by burning
us. And that Invention will have moſt of Merit, which is moſt
quick and extenſive, and makes an end of moſt at once. The
Society is particularly under the Conduct of that Spirit; for the
<hi>Provincial Garnet, Teſmond, Gerard,</hi> and other Jeſuits did teach
the Conſpirators this Catholick Doctrine<note n="n" place="bottom">Gunpowder. Treaſon. <hi>pag.</hi> 74.</note> 
               <hi>That the King,
Nobility, Clergy and whole Commonalty of the Realm of</hi> England
<hi>(Papiſts excepted) were Hereticks, and that all Hereticks were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
and excommunicate, and that no Heretick could be a King;
but that it was lawful and meritorious to kill the King, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Hereticks within this Realm of</hi> England; <hi>for the Advancing
and enlargement of the Authority and Jurisdiction of the Biſhop of</hi>
Rome, <hi>and for the reſtoring of the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Religion.</hi> What? Is
it meritorious to kill all in the Realm? Yes, the more the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the greater the ſacrifice, the greater will the value and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of it be: They will prove it unanſwerably by an Argument
from the leſs to the greater. If it be meritorious to kill one
Heretick, it will be as much more meritorious to kill all in a
Kingdom; as all in a whole Kingdom are more than one ſingle
perſon.</p>
            <p>Thus the greater any wickedneſs is, the more powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
their Church hath for its encouragement; The more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digiouſly
bloody and inhumane it is, the more will the Catholick
<hi>Merit</hi> of it advance. And the Ground of this is obſervable, they
will have it meritorious to Murder this whole Nation, King and
People, becauſe <hi>they were Hereticks, and all Hereticks are accurſed
and excommunicated.</hi> Now King <hi>James</hi> and the People of theſe
Kingdoms were not at this time excommunicate expreſly, nor ſo

whom the Papiſts here honoured as a Pope, and paid

<hi>That they may lawfully extinguiſh the good and bad together, and that
it would be an act of great Merit, if it would much promote the

meritorious to burn <hi>London,</hi> though the Houſes and Goods of
many Papiſts were conſumed in the Flames; yea, and how the moſt
deſperate Villains amongſt them might merit Heaven, and expiate
all the Crimes of a moſt flagitious life, if he could but fire the whole

Whereby we ſee their Principles and Actings, both of them
are grounded upon their Church-Laws, Sentencing Hereticks to
death and ruine. The executing of theſe Laws is the exerciſe
of a principal vertue, <hi>an Act of Juſtice,</hi> and is upon this and
other accounts eſteemed meritorious. Execution muſt be done
one way or other in order to it; they muſt and will do, what our
preſent Circumſtances leave feaſible. They cannot now in a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
Court try and condemn us, and then deliver us to the Secular
Power to be burnt at a Stake; but they can Stab, or Piſtol, or Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
us, or Blow us up; and theſe are Acts of Juſtice upon Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors,
which their Laws condemn to Death, no leſs vertuous and
meritorious than the other; perhaps Heroical in their account, as
being of more then an ordinary ſtrain. It is true, they want ſome
<hi>formalities</hi> of Law, yet are never the worſe for the want of that,
which they cannot poſſibly have. But men once they have ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Throne, we may expect they will proceed againſt us with
more obſervance of a Judicial Proceſs, and burn us and our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
with all Punctilio's of Law, as they did under the laſt Popiſh
Succeſſor.</p>
            <p>But it is not probable that under ſuch a Succeſſor theſe Laws may
not be executed.</p>
            <p>If there were any probability, that for a while they might not
be throughly executed, yet our condition in the interim would
ſcarce be tolerable to an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man; to be deveſted of all ſecurity
by Law, for Liberty, Eſtate and Life; and to hold theſe
<hi>without,</hi> nay <hi>againſt</hi> Law, only at the will and known mercy of
Papiſts; even when they muſt count it a cruelty to themſelves
to ſpare us, ſeeing both their Salvation and (which ſeems gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
more minded) their Intereſt is concerned in the Execution
of theſe Laws. It ſeems highly probable to me that all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
will be uſed to have them fully executed; for the deſign of
theſe Laws is to deſtroy Proteſtants. And thoſe <hi>Romaniſts</hi> that
underſtand their concerns, do make account, that their main in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
lyes in this; For neither can they recover their former flouriſh
and greatneſs, nor can they indeed think themſelves <hi>ſafe,</hi> till this
be done,</p>
            <p>Accordingly we may obſerve, that in all Countreys round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
us, who have been under Popiſh Princes, all attempts have
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49064:12"/>
been made, and their utmoſt endeavours uſed utterly to root out
Proteſtants. And it is meer folly to expect that we ſhould fare
better in like circumſtances. Even in <hi>France</hi> the only inſtance
alledged, to give any hopes that Proteſtants may ſubſiſt under
ſuch a Power, The deſign of theſe Laws was vigorouſly purſued,
in all methods of pretended Juſtice, and plain Violence, in the

by Fire and Sword, by Aſſaſſinations, Treacherous Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres,
and open War. So that ſome Hundred Thouſands of them
were deſtroyed, and in all reaſon none of them had eſcaped, nor
any more Hugonots had been left in <hi>France,</hi> than there are in

            <p>Thoſe who would have us reduced to ſuch a condition, wherein
we cannot otherwiſe be ſecured than the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants were,

            <p>Our Conſpirators have declared that they had the very ſame

might have ſatisfied ſuch harmleſs Catholicks? not an hundred we
may be ſure, if all the Proteſtants in the World could have bled
more. But this they were bound in Conſcience to execute the Popes
Laws, they were at all points ready to do it, they wanted nothing
but only a Catholick Prince in the Throne.</p>
            <p>O but the Temper, or at leaſt the Intereſt of ſuch a Prince
would oblige him to forbid or reſtrain ſuch violent executions in

What if he be perſwaded as other Catholicks are, that

ſaith he, Decreed theſe two things: Firſt, 

<q>That the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Power can no way hinder the Eccleſiaſtical Power from
its Legal exerciſe, and therefore if any Secular Prince do
give ſafe conduct to any Heretick, this ought not to hinder
the Eccleſiaſtical Judg from exerciſing his Office, that is from
trying an Heretick, and proceeding againſt him according to
evidence. The reaſon is, becauſe when there are two Princes
who have diſtinct Judicatures and Tribunals, one of which is
greater and ſuperiour to the other; the Inferiour may not
hinder the Superiour, from executing his Juriſdictions. And
therefore the ſecurity which he promiſeth to any, extends not
to the Tribunal of the Superiour Prince, becauſe the Superiour
is not bound by the Laws and agreement of the Inferiour,
<hi>(Caput, cum Inferior extra.)</hi> But now the Secular and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Prince have diſtinct Tribunals (as is well known,) and
the Eccleſiaſtical is Superiour <hi>(Cap. Solita:)</hi> Therefore the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
when he gives ſafe Conduct to any, he cannot extend it
to the Eccleſiaſtical Tribunal; nor by the ſecurity given, can
hinder the Juriſidiction of the Eccleſiaſtical Judg, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

of <hi>Simanca,</hi> tells us, that they all ſay as much as he hath ſaid.
<hi>Simanca teaches the ſame that we teach,</hi> viz. <hi>That Faith is to be
kept with Hereticks in what is lawful and honeſt: but in no caſe
otherwiſe,</hi> and ſo never in caſe of Hereſie. So that the Faith
of any Prince however engaged, is ſo far from giving an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
any ſecurity; as Hereſie is far from being a thing lawful
and honeſt. Upon theſe principles (by which it appears that
<hi>Rome</hi> hath changed <hi>Faith</hi> with <hi>Carthage,</hi> that being now worſe
than <hi>Fides Punica;</hi> and is when ſhe would be counted <hi>Chriſtian,</hi>
far more Faithleſs than when <hi>Pagan)</hi> their Doctors, Jeſuits,

out of Hereticks; Aſſerting, <hi>that an Oath in favour of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi>
is but <hi>Vinculum iniquitatis.</hi> In Fine, This is the ſenſe of
their beſt Authors, and we muſt believe it to be ſo, unleſs we
will be deluded. By their Laws and Principles they are always
under an Obligation utterly to exterminate Proteſtants; yet
ſometimes they are concerned in point of Intereſt, to forbear
and diſſemble; Pretending to engage their Faith when they do
it not in the ſenſe of thoſe who relye on it, as the Council of
<hi>Conſtance</hi> deluded <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> that they might (as they
did) burn him: or engaging their Faith when they intend not
to keep it, as our Queen <hi>Mary, Charles</hi> the <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and
other Popiſh Princes, abuſed the Proteſtants to make them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
that they might have the better advantage to ruine
them; and then that they may ſeem real, they may promiſe
or ſwear that they will not proceed againſt us; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
when they have an opportunity to deſtroy us, though
they were bound by Ten thouſand Oaths not to attempt it;
yet they <hi>Sin damnably</hi> if they endeavour it not to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49064:14"/>
But if there were neither <hi>Law</hi> nor <hi>Conſcience</hi> to hinder, yet in
point of Intereſt, he muſt not ſhew favour to Hereticks, nor grant
any Indulgence for their Religion, he cannot do it without apparent
hazard both of <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi> For by ſhewing ſuch favour, he
in their account depoſeth himſelf, and immediately loſeth title to

have been reduced to practice among thoſe who have the repute
of the moſt moderate Papiſts in <hi>Europe. Henry 3d.</hi> and <hi>4th</hi> two

have eſcaped better; no wonder, for they never provoked the

            <p>And which more concernsus, the Conſpirators in all places hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

But may not Parliaments ſecure us by Laws and Proviſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining

            <p>There is nothing of this tendency can in reaſon be expected
from Parliaments, <hi>without ſecuring the Throne.</hi> For if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators
once gain that, it may be they will have no Parliaments;
A Government more Arbitrary and Violent is more agreeable to
their Principles and Deſigns. It is apparent that <hi>Popery,</hi> as it
hath been by many occaſions <hi>ſublimated</hi> ſince the Reformation,
hath in a manner quite ſtifled the <hi>Engliſh Spirit</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts.
They are for another Government, in which the <hi>Pope</hi> muſt
be Supreme, and to which our Kings muſt be <hi>ſubjected</hi> or <hi>kill'd.</hi>
And in Civils, they are for an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarchy,</hi> by which
this and others muſt be ſwallowed up; and ſo they are ſtill ready
to devote themſelves to that Prince who bids faireſt for it. So
they did to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that account are wheeled off to the <hi>French:</hi> They have been
forward upon all occaſions, to Sacrifice the Honour of the King,

much more his Subjects than the Kings; and they are no more
to be truſted as to the true <hi>Engliſh Intereſt,</hi> than the <hi>Italians</hi>
or <hi>Spaniards.</hi> They paſs for <hi>Natives</hi> indeed, being born among
us; but are plainly <hi>Foreigners</hi> as to Government, Principle, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
Affection and Deſign. We may well believe on theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
they are no Friends to Parliaments, if they did not otherwiſe
openly declare it.</p>
            <p>But if the neceſſity of their affairs ſhould require a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there is no great queſtion but they may get ſuch a one
as will ſerve their turn: For ſo hath every of our former <hi>Princes</hi>
in all the <hi>changes of Religion</hi> that have been amongſt us. So did
<hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> both when he was for Popery; and when he
was againſt it, and when he was partly both for it, and againſt
it. So did <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> when he was wholly Proteſtant. So
did Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> when ſhe was for burning them alive. So did
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when ſhe run Counter to her Siſter. There
are <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Papiſts enough already to furniſh both Houſes; and
there will be more, if Popery were once enthron'd. The ſtrongeſt
Arguments which divers have for their Religion, are drawn
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49064:16"/>
from the Throne. The indifferency which is viſible in too many,
ſignifies that they will be determined by their intereſt, and their
Eſtates are like to out-weigh their Religion.</p>
            <p>The warping of divers upon advancement, and acting Counter
to themſelves when lower; ſhews, there is ſomething higher
in their hearts, then that which ſhould be Supreme. The little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
they ſhew for Religion, who in regard of their Station in the
Church, ſhould have the greateſt Zeal for it, diſappointing and
aſtoniſhing thoſe who eſteemed them Proteſtants, and great ſupports
of that Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>The little ſenſe of any danger (when our Religion was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

is null and void. Since our Princes were Proteſtants, they are no

This is manifeſt by the firſt <hi>Penaltie</hi> forementioned, and

acquired ſince by Purchaſe, or otherwiſe. So that they
have no Right to be choſen, nor have Proteſtants any
Right to chuſe them, being no Freeholders, nor having
title to any Goods or Lands, by any Tenure whatſoever.
In ſhort, By the Judgment and Sentence of their Church,
all Ranks among us are in a State of <hi>

the Acts or Ordinances of meer Uſurpers, nor do they owe,
nor will they pay them more obſervance (when time ſerves)
than to the Conſtitutions of ſo many Thieves and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe our Laws were valid, and Enacted by a
competent Authority, yet being againſt the Laws of the
Church, the Soveraign Authority of theſe will ſuperſede
the other: For ſo they determine, that when the <hi>Canon</hi>
