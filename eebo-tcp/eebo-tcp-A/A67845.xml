            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This you will grant, ſome Bapts have lately done (vulgarly Anabaptiſts): They have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd a <hi>Socinian</hi> to Argue, and a worſe to Rave; this Fire, all the Water in which ſuch are plung'd, cannot quench. But no wonder, when <hi>D.

Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Spirit proves all: I am of his Mind, who ſaid, Baptizing in <hi>Enon</hi> was ſo far from proving Plunging, That it diſproves it. They therefore left <hi>Bathabara</hi>; ſays he, becauſe the Waters were Deep, and not ſo fit for Baptiſm; and came to <hi>Enou,</hi> for the Rivulets there, were fit for Baptiſm but not Plunging.</p>
            <p>Reverend Sir, I am much importun'd to Write you a Third Epiſtle about your Sermons at <hi>Turners Hall,</hi> and <hi>G. Church</hi> lately Printed, but I long refus'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe I have often appear'd for you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I am Anſwer'd, that matters not, This is not <hi>ad Idem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe I think I have done it already: I find but little you have ſaid about the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, Ceremonies, and Epiſcopacy, but what

I have Anſwer'd in my Apology<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Mr. <hi>Laſly,</hi> and <hi>Friendly Epiſtle to you.</hi> I pray look on all once again: You approved then of what I did. How came you ſo ſoon chang'd? It would be an Abuſe clapt on my Readers, to deceive them of their Time, and Money, to tranſcribe what they know I then wrote.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe I think ſome things in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are too triflng and unfit for an Anſwer, as your Gloſs on theſe Words. <hi>He that break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one of the leaſt of theſe Commandments, ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of God.</hi> So the <hi>Ruſhing of many Waters,</hi> and other Places brought for your Confuſions in your Liturgy.

            <p>I was, Sir, your Herrer in G Church; in the Afternoon, when I came there, I ſaw the Reader with his Spectacles on his Noſe, and both with Eyes cloſe to the Book, thus reading Prayers to his God. No Eyes nor Hands lift up to Heaven in any praying Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, but both as nail'd to the Book, for fear of not reading right, as if the Poor Man had not loſt only the Power of Godlineſs, but the uery Form of it too.

               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:41866:4"/>Mr. <hi>Keath,</hi> let you and I talk privately; for it would not be ſafe to ask you openly, whether you can believe, That the great God, the Bleſſed Jeſus, the Holy Spirit, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Were it not for ſome Penal Laws yet in force againſt Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I ſhould go near to ſay, That for ſuch a one to read other Mens Prayers to God, is not only as Scandalous, but ten times more ſo, than to read other Mens Sermons to the People? When the Apoſtle tells the Church, the Gifts God gave Men, <hi>Tongues, Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tongues, Propheſying, Interpretations,</hi> &amp;c. Never mention'd he the poor, poor, pittiful poor Gift of Reading.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was in its Swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-Clouts, and fed with Milk, taught by many Ceremonies, God made every one of them himſelf, not they; yet then there were no Forms, no Liturgies for the Prieſts to read, or People to hear when they came together.</p>
            <p>As weak as they were, they were not ſo weak. Who dares now impoſe under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Diſpenſation, when the Church is become a Man, and much more, as of the Grace, ſo of the Gifts of the Spirit is now poured out.</p>
            <p>You pleading up Conformity, unhappily choſe this Text, (the beſt to caution us againſt it.) <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6. <hi>And they were hath Perfect, walking in all the Commandments, and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Lord, blameleſly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41866:5"/>1. Why, good Mr. <hi>Keith,</hi> were <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> commended for walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of Men?

            <p n="2">2. Can you charge any of us, againſt whom you moſt ſet your ſellf at that time, with not walking in the Commandments and Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God? Your Work lay then not with the Quakers. <hi>Zachary</hi> obſerv'd Circumciſion, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not waſhing of Hands, Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteries. We obſerve Baptiſm and Lord Supper, not Croſs nor Surplice: No wonder. I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard a Clergy-man ſay in the Church; <hi>your Sermon was nothing to the Text.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was it not a lovely ſight to hear you decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt Schiſm, who ſoon lept from <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Hall,</hi> after the Sacrament receiv'd, to a publick Church? To tell us, you were only as a Catechiſt there, or that the Biſhop gave his Conſent, is poor thin Sophiſtry; what is his Lordſhip ſuch a Plenipotentiary, as if all Power were given to him in Heaven, and in Earth, That he can make Schiſm no Schiſm, and Lay-mens Preaching lawful, without Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination? You were pleas'd to tell us, <hi>That there were no lawful Sacraments, where was no lawful Adminiſtrator.

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:41866:5"/>
&amp;c. That all other Churches wanted what was integral (Epiſcopacy): I thank you, that on my Letter to you, you were pleaſed to leave this out in the Printed Sermon.

It was not long ſince you told the Anabaptiſts they were in the right about the Subject and Form of Baptiſm: Some are pleas'd to ſay, I Cured you of theſe Errors. Then Independency was the beſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but for Presbytery, I confeſs you never had a good Word then; and why? becauſe they were not pure enough in admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Lord's Table: Yet gave a jump to Epiſcopacy (I thought you would as ſoon turn to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>) You are now gotten among pure Communicants: The Church was lately in the Wilderneſs, and you had found in the Revelations ſhe would not come out theſe Thirty Years. Well, ſeeing the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain will not come to <hi>Mahomet, Mahomet</hi> will go to the Mountain. Seeing the Church will not come out of the Wilderneſs to you, you are gone to her in the Wilderneſs (ſo it is) to get her Bleſſing too whilſt you live. You then told your Friends, Baptiſm was an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Chriſt, but there was not an Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator upon Earth.</p>
            <p>To be plain, I wiſh, That as you have long left the Quakers for talking of a Chriſt within, not of a Chriſt without; you have not run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that talk of a Chriſt without, not of a Chriſt within.

            <p>If you ſay, as I hear you do; a Surplice is no more than a Gown; what Man ſhould you go to your Table (or a Place nor ſo ſweet) with it? This would be accounted a Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Holy Garment.</p>
