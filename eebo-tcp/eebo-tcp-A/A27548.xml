            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Subject of my preſent Writing car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that Horrour and Amazement, as puts a Trembling into the very Hand that guides the Pen: The ſad Relation I have to make you, perhaps hath not hitherto been equalled in any Records or Hiſtory of the World, and I hope never will, the Calamity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed being unexpreſſable. 'Tis true, we have had very melancholy Narratives of the late Diſmal <hi>Earthquakes</hi> in <hi>Jamaica;</hi> but, alaſs, that Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has been infinitely Inferior to the much ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Hand of Heaven felt amongſt us in this Part of the World. As to the <hi>Earthquakes</hi> that gave you ſome ſmall Fright in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> thoſe were ſo inconſiderable, as to be ſcarce Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, little more than a Name.</p>
            <p>For Inſtance, at a City call'd <hi>Cattana</hi> about 60 Miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> and not far from the Mount <hi>Aetna,</hi> on the firſt Inſtant there happened an <hi>Earthquake</hi> ſo Violent, that not one Houſe has been left ſtanding in the whole City, but, together with the Churches and Covents of <hi>Fryers</hi> and <hi>Nuns,</hi> all levelled to the Ground, and buried in one Heap of Rubbiſh, in which near 20 Thouſand People periſhed, there remaining not above 1500 Souls alive, and thoſe not all intirely Eſcaping, for above one third of the Number were either miſerably Torn and Mangled, or otherwiſe Hurt and Damaged.</p>
            <p>The City <hi>Seraguſa Anguſta</hi> has participated in the like bitter Vial of God's Judgment, being in like manner intirely and utterly Deſtroyed, with an equal Fatality and Deſtruction of the miſerable Inhabitants, having only Five Hundred and odd People ſaved out of above 22000. A great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Town and Villages have proportionably groaned under the ſame deſtroying Vengeance: Nay, the very Rocks throughout the whole Iſland have been all Torn in ſunder, and ſuch diſmal Marks are left behind, that the whole Face of the Country is little leſs than one continued Chaos and Confuſion. In fine, it is altogether ſo hideous a Scene, that no Words can expreſs nor Pen deſcribe it. To ſum up our general Miſery and Deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the greateſt part of thoſe Remains of us, that God in his particular Mercy has been pleaſed to Spare, are forced to lie abroad out of the Towns and Cities (as no longer capable to ſhelter them) in Hutts and Booths ſomewhat like your <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew</hi> Fair.</p>
            <p>But in all theſe deplorable Objects before our Eyes, and the ſtill frightful Remembrance behind us, we have Reaſon to bleſs God that the leaſt Portion of this Miſery fell to our Share in this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Meſſina,</hi> compared with the more hideous Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines and ſuffering Neighbours round about us; for we had that particular Providence to have only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 40 Houſes intirely deſtroyed, and about 30 People Killed, though indeed we have ſcarce a Houſe in the whole Town that has not in ſome Meaſure been Shattered and Torn.</p>
            <p>After the Violence of our Conſternation was ſo far abated, as to give us leave to examine and compute the univerſal Loſs, we have had a Liſt of 37 Cities and Towns which have been wholly Ruined by this <hi>Earthquake,</hi> and above 120000 People periſh'd; beſides ſeveral Thouſands al Languiſhing, Maimed and Cripples.</p>
            <p>But to quit ſo deplorable a Theme, and Return Thanks to Heaven for my own Preſervation, Il ſhall conclude, by telling you, that God willing, I ſhall be very ſpeedily with you, this whole Iſland being now ſo ruined a Place, that I ſhall eſteem my ſelf Happy in my Deliverance from ſo Diſmal and Deſolate a Wilderneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
