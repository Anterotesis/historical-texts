            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>After ſuch amazements and aſſaults upon Our Patience, as no times of malice or cruelty can paralel (not excluding thoſe of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> holding the compariſon to our humane condition;) After we have circumſpectly meaſured the madneſſe of Our People with the raging of the Seas and noiſe of the waves, (the extent of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons none can reach but He who holds the waters in His Fiſt, and weighs the winds in a Ballance;) We are led to contemplate the <hi>Chaos</hi> from whence God raiſed the goodly ſtructure which we continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually behold.</p>
            <p>And finding the Light to be the begnning of the Creation, We thought fit to ſeparate you from the preſent confuſion fallen upon Our people, even you whom Our Anceſtors have clarified from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, and therefore dignified, that by your prudence the miſguidings and wanderings of Our meaner Subjects may be undeceived and reduced, who do now. (after the raſh rejection of Our glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Fathers prophetique Admonitions) feel the fruits of their follies to become their own ruine, beyond their wiſdom and power to redeem.</p>
            <p>How often We have viſited them with Meekneſſe and Clemency in our Meſſages and Invitations from the Courts of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whom, (for their onely ſakes, Our Predeceſſors have made their enemies) even when their offered powers would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled Us to correct Our moſt rigid Rebels, cannot by Us (without regret for ſuch enforcements) be remembred; Nor are Our Subjects themſelves without a ſad ſenſe of this, who, following their ambitious and avaritions blinde Conductors, are fallen into Laberinths of enmities with thoſe Princes, whereout their deepeſt ſubtleties cannot bring them.</p>
            <p>Happily by your inſtructions they may learn the Truth of this from their inconſtant ſimilitude the Seas, wch for many hundred of years, have by the Wiſdom of our Anceſtors their Princes, embraced them as their deareſt Friends, as well conveighing them with their Merchandize to the utmoſt parts of the World, as alſo returning them with ſuch fraights, as have made their Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes the Magazines of other Countries, whereas at preſent (though they be the chief Proprietors of the Worlds Food and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and Navigation) even thoſe Seas, for want of a lawful Soveraignty, deny them further Tutelage; The Ports of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Allyes refuſe them Trade or Harbourage; And <hi>England</hi> which ſate as a Virgin Queen upon the Waters, is Deflored, Raviſhed, and carried Captive into their Ports who formerly thought no Wealth too pretious to woe her.</p>
            <p>We ſay we look upon your Lordſhips ſhining as Tapors to our blinded Subjects, and as Light-houſes to their Unpiloted Rov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which Office we conſider to be to you alſo a Dignity, formerly belonging to the Lamps of the Church, though now they are under a Buſhel; As for the giddy multitude we pitty them with that Chriſtian Proverb, <q xml:lang="lat">
                  <hi>Eheu quam honeſte miſerii erant,</hi>
               </q> for by imitateing their Superiors they think they do well.</p>
            <p>When we behold the Robes of ſome mens Conſciences, who viſit us in Corporal Rags (the beſt Purchaſes their Loyalty can make) we reſt aſſured, that you who have this Worlds Wealth and not the Priviledge to uſe it, cannot enchain your Noble Souls to ſuch ſlavery; Nor is it our deſire to invite you to violence, but the Peace which we wiſh to your Bodies and Souls, we equally preſent in our daily Prayers for you, together with the meaneſt of our Subjects, and ſeeing your Chriſtianity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands your Brotherly Love even to your moſt inferiour Nighbours, you cannot better teſtifie the ſame, then by your exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to bring them into the Way of Truth, which they ſhall never find in the Paths of Rebellion.</p>
            <p>Again we call upon you our Peers, who cannot be unſenſible that the Streams of your own Honour muſt neceſſarily faile, when the Fountain which ſhould feed them is diverted; We adviſe yon to learn of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who after that abſence of their King <hi>David</hi> (more then ſeven times doubled by Our ſufferings) grew to contention for bringing home their perſecuted Prince.</p>
            <p>Nor are the opportunities difficult to your performance, there having been, in theſe many years of Our pilgrimage, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers aſſemblings of Our Subjects, which ſtill continuing, you may, if you pleaſe, impart unto them ſuch provident Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as may return them to their antient Duty and future welfare, the after fruits whereof none of you need to doubt; if you reflect upon the Felicities which all your Anceſtors have enjoyed under the Raigns of Our Predeceſſors; The inferiour ſort having alwayes before them that formidable affrightment of preſent beggary and continued want of Trade, ſo long as they <gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
