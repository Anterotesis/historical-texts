            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat this Author hath beene so carefully trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into the <hi>Latine, Spanish, French</hi> and <hi>English</hi> languages, is a concluding argument (to me) that no man of those Nations hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto written so well in this Argument: else, what needed they to translate him? Nay, and doubly translated hee hath beene; not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their tongues, but into their bookes; seeing that all the Writers of <hi>Geographie,</hi> since his time, have translated no small part of him into their Writings. Of some of which, what is from hence borrowed, is their very chiefe credit and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How much (I pray) hath that voluminous
<pb facs="tcp:6897:3"/>
               <hi>French</hi> Writer (translated into <hi>Latine</hi> by <hi>Godo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fredus,</hi> and into <hi>English</hi> by <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>The States of the world.</hi>
               </note> our <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Grime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone</hi>) beene beholding unto this Author? How much hath that <note n="*" place="margin">Petrus Bertius.</note> Turncoat Apostatizing Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giarie, that Enemie and Threatner of our <hi>English</hi> Nation, closely lurcht out of this Author? Some of our owne have beene more ingenuous, to name him when they quote him: and thats faire play.</p>
            <p>What the Setters forth of the two former Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in our language, meant in concealing his name, we will not doe them so much wrong as to ghesse at. Our <hi>Title page</hi> acknowledges him to be that famous <hi>Borero,</hi> the <hi>Italian:</hi> a Writer, that still passes amongst his owne people not only for a <hi>Wit,</hi> but for a <hi>Iudgement.</hi> His way of writing is his owne; for tis <hi>New:</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the usefulnesse of it let this be enough, that the nimblest Politico's of these active times could (perchance) have wisht, That the Relations of <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni Botero</hi> had only beene in their owne Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. That in this third Edition we have taken upon us to adde some new Discourses, and to Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment divers of the old; we were emboldned unto by the voyces and judgements of the Buyers,
<pb facs="tcp:6897:3"/>
whom we perceived to be better pleased with those inlargements in the second Edition, than with the first. In what we have done, we have bound our selves to the Authors way and method: and how much wee have added, the next <hi>Page</hi> shall tell you.</p>
            <p>We must not in the meane time conceale from you, how that divers of the <hi>Italians</hi> (who are as naturall haters, as they are fearers of the <hi>Spanish</hi> greatnesse) have taken the same exceptions to <hi>Botero,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> of old did to <hi>Proislart:</hi> who for writing so gloriously of the <hi>English</hi> victories, and so truly of the <hi>French</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes; have thought to disgrace his whole sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, by calling him a Pensioner of <hi>England,</hi> and a man hired to write by the good <hi>Rose-nobles</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> In like manner hath <hi>Botero</hi> (say some) beene suspected to have had a feeling of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Pistolets, for that hee hath written so magnificently of that Nation. This hath made us so wary and so carefull withall, by the truth of history to examine whatsoever might that way seeme hyperbolicall. Some things in that kinde wee had rather leave to be amended by your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than either too much to wrong that Nation,
<pb facs="tcp:6897:4"/>
or to correct our Copie by bringing it under our <hi>Index Expurgatorius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Author deserves rather to bee numbred among the Polititians, than amongst the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians or <hi>Geographers.</hi> Tis to his purpose some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to deliver you the situation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey he discourses upon; so to shew you, first the Greatnesse of each Kingdome: Secondly, how formidable or helpefull each Prince is likely to prove to his next neighbour; out of which two considerations, arise most of those leagues, Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, and those other Tyes of State, betwixt Kingdome and Kingdome. Thirdly, wee hence learne, how suddenly either Forces or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes may bee transported from one Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to another. And all these helpe him to relate of the Greatnesse and Riches of each King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; which to doe, bee two of his maine pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. The <hi>Historie</hi> that hee makes use of, is to shew you the valours of people, the power of taking opportunities, the advantages of the use of severall weapons, &amp;c. and that is also to his purpose. Both <hi>Geographie</hi> and <hi>History</hi> together (which bee the two favourite studies of the times) doe serve finally for the delight
<pb facs="tcp:6897:4"/>
of the <hi>Reader</hi>; and doe altogether make up our Author into a complete and a fine compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for Gentlemen, for Souldiers, for Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and for all men to passe the time withall: and for such an one we here commend him to your acquaintance. Fare well; and make him your owne.</p>

                  <p>The ancient <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> both to set forth their owne skill in Geographie and Philosophie, and withall to make shew of the largenesse of their conquests; with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and idlenesse enough, did like the <hi>Chinois</hi> at this day represent their owne kingdome in the map, as bigge as all the rest of the world besides. They therefore dividing the heavens into five <hi>Zones,</hi> made three of them utterly inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable: In those two next the Poles their philosophy judged not much amisse; for though no man of <hi>Europe</hi> hath beene neere to either of them, yet at that distance were the discoverers, yea the Seas themselves frozen up with most insufferable cold; and these the Ancients rightly called, The <hi>frozen Zones.</hi> But in that which is called the <hi>Torride Zone,</hi> their philosophy was much mistaken. This <hi>Zone</hi> takes up all that space which is betwixt the two <hi>Tropicks,</hi> and is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually divided by the <hi>Aequinoctiall</hi> line; the whole breadth of the <hi>Zone</hi> being 47. degrees, that is, 2820. Italian miles of ground. Now in this vast tract to imagine, all heat and no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6897:8"/>
temperature sufficient for a man to live in, was but an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the times, bewraying their owne unexperience, and the uncertainty of speculative philosophie.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, that neere unto the North pole men thinking to draw in their breaths, are in danger to have their throats pluggd up with an Isicle: and the <hi>Dutchmen</hi> wintering in <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> had their house covered with snow for nine or ten moneths together, nor could they get themselves a heat with all the fire they could make. But there is not the same reason for the insufferablenesse of heat, that there is of cold. Heat is the friend of life and nature, and cold the great enemie and nipper of <hi>vegetation:</hi> And whereas cold can without doors receiue no temperer; heat on the contrarie is capable of very many. For so hath the most wise <hi>God</hi> ordered his Creation, that under the <hi>Torride Zone,</hi> there is most abundant plentie of waters; Rain-water, Snow-water, Sea-water, Lake-water, River-water, and Spring-water. As for their raines, even the heats cause them; for in those moneths, when the Sunne is verticall, and right over their heads, and at that time of the day when he scorches from the height of his Meridian, at high noone dayes, even then most plentifully doth hee dissolve the clouds; and the raines at that time quench his flames most temperately. At mid-day also have they (and that constantly) those coole and gentle winds, which the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> call the <hi>Brizes.</hi> In those parts have they the most mighty Rivers; witnesse the <hi>Orelian</hi> 70. leagues in bredth, and that of <hi>Plate,</hi> 40. leagues over; with divers others not much streighter than our narrow Seas. There have they the Lake <hi>Ticicaca,</hi> 80. leagues compasse; <hi>Nicuragua,</hi> 300. miles long; and the Lake of <hi>Mexico</hi> 1100. miles about. To come on this side the Line (yet still under the <hi>Torride Zone</hi>) where can you finde such impetuous raines continually falling for some whole moneths together, and such vast Lakes and Rivers as in <hi>Aethiopia?</hi> the mouth of the River <hi>Zairo</hi> is 20. miles wide; nay, and in these places the rivers content not themselves with their owne chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6897:8"/>
but in the hottest moneths they then overflow the whole country, witnesse the <hi>Nile</hi> and the <hi>Niger</hi>: Another commoditie of these waters is this, that the winds skim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming over the face of them, fannes the coole vapour all over those quarters. Nay, as if this were not enough, wee see that <hi>God</hi> hath provided water even in living and growing Cesternes; the hollow truncks of most tree-like canes being full of water, and those coole a little also; such be plentifull in the <hi>Moluccas,</hi> even under the <hi>Aequinoctiall.</hi> Besides all this, hath nature provided those parts of many high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, which cast long shadowes, and mightily keepe off the Sun; yea, and which you would wonder at, even in that continuall neighbourhood of that great <hi>Thawer</hi> have you hils perpetually covered with frost &amp; snow: so is it in the Ile of Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> which is just under the <hi>Aequinoctiall</hi>; and so are the silver hills of <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The generall causer of these snowes and colds is held to be the length of the nights (whose long and frequent intermissions be another maine occasion of temper and cooling) and these are generally, and all the yeare, the neerer the Line, the longer, being there equall with the dayes themselves; so that there it snowes and freezes as much in the night, as the Sun thawes in the day; these snow-waters being naturally more cold than other waters also. For these and other reasons have our men of <hi>Europe</hi> found not people alone, but even white people, and most delicate and temperate dwelling (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance the best in the world) in this <hi>Torride Zone,</hi> yea, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the very <hi>Aequinoctiall</hi>; yea, much cooler Summers, than in <hi>Estramedura</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> or <hi>Apulia</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> To conclude this point, the ancient <hi>Romanes</hi> who lookt for nothing but rost-meat in that <hi>Zone,</hi> and that raw men could not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly live there, were a great deale worse scorched in their owne <hi>Italy</hi>; nor have those under the <hi>Torride Zone</hi> so much need of the <hi>Romane Grottaes</hi> or-<hi>Freskataes</hi> for to coole them.</p>

And this bright-shining colour (saith <hi>Aristotle</hi>) argueth heat: but blacke (the colour of the Southerne people) betokeneth want thereof. The grey eye (and such is theirs who inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite betweene both) is sharpest of sight, seldome troubled with dimnesse; and according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> denoteth good qualities: the Red, crueltie and austeritie, as <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> observed of <hi>Sylla, Caro,</hi> and <hi>Augustus.</hi>

                  <p>The bloud also of the <hi>Scythian</hi> is full of small strings, such as are discernable in the goare of Bulls and Boares, and betokeneth strength and courage. The people of the South haue their bloud thinne and fluent, like to that of the Hare and Hart, and denoteth feare. Whereupon it may be conjectured, that those Nations which are spread from the fortieth degree to the seventie five Northward, are hot within: but the people of the South, what they borrow from the Sunne, that they want in themselves; the inward heat being dispersed and drawne into the outward parts by the vehemencie of the outward heat: A reason why
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6897:9"/>
in frosty weather our minds and joynts are couragious and strong: in heat, idle, and lazie; and so our appetites and digestion more vehement in Winter than in Summer, (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if the Northerne winds be stirring.) The Southerne winds effect the contrary in all living creatures (saith <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi>) as may daily be observed amongst the <hi>English,</hi> the <hi>Germans,</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> travelling into <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine:</hi> where if they live not sparingly, they fall into surfets; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> living in <hi>Spaine</hi> after his <hi>Germane</hi> gourmandizing fashion.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who in their owne Countries live most niggardly, in our parts of the world prove better tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher-men than the natives. And this experiment falleth not out true in men onely, but also in beasts, which (as herds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men affirme) being driven towards the South, fall away and lose flesh: but if they feed towards the North, they prosper and wax fat. Which I the rather beleeve, for that <hi>Leo Afer</hi> writeth, that throughout all <hi>Afrike</hi> you shall almost see no herds of Cattell, nor Horse, few flocks of Sheepe, and scarce any milke at all. On the other side, the goodly droves of the <hi>English,</hi> the <hi>Germans,</hi> and the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> are celebrated of all writers: not because their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures are better, or sweeter than those of the South, (by the censure of <hi>Plinie</hi>) but for the nature and temperature of the Heavens, and the Ayre.</p>
                  <p>And as the Northerne man by nature is hot and moist, (the Elements of fecunditie) so there is no question, but that of all people they are, and have beene, the most popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. For from the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Scythians,</hi> the <hi>Germans,</hi> and the <hi>Scandians,</hi> not onely vast desarts, and goodly Cities have beene founded, and inhabited, but from their loynes also have Colonies beene derived thorowout all <hi>Europe.</hi> Well therefore might <hi>Methodius,</hi> and <hi>P.

And most true it is, that <hi>Iornandes</hi> and <hi>Olaus</hi> terme the North, the Store-house of mankinde; because from thence the <hi>Goths,</hi> the <hi>Gepidae,</hi> the <hi>Hunnes,</hi> the <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> the <hi>Lombards,</hi> the <hi>Alani,</hi> the <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundians,</hi>

                  <p>Which maketh me to muse, upon what reasons <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> could build to say, That the Northerne Nations were unapt for generation, <hi>causa frigiditatis</hi>; whereas the conjectures of heat and moisture, argued in their hot and fervent breathings, proceeding from the stomacke, and more apparant in Winter than in Summer, are not so effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually verified in any people, as in the inhabitants of the North. The true motives, I say, of promptnesse to genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not of sensuall concupiscence, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> also would have us to imagine: A vice more proper to the Southerne man: performance to the Northerne man.</p>
                  <p>Which indifferent limitation, was (without doubt) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to either climate by the handy-worke of God; that those who were of sufficiencie for generation, should not greatly be addicted to pleasures; &amp; the residue which wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of that measure of heat and moisture, should delight in wantonnesse, to raise their appetites; without the which, they would neither propagate their issue, nor by inter-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages maintaine humane societie.</p>
                  <p>And that this inward heat also maketh the people of the North more couragious, taller, and stronger, than the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the South, is apparantly discernable, not in our parts onely (by the operation of nature) but also in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dwelling beyond the Tropike of <hi>Capricorne:</hi> where the more they decline from the Aequator, the more they spread in stature and tallnesse. For the land of the <hi>Pentagones</hi> (of some termed Giants) is situated under the same latitude that <hi>Germanie</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>Which assertions holding true, it is no wonder that this strong and couragious people, the <hi>Scythians,</hi> have from the beginning cruelly invaded the South, erecting therein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goodly Trophies: whereas from the South hath scarce ever beene attempted a journey worth speaking of, to the indammagement of the North.</p>

For those which dwell beyond (being either none, or very few) are dried up (to use <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his terme) with as vehement cold, as the people living under the Tropikes are with heat: Not by reason of their inward heat, (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Meteors</hi> dreamed) but by the rigour of the cold, piercing their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and wasting their humours; unto which humours, the Northerne people are generally subject.

The Hungarian is a fierce assailant, and his horse must bee lookt too for feare of running away with the Coach. The high and low Dutch are bigge boned, but foggie people, and the Germane horse is not to travell above thirtie miles a day; that nation admires a poore English Hackney. The Tartar is a stubbed squat fellow, hard bred, and such are their horses. And so for our English.</p>

much wonder at the <hi>English,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings,</hi> for their nightly complaints of the bitings of the Gnats and Cimeces (a kinde of wormes breeding in their beds and bedsteads) whereas they themselves doe little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them.</p>
                  <p>But as the bodies of the Northerne people are endued with strength and courage; so the weake constitutions of the Southerne Nations are supplied by the extraordinarie gifts of the minde; terme them what you please, either wit, or subtiltie.</p>
                  <p>Of crueltie also they have ever beene taxed: Reade <hi>Leo Afer</hi> his Historie of <hi>Afrike,</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: or if Antiquitie please you not, then turne your eyes to the late butcheries of <hi>Muleasses</hi> and his children, and diligently weigh, if ever your eares heard of more hellish furies than those which these Princes have put in execution, either upon their vassals, or against their own linage. Which if you undertake, then you shall see miserable <hi>Muleasses</hi> deprived of his kingdome, with his eyes burnt out, his face disfigured, and in lamentable distresse (by the cruelty of his brother) prostrating his complaints at the feet of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour.</p>
                  <p>For to speake uprightly, from these Nations (more than from any other) have tortures of more exquisite device ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their originals: as exoculations, tearing of memb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>And, that no man should conjecture, as doth <hi>Polybius,</hi> that evill education should produce this disposition of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, I would advise him to looke into the nature of the Southerne <hi>Americans,</hi> who also bathe their children in the gore of their slaughtered enemies, then drinke their bloud, and lastly banquet with the quartered carkasses of their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6897:12"/>
enemies. But if peradventure any man will object the like crueltie in the Northerne man, I would wish him to put this difference: that the man of the North is transported into fury by the heat of courage, and pursueth his revenge in open field; where being provoked, and passion asswaged, he is easily pacified: whereas the Southerne man is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily provoked; nor once in passion, is easily to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: and in actions of warre, he wholly setteth his hopes on policies and stratagems, tormenting with great indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and crueltie his slaine or vanquished enemies, and that in cold bloud. A disposition base and brutish, arising part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (I denie not) from that instinct of fury, which evill education, and their inveterate desire of revenge, doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender in nature, but more properly increased by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall distribution of humours, and these humours by the inequalitie of the elements. By the influence of celestiall providence, these elements are proportioned, and by these elements humane bodies are transported and bloud infused in the bodie, life in the bloud, the soule in life, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the soule: which, although it be free from pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, yet by proximitie it cannot but participate of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-imperfection: the reason wherefore the people dwelling on either side our <hi>Middest,</hi> are more prone to vice and foule behaviour.</p>
                  <p>For as melancholie can no more be wanting to bloud, thanlees to wine; no otherwise can these passions, which arise from melancholie, be extracted from the body.</p>
                  <p>Now, the Southerne people having the greatest portion of their other humours drawne out by the heat of the Sun, the melancholike (wherewith they most abound) remaine, and as dregges settle at the base of all their actions, being the more exasperated by their froward and perverse dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions. That men of these constitutions are utterly implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>M. Coriolanus</hi> may serve for presidents; the former of whom, for that he could not have his will on his enemie, in a madding mood fell upon droves of cattell: the other would in no wise be reconciled to his Countrey,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6897:12"/>
before he saw the Cities thereof on a flaming fire, in danger of irrecoverable destruction.</p>
                  <p>But that the Northerne people have also their faults, and are subject to choler, I must not gaine-say, but advise you to consider, that when this passion happeneth to over-rule rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it burneth the bloud, and incenseth the minde to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling and revenge, but in a farre fairer measure (as I said before) than melancholie doth in the nature of a Southerne man. According to <hi>Cicero: Passion may over-beare a wise man; madnesse cannot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, that the people of the South have beene given to the studies of contemplation, (a profession befitting their melancholike humours) let their excellent Writers, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors of many noble Sciences, as the <hi>Historie of Nature,</hi> the <hi>Mathematikes, Religion,</hi> and the <hi>operation of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> plead their properties.</p>
                  <p>The Northerne people, being lesse given to contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reason of their plentie of bloud and humours, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempering their minds, and hindering it's faculties, have, without teaching, found out such Arts, as fall within the compasse of understanding and apprehension; as Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call workmanships, Ordnance, casting of metals, Printing, and Minerals.</p>
                  <p>Being also the Darlings of <hi>Mars,</hi> they have alwayes, and that with incredible eagernesse of courage, embraced the Art Militarie, loved Armes, levelled Mountaines, and turned Streames; giving themselves wholly to Hunting, to Tillage, to Grasing, and to those Arts which are managed by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: insomuch, that a man may well affirme, That their wits consist in their hands.

                  <p>OF this division are those, who at this day, understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the reciprocall bounds of Government and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6897:13"/>
and inured to civill and sociable conditions, are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently enabled to frustrate the policies of the South, and to oppose against the furies of the North. Out of this mould would <hi>Vitruvius</hi> have a Commander to be chosen; and how judiciously, let others say: wee will only maintaine by hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall experience, that the <hi>Goths, Hunnes, Heruli,</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> wasted <hi>Asia, Afrike,</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi>; and yet for want of good counsell, could never maintaine their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests: whereas farre weaker forces, assisted by wisdome and politike government, have not only brought barbarous Nations to civilitie, but likewise perpetuated most flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Empires.</p>
                  <p>In approbation whereof, the Poets fained <hi>Pallas</hi> to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and <hi>Achilles</hi> to be by her protected. It is recorded also of <hi>Cato Censorius,</hi> that he was a valiant Captaine, a sage Senator, an upright Iudge, and a great Scholer: of <hi>Caesar,</hi> that he was a Politician, an Historian, an Orator, and a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior: of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> that he was a good Governour, and a tall Souldier. And therefore no wonder, if the <hi>Scythians,</hi> hating Learning, and the Southerne Nations, abhorring Armes, could never make good their conquered acquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The <hi>Romans</hi> embraced both, to their great good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and according to <hi>Platoes</hi> rule, intermingled Musicke (as the saying is) with Martiall exercises. From the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> they deemed it no discredit to borrow Lawes and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: from the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> and <hi>Sicilians,</hi> the Art Marine: the Militarie they had in perfection by continuance and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduitie. Before these times, <hi>Scythian</hi>-like, they strucke downe-right blowes: afterwards, they learned of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> (saith <hi>Polybius</hi>) to thrust with the point.</p>
                  <p>Thus much, by way of Reading and Observation, for Inclination and Industrie: for mine owne part, I cannot but attribute these qualities of Strength in the <hi>Scythian,</hi> Wit in the <hi>Southerne man,</hi> and Indifferencie in the <hi>Middle man,</hi> to the Divine providence; who in his praescience adjudged it best, upon cruell and barbarous men, as upon Bulls and brute beasts, not to bestow these good gifts of the Minde:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6897:13"/>
neither upon subtle and vafrous people, Courage, and Strength of body; left both should abuse both, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of each other. For as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, <hi>There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more dangerous than armed furie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore, sithence all Nations have their faults, as well as their vertues, let us neither reproach the laudable sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie of the <hi>Southerne man,</hi> nor tax the free drinking of the <hi>Northerne man</hi>; faculties (without controversie) peculiar to either people: but rather, according to reason, let us weigh with our selves, that the <hi>Southerne man,</hi> for want of naturall digestion, if he should gourmandize, would fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Surfets, Apoplexies, &amp;c. and the <hi>Northerne man,</hi> if hee would, cannot constraine abstinence, by reason of thirst, proceeding of inward heat. And this should have beene the consideration of all Authors, before they had proceeded to rash condemnation.</p>
                  <p>So againe, if the <hi>Greeke,</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> the <hi>Arabian,</hi> or the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> be to be taxed of Superstition, Sorcerie, Cowardize, Trecherie, or Lasciviousnesse; yet let them not be so rejected, but that wee vouchsafe in them, to imitate what hath beene commendable, what excellent: For from these Nations, in truth, have Letters, Arts, Learning, Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, Philosophie, Religion, and the rules of humane Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie beene derived, over the face of the habitable earth.</p>
                  <p>Neither let us detract from the industries of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne Nations, neither take exceptions against the frailties of those whom God hath allotted to possesse the Middle Regions. For albeit (as I said at first) that no over-weening credit be to be given to Starres and Planets, yet so farre let us leane to the learned, as experience may seeme to verifie what they have observed.</p>
                  <p>The Aphorismes of the Signes in the Zodiake (saith <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi>) are intricate, and not understood by us, considering, that by the Astronomers owne observations to these times, all the points of the Zodiake, and the Signes, have wholly changed their stations.</p>
                  <p>To the Southerne people, they place <hi>Saturne</hi> as Lord and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6897:14"/>
Governour: To the Middle, <hi>Iupiter:</hi> To the Northerne, <hi>Mars.</hi> And these in generall. But because of particulars, they put <hi>Venus</hi> in conjunction with <hi>Saturne, Mercurie</hi> with <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> with <hi>Mars.</hi> The Sunne, as Moderator, they have confined as indifferent.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chaldeans</hi> say, That the influence of <hi>Saturne</hi> opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in apprehension: the influence of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> in action: and the influence of <hi>Mars,</hi> in execution. The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> terme <hi>Saturne,</hi> quiet, peaceable, contemplative; <hi>Iupiter,</hi> just, wise, &amp;c. and <hi>Mars,</hi> strong, and full of courage. <hi>Saturne</hi> (they say) is cold, <hi>Mars</hi> hot, and <hi>Iupiter</hi> moderate.</p>
                  <p>But the people of the <hi>Middle Region</hi> are neither borne so apt to the studying of arcane Sciences, as are the Southerne men; nor so eagerly given to Mechanicall labours, as are the Northerne men: but in management of civill affaires they prove most eminent. Let any man conferre Time and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, and he shall finde, that by this people the rudiments of civill behaviour, of Lawes, good Customes, Statizing, Merchandizing, Oratorie, and Dialect, have beene bette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if not invented. And no marvell: for <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi> are said to bee the Schoole-masters of Sciences, and they that are borne under either, are exceeding apt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of their proper inclinations. Witnesse <hi>Asia, Graecia, Assyria, Italy, France,</hi> and the higher <hi>Germanie</hi> (which lieth betweene the Pole and the Aequator, from the 40. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the 50.) From hence the greatest Empires, the best judges, the wisest Lawyers, the eloquentest Orators, the skilfullest Merchants, and finally the most exquisite Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians and Actors of Comedies, that ever were, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. In <hi>Africa</hi> have few such beene found: In <hi>Scythia,</hi> fewer, no, not one, <hi>Anacharsis</hi> excepted.</p>
                  <p>Thus hath God and Nature decreed, That the <hi>Scythian</hi> (or Northern man) should carrie the reputation of <hi>Strength</hi>; the Southerne man, the praise of <hi>Contemplation</hi>; and the people inhabiting betweene both, the <hi>Attributes of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> And yet in all places (according to their Situations) shall you finde, some more strong, some more contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6897:14"/>
and some more wise. <hi>Sed à particulari non est syllogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zandum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of East, and West, what more can be spoken? To places parallel, the Sunne neither riseth, nor falleth. When it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth the South with us, (being about noone-tide) then is it said to fall, by the Easterne people; and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, then to rise by the Southerne. And therefore, as well to reconcile the doubts of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> as to satisfie the <hi>Curious,</hi> in these unrevealed workes of God, and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Nature; the Moderne Cosmographers have beene bold to suppose the finite limitation of the East, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine in the Islands of the <hi>Molucca</hi>; and of the West in the <hi>Hesperides.</hi> For herein (say they) standeth the centre of the Globe, the Meridian of both Islands being 180. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degrees distant one from another. On the other halfe of the Globe lieth <hi>America,</hi> divided from either angle by so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensible a tract of Sea, that it deserveth by it selfe, peculiar Bounds of East and West.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T now remaineth, that I undertake the second branch of Observation; which is to relate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our traveller, of the greatest Princes and Potentates, which at this day sway the world,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:6897:15"/>
and how they have attained to their Soveraignty.</p>
                  <p>This earth, all created by one God, was not all given to one man; nor did God for ever intaile the possession and soveraignty over the same people, unto the same family. Foure Monarchies we have had, &amp; this last much mangled and invaded in the declination of the Empire; those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders who at first built their nests with the Eagles fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, falling out afterwards amongst themselves about the division of the spoile. Hence the <hi>Risings,</hi> and the <hi>Ruines,</hi> the <hi>Decayings</hi> and <hi>Inlargements</hi> of severall kingdomes, just as mens ambition and meanes did enable them. Since the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of the foure Monarchies, the greatest Princes of the world are these at this day; The King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the great <hi>Turke,</hi> both risen out of the ruines of the <hi>Romane</hi> and the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Monarchies. Next is the Emperour of <hi>Russia,</hi> and the <hi>Tartar</hi> in the North of the world; The great <hi>Mogore</hi> in East <hi>India,</hi> and the great <hi>Xeriff</hi> in <hi>Africa.</hi> And these be the most renowned Potentates; and yet, me thinks, that in this one respect, no one nation comes neere the honour of the <hi>Persian</hi>; which (first) was once a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; and secondly, since the decay of that, it hath ever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, a rich, a great, an active, and a glorious kingdome, which neither <hi>Assyria, Macedonia,</hi> nor <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe can boast of. This one thing let me note, that the glory of these Northerne Princes hath beene much more powerfull, but nothing comparable to the state and Majestie of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne Monarchs. That of <hi>Assyria</hi> was planted in the very garden and treasurie of the world, both for wealth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacie; and whereas the meanest subject may put a petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the hands of one of our Princes, the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> kept such state, that it was death even for the Queene her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to come neere the throne, untill <hi>Ahashuerosh</hi> held forth the golden scepter. The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> weares at this day (perchance) a homely Cassocke of blacke Serge, many a Curate in his Country having a better; whereas the King of <hi>China</hi> gives not presence, but rarely at the great suit of his people, and that out at the window of a gilded cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6897:15"/>
himselfe gloriously shining in Rubies, in Gold and Diamonds; and that at such time too, as the Sunne shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon him, even dazles the eyes of his adoring subjects, with the glitter of the reflection; and this they thinke the Sunne doth in favour of him, whence they call him, <hi>The Sonne of the Sunne.</hi> No Northerne or Westerne Prince at this day keeps state, but the Emperour of <hi>Russia,</hi> and the great <hi>Turke</hi>; nor are any so obeyed: but their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (as those of <hi>Assyria</hi> and <hi>Persia</hi> of old, and the great <hi>Mogore</hi> and <hi>China</hi> at this day) are rather Tyrannies than Monarchies.</p>
                  <p>Now most certaine it is, that all these Monarchies and mighty kingdomes arrived not to that height of Empire, but by time, by meanes, and by degrees: Time indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the designe, but twas the meanes that effected it. Let this be therefore laid for the ground of our discourse, that there be many (though secret, yet) irresistable causes of enlarging of Empire; which being made the right use of by a wife Architect of State, presently shewes the advantage to lie on his side, that hath the true knacke of <hi>King-craft.</hi> Tis true, <hi>That no man by taking thought can adde one cubite unto his stature</hi>; but yet in that vast frame of common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, by observing off me naturall and casuall advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and by introducing of some good ordinances and constitutions, there may be found out that Art of <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocles</hi>; To make a small towne to become a great Citie, and to sowe greatnesse to posteritie.</p>
                  <p>And these means conducing unto the enlargement of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, we will reduce unto seven heads: First, numbers of men. Secondly, valour of the Natives. Thirdly, pretence of Religion. Fourthly, plentie of money. Fifthly, advantage of weapons. Sixthly, happinesse of situation. Seventhly, the prudent apprehending of an opportunitie.</p>
                  <p>The inlarging of <hi>Dominion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numbers.</note> is the uniting and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of divers Territories under one Soveraigne govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereunto is necessarily required such numbers of men, and those not mercenarie, if it may be avoided, as may
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6897:16"/>
exceed the fatall dangers and doubtfull chances, incident to casualties. For small numbers are soone consumed by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, or oppressed by a more mighty enemy; overthrowne in one battell, or extenuated by a long warre: to which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences great numbers and populous Nations are not so subject. By these advantages, the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and the <hi>Persians,</hi> have for the most part brought their attempts to happy ends. The <hi>Romanes</hi> (if in respect of their honour) they did not ordinarily use huge Armies, yet they alwayes prevailed, by reason of their populous territories, or their indefatigable continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; being thereby able the second and third time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce their Legions, and finally with fresh supplies to overcome their enemies, being weakned with overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. And to multiplie and maintaine these numbers, as they sometimes received into their territories their very enemies, so at other times they sent forth Colonies of their owne people. By meanes whereof, and other such like po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies, they grew to such multitudes, that in the eighth yeare of the reigne of the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> the people were numbred to be six millions; a number at this present, not to be found in the bounds of all <hi>Italy</hi>; whereby they became conquerours of the parts of the world then discovered. Conquest (say I) undertaken by them, as much in regard of <hi>their numbers,</hi> as of <hi>their valour.</hi>

                  <p>A good <hi>Manroode</hi> is an inexhaustible stocke. By popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous armies did the Northerne Nations (called <hi>officinae ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi> the shops of men) overrunne farre greater Nations than their owne. Small numbers are quickly consumed by mortalitie, or one overthrow: whereas the <hi>Romanes</hi> by frequent re-inforcing their legions with new Recruites, put <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> (who had often overthrowne them) to confesse at last, That if he overcame the <hi>Romans</hi> once more, he should be utterly undone; <hi>Saepius possunt vinci, quàm tu vincere: Multitudes can indure to be overcome oftner, than a few are able to overcome them.</hi> But most expedient it is, that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and flower of the Armie, be made up of the natives, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6897:16"/>
not of strangers: for he that trusts to mercenaries, may sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly rise and spread his feathers, but he will mew them soone after. The <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> that the <hi>Romanes</hi> made use of, were either first made their owne by Indenization, or as good as their owne, by entring a league offensive and defensive, against a common enemie. Necessary it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that amongst those numbers there be a race of military men: such be the <hi>Timariotes</hi> amongst the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and most of the Gentry amongst the <hi>Polonians</hi> and <hi>Hungarians.</hi> Let every Prince thinke soberly of his forces, unlesse his <hi>militia</hi> of natives be good and valiant souldiers, able, and hardy bodies, and stout and sturdy stomacks. The plough ('tis true) breeds the souldier, that is the <hi>Foot</hi> which makes the bodie of the Armie, but they must expect much time to harden, to drill and exercise them; and therefore the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>French</hi> nation, though they must have an <hi>Infantery</hi> of Foot, yet their maine trust and glory of service they lay upon their <hi>Cavallery,</hi> which bee their Gentry, which use themselves to horse and Armes continually. But the chiefe secret of all for enlarging of Empire is, the maintaining of a sufficient number in Armes, such as hath beene on both sides in the <hi>Low Countries</hi> these 60. yeares; and such an Army may well deserve the name of a Schoole of Warre, and of a true <hi>Militia</hi> indeed. The <hi>Venetians</hi> (contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer discipline) doe with great wages levie sudden forces, and when the service is done, as suddenly disband them: but they doe it meerely to keepe Empire, and not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large it: their subjects be but few, and therefore their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion enlarges not.</p>
                  <p>True <hi>Valour</hi> consisteth partly in judicious apprehension,<note place="margin">Valour.</note> (whereby both convenient opportunities are discerned and entertained, and all difficulties discovered and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:) and partly in the forward resolution of the minde: by conjunction of which two Vertues, great enterprizes are undertaken with good successe; dangers almost inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table made light, and waighty attempts brought to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conclusions. Of these two I doe not know which to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6897:17"/>
Preferre as most necessary, and of greatest importance: but most certaine it is, that the one without the other, little availeth, to the atchieving of any matter worthy enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize. For wisdome without courage, may rather be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med subtilty, than judicious carriage: and courage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out discretion, is rather furious rashnesse, than true valour; neither let any man suppose, that from wilinesse without force, nor force without judgement, can proceed any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of worthy consideration. For all designes which have in them greatnesse, have also in them difficulty and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and to master uneasie actions, it is necessary both to use judgement in fore-seeing of dangers, and courage to overcome them once undertaken. These two joyned in one man, or in one Nation, are apt meanes to raise their fortunes above their neighbours. As we see amongst birds, the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle; among beasts, the Lion; among fishes, the Dolphin; (in whom doe appeare some shadowes of wit and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage) are esteemed as it were Princes above their Fellow-creatures.</p>
                  <p>But if any man affirme, that true judgement cannot be severed from true valour, yet give me leave to affirme, that ordinarily the one doth appeare more discernable above the other in divers subjects. For we may note in <hi>Philip</hi> King of the <hi>Macedons,</hi> and in <hi>Amilcar</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian,</hi> great foresight and wisdome, and in <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> (their sonnes) more courage and valour; In <hi>Fabritius,</hi> judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious warinesse; in <hi>Marcellus,</hi> couragious forwardnesse: both which were alike fearefull and disastrous to the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I say not, but some actions are better dealt in, by the one, than by the other. For generally, to conquer and winne, courage is more availeable than wit; but to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish and keepe that which is gotten, discretion is more to be desired than it; as may well be discerned in <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who have surer setled themselves in that which they have gained by their warinesse and judgement, than did the <hi>French</hi> by their fury and hazzard.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:6897:17"/>
But, if any man should urge me to speake my opinion, whether courage or wisdome be more necessarily to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; I would give my consent with courage: My reason is, that wisdome is given but to few, and that must be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by travell, by long time and studie, whereas courage naturally is by divers meanes, and upon sudden casualties imparted and dispersed in the mindes of many: which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny having to deale with few, will casually finde opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to vanquish and overcome. As we read of the <hi>Goths</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Vandals,</hi> the <hi>Tartarians,</hi> and the <hi>Turks,</hi> who with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage onely have atchieved great conquests, and have brought to passe such enterprises, as a man would have thought unpossible: The reason whereof is, that their sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and speedy movings, and their unexspected boldnesse, hath confounded the Counsels, and amazed the judgements of the wisest Commanders. Besides, in sudden hurly-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of war it is commonly seene, that courage openeth more gaps, and affordeth more releefe, than policie; for that in such cases, reason is jealous, suspicious, and fearefull, and men stand as it were amazed at the greatnesse of the present danger: whereas courage doth oft-times gather strength in extreme despaire. <hi>Vna salus victis nullam sperare salutem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, it is commonly seene,<note place="margin">Wisdome.</note> that those people who are more commended for their wit and policie, than for their courage and valour, have given place to those who have beene more esteemed for their resolution, than for their skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Macedons</hi> doe at this day to the <hi>Turks:</hi> the <hi>Gaules</hi> of old, to the <hi>French:</hi> the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> to the <hi>Persians:</hi> the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> to the <hi>Chaldeans:</hi> and other Nations to the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Parthians.</hi> Yea, it is the received opinion, That the <hi>French</hi> did range <hi>Italy</hi> at their pleasure under <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, and gave them the Law, because in those times the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes did wholly give themselves to the studie of good Letters.</p>
                  <p>Multitudes are nothing without valour: it never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the wolfe how many the sheepe be; and surely a small Armie of well trained and resolved old souldiers, under a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6897:18"/>
prudent Generall, will not much care for a confused rabble and multitudes of a Barbarous enemie. Let the <hi>Turks</hi> come into <hi>Epyre</hi> with 50. or 60000. men, <hi>Scanderbeg</hi> never ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for above 9000. to goe against them; and his few well led men came ever off with victory: When <hi>Tigranes</hi> the <hi>Armenian,</hi> having encamped his mighty Army of 400000. men upon the advantage of the hils, saw the <hi>Romans</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their march towards him not with above 14000. in their whole Armie, in a pleasant humour sayes he, These men be too many for an Ambassage, and too few for a fight. But before night he found them enough, for they gave him both the chace and slaughter. True valour (now) is a due mixture of judgement for the discovery of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with a quicke resolution to execute. Part them, and they are but subtilty, and fury; where they light together, they both advance the cause, the man, and the Nation. Both these have their severall activities: Courage, is able at a pinch to man up it selfe, and with a sudden assault to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise the unperfected consultations of the enemie. Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath its scouts ever abroad, to prevent such like fallies and cavalcadoes, that he be not taken sleeper. Resolution atchieves the victorie, and judgement keepes it. Shall wee goe lesse? and for Iudgement take Policy, and for valour courage? which of the two now is to be preferred? The question was anciently answered by the Orator; <hi>Parva sunt foris arma, nisi sit consilium domi; an army in the field is nothing so potent, unlesse the Generall receives his instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the councell-table at home.</hi> Policies office is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent dangers, and to plot designes: in both which it may be abused, either by feare, or want of intelligence. Against the first, courage is provided; the second it regards not, as accounting no difficultie insuperable. The <hi>French</hi> slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our English victories with imputation of rashnesse, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than valour; saying, We overcame dangers, because we were ignorant of them. And let us doe so still: <hi>Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo pugnando vincam, tu vince loquendo; We can give lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers leave to talke.</hi> Finally, politike enemies, have still gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6897:18"/>
way to resolute, yea even when they were vanquished: A resolved or a famished enemie that would get loose or die, make him a bridge of gold to flee upon. Certainly, a couragious enemy is never despised, a politike one may bee.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, their is a certaine fiercenesse, or rather fury,<note place="margin">Rashnesse.</note> which commeth neere to valour: for that excesse of bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, where with the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and afterward the <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> have atchieved notable exploits, is in some sort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable. But withall it is worthy of observation, that such like acquisitions are commonly of small continuance. Whereupon it was well said; <hi>Moderation to be the Mother of continuance, to States and Kingdomes.</hi> The <hi>Swissers</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves notable herein, especially in the warres of <hi>Navar</hi>; insomuch as <hi>Iames Trivultio</hi> reporteth, that their battell seemed rather to consist of Giants, than of ordinary Souldiers. Neither hath any Nation ever dealt more at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, or hath used more boldnesse and blinde fury, than the <hi>Portugals,</hi> whose voyages beyond the Cape of <hi>Good-Hope,</hi> and the Straights of <hi>Sinca-Pura</hi>; their conquests of <hi>Ormus,</hi> of <hi>Goa,</hi> of <hi>Malacca,</hi> and the <hi>Moluccos</hi>; the defence of <hi>Cochin,</hi> of <hi>Diu,</hi> of <hi>Chaul,</hi> and of <hi>Goa,</hi> are more true and commendable, than in reason likely to have prospered.</p>
                  <p>Military valour (now) is usually increased by some such like means as these. First, by using them to the wars: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by treating them like free men, &amp; not like slaves: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by inuring them to Arts manly: Fourthly, by appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting military rewards and honours for the souldiery.</p>
                  <p>When people are inured to the warres,<note place="margin">I Vse.</note> it takes away the horrour and hideous feare of it, and makes it but a kinde of trade to the followers, who desire it, to live by it. One of our lusty ploughmen of mid-<hi>England,</hi> would at fifty-cuffes or cudgels soundly beclowt a <hi>Hollander:</hi> but yet for that he never saw men with iron faces, he durst as well take a sheet of an hedge, as come within the cracke of a pistoll: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as tis usuall for the Bores of <hi>Holland,</hi> some with firelocks, &amp; some with Loapestaves, to make out parties of foot to goe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6897:19"/>
a-bootehaling, and even to set upon the horse of the enemie. And all this is, because the <hi>Englishman</hi> is not used to it, and the <hi>Hollander</hi> is. For the same reason there is much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the same people in time of warre, and after a long and effeminating peace. That felt <hi>Hannibals</hi> souldiers after their long and lazie quarter in <hi>Capua.</hi> Before <hi>Da'lvaes</hi> comming into the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> to provoke the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> there was not a more simple cullion in the world than a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> and now, no where a braver man: and what hath effeminated our <hi>English,</hi> but a long difuse of armes. Finally, though in a hard battell there would appeare a great deale of difference betwixt an old beaten souldier, who had seene men die familiarly, (even the sight of bloud making men fierce and fearelesse) and a man of our traine bands of <hi>London:</hi> yet surely would the Londoner much sooner prove fit for a battell, than the unexperienced coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man, even for that little use which he hath had of his Armes in the Artillery garden, and Military yard: of such force is use and custome to the increase of military valour.</p>
                  <p>Most requisite it is, that what people a Prince would make valiant,<note place="margin">2 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> he should use freely, and not like slaves. A Nation overlaid with taxes, will never prove military. In <hi>France</hi> therefore where the peasant is but the day-labourer for his Land-lord the Monsieur, and never suffered to eat good bit, to weare good ragge, or scarce to lay up a quart-deseue at the years end; the Prince does not much trust to the Enfantery, which is made up of this slavish people. Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced impositions, mightily abate peoples love and courages: and the blessing of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Issachar</hi> will never meet, That the same people should prove the Lions whelpe, which is used like an Asse betweene two burthens. But where the yeoman or husbandman may eat what he breeds, spend what he earnes, and have the benefit of the Law against the best gentleman of the Country, there are they fit for an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met. And all this is in <hi>England:</hi> in no Nation under heaven does the common man live so freely, or dares spend so frankly; no where so free minds, or so able bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:6897:19"/>
Three other usages have we had in <hi>England,</hi> which have kept our people in spirit and valour. One was, the tenure of Knights service: by vertue of which, when the Lord of the Mannor was called to serve the King, he drew his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants after him, who would not budge a foot, but live and die with their Land-lord and Captaine: for if they proved cowards to their Land-lord, how should they looke his sonne in the face, and how disgraced should they be at their returne into their owne Country? Thus proved we vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second usage was perfected by King <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, which was to reduce the Farmes and houses of hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry to a standard, assigning such a proportion of land to each, as might breed a subject to live in a convenient plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; neither with so much, as should effeminate him into the ease of a gentleman; nor with so little, as should discourage him with beggery.</p>
                  <p>The third usage was, the frequency of Serving-men and Retainers, who before that the sinne of drunkennesse had overflowed their gals and courages, were no whit for valour and service inferiour to the Yeomanrie. All these being kept in freedome, were maintained in courage, able and willing to serve both their Prince and Country.</p>
                  <p>A third thing necessary to breed courage in a Nation,<note place="margin">3 Manly arts.</note> is (if other reasons of State will beare it) that there be more addicted to arts manly, than unto sedentary and within-doores occupations. Such I mean, as require the strength of the backe, and brawne of the arme, rather than the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestle of the braine or finger. Some have thought that the multitudes of Monkes and Friers, would if need were, be a great strengthening to the Papacie, and fight hard for their Grandfire of <hi>Rome.</hi> But most assuredly those cage-birds have no military minds at all. When <hi>Rome</hi> was beleagred by the Duke of <hi>Burbon</hi> in <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth his time, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken too, not a Frier came to the rescue. The Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have sometimes made bold with the treasure of the Monasteries, but never thought their persons serviceable.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6897:20"/>
Had they beene martiall-minded, such multitudes would never have suffered themselves to be turned out of their warme nests, in King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighths time, without stroke striking. And surely the taking in of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Waltons</hi> into our Cities of <hi>England,</hi> was more out of charity than policie: for they being all given to neat and delicate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures, may seeme rather to bring riches than strength to the kingdome. Nor have our Kings hitherto tryed any of them in their souldierie. Studious, delicate, and sedentary arts, are not fit for armes: tis the whip, the plough-stafte, the slayle, the hammer, and the hatchet, that breeds the lusty souldier, that makes able bodies and couragious spirits.</p>
                  <p>Another great maintainer of courage is,<note place="margin">4 Military re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</note> the invention and worthy bestowing of military honours and rewards, after the service is done.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> had their <hi>Triumphs</hi> and <hi>Ovations,</hi> their Garlands and their Donatives to inhearten their souldiers. Orders of Knighthood were also invented for this purpose. But what's all this to the common Souldier, who hath no reward assigned untill he be lame, and that a little from the Treasurer. As for releefe in an hospitall, a serving-man can make better meanes to get into it than a poore souldier after twenty or thirty years service. This is a discouragement. But nothing so bad as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whose practice hath beene for these many ages, to reward most of his great Captaines (especially if they were not naturally <hi>Spaniards</hi>) first with an empty title, and lastly (being not otherwise able to pay or recompence them) with a Spanish <hi>sico.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A great and a maine advancer of a cause and enlarger of Empire,<note place="margin">3 Religion.</note> is Religion, or the pretence of it. Religion is well called the soule of the State; and is ever the prime thing to be looked into; most bitter dissentions and hinderances of all great actions, still proceeding from discontentments in Religion. <hi>Anima est actus corporis,</hi> sayes the Philosopher; <hi>Tis the soule that gives action and motion to the body</hi>; and if the affections and passions of the soule bee composed to a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6897:20"/>
well ordered and contented tranquillity and serenity, there followes health, strength, and growth in all the limbs and members of the body. The conscience is an active sparke, and can easily man up all the powers of soule and body, either for the maintenance or enlargement of it's libertie. <hi>Bonum est sui communicativum; Religion</hi> (contrary to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell) <hi>desires ever to be made publike:</hi> the spirituall man as well as the naturall, ever having a desire <hi>generare sibi simile; to beget others in his owne likenesse</hi>; to compasse Sea and Land to make a Proselyte. As therefore Princes have still ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it a dangerous thing to arme Religion against themselves; so have they most willingly accepted of the countenance of Religion. No such encouragement could come to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> or disheartning to the <hi>Philistines,</hi> as when the Arke of God was in the host of <hi>Israel</hi>: who is able to stand against these mighty gods, say they. Most surely is the kingdome of the <hi>Pope</hi> founded, whose ground is layed in the conscience. The <hi>Turke</hi> pretending to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate his Religion with fire and sword, we see how that hath advanced his conquests: and what advantage hath the <hi>Spaniard</hi> more made use of in these late warres, than a <hi>specious</hi> pretence of rooting out the Protestants, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishing of the Catholike Religion; by which secret he hath not onely staved off the popish Princes and Erectors of <hi>Germany,</hi> not onely from defending the common libertie of their country, but to enter that which they call the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly league</hi> with him, whereby for zeale of enlarging their Religion, they in the meane time weaken themselves, that he at last picking a slight quarrell with them, may swallow them up one after another, having long before designed them (Papists as well as Protestants) to a common destruction; for though the <hi>Spaniard</hi> pretends Religion, yet he intends Monarchie. This plot beginning to be discovered, we see most of the Princes of Christendome drawing to a <hi>leaguer,</hi> war, that is, to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federacy of all Protestant Princes against all Popish; &amp; who sees not, that if the Romish religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes, the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> Monarchie must needs prove as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6897:21"/>
Catholike (that is, universall) as his religion; and then will he prove the Catholike King indeed.</p>
                  <p>Now that the pretence of Religion may take the better, 'tis necessary that there be an union in it among all the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the grand pretender; or at least, that those of the adverse opinion be so few and weake, that they be not able to put an Armie into the field: tolerations of Religion are most dangerous: and surely, should the King of <hi>England</hi> much exhaust his land forces, to make a potent invasion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Spanish dominions, the Iesuites would presently stirre up our Papists to call him backe againe for the stinting of a domestike rebellion: for to be feared it is, that though all our Recusants be the King of <hi>Englands</hi> subjects, yet too many of them be the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> servants. No sooner (on the otherside) did the <hi>French</hi> King this present yeare lead his Army over the Alpes into <hi>Italy,</hi> but the Duke de <hi>Rohan</hi> thought it a fit opportunity for the Protestants to struggle for their liberty. And therefore plainly as of all good causes Religion is the chiefe, so in Religion there must be unitie; and that makes it irresistable. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as naturall bodies are best nourished by things of that nature and kinde whereof they consist; even so that Empire which is gained or inlarged by Religion, must ever be maintained by it: Twas therefore the old rule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Conquerours, to bring in their owne language, lawes, and religion among their new subjects. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> did this every where, and the <hi>Norman</hi> did it in <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Spaniard</hi> indeed hath not much stood upon lawes and language, but hath ever beene diligent for his Religion: and though in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> he suffered some Protestant Ministers awhile, (to make the conquest the sweeter) yet those being either dead or wearied out, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffered another Protestant to succeed. The diligence and fury of the Emperour for rooting out those of the <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stane</hi> confession in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> &amp;c. may well confirme the truth of this observation.</p>
                  <p>The qualities of weapons,<note place="margin">4 Weapons.</note> and the order of discipline are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6897:21"/>
important instruments of this martiall greatnesse. Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of weapons is like good casting, and strict discipline like skilfull playing, both which must needs winne the game. The <hi>Macedonians</hi> by their Pikes, and the <hi>Romans</hi> by their Pyles; the <hi>Parthians</hi> and <hi>English</hi> by their long bowes, have still beene victorious. The same thing doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine and fortification. The gunne hath brought all wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to an equality: that onely domineeres now. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing resists it but the spade. Tis a weapon of terrible execution, serviceable both by Sea and Land; &amp; yet are not the slaughters made by the gunne, any way comparable for numbers, to those bloudy battels wonne by the sword. The charges of this, disables Princes from levying Armies equall for multitudes to the Ancient; which now adayes beginne to be incredible. Infinite were it to speake of the new invented engines and fire-workes, and of the severall provisions to prevent them: and whether after-ages shall invent a more terrible weapon than the gun, is to us uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: which if it proves, the Inventor gets incredible ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                  <p>Treasure is an advantage of great importance:<note place="margin">Treasure.</note> forasmuch as there is nothing more necessary in warres, or of more use in peace. By meanes hereof the <hi>Florentines</hi> became Lords of a great part of <hi>Tuscany:</hi> they bought many Cities; they freed themselves from the incursions of divers enemies; they maintained the warres many yeares against the <hi>Pisans,</hi> and against the prowesse of those peoples, and the power of those Princes which did aid them; and at the last brought that warre to good end. By meanes hereof, the <hi>Venetians</hi> made themselves Lords of a good part of <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the forces of the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> the Arch-duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> and of divers other Princes. Whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that money worketh two notable effects, to the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and continuance of the greatnesse of kingdomes and estates: The one, to provide and gather forces, and those being gotten, to uphold and maintaine, with supplies of Souldiers, victuals, munition and armes: The other,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:6897:22"/>
that it doth offer us opportunity, (if not to weaken and vanquish the enemy, having gotten the advantage) yet at least, it doth enable us to endure and withstand him; that by drawing out the warre in length, wee may make him weary of continuance, and gives us benefit of time. By this temporizing, the <hi>Venetians</hi> being overthrowne in all places by the league of <hi>Cambray,</hi> in the end became Conquerours. So that, as to him that hath a populous army, and finds himselfe mighty and strong, it is most convenient to hasten the encounter, and to fight without prolonging of time; for delay (the overthrow of many actions) can afford him no other, but losse, sicknesse, infection, scarcity, famine, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies, and dissolution of forces: So for him that is better furnished with money than with men, it is most advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to prolong the warre, and to stand upon the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive; for in the end, his money may gaine him victory.</p>
                  <p>Finally, although some men will not suffer money to be called the sinewes of warre; because as <hi>Solon</hi> answered once to <hi>Croesus,</hi> (who in ostentation shewed him his gold) <hi>Sir, if another comes that hath better iron than you, he will be master of all this gold:</hi> yet notwithstanding, where numbers, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, valour, and weapons have not either singly or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether prevailed, there hath money alone done the feat. For this, have Townes and Kingdomes beene bought of trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: with this, purchase we either peace or victory. No place is to be held impregnable, whither an Asse laden with gold may get up. Two great effects it workes: First, it le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies forces suddenly, and withall, keeps them long together: Secondly, a monied enemie may fight when he will, and but when he will, and must needs therefore weary out his adversary, and so at last endanger either to overthrow him, or force him to a faire composition. For want of pay Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies mutinie, and will neither muster nor fight; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Germans.</hi> But <hi>Spinola</hi> hath made great use of a secret of warre, how in scarcitie of moneys to awe these mutiniers; and that is by paying and contenting the horse, and they shall keepe the foot in obedience. But this tricke
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6897:22"/>
will not alwayes serve, for in an Armie a man can hardly tell which is most necessary, armes, victuals, or money; this last alwayes fetches in both the other.</p>
                  <p>The advantage of site, is of much importance,<note place="margin">Situation.</note> for the defending or inlarging of dominion, and doth chiefly consist in this; that it be convenient for the making of an assault, and uneasie to be againe assaulted. For a Country being as it were naturally fortified, hath easie meanes to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, and get victory, to the inlargement of their owne dominions, and to the overthrow of anothers. Of this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are the situations of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Araby,</hi> for both these are (as it were) <hi>pene-Insulaes,</hi> having their greatest parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed with the Sea, whereby they may assaile the Countries neere adjoyning, and cannot without great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty be assaulted againe. The one hath dangerous shores without harbors, and is invironed with mountaines (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving few and secret passages) the other is inclosed with sands and desarts. Of like quality is <hi>Italy:</hi> And among the Islands, <hi>England.</hi> But this advantage of situation I hold not sufficient (of it selfe) to effect any notable exploit: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, there is required plenty of victuals, store of munition, armes, horses, and divers other necessaries, without which, there is no hope to accomplish any famous expedition. Moreover, such a disposition and quality of the country is necessarily to be required, that the aforesaid habiliments may easily be brought together, and removed to places, whither occasion shall command. And although those, which possesse the mountaines and higher places, may with advantage come downe upon the plaine and low countries, and by reason of the craggednesse and hard passages of their country, can hardly be assaulted againe; yet have not such people done any thing which may worthily commend them. For the mountaines be ordinarily long and narrow, or at the least, much broken and divided amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (which must needs hinder the speedy drawing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and uniting of their forces and necessaries;) againe, are they unprovided of victuals, and of all other things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6897:23"/>
of the warres, and therefore altogether unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in action. So that they warre rather after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of robbers and theeves, than of true souldiers: It may also be added, that the mountaine-men cannot live any long time, without intercourse and traffike with the men of the plaine Countrey. And therefore if upon any attempt, they doe not prevaile at the first brunt, their best course will bee to capitulate with their enemies, and to returne home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, although with losse; as did the <hi>Helvetii</hi> at the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of <hi>Mount S. Claud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So wee may see, that the <hi>Englishmen</hi> which inhabit a plaine and plentifull soile, have alwayes prevailed against the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Welshmen,</hi> who upon presumptions of their naturall situations, have divers times molested them. For the plaine Country by reason of the fruitfulnesse, doth minister all things requisite for warre, and to defray charges; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencie to joyne forces, and being gotten together, able long time to maintaine them: Whereas on the contrary, the Mountaines (by reason of their barrennesse) afford no provision for a long journey, nor are any way able to beare the charge of any notable enterprise.</p>
                  <p>Wherupon it doth proceed, that small Islands having the foresaid qualities of situation, have never attained any great Soveraignty; because the advantages of the Land are farre greater than those of the Sea. Moreover, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand cannot be great, unlesse it be enlarged by meanes of the firme Land; for Islands hold the same proportion with the Continent, that the part doth with the whole. Besides, they be for the most part long and narrow, as <hi>Candy, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus, Spagniola, Cuba, S. Laurence,</hi> and <hi>Sumatra,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot readily bring their forces together. Neither will I sticke to say, that Islands (if not strong in shipping, as <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands</hi>) although they may with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage come forth and assaile others, are not withstanding, as it were Cities without wals, laid open to the spoile of all Invaders. As it happened to <hi>Sicil</hi> being assailed by the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> and the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and afterwards by the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:6897:23"/>
and the <hi>Romans.</hi> But the Provinces of the firme Land, being for the most part of a proportion more round, and square, have their forces continually neere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to be speedily united; and therefore more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and apt for opposition.</p>
                  <p>Yet to small purpose are all these aforesaid advantages, if opportunity give not aid thereunto. This opportunity is a meeting and concurring of divers cadences, which at one instant doe make a matter very easie, and at another time, being overslipped, it will be impossible, or at least very hard, to bring to like facility. Wherefore amongst many and divers, I will here note the most principall. The first groweth by the basenesse and negligence of the neighbour Princes, arising either by reason of a naturall jealousie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and dulnesse, or of too long a peace. So <hi>Caesar</hi> possest himselfe of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of the Common-wealth, being ready, and in Armes, the State being disarmed, not looking for any such innovation. So the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> subdued the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Rome:</hi> The <hi>Arabians</hi> the Empire of the East, of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and of <hi>Spaine: Charles</hi> the eighth King of <hi>France,</hi> gained <hi>Italy:</hi> The <hi>Portugals, India</hi>; The <hi>Castilians,</hi> the new world; and <hi>Soliman,</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>Hungary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The division of the neighbouring States,<note place="margin">Pettie Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niories.</note> either into Common-wealths, or into petty Seigniories, and those of small power, gave courage to the <hi>Romans</hi> to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Lords of <hi>Italy,</hi> and made an easie passage for the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> into <hi>Lumbardy.</hi> This also made the attempt of <hi>Thus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian</hi> light unto the <hi>Florentines,</hi> and no lesse that of <hi>Barbary</hi> to the <hi>Castilians</hi>; which they would have found very hard, of either the one, or the other, had expected them with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med forces.</p>
                  <p>The variance and jarring of the adjoyning Princes did open the way to the <hi>Turks</hi> to enter so farre into <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and with little trouble to invest himselfe of many kingdomes therein. So <hi>Amurath</hi> the third, presuming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the civill discords of the Princes of the bloud Royall of <hi>Persia,</hi> made that attempt with great advantage. So againe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6897:24"/>
the <hi>Persian,</hi> upon the difference of the <hi>Scrivano,</hi> and the Bashawes of <hi>Syria,</hi> hath resumed the advantage, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly prospered. Neither doth the whole mischiefe arise out of these intestine jarres onely, but in all factions one part will be sure to intreat the aid of some forren Prince against the other: than which, no man can have a better occasion, because then he commeth armed into the owners house at his owne request. So the <hi>Romans,</hi> set foot in <hi>Sicil,</hi> being cald in by the <hi>Mamertines:</hi> In <hi>Greece</hi> by the <hi>Athenians:</hi> In <hi>Numidia</hi> by the sonnes of <hi>Micipsa</hi>: In <hi>Provence</hi> by the <hi>Marsilians:</hi> In <hi>France</hi> by the <hi>Hedui,</hi> and so from time to time by divers others. So <hi>Amurath</hi> the first King of <hi>Turks</hi> got hold in <hi>Europe,</hi> being requested in aid by the Emperour of the East, being then in warre with the Princes of <hi>Greece.</hi> So <hi>Soliman,</hi> in <hi>Hungarie,</hi> being intreated by Queene <hi>Isabel,</hi> and afterwards by King <hi>Iohn.</hi> So the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,</hi> in the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> being drawne thither by Queene <hi>Ioane</hi> the second: and so <hi>Henry</hi> the second King of <hi>France,</hi> made himselfe Lord of three great Cities of the Empire. Often hath it beene seene, that he that is now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in as a friend, does after prove an enemie; and if one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a civill warre cals in a forren arbitrator, both parties cannot get him out againe.</p>
                  <p>But another no lesse successefull opportunity hath also beene made use of, and that by way of marriage. By appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the opportunity of a marriage, were the two houses of <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> and the two kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> united. But no Prince hath made so great advantage of marriage as the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> The match of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was the very foundation of their greatnesse. By marriages were the severall Provinces of the Low Countries united, all which fell to <hi>Spaines</hi> at a clap. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, for this advantage hath the house of <hi>Spaine</hi> three times purchased dispensations from <hi>Rome</hi> for incestuous marriages, and more they intended too: <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth Emperour, was solemnly contracted to our Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> the second King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> sonne to the said Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:6897:24"/>
both wedded and bedded her: nay, upon strong ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances suspected it then was, that King <hi>Philips</hi> curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies to Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were for his owne ends, that if Queene <hi>Mary</hi> should die without issue, he might marrie her also; which he afterwards attempted by the Count de <hi>Feria,</hi> promising to obtaine a dispensation: so should <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have beene laid to <hi>Spaine,</hi> and what should then have hindred his Monarchie?</p>
                  <p>Now besides those advantages of humane policie and strength (before mentioned) God himselfe hath reserved a power at his owne disposing, in the giving away of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and in the cutting short, or inlargement of Empire. And to this end hath ordained these naturall Agencies and Assistances of Seas, Rivers, Mountaines, Marishes, Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, and the sandie Desarts. By these, helps he the weake to hedge and ditch out their incroaching neighbours; and by granting the mastership over these to another Nation, he can at pleasure scourge the rebellion or unthankfulnesse of those people, whom before he defended by them. And of these helps of nature something will we say, and in their order. And first for the benefit of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the profits of Merchandize, (both for impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and exporting of commodities) I will not here speake;<note place="margin">1 The commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the Sea, for the defending or inlarging of Empire.</note> (though even that tends so much to the inrichment and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the honour of the State, that in all treaties of warre and peace, I see, that the articles concerning traffike, are sometimes two thirds of the treatie; for so were they I am sure, in that politike and nice-driven negotiation of the peace betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> in the beginning of the Reigne of King <hi>Iames</hi>; the Lord Treasurer <hi>Cecil, Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and the greatest Sages of the kingdome, being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners on our partie; and the best pates of <hi>Spaine,</hi> for theirs:) but here I will onely treat of the Sea, as of a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne friend and bulwarke to that Nation that is neerliest situated unto it; and a maine helpe towards the keeping or inlargement of dominion. The Poets you know made a God of <hi>Neptune</hi> that obtained the soveraingty of the Sea
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:6897:25"/>
as well as of him that had the government of the Land: and truly to be Lord of the narrow Seas, and to enjoy a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, That the ships of all Nations shall strike faile to one of the Kings ships, is none of the least honours: and to bee master of the Sea, is more of it selfe than a pettie Monarchie. He that is so indeed may give the law, as well as he that is master of the field. The Sea-fight at <hi>Actium</hi> was it that made <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> sole Emperour of the world: and <hi>Pompey</hi> learned it of old <hi>Themistocles,</hi> that he that had the best Navy, would in the end prove the Conquerour: The victory that the Christians got at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> so arrested the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>aching of the <hi>Turkish</hi> greatnesse, that they have done little upon Chirstendome never since. I mention not 88. nor that the resistance that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have beene able to make against the greatest Monarch of the world, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds meerly from the advantage they have of him by their commodious situation upon the Sea, and by having more havens and ships than he.</p>
                  <p>This certainly will prove true; that if ever the Monarchie of <hi>Spaine</hi> be broken, it must be by Sea, even by the Fleets of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi>; and that know the Counsellours of the Emperour and <hi>Spaine</hi> well enough; who to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves masters of some good ports, have supplied their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a Navy, by a chargeable land army. For what thinke you else should be the designe of Monsieur <hi>Tilly,</hi> but to take the Sea by Land, to make his master Lord of <hi>Stoad, Hamborrough, Luckstadt,</hi> with other <hi>Hansee</hi> townes, and the <hi>Sowndt</hi> of <hi>Denmarke?</hi> and what makes the Emperour (who yet had never greater vessel than a <hi>Punt</hi> or <hi>Yaugh</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Danuby</hi>) to buy and hire ships so fast at this very present, at <hi>Lubecke, Rostocke,</hi> and other coast townes, and to appoint <hi>Mansfelt</hi> for his Admirall? Such a friend is the Sea to those that border upon it; and of such importance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the defending or enlarging of Empire. But as for Islands (such as ours) wholly situate in it; certainly that wall of water and sand about us, is a surer fortification, than Frier <hi>Bacons</hi> wall of brasse could have beene. Our Almighty
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:6897:25"/>
Creator (in an humble and a thankfull sense bee it spoken) hath even married us to his owne providence &amp; protection; the sand about us seemes to be our wedding Ring, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the Sea our Dowrie. By benefit of the Sea (as long as we have kept our selves masters of it) we have enjoyed peace, and have heard of, rather than felt, the miseries of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and (certainly) so long as we keepe our selves so, wee are at liberty to take as much or little of the warre, as wee please: and at length (verily) even the wealth of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> will be but an accessary to the command of the Seas. The <hi>Indies</hi> being but like the <hi>Bets</hi> at play; he that winnes the game, gets not only the maine <hi>Stake,</hi> but all the <hi>Bets</hi> by follow the fortune of his hand. This finally, is the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of an Iland, that it cannot be taken if it be master at Sea: tis not so much matter what the Land-forces be (in the resisting of the landing of an invading enemie,) seeing one Fleet is worth three Armies. Wee had two Armies drawne together on foot in 88. and one of traine bands to be called for upon occasion; yet our Fleet (blessed be God) did more service than they all; and good reason is there for it; For suppose an enemie this evening he discovered at Sea upon the coast of <hi>Kent,</hi> thitherwayes presently make the Land forces; but ere morning the wind chops about, and the enemy is ready within foure and twenty houres to land Northward, or Westward, where the Army cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be to attend him; but a Fleet (now) is ever ready to dogge him with the same wind; and is ever and anon bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up to him, still beating upon his Reare; and if it be able to doe no more, can yet at least hold him play, till the beacons be fired, and the Country forces come in to hinder the landing. And thus much for situation upon the Sea, and the strength which that affords us either in offending or defending, in keeping or inlarging of Empire.</p>
                  <p>Of all creatures in the world,<note place="margin">2 Rivers.</note> a River most resembles a monster. The head (like that of Rumor) is oftentimes not to be found; the mouth farre bigger than the head, and withall, farthest off from it; The head hath no motion; the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:6897:26"/>
veines feed the bodie; the mouth serves not but to void the supersfluities: How monstrous not withstanding soever it be, yet most beneficiall it is. The next advantage to that of the Sea, being the commodity of great, navigable, &amp; impassable Rivers. The <hi>Roman</hi> conquests never made stand in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> till they came to the banks of the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Danuby.</hi> but there they did for many ages. The swift River <hi>Oxus</hi> in the East of the world, hath beene the fatall bounder of two Monarchies: the River <hi>Don</hi> in <hi>Russia,</hi> hath the honour to part <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi>; and the River <hi>Dee</hi> by <hi>Chester,</hi> did a long time keepe our <hi>Welshmen</hi> thereabouts unconquered. Nothing awes a great River so much as a bridge; whose Arches he labours to overthrow with all his forces: for a bridge is the saddle to ride this Sea-horse: The Emperour <hi>Hadrian</hi> thought he had done such an act, when he had laid a bridge over the <hi>Danuby,</hi> that he expressed the memory of it (as of a victory) in medals and coynes. That mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have beene defeated in their passing of Rivers, need not be stood upon. When <hi>Spinola</hi> in these late warres, (being guided by a country butcher) had once passed the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and undisturbed set footing in the <hi>Palatinate: Be of good comfort fellow souldiers,</hi> (saith he to his Army) <hi>Ile warrant you that we shall never be fought withall by this enemie.</hi> For in passing of a River the enemy hath so many disadvantages, what by the swiftnesse of the streame, the smalnesse of the boats, the unsteadinesse of the footing, and the disorder in the approaching; that he that to save his owne will not then fight, will never fight: And thus see wee, that though Rivers be not (like the Sea) so apt to inlarge Empire, they bee most commodious to guard it, being once acquired: and that's no small benefit, seeing wise men have anciently accounted it, That <hi>Non minor est virtus quàm quaerere, parta tueri: Tis an argument of no lesse valour or fortune, to keepe what a man hath, than to get that which a man hath not.</hi>

                  <p>None of the weakest boundaries to Conquerours and Monarchies are the Mountaines;<note place="margin">3 Mountaines.</note> for were all the world a levell and <hi>Campania,</hi> what should hinder him that were

                  <p>Mountaines be naturall swellings of the earth, above the usuall levell or surface of it: which make the same excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the definition of the roundnesse of the earth, that a wart or pimple may to the smoothnesse of a young face. They may seeme to be some heaps of rubbish and offals, left of the creation of the world. The difficulty of the ascent up to them, the horridnesse of their cragges, the savagenesse of their wilde inhabitants, (beasts or people,) the chillnesse of their frostie tops, with the inhospitable barrennesse of their rugged sides, may give scandall, or leave an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of beggery and barbarousnesse to that country that hath most of them; if their commodities be not thought upon as well as their discommodities. For as they keepe their neighbours poore, so they keepe them safe; witnesse our unconquered <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> which, nor <hi>Romans,</hi> nor <hi>Danes,</hi> nor <hi>Saxons,</hi> durst ever throughly set upon.

in that great bank or trench upon <hi>New-market heath,</hi> which served for a boundarie to the kingdome of the <hi>East-Angles:</hi> and by raising up wonderfull and stupendous wals, as namely in that wall of <hi>China,</hi> which where the hils brake off, was continued and fortified for six hundred miles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: and that admirable <hi>Roman</hi> wall in the North of <hi>England,</hi> (even crosse the Iland from Sea to Sea) for the keeping out of the <hi>Picts.</hi> To conclude, mountaines and wals made good by the natives, preserve them in safety, but being once mastered and overpassed by the Conquerour, give way to a fatall and a sudden inlargement to his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and set a small period to the others liberty. When <hi>Hannibal</hi> had once passed the Alpes, within a little after, he presented his Army before the gates of <hi>Rome.</hi> When <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlane</hi> had wonne the wall of <hi>China,</hi> he did what he list afterwards in the Country: the <hi>Brittains</hi> losing their wall, could not hinder the <hi>Picts</hi> from setting up their kingdome: and surely since the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath gotten the passage over the Alpes, and made himselfe master of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> hee hath in expectation swallowed up all <hi>Germany,</hi> and in a manner besieged even <hi>France</hi> it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Of those other fortifications of nature,<note place="margin">4 Marishes.</note> Marishes, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesses, and Sandy desarts, I have lesse to say. Tis well knowne what advantage the Irish <hi>Kernes</hi> have made of their bogges and woods. Two famous Cities in <hi>Europe</hi> are built in marishes, namely, <hi>Venice</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Dort</hi> in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and both of them be called <hi>maiden Cities</hi>; for that hitherto they could never be ravished, never conquered. <hi>La Fert</hi> one of the strongest townes in <hi>France</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is thus situated: and in our Barons warres, have many sheltred themselves in the Ile of <hi>Elie.</hi> He that is to beleaguer townes thus situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, fights not against men, but nature. Marishes admit no drie lodging for the foot, no approaches for the horse, no sure ground for Ordnance, or heavie carriages: The towne feares no undermining; and a marish (finally) is not (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by long siege and famine) otherwise to be conquered but as heretikes be, and that's with faggots: and when that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:6897:27"/>
way approaches be made over it, the towne is ours, and Empire is inlarged.</p>
                  <p>Amongst Woods and Wildernesses, those of <hi>Hercynia</hi> and <hi>Ardenna</hi> have of old beene famous,<note place="margin">5 Wildernesses.</note> and were sometime bounders to the unlimited <hi>Roman</hi> Empire it selfe: nor have they beene conquered by force, but by time.<note place="margin">6 Desarts.</note> As for Desarts and Sands, I will mention no more but those vast Desarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> which the <hi>Turke</hi> cals his, but cannot conquer. An unknowne Sea and solitude of heath and Sand, is said to keepe the two mighty Empires of the <hi>Chinois</hi> and great <hi>Mogor,</hi> from incroaching one upon another. In such sands have whole Armies and Caravans beene buried: over these they travell (as at Sea) by observing the starres, and by Card &amp; Compasse. Of all the rest before named, these be the surest fortresses, and the most insuperable: no Army (that's wisely led) dares venture to march over the hot sands of <hi>Lybia.</hi> Desarts afford no towns for shelter, no food for men, no pasture, or so much as water for horses; all must be brought with them: and he that shall thinke to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his Empire by making an invasion this way, shall finde it worse than a long suit for a dribling debt, the charges will amount to more than the principall. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this tedious discourse: man looks upon the world, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Seas, Rivers, Mountains, Marishes, &amp;c. as upon things set there casually, or by chance; but God made them there, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on most wise designe: here he casts up a mountaine and that barres a conquerour; here he powres out a River, and in passing of that, overthrowes an Army; there plants he a wood, and by dressing an ambush in it, gives away a victory; and upon changing the fortune of the field Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires take their beginnings or periods; lawes and religions their alterations; the pride and policies of men are defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that his owne power and providence might onely be acknowledged. For by helpe of these naturall causes, sayes <hi>God</hi> silently unto Tyrants and conquerours, as at first he said unto the Sea; <hi>Hitherto shall thy proud waves goe, and no further.</hi>

Base and vulgar spirits hover still about home: Those are more Noble and Divine, that imitate the Heavens, and joy in motion.</p>
                  <p>Hee therefore that intends to Travell out of his owne Countrey, must likewise resolve to Travell out of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey fashion, and indeed out of himselfe: that is, out of his former intemperate feeding, disordinate drinking, thriftlesse gaming, fruitlesse time-spending, violent exercising, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular misgoverning whatsoever. He must determine, that the end of his Travell, is his ripening in knowledge; and the end of his knowledge, is the service of his Countrey, which of right, challengeth the better part of us.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6897:28"/>
thing but the shame of either, or repentance of both: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in my Travell I have seene some examples, and by them made use, to prevent both mischiefes, which I will briefly shew: And first of the better part.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Travellers Religion,<note place="margin">Of Minde.</note> I teach not what it should be, (being out of my Element) nor inquire what it is, (being out of my Commission;) only my hopes are, he be of the religion here established: and my advice is, he be therein well setled; and that howsoever his imagination shall be carried in the voluble Sphere of divers mens dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses; yet his inmost thoughts (like lines in a Circle) shall alwayes concenter in this immoveable point; <hi>Not to alter his first Faith:</hi> For I know, that, as all innovation is dangerous in a State; so is this change in the little Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of a Man. And it is to be feared, that he which is of one Religion in his youth, and of another in his manhood, will in his age be of neither.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, if my Traveller will keep this Bird safe in his bosome, he must neither be inquisitive after other mens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, nor prompt to discover his owne. For I hold him unwise, who in a strange Countrey, will either shew his minde, or his money. A true friend is as hard to finde as a Phenix, of which the whole world affoords but one, and therefore let not this my Traveller, be so blinde as to thinke to finde him every where, in his owne imagination. <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pithias, Pilades</hi> and <hi>Orestes</hi> are all dead, or else it is but a dead Story. And therefore let him remember that Nature alters, like humours and complexions, every minute of an houre.</p>
                  <p>And as I would not have him to change,<note place="margin">Of Religion.</note> so would I wish him, to beware how he heare any thing repugnant thereto: for as I have tied his tongue, so must I stop his ears, left they be open to the smooth incantations of an insinuating Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, or the subtill arguments of a sophisticall adversarie. To this effect, I must precisely forbid him the fellowship or company of one sort of people in generall; those are the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuites, underminers and inveiglers of greene wits, seducers
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:6897:29"/>
of men in matter of Faith, and subverters of men in matter of State; making of both a bad Christian, and a worse Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. These men I would have my Traveller never heare, except in the Pulpit; for being eloquent, they speake excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent language; and being wise, (therefore best knowing how to speake to best purpose) they seldome, or never handle matter of controversie.</p>
                  <p>As for other orders of Religion, Friers of Monkes, or whatsoever, let him use them for his bettering, either in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of language, or other knowledge. They are good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, they are not so dangerous; they talke more of their cheere, than of their Church; of their feasts, than their Faith; of good wine, than good workes; of Curtisans, than Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie. The reason is, because few of them are learned, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny carelesse in their profession, almost all dissolute in their conversation.</p>
                  <p>I have excepted against the Persons: I will now protest against the Places.<note place="margin">Of Persons and Places.</note> These are, <hi>Rome, Rhemes,</hi> and <hi>Doway,</hi> but these two last, being out of all ordinary road of Travell; I say, he that goes that way, goes doubly out of his way, and shall neither have this discourse for his direction, nor me for his companion. Let me only say of <hi>Rome,</hi> because it is the Seminary and Nursery of English Fugitives, and yet a place most worthy to be seene, <hi>(vel antiquitatis causa, vel novitatis)</hi> that it is suspected of all, knowne to many, and proved by some, to be dangerous that way.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the Persons and Places have I noted, hee that shall meet with others of like condition and danger, let him see and shun. It remameth I speake of bettering the minde, by the knowledge and understanding of tongues: for, as for learning the liberall Sciences, he hath much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meanes at home; their manner of teaching, and orders of Vniversities, being farre inferiour to ours.</p>
                  <p>For the attaining therefore of Language,<note place="margin">Of Language.</note> it is convenient, that he make choice of the best places: These are, <hi>Orleans</hi> for the French; <hi>Florence</hi> for the Italian; and <hi>Lipsicke</hi> for the Dutch tongues: for in these places is the best Language spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6897:29"/>
And as we observe a difference of speech in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; of the North, from the South; and the West, from both: or as wee have learned of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that they had five severall kindes of <hi>Dialects:</hi> so differ they infinitely in <hi>Germany,</hi> but that of <hi>Misnia</hi> is the best, where <hi>Lipsicke</hi> stands. More in <hi>France,</hi> where the <hi>Picard</hi> speakes one, the <hi>Norman</hi> another, the <hi>Eri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>an</hi> his, the <hi>Gascoigne</hi> his, the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venciall</hi> and <hi>Savoyard</hi> theirs, the <hi>Inlanders</hi> theirs: but of all these, the <hi>Orleanois</hi> is the best. As also in <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> hath one kinde of phrase and pronunciation; the <hi>Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> another; the <hi>Venetian</hi> a third; the <hi>Bergamasco,</hi> a worse; but the best of all is the <hi>Tuscan,</hi> where <hi>Florence</hi> stands: yet I prescribe not these places so precisely, as that he may not live in others, and learne the Language as well: for in <hi>Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany, Stena,</hi> and <hi>Prato,</hi> are some places, where the speech is as good, as that of <hi>Florence,</hi> and more retired, and of lesse charge: therefore fitter for some, whose proportion for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence is but small. So have ye in <hi>Germany, Heidleburge</hi> as good as <hi>Lipsick.</hi> And in <hi>France, Blois</hi> as good as <hi>Orleans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having made choice of the place,<note place="margin">Of Reading.</note> his next care must be to make choice of a good Reader, whereof he shall finde in Travell great scarcity. Let good acquaintance, or good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, bring him to the best.</p>
                  <p>For were it, that there were good Readers, it were here needlesse to set downe a course of learning: for hee might have a better direction from them. But for the cause allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, I will presume to advise him, that the most compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way of attaining the tongue (whether <hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>) is by Booke; I meane for the knowledge. For as for the speaking, he shall never attaine it, but by continuall practice and conversation. He shall therefore first learne his Nounes and Verbs by heart, and specially the Articles, and their uses, with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> words, <hi>Sum</hi> and <hi>Habeo:</hi> for in these, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the greatest observation of that part of speech. Let not your Reader reade any Booke of Poetry and the first, but some other kinde of Stile; and I thinke meetest, some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Comedie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:6897:30"/>
Let his Lecture consist, more in questions and answers, either of the one or the other, than in the Readers conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued speech; for this is for the most part idle and fruitlesse: by the other, many errours and mistakings, either in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, or sense, are reformed.</p>
                  <p>After three moneths, he shall quit his Lectures, and use his Master, only to walke with, and discourse, first the one and then the other: for thus shall be observe the right use of the phrase in his Reader, heare his owne faults reproved, and grow readie and prompt in his owne delivery: which with the right straine of the accent, are the two hardest things in language.</p>
                  <p>Privately hee may for his pleasure reade Poetry, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if at his returne, hee meane to Court it: but for his profit, if hee be a man of meanes, and likely hereafter to beare charge in his Countrey: or if a man of endevours, and willing to preferre himselfe by service, I wish him to Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: If one that would make a fortune by the warres, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him (beside History) to the Mathematicks, discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of warre, and bookes of fortification.</p>
                  <p>To this Reading he must adde a continuall talking, and exercising of his speech with all sorts of people, with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and much assurance in himselfe: for I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in others, that nothing hath more prejudiced their profiting, than their owne diffidence and distrust. To this I would have him adde an often writing, either of matter of translation, or of his owne invention, where againe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to the Readers eye, to censure and correct: for who so cannot write the language he speakes, I count he hath but halfe the language.</p>
                  <p>These then, are the two only meanes of obtaining a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, of speaking and writing: but the first is the chiefest, and therefore I must advertise the Traveller of the one thing, which in other Countries, is a greater hinderer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: namely, the often haunting, and frequenting of our own Countrey-men, whereof he must have a speciall care, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to distaste them by a too much retirednesse, nor to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6897:30"/>
hinder himselfe by too much familiarity.</p>
                  <p>It is thought also, that one language is a hinderance to the pronunciation (if not learning) of another: which if it be in any, is in the pronouncing, not the learning: and in the <hi>Italian</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> not contrary. To this effect therefore, I would wish the Traveller, first to spend his time in <hi>France,</hi> which language will much helpe to the understanding, and nothing hinder the speaking of the <hi>Italian,</hi> especially in us; who of all other Nations pronounce this language best next themselves, by their owne confession.</p>
                  <p>There is also another reason, why I would have him see <hi>Italy</hi> last, because we best remember the last impressions; and I would rather he should come home <hi>Italianate,</hi> than <hi>Frenchified:</hi> I speake of both in the better sense: for the <hi>French</hi> is stirring, bold, respectlesse, inconstant, sudden. The <hi>Italian,</hi> stayed, demure, respective, grave, advised. I would wish the Traveller therefore (because I speake now of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering his minde by conversation) observe with judgement, what he seeth in these Nations of <hi>Italy, France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> (for further I guide him not) &amp; out of their better parts, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the worse to themselves, gather so much to his use, as may make him a complete Gentleman. For example, he shall observe, that the <hi>French</hi> hath valour; but he hath withall, <hi>Vanitatem &amp; Levitatem.</hi> The <hi>Italian</hi> hath a discreet fashion of carriage; but, with this he hath <hi>Proterviam &amp; libidinem:</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> hath an honest and reall manner of dealing, but <hi>non sine commessatione &amp; ebrietate.</hi> Let him now of these three, learne their three vertues, so shall he come home a Valiant, Wise and Honest man. This is a better purchase than the Italian huffe of the shoulder, or the <hi>Dutch</hi> puffe with the pot, or the <hi>French</hi> Apishnesse, which many Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers bring home.</p>
                  <p>Touching conference, observe these rules: For the time,<note place="margin">Of Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> let it be, when you give leave to your minde to recreate your spirits, that you may the better conceive what you heare, and best digest things subject to your understanding. Let therefore the houres be in the morning, and in the Evening,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6897:31"/>
when the senses are fresh, and the wits quiet. But if you finde your senses dull with melancholy passions, quicken them shortly with some good societie. Touching the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, let them be of some good yeares for the most part, though sometime to heare a young man, will prove no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice. Observe opportunitie, sometime discoursing with the learned concerning History, the better to benefit me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory by application of examples. At other times, frequent the company of the expert, that by noting their observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and suting them to particular judgement, you may discerne the difference betweene Art and Nature, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Learning. Sometime discourse with the souldier, that in hearing of a drumme, you be not daunted in a skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish. Conferre much with Travellers, that by their discourse of forren natures, you may the better discerne of domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call disposition: Forget not the Divines for the comfort of your soules, nor neglect the reading of Scripture, for the better direction of your life and conscience. Talke not with women upon idle occasions, lest you trouble their wits, or displease their humours. To conferre with fooles is frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; with the wicked dangerous; but with the honest availeable, for they are vertuous; and with the wise profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, for they are gracious.</p>
                  <p>It now followeth,<note place="margin">Of the body.</note> that I speake of the Body, which is preserved in good state, by diet and exercise: For his diet, I neither prescribe what, nor how much to eat, I presume him able before he set out, to keepe his nose from his sleeve, feed himselfe, and be his owne carver: Onely, I must ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise him to beware of their Wines, which agree not with some natures, &amp; are hurtfull to all, in those hotter Countries, except sparingly taken, or well qualified with water. As for his viands, I feare not his surfetting; his provision is never so great, but ye may let him loose to his allowance. For I would not have him live at his owne provision, (especially in <hi>France</hi>) it will hinder his profiting, and onely further him with some few kitchen and market phrases. Let him be still in pension with others, so they be such, whose language he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6897:31"/>
learneth. His care shall be the lesse, his profit the greater, &amp; his expence nothing the more. I shall not need to tell him before, what his diet shall be, his appetite will make it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than it is; for he shall be still kept sharpe: onely of the difference of diets, he shall observe thus much; that that of <hi>Germany</hi> is full, or rather fulsome; that of <hi>France,</hi> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; that of <hi>Italy,</hi> tolerable; with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> he shall have much meat, ill dressed; with the <hi>French,</hi> lesse, but well handled; with the <hi>Italian,</hi> neither the one, nor the other.</p>
                  <p>As for his Exercises, there is danger but of one in <hi>France,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of Exercises.</note> and this is Tennis play: this is dangerous (if used with too much violence) for the body: and (if followed with too much diligence) for the purse, a maine point of the Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers care. There is another exercise to be learned in <hi>France,</hi> because there are better teachers: and the <hi>French</hi> fashion is in most request with us, and that is Dancing. This I meane to my Traveller that is young, &amp; means to follow the Court; otherwise, I hold it needlesse, and in some ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>These former therefore are two exrcises, which I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, but with their limitation. There remaine two other, to which I perswade: those tolerable, these commendable; those of grace and complement, these of use and necessity, to him that will returne ably qualified for his Countries service in warre, and his owne defence in private quarrell. These are Riding, and Fencing.

sterling is a competent proportion, except he learne to ride: if he maintaine both these charges, he can be allowed no lesse than an hundred and fifty pounds: and to allow above two hundred, were superfluous, and to his hurt. And thus ratably according to the number he keepeth.</p>
                  <p>The ordinary rate of his expence,<note place="margin">Of Money.</note> is this: ten gold Crownes a moneth his owne diet, eight for his man, (at the most) two Crownes a moneth his Fencing, as much for Dancing, and no lesse for his Reading, and fifteene crownes monethly for his Riding: but this exercise hee shall discontinue all the heat of the yeare. The remainder of his hundred and fifty pound, I allow him for Apparell, Books, Travelling, Charges, Tennis-play, and other extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary expences.</p>
                  <p>Let him have foure bils of exchange with him, for the whole yeare, with Letters of advice, to be paid him quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, by equall portions: so shall he not want his money at the day, nor be driven to those shifts, which I have seene divers put to, by long expecting Letters out of <hi>England</hi>; which either their friends forgetfulnesse, or the Carriers negligence, or the miscarrying of their letters, by intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or other accident, hath caused.</p>
                  <p>If he carry over money with him (as by our Law he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not carry much) let it bee in double Pistolets, or French crownes of weight: by these he is sure to sustaine losse in no place: and in <hi>Italy</hi> to gaine above twelve pence in the pound.</p>
                  <p>Concerning his bookes,<note place="margin">Of Bookes.</note> let them be few or none, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from place to place: or if any, that they be not such as are prohibited by the Inquisition: lest, when his Male is searched (as it is at every Cities gate in <hi>Italy</hi>) they bring him to trouble: whatsoever they be, they will put him to charge, for he payeth Tole for them at every such Towne. I would only have him to carry the papers of his own obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; especially a Iournall, wherin from day to day, he shall set downe the divers Provinces he passeth, with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; the Townes, with their manner of buildings; the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6897:32"/>
names, and benefit of the Rivers; the distance of places; the condition of the soyle; manners of the people, and: what else his eye meeteth by the way remarkable.</p>
                  <p>When hee commeth to the place of his residence, let him furnish himselfe with the best bookes of that profession, to which he addicted his study, or other he shall finde, not to be got here in <hi>England</hi>; and at his departure, send them home by his Merchants meanes.</p>
                  <p>I must advise as well for his Apparell, as for his Bookes:<note place="margin">Of Apparell.</note> that upon his journey, he be not overcharged with over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much luggage; even a light burthen farre carried, is heavy: beside, somewhat is like wise to be paid for these, at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of every City gate. Let him also take heed, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell he weares, be in fashion in the place where he resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: for it is no lesse ridiculous to weare clothes of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion among them, than at our returne to use still their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion among us. A notorious affectation of many Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, because it is not amisse,<note place="margin">Manners of Nations.</note> to be acquainted as well with the divers natures of Nations, soyles, and people, as with theorike of instructions: first, I counsell my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller, not to make any long abode in any Region, which he findeth not agreeable to his naturall constitution; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let him be ignorant of such comforts, as may prove best preservatives for his health: for although I hold it not best discretion to use the body to much physicke, yet in causes of extremity, to know the helpe of Nature, I hold it no vanity.</p>
                  <p>For the Soile (wherein Townes and Cities are seated) if it be sandy or gravelly ground,<note place="margin">Nature of Soiles.</note> and neere unto some fresh brooks, springs, or river, it may probably promise health, both to the inhabitant and stranger: but if the earth bee moorish, and stand much upon springs, and low towards the Sea, it may prove healthfull to the inhabitant, yet hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the stranger, comming from a more healthfull Soile.</p>
                  <p>For the people, let him chuse chiefly,<note place="margin">Of people.</note> and longest to stay amongst those kinde of Nations, who stand most affected
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:6897:33"/>
to the nature of his native Country, and let him bee never perswaded, that his neerest neighbours are his greatest friends; for you shall often finde no greater an enemy, than within the wals of thine owne house.</p>
                  <p>I will first speake of the <hi>Spaniard:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard.</note> Him you shall finde in nature proud, yet cunning. He will ordinarily use a kinde of courtesie, and seeme wise touching the world, and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike in plotting his will: valiant where he may either pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase riches, or reputation: jealous of his mistresse, envious of worthinesse, malicious upon suspition, and bloudy in execution.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> is more courteous,<note place="margin">Of the Italian.</note> but no lesse cunning, affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble where he seems to affect, but deadly dangerous where he growes jealous: thrifty in his purse, valiant in his kinde, and onely bountifull to his masters. Sharply conceived, of fresh memory, and for the most part excellently spoken. Many of them are good Schollers, some very good horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and for such Courts as their Dukedomes afford, you shall finde many fine Gentlemen. Their Ladies and chiefe women for the most part are painted, but witty in speech, modest in carriage, and where they affect, very bountifull. The chiefe men (as the Lords, Governours, and great Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates) are commonly ambitious, covetous, and vitious. And if you have the good hap to come into their houses, you shall seeme to see the nature of a devill solacing in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise: For you shall observe a stately house, richly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; a Lady fairely painted, and gorgeously attired; you shall see a Garden full of sweet flowers, and dainty fruits, a cage of singing birds, and perhaps a consort of sweet mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke; a banquet of excessive charge, and amidst all those, you shall see an old sheep-biter, with a nose too tedious for his face, his beard like the bristles of a hog, with a slavering lip, a bleare-eye, &amp; of a swelling speech, courting of a come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lady, and couching of a cold peece of comfort, being no lesse youthfull in desire, than aged in performance. But take heed that in too much eying of his Lady, he grow not jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of your affection, and suspitious of her favour, to the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6897:33"/>
assured shortning of your dayes, by a poysonsome tricke of an <hi>Italian fico,</hi> when he pretends most kindnesse.</p>
                  <p>For the younger sort, rather follow their good exercises, than conferre with their capacities: and above all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, avoid the haunting of brothell houses, which are there most infinite in number, &amp; common in use. They will impaire your health, impeach your purse, abase your credit, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the ruine of your content and fortunes.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>France,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> you shall finde the people proud, and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasticall, kind, but variable, jealous in being a friend, and lost upon a light humour, cunning in policie, and bloudy in revenge. The Noblesse commonly learned, the Souldier more desperate than valiant: much given to venery and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion; and making no conscience of abuse for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of a commodity. The Governours wise, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant rich, and the peasant a poore slave. The Ladies witty, but apish, and in their fancies as humorous as amorous: few of them beautifull, and commonly all painted and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, except some few of rare worth; which may bee the wonder of the country: And therefore as you finde them, so let them have their due honour. For <hi>Germany,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The German.</note> you shall finde the Nobles and chiefe Gentlemen, either great Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, or valiant Souldiers; rather resolute to gaine honour, than proud of Authority: their Cities strong, and their Merchants very rich, and their Countries well peopled. For their Ladies and Gentlewomen, by the grossenesse of their diet, and too much delight in drinking and banquetting, they are for the most part a corpulent kinde of people; yet many of them strong and of bigge bone, (as we commonly say) good bearers, and good breeders. The younger sort, as well men as women, very industrious, and the elder sort ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther politike than Religious: their Lawes very severe, and therefore the people in better order and obedience.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Poland,</hi> the Cities are strong,<note place="margin">Of the Pole laque.</note> and the people rather wise than wealthy: the Gentlemen for the most part given to armes, and the peasant in much subjection to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Merchant rather covetous than honourable, and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:6897:34"/>
the Schollers rather beloved than advanced: the women in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different faire, and better witted than spoken: the old men studious, and the younger sort seldome idle; little given to drinke, and as little accounting of honour, except it be in the field.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Low-countries</hi> and <hi>Denmarke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlander and Dane.</note> you shall finde them much to agree in nature, but that <hi>Denmarke</hi> will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a King, which I finde not willing in the <hi>Low-countries.</hi> Their Magistrates are rather wise by experience than by study; and the Souldier fitter for the Sea than the field. <hi>Denmarke</hi> is governed by the Kings law set downe: but the <hi>Low-countries</hi> have divers formes of Government, in a manner according to the disposition of the States and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours: much given to drinke, and yet serving their times: politike in their government: their old men wise and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous; their young men thrifty and industrious; and their Merchant very ambitious. For their religious, thinke of them as you finde them; I have seene them much reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and well maintained. And as for their Ladies, they are wittie and of a good complexion; for the most pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Their women are very private, fearefull to offend; but once lascivious, intolerably wanton, beastly, idle, and ill attended.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> are merry,<note place="margin">The Grecian.</note> lyers, blasphemers, promise-breakers, buggers, strong membred, and blacke haired.

Their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men small of stature, for the most part of good complexions, and not to be seene or spoken to abroad: jealous, revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (when they have opportunity) lascivious within doores or in their baths; very pleasing in matters of incontinency, and cleanly.</p>

Their women gorgeous in attire, with high <hi>Tiaras</hi> and veiles, like the <hi>Sultaneses</hi> amongst the <hi>Turks:</hi> long sitters at feasts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightsome in sequestration of pleasure; as beginning with a modest shamefulnesse, but ere you have concluded, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately wanton; cleanly in much washing, but withall using perfumes and odours; loving truly, and desirous to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in the first place of her husbands affection: For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing many wives, they are desirous to please.</p>

                  <p>And therefore since I have deciphered the persons, let me in a word advise thee of their properties: that is, to take heed of the pride of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the poyson of <hi>Italy,</hi> the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>France,</hi> and the drinke of <hi>Flanders.</hi> Beware of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and let not rash trust in friendship produce matter of fruitlesse repentance: Remember that <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pithias, Pilades</hi> and <hi>Orestes,</hi> are all dead, or else it is but a dead sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Nature alters like humours and complexions, every minute of an houre. And should I not speake too much to the worlds shame, I would advise thee to thinke, that there is no one man faithfull to another in the world. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this dangerous age, since every man is neerest, and onely neere unto himselfe, and hee is held the onely wise man, who hath the world at most command, let no man so presume of his owne sufficiency, as to neglect the benefit of counsell. Take a young man for thy companion, rather than for thy friend. The world affordeth but one Phenix, and let not any man be so conceited, as to thinke to finde him in his owne imagination. Serve God with devotion, and then care not for the devils illusion.</p>
                  <p>When thou returnest from these forren men, and forren places, resolve then also to leave their forren manners. First, come home to thy selfe, and then fashion thy carriage, thy apparell, thy studies, thy conscience, and thy conversation, to the best patterne of the place, from whence at first with good intent thou began'st thy pilgrimage. So shall the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of thy travell be pleasant, the profit infinite, and thy returne an ornament to King and Country.</p>

                  <p>Of all these seven parts, because <hi>Europe</hi> is farrelesse than any of the rest, and yet exceedeth them all in Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Magnificence, multitude of people, in might, puissance, and renowne; we will first beginne with the description thereof. It is bounded on the North, with the North Ocean Sea, on the South with the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> on the East with the floud <hi>Tanais,</hi> and on the West with the West Ocean. It containeth more than foure and twenty Christian Kingdomes at this day, as farre excelling the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of the Provinces in Religion, Arts, Valour, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilitie, as in elder age it did surpasse them in Prowesse and Reputation.</p>

                  <p>The aire hereof is most wholsome, the situation milde, the weather temperate, but not altogether good to ripen fruit: For neither in Summer season, the heat is so parching that it driveth the Inhabitant to seeke the shade, neither the cold in Winter so rigorous, but that he may well live from the fire side: By the influence of the aire, all parts of the yeare are tolerably warme.

The quality of the soile and constellation of the Heavens is moist with the most; whereupon it commeth to passe, that both inhabitants and strangers are troubled with the flix and Rheumes, and holpen or prevented with drinking <hi>Aqua-vitae.</hi> The Land is of divers Natures, in some place rough and mountainous, in others, boggie and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terish; shadowed with huge woods, and exposed to the winds, with intermixture of many great Lakes. Yea, in the ridge of their highest hils (mountaines indeed I cannot terme them) you shall find pooles &amp; marishes.

The hils swarme with cattell and sheepe, from whence they reape plenty of butter, cheese, and milke. The wheat thereof is small and short, and those vines which they cherish, serve rather for shade than profit. For in those countries the sunne entring into <hi>Virgo,</hi> causeth cold gales to blow, and in Autumne the' after-noones heat is so faint and short, that it cannot ripen the clusters of the vine.

It breedeth the injurious Wolfe, and the Fox, as also all other creatures tame and gentle, necessary for life, but of lesser growth except the Grey-hound. Almost all the woods are replenished with Deere, (and those so fat, that they can frant runne for fatnesse,) with Bores, Hares, in great abundance, Goats, Fallow-Deere: Hedg-Hogges, and Moales, are seldome seene, but Mice infinite. it aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth also with Falcons, Merlins, Eagles, Cranes, and in the Northerly parts with Swannes.

Next as farre as the Trent, which runneth thorow the middest of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> are sixteene other Shires proportioned, whereof the first six lie towards the East, and the other ten lie more to the Inland, other six border upon <hi>Wales,</hi> and are bounded towards the West.

Wherby it commeth to passe, that the Yeomen conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with the Gentry, doe in every place savour of some good fashion, and the Vpland Cities are the lesse famoused.</p>
                  <p>The land generally is exceeding fertile, and plentifull in beasts: whereby it commeth to passe that the <hi>English</hi> peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are more addicted unto Grazing, than unto Tillage: so that almost the third part of the soile is reserved rather for Cattell, Deere, Conies, and Goats a (for of this sort also there is great store in <hi>Wales.</hi>) And in every Shire you shall see Parkes impaled, and Forrests replenished with these

                  <p>For provision of the Inhabitants, neither is it lesse stored with corne, wilde fowle, and fish, so that for plenty, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and sweetnesse, it needeth neither the helpe of <hi>France,</hi> no, nor of any neighbour-bordering Country. Among other things, the flesh especially of their Swine, Oxen, and Veales, have the best rellish of any part of Christendome; and of Fish, their Pike and Oysters.

                     <note place="margin">Wealth.</note> The wealth hereof consisteth in the never-decaying Mines of Tinue and Lead, of Copper, Iron, and Coales; On the Downes groweth a small and tender kinde of grasse, neither dunged nor watred with spring or river; but in Winter nourished with the moisture of the aire, and in Summer with the dew of Heaven; which is so gratefull and pleasing to the Sheepe, that it causeth them to beare fleeces of singular goodnesse, and exceeding finenesse. The Island breedeth no Wolves, nor any other ravening beast; and therefore these their flockes wander night and day, by Hils, Dales, and Fields, as well inclosed, as common, without feare or danger. Most delicate Cloths are woven of this Wooll, which from thence are transported in great abundance, into <hi>Germany, Poland, Denmarke, Sweveland, Italy, Turkie,</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> where they are in high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest.

The Island is so commodiously seated for the Sea, that it is never without resort of <hi>Portugall, Spanish, French, Flemmish,</hi> and Easterling Merchants. The traffike betweene the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Flemmish,</hi> ariseth to an inestimable va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue: for <hi>Guicciardin</hi> writeth, that before the tumults of the <hi>Low-countries,</hi> they bartered for twelve millions of crownes yearely.</p>

                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:6897:43"/>
The aire is somewhat thicke, and therefore more subject to the gathering of clouds, raine, and winds; but withall, lesse distempered with heat or cold, for the same reasons of crassitude. The nights are lightsome, and in the Norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most parts of the Land, they are so short, that the falling and rising of the Sunne is discernde but by a small intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for that the Island is situated almost full North, and the Sunne in the Summer time moving slowly, and staying long in the Northerne Climates, doth almost compasse it round above. In the Winter, it is as farre removed, when approaching neerer the South, it runneth towards the East. I my selfe have observed, that in the City of <hi>London</hi> (being seated in the Southerly part of the Island) about the Summer Solstice, the night hath not beene above five houres long. At all seasons of the yeare the Country is most temperate, being subject to no extraordinary evill influence of the Heavens, so that diseases are not there very common, and therefore lesse use of Physicke than in other places: yea, many times some people there are, who attaine unto one hundred and ten yeares of age; yea some to one hundred and twenty.</p>
                  <p>Earth-quakes are here seldome heard of: and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings almost to speake of, as seldome. The soyle is very fruitfull and plentifull, and of all necessaries it yeeldeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, except of those things which are peculiar to hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or colder Regions. Vines are fostered rather for the pleasure of their shadowes, than for the increase of their profits: yet prosper they in all places, and bring forth Grapes; which notwithstanding hardly wax ripe, unlesse an unusuall hot Summer, or an artificiall reflexion doe helpe them. Wheat, Rye, Barley, and Oats, are sowed in their seasons: other graines they commonly use not; and of Pulse, onely Beanes and Pease. The fruits suddenly knot, but ripen slowly; the cause of either is the overmuch moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture both of the soile and the aire. Wine (as aforesaid) the Land affordeth not; in stead whereof, beere is in request; without controversie by use, a pleasant and wholsome Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verage.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:6897:44"/>
Wines are transported from <hi>France, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Canaie.</hi> The Woods are full of fruit trees, and most plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull of Mast. The Rivers faire, and runne through many Provinces. The Downes are many, yet neither cumbred with wood, nor overlayed with water, which by reason therof bringeth forth a tender and short grasse, gratefull and sufficient for the pasturage of infinite flockes of sheepe; And whether it be by the influence of the Heavens, or the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the land, they yeeld the finest and softest freeces thorow the whole world.</p>
                  <p>And first I must put you in minde of a Miracle; how this beast, besides the dew of Heaven ordinarily tasteth of no other water, so that the shepherds of purpose doe drive them from all watry places, upon true observation; <hi>That to let them drinke, is to let them bane.</hi> Without doubt this is the true golden Fleece, wherein the maine wealth of the whole Island consisteth. And for to buy this commoditie, immensive treasure is yearely reconveyed into the Land by Merchants; from whence it is never conveyed, because it is provided by the Lawes of the Kingdome; <hi>That no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son transport Gold or Silver, Plate, Iewels, &amp;c.</hi> Whereby it commeth to passe, that no Countrey under the Cope of Heaven is richer than <hi>England.</hi> For, besides those masses of Coyne, which passe this way and that way, through the hands of Tradesmen, Merchants, and Gentlemen; there is almost no person of meane condition, but for the use of his daily table, he hath either a Salt, Cups, or Spoones of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and according to his estate, more or lesse, for divers services.</p>
                  <p>It is no lesse stored with all kinde of Beasts, except Asses, Mules, Camels, and Elephants. It bringeth forth no mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall venomous Creature, or Beast of prey, save the Fox, worthy talking of: for the race of the Wolves is quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished, and therefore all sorts of cattell stray as they list, and are in safetie without any great care-taking for an Heards-man: so that you shall see Heards of Rother Beasts and Horses, and Flocks of Sheepe, in all places wandring by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:6897:44"/>
day and by night, upon Hils and in Vallies, in Commons, and inclosed Grounds, (by ancient Customes laid open after Harvest) wherein every Neighbour claimeth communitie to feed his Cattell.</p>
                  <p>For in truth, the Oxe and the Weather are Creatures especially ordained for the Table, than whose flesh there is not in any place a more savourie or delicious service. Of the two, the Steere is the best, especially if it be seasonably pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: of which there is no marvell, for that this choice is altogether exempted from labour, and fed up for food, and withall the diet of the English Nation consisting most upon flesh.</p>
                  <p>The people are tall of stature, faire of complexion,<note place="margin">Qualities of the English.</note> for the greater part gray-eyed; and as in pronunciation they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the <hi>Italian,</hi> so in constitution of body and fashion they doe well-neere imitate them.

Their acquaintance they invite to their houses, and there entertaine them kindly, and feast them both at noone and at night merrily, neatly, heartily, and bountifully: and this they terme courtesie, or neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. In battell they are fearlesse, excellent Archers, and in service unindurable of temporizing, and therefore the sword being once drawne, they forth with set at all upon the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of a battell, knowing that all good successe attendeth the fortune of the Victor. Fortresses they build none, but rather suffer those which heretofore have beene built, and are now by age growne ruinous, utterly to perish: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once in forren parts, they retaine all military discipline to the utmost. For Booke-men, their maintenance is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, their proficiencie commendable, and their number numberlesse. Their attire differeth not much from the <hi>French</hi>; their women are amiable and beautifull, and atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in most comely fashion. Their Cities are honourable,

In so much, that on my knowledge, even the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentest state there, boasting of the bravery of 200. gallies, and eight or ten galleasses, neither hath sufficient men to man twenty, nor can without time and great expences (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves) fill up the inventory of that scarcity.</p>

The burnt hils, and desart places will pregnantly prove the assertion. The Country man hideth

his garlike and onions, as ashamed of his diet. The Citizen powders fish, and buyeth cheese of the <hi>Dutchman.</hi> The Gentry is limited what he shall eat, and how much meat he shall carry home. The Court hath much adoe to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and many concussions are put in practice from the Kings prerogative, to furnish the offices with reasonable allowance; and in truth the provision is farre short from the expences of other places. For in generall, they are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times afraid to want bread, inploying certaine Agents for transportation both of corne and victuall, even from remote Countries; tempting us with gold and payment of ready money: For which purpose onely is there a Proviso in their Acts of Parliament, concerning the exportation of coyne.

                     <hi>Canaan</hi> had neighbourly meetings, feasts of triumphs, and times of private rejoycings: <hi>Spaine</hi> dares not, nor can bid you welcome. Idle jelousies, private hate, or hatefull pride, feare of expences, and vaine-glorious speeches, will quickly debarre you from the pleasure of invitation, from the freedome of conversing one with another, which cannot savour the noble entercourses of mutuall amitie. <hi>Canaan</hi> had the Temple furnished, as God commanded, the Priest obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the King, the Prophets in estimation, and the Feasts orderly celebrated: <hi>Spaine</hi> is polluted with worse severitie than Paganisme hath invented, <hi>viz.</hi> the cruell Office of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition, wherewith the Kings themselves have beene so over-awed by the insolence of the Clergie, that some of them have not spared to commit repentant error, to please the Pope. <hi>Canaan</hi> was a receptacle of strangers and Princely solemnities; <hi>Spaine</hi> hateth all men, commits them to fire and sword, and cannot order one solemne Festivall, unlesse at a Kings Coronation, a Princes mariage, or a Cardinals jollitie; where yet an <hi>Italian invention</hi> shall fill a table with painted trenchers and dishes of <hi>China,</hi> but a hungry belly

                  <p>
                     <hi>Canaan</hi> had cities of refuge, cities of store, cities of strength, cities for horses, and all for the Kings magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; to all which the wayes lay ordered, and men passed to and fro without danger and want: In <hi>Spaine</hi> you must have a guide, yea sometime a guard, and are so farre from expecting releefe after your dayes travels, that if you have not a Borachio before your saddle, and made your provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on the backe of an Asse, you may happen to be tired for want of sustenance, and faint with <hi>Ismael</hi> for lack of water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Canaan</hi> had beautifull women, and the Scripture sets it downe, as a blessing of God: But <hi>Spaine</hi> must mourne for strange disparity, and either lament that her women are painted, (like the images of the grove) or sit in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as <hi>Thamar</hi> did, to deceive <hi>Iuda.</hi> For in truth they are for the most part unpleasing &amp; swartish, or else by comming to be Curtizans, dangerous and impudent. Thus as yet <hi>Salomon</hi> must sit without compare, and his kingdome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matchably triumph with a noble prerogative.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>Salomons</hi> Court, the Queene of <hi>Saba</hi> commended the obedience of the Princes, the sitting of the Kings servants, the ordering of the Palace, and the multitude of the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions daily brought in: In <hi>France</hi> the Princes contest with the King, &amp; the Clergie affront the Princes, &amp; beare downe the States; the Pages mocke the Gentlemen, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen are proud of nothing but slovennesse, unbeseeming familiarity, and disorder. So that with much adoe, the mechanicall man stands bare to the King, and the Princes sit at meat like Carriers in an Hostry, without reverence, silence, or observation, and a vile custome having got the

                  <p>A wise State, and potent Kings, have built Navies, and travelled themselves in person to view them, raising cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes from their Merchants, loving and maintaining good Mariners and Pilots, contracting leagues with remote Princes, and making the confirmation of them honourable and advantagious: But <hi>France</hi> wanteth shipping, is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of Navigation, can raise no good Sailers, seldome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth voyages or discoveries, and consequently hath its Cities and Merchants conversing without forme or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition. For in <hi>Paris</hi> they dare talke of the Kings mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, intermeddle with all tractates of Parliaments and State, call any Prince <hi>Hugonet,</hi> who dares onely say, That <hi>Nostre Dame</hi> is but a darke melancholike Church; and finally, justifie very monstrous and abusive actions. So that to tell you of their inconstant and refractorie dispositions at all times, would sooner discover their loathsome effusions of Christian bloud, than prevent the customary and mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous practices of this people.</p>
                  <p>As for the Court, by reason of inveterate disorders, it is a meere map of confusion, and exposeth many actions, more ridiculous, than worthy of imitation.</p>

                  <p>But now (leaving these premonitions to your better considerations) as I have made you acquainted with those blessings, which in truth doe make a Kingdome really happy; So again for the strength of situation, I hope to make you as perfect beholders of the two properties which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> wished (above all projects what ever) to be regarded in the building of a Citie. The one is, that it be difficult to besiege; the other, that it be easie for conveying in, and transporting out of things necessary.<note place="margin">The situation of England.</note> These two commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties hath <hi>England</hi> by the Sea, which to the Inhabitants is a deep trench against all hostile invasions, &amp; an easie passage to take in, and send out all commodities whatsoever, being situated in the bosome of the maine Ocean, which even by naturall courses fortifieth the Iland, more than any Sea doth any other Kingdome. For, on the West lieth the <hi>Irish</hi> Ocean, a Sea so turbulent, and so full of rocks and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:6897:57"/>
flats, that it is very dangerous for great Ships; and on the East, South, and North, the flowing and ebbing of the Brittish Ocean, is so accidentall, the removing of the sands and shelves so uncertaine, and the rising and falling of the water betweene twelve and fifteene fathome (a thing won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull to be spoken of) so ordinary every twelve houres, that without an <hi>English</hi> Pilot, no stranger shall bee able to bring in a vessell in safety: And he likewise must bring his Tide justly with him, or otherwise it is impossible to land without perill. The Sea coast on every side is cliffie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible, except in some certaine places which are strongly fortified, as <hi>Barwicke, Dover, Dartmouth, Plim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, Portsmouth,</hi> &amp;c. so that the whole Iland may well be reputed for one impregnable fortresse.</p>
                  <p>To this strength of situation,<note place="margin">Forces.</note> sithence of late a worthy Gentleman (and that truly) hath not doubted to averre, that ten such Merchants ships well provided of munition and men, as in these dayes trade into the East-Indies, would not much feare the Navy royall of some Kings in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; why should we feare to rejoyce in the flourishing estate of that Kingdome, in whose Havens (besides the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Royall) two thousand vessels are reported to traffike yearely?</p>
                  <p>And be it as it may, to prove what we speake, and to passe over the much famoused passages of <hi>Edward</hi> the third to <hi>Callis,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth to <hi>Bulloigne</hi>; we will flie no further for examples, than the fourth yeare of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when in her journey to New-haven, the Navie lately neglected, was now againe so well furnished, as both the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Frenchman</hi> envied her Abilities.</p>
                  <p>But 88. was the yeare which gave both terrour and admiration unto all our neighbours. A yeare, by the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> foretold, to be the worlds climactericall, &amp; by <hi>Regio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montanus,</hi> Admirable. And so indeed it proved; full of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, anxieties, and menaces. The King of <hi>Spaine</hi> having of late dayes added unto his Seigniories of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the kingdome of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and boyling in revenge against this
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:6897:58"/>
kingdome, suggesting unto his imaginations, that if his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinies would vouchsafe as facile a victory against <hi>England,</hi> as elsewhere upon like suppositions they had bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him at the <hi>Terceras</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi>; then, even then at once had the life of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> lien a bleeding, his navigation to the Indies warranted, and his hopes finished. To the accomplishment whereof he presseth, forceth, hireth, and borroweth from sundry Nations, the strongest vessels, and therein imployeth his utmost meanes to have tamed the <hi>English,</hi> and confounded the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that ever memorable Lady, wary and provident, summoneth her subjects, relieth on their loves, and to the Westward opposeth a Navie consisting of 100. saile, there to wait the approach of this <hi>Invincible Armada:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause from <hi>Flanders</hi> the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> threatned no lesse danger, upon that coast also she laid twenty other good ships to attend his attempts, besides those of the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the West the enemy was discerned, and fight with present courage entertained, but precisely ordered, that none of the English ships should voluntarily (if otherwise it might be avoided) lay any <hi>Spaniard</hi> aboard, but alwayes fight at best advantage; endevouring by all meanes to keepe into the weather; whereby at all times soundly to have interrupted them, if they had offered to land; So to leave and take as occasions presented; they comming to invade, and the <hi>English</hi> ends being onely to keepe them from landing. The which directions were so punctually observed, as that this invincible fleet for all their force and appearance, without either gaining or sinking one of our vessels, was faine to flie away by the backe doore, I meane by the North Seas; wherein they found a miserable and tedious flight, lost an hundred and odde of their best ships, and in recompence, never got so much as one dishfull of fresh water, not ever landed one man (prisoners except) upon the English coast.</p>
                  <p>Whereat, neither let the Papist mutter, nor the ignorant
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:6897:58"/>
detract by saying, <hi>That is was the onely stormy winds, and tempestuous Seas, that afflicted our enemies, and drave them from our coast.</hi> These excuses argue bad spirits; for it could not be avoided, but that the English ships should also bee ingaged to like violent accidents of wind and waves, as were the Spaniards. The English had no determination to leave them, no, not to looke into any of their owne ports, or those of their friends for succour. And surely, foule wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and high growne Seas did more hinder us than them. For then could not we carry out our lower ports, being our best tyres; which the Spaniards might doe, their ordnance lying nothing so neere the water as the English did. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding we alwayes affronted them, and galled them with our great ordnance, as our best opportunities served; our ships being more proper for these Seas, than their huge Lee-ward Carts. Alwayes in spight of their hearts we kept into the weather of them, to our great advantage; which in truth was no small meanes of victory, and of their disgrace, that made so great preparations to so small purpose.</p>
                  <p>If they longed to be fought withall, and were not; why did they never offer to dispatch the businesse, whereabout they made the world beleeve they came so resolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined? why did they not make a triall for landing, or adventure the surprisall of some famous port, for want whereof in former ages <hi>Xerxes</hi> suffered that terrible defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at <hi>Thermipola?</hi> Before this was done, why ranne they away? of what were they so fearefull, who came like soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and resolute men, under the title of assurance, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer such a Nation? Did the terrour of a storme onely drive them from hence in such haste? were they not resolved to endure such weather (as should happen) in so great an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise? Did they thinke to winne <hi>England</hi> with bigge lookes, or to have tamed the people by tricks and dalliance, as they had done the surly <hi>Portugues</hi> and fine <hi>Italians</hi> their neighbours? Surely, it seemed the Southerne winds had only inflated their minds, as it is reported, it doth their mares in the <hi>Asturies.</hi>

                  <p>The force at land is nothing inferiour to that at Sea;<note place="margin">At land.</note> for the kingdome is divided into 52 Shires, in one only where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (commonly called <hi>Yorkeshire</hi>) it is thought seventy thousand foot-men may be levied. Every shire hath a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, who seeth to the election and training of souldiers when necessity requireth. In chusing of souldiers, they take the names of all the inhabitants: In the Country, from above sixteene yeares of age to sixtie; and out of these they chuse the likeliest and ablest for service. The taller and stronger are chosen for footmen, and these divided into foure kinds. The first are Archers, by whose dexterity they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:6897:59"/>
conquered the greatest part of <hi>France</hi>; tooke King <hi>Iohn</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and held <hi>Paris</hi> sixteene yeares in subjection. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of the <hi>Parthians</hi> were never more dreadfull to the <hi>Romans,</hi> than the Bowes of the <hi>English</hi> to <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> The second sort used browne Bils, well headed with Iron, with which they would strike, and also plucke a man from his horse. This was the ancient weapon of the <hi>Britons.</hi> The other two, use and experience of latter times hath taught them; the one is the Harquebuze, the other the Pike, a fit weapon for their constitution, by reason of their tall, strong, and man-like stature. For their service on Horsebacke, they chuse men of small stature, but well set, active, and nimble. These horsemen are of two sorts; some heavie armed, &amp; those for the most part are Gentlemen; other lighter armed, and some riding after the manner of the <hi>Albannesses</hi>; some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fashion of <hi>Italie,</hi> using a Scull, a Iacke, a Sword, and long light Speares. And although they are able to bring to the field 2000. men at Armes, and infinite troopes of light Horsemen; yet their Horsemen never carried reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Footmen: For <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth (which made so many journeyes into <hi>France,</hi> and obtained so many famous victories) to shew what confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they reposed in their Infantely, ever left their horse, and put themselves into the battell of their footmen: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>French</hi> Kings not daring to inure the Commons to warfare (left leaving their manuall occupations and trades, they should grow insolent in the warres, to which humour they are greatly addicted) alwayes put themselves &amp; their hopes upon the fortune of their Cavalry, being all almost Gentlemen. But, forasmuch as the <hi>French</hi> maintaine no good races of horse, and to purchase them from other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is a matter of great charge, and good cannot alwayes be gotten for money; for these reasons, and for that Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are nothing so serviceable in the field as footmen, I thinke the <hi>French</hi> have often beene so defeated by the <hi>English.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To shew what force the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are able to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:6897:60"/>
bring into the field, let these examples stand for many. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the eighth passed to <hi>Bullvigne,</hi> with an Army divided into three Battalions: In the Vantguard passed twelve thousand footmen, and five hundred light-Horsemen, cloathed in blew Iackets with red guards. The middle ward (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the King was, and passed last over) consisted of twentie thousand footmen, and two thousand horse, cloathed with red Iackets and yellow guards. In the rereward was the Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> &amp; with him an Army like in number and apparell to the first; saving that therein served one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Irishmen,</hi> all naked save their maneles, and their thicke gathered skirts: Their Armes were three Darts, a Sword, and a Skeane. They drew after them one hundred great peeces, besides small: an Army by the censure of <hi>Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardini,</hi> not more notable by the multitudes of souldiers, and consideration of their valour, than most glorious by the presence and Majesty of their King, in whose person ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at that instant, being in an age disposed and active, all those tokens of honour and magnanimity, which rising after to their full ripenesse and perfection, by degrees of time, study, &amp; experience, made him the most renowned and mighty Prince that lived in his age, in all this part or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of the earth, which we call Christendome. Their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages were so many, that therewith they intrenched their Campe like a wall. And for the conveyance of their Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, their baggage, and their provision, they transported into the Continent, above five and twenty thousand horse, beside all other kinde of cattell.</p>
                  <p>In the aforesaid yeare of 88. after that Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had provided fully and sufficiently to prevent her enemies at Sea, then ceased she not to be as carefull at Land, over her owne and her peoples safeties. And therfore to be ready against any sinister accident, which it might have pleased the Almighty to have given her at Sea: at land she appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted five and twenty thousand souldiers to attend the enemy all along the Southerne coast. At <hi>Tilbury</hi> lay the Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> with one thousand horse, and two and twenty
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:6897:60"/>
thousand foot, there to have entertained the enemie, if hee had kept his resolution; which was by the Thames mouth to have assailed <hi>London</hi> upon the sudden. For the guard of Her person (under the command of the Lord <hi>Hunsdon</hi>) she levied out of the Inland shires, fioure and thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand footmen, and two thousand horse, besides those good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troops which the Nobility and Gentry presented unto her Majesties view, to their meere love and zeale to Prince and Country.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> it may be supposed that the Princes of the reformed Religion will be alwayes glad to finde good correspondency from those,<note place="margin">France.</note> who are interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in like disadvantages as themselves. What may be done by the perswasions of the pestiferous Iesuites, God onely knoweth. But this is certaine, that betweene nations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ancient quarrels, and both aspiring to one and the same greatnesse, Alliances may easily be made, friendship never. At worst, the Frenchman is a tolerable friend, though a doubtfull neighbour. <hi>Francum amicum habe, sed non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinum.</hi> The like saith He, for us.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> it is a proverbe of his owne,<note place="margin">The Spanish.</note>

And if the late Queene would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved her men of warre, as she did some others addicted to peacefull courses, she might peradventure have broken that great Empire in peeces, and made their Kings as in old times, Kings onely of home-bred commodities. Well was it for them, that her Majesty (alwayes inclinable to peace) did all by the halfes, and petty invasions, which indeed was her onely errour; for future to teach the <hi>Spaniard</hi> how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himselfe, and to see his owne weaknesse; which till her attempts had taught him, was hardly knowne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; foure thousand men would have made a shrewd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to have taken his <hi>Indies</hi> from him; I meane, all the ports by which his treasure passeth: wherein he is more hated by the natives, than the English are by the Irish. And
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:6897:61"/>
then, what shall his <hi>Low-countrie</hi> Armies doe, if the <hi>Indies</hi> pay them not? nothing but mutinie, and spoile their owne territories as they have often done, and that of late yeares, almost to the ruine of the Archduke.</p>
                  <p>So againe, in 88. if that Queene would have hearkned to hazard, yet not without reason, we had burnt all his ships and preparations in his owne ports, as we did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon the same grounds and intelligence in <hi>Cadiz.</hi> He that knowes him not feares him, but excepting his <hi>Low-countrie</hi> army (as aforesaid) which hath continued in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline since <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth his time, he is no where strong, they are but follies that are spoken of him elsewhere: Hee knoweth that we are too strong for him at Sea, and have the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to helpe,<note place="margin">The Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</note> who are now by their industries in way to be strongest of all. They are a wise people, and tooke it somewhat in ill part, that we made peace without them; which in truth forced them to conclude their long truce: They were the last that put downe armes, and though they compounded upon the greatest disadvantage, (<hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> having first capitulated) yet they made a farre more noble peace than their associates did. Since that time (we finde) the people to be more provident, and by degrees lesse respective of their neighbors. All histories will tell you, it is a point worth the looking unto. For unto whom they fasten themselves, he that enjoyeth them will be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, and give law to the rest. If any man doubt it, he knowes not much, all nations have their imperfections, and so have we; faults have at all times troubled the eye of understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. For whereas in her Majesties time, it is well knowne, that one of her ships hath commanded forty of theirs to strike saile, they will now undertake us one to one, and, but for the jealousies of time, scant vouchsafe us a good word. But Kings are not like private men, they forsake not one another in adversity; though not alwayes for their sakes who are oppressed, but for their owne securities, because they watch (and reason good) the surmounting power of confining neighbourhood.</p>

I make no question, but by the generous disposition of noble Governours, they will returne to the disgrace of the brocheri. As it fell out to Captaine <hi>R.

                  <p>Thus have I shewed you the love of some, and the malice of others abroad, with our owne happinesse at home, if we can be thankfull for it. Amongst the which, as last, but not least, I account the continued tranquillitie of <hi>England,</hi> especially to consist in the moderate, yet honourable respect of our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie; wherein though they possesse few Castles or strong places, invironed with rampiers and ditches; neither that the Titles of Dukes, Marquesses, or Earles, are more than titular, as bestowed (upon desert) at the pleasure of the Prince; yet have they the government of Provinces, with subordinate authoritie over the people, to the great quiet of the State, and the prosperitie of the kingdome: where, on the contrary, the Nobilitie in <hi>France,</hi> possessing some absolute, and some mixt jurisdiction, with hereditary titles, &amp;c. being Lords not only of Townes, but of great and goodly Cities also, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving homage and fealtie of their tenants, doe (as wee have often seene) but badly and at pleasure acknowledge the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie of the King, and the Arrest of the Parliaments.</p>

                  <p>The Kingdome hath every where safe harbours, creekes, lakes, marishes, rivers and fountaines replenished with fish: As also mountaines, and in tops thereof large plaines, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abundance of grazing to cattell, and woods wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abounding with venerie.

                  <p>Those who inhabit the Southerne part, as by much the best, so are they the better qualified, the civillest, and speake the English language.

Their weapons are Bow and Arrowes, with a very broad Sword &amp; Dagger, sharpe but on one edge.

                  <p>They differ from the <hi>English</hi> both in Lawes &amp; Customes; for the one retaineth the Civill Law, as almost doe all other Nations: but the <hi>English</hi> have their peculiar or Municipall Lawes.

                  <p>Their houses in the Villages are very small, and covered with straw or reed; wherein as well their cattell as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in manner of stables, doe reside.

They are also ingenious, which their learning manifesteth, so that unto what Art soever they doe addict their capacities, they easily profit therein. And those also who meditate nothing but sloth, ease, and lazinesse, (though by refusall to take any paines, they live most basely and beggerly) yet will they not let to boast of their Gentrie, and that so presumptuously, as if it were more commendable for a man well descended to beg, than to betake himselfe to any ingenious profession, for the sustentation of his carkase. But withall they are accounted naturally to be very zealous in Religion.</p>
                  <p>About <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the <hi>Irish</hi> Ocean, are more than forty Islands, by <hi>Pliny</hi> termed <hi>Britaniae,</hi> but by others <hi>Meraniae,</hi> and <hi>Herbrides.</hi> The biggest of these in length exceeds not thirty miles; in bredth, not above twelve. Amongst them is <hi>Iona,</hi> famous for the ancient sepulture of the <hi>Scottish</hi> Kings.

                  <p>Beyond <hi>Scotland</hi> Northwards lie the <hi>Orcades,</hi> in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (saith <hi>Ptolomy</hi>) thirty, being partly seated in the <hi>Deuca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidon</hi> Ocean, and partly in the <hi>German.</hi> The chiefe whereof is called <hi>Pamonia,</hi> and therein is an Episcopall Sea, being sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto the King of <hi>Great Brittaine.</hi> The Islanders speake the <hi>Gotish</hi> tongue; a record, that they are descended from the <hi>Germans.</hi> Of stature they are all, of a sound constitution; whereby it commeth to passe, that for the greater part they are long-lived, although most commonly they live upon fish. The soile is in a manner alwayes covered with snow: in many places it will scarce beare graine, but of trees almost none.</p>

Thence-forth the English stiled the Countrey <hi>Wales,</hi> and the Inhabitants <hi>Welshmen,</hi> which denomination in the <hi>German</hi> language, signifieth a <hi>Stranger,</hi> an <hi>Alien,</hi> a <hi>Guest,</hi> or a <hi>New-come person,</hi> that is to say, one that speaketh

And so the <hi>Brittons</hi> lost their name, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Empire.</p>
                  <p>The soile of the Country, especially of that which adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth unto the Sea, or consisteth of Champian, is most fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, which both to Man and Beast supplieth great store of provision: but contrariwise, for the Major part it is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and lesse fruitfull, and (peradventure) for that good husbandrie is wanting, which is the cause that the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen live hardly, eat Oaten-bread, and drinke Milke, sometime mingled with water. In it are many fine Townes, with fortified Castles, and foure Bishopricks; if <hi>Hereford</hi> be accounted in <hi>England</hi> (as aforesaid) according to the Moderne description.</p>
                  <p>The people have also a different language from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> which they (who boast to derive their pedegree from the <hi>Trojan</hi> Line) doe affirme to participate partly of the <hi>Trojan</hi> antiquity, and partly of the <hi>Grecian.</hi> Verily, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the case standeth, their pronuntiation is not so sweet and fluent, as is the pronuntiation of the <hi>English</hi>; for that the <hi>Welsh</hi> in my opinion, do speak more neere the throat; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, the <hi>English</hi> truly imitating the <hi>Latines,</hi> doe pronounce their words a little betweene their lips, which to the Auditor yeeldeth a pleasing sound.

setting of the Sunne. To the Eastward it stretcheth ninetie miles, even a little beyond Saint <hi>Germains,</hi> a fine Village, and seated towards the right hand upon the Sea-shore; where its greatest breadth is but twenty miles over. For this por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ground upon the right side is incircled with the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; upon the left, with that inlet of Sea, which (as before we told you) pierceth into the Land as farre as <hi>Chepstow</hi>; where taking the similitude of a horne, it runneth along, first narrow, and afterwards broader, a little beyond the Towne of Saint <hi>Germaines.</hi> Eastward it bordereth upon <hi>England</hi>; upon the West, the South, and the North, the maine Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an incompasseth it.

But for Tinne, it is admirable boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, in the Mines whereof consisteth the better part of the Inhabitants happinesse.</p>
                  <p>However the Language is greatly different from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,</hi> but with the <hi>Welsh</hi> it participateth with no small affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: for either language hath the denomination of many things in common.

Whereunto the King condescended, not by the counsell of the old Marshall <hi>Biron,</hi> who told him, it was no policie to take the bird naked, when hee may have her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and all.

                  <p>This Bastile of <hi>Saint Anthonie</hi> was built (some say) by the <hi>English</hi>; and indeed it is somewhat like those peeces which they have built elsewhere in <hi>France</hi>; as namely, that at <hi>Roven:</hi> howbeit, I read in <hi>Vigner</hi> his Chronicle, that it was builded by a Provost of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the third of <hi>England</hi>; at what time our Kings began their first claime, and had as yet nothing to doe in this Citie.</p>

                  <p>The Chamber also of Compts, built by this <hi>Lewis,</hi> is a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:6897:70"/>
very faire roome; at the entry whereof are five pourtraicts with their Mots. The first is <hi>Temperance,</hi> with a Diall and Spectacle: her word, <hi>Mihi spreta voluptas</hi>; I despise plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Secondly, <hi>Prudence,</hi> with a Looking-Glasse and a Sive: her word, <hi>Consiliis rerum speculor</hi>; I prie into the counsell of things. <hi>Iustice,</hi> with a Ballance and a Sword: her Mot, <hi>Sua cuique ministro</hi>; I give to every man his owne. <hi>Fortitude,</hi> with a Tower in one arme, and a Serpent in the other: her word, <hi>Me dolor atque metus fugiunt</hi>; Both paine and feare avoid mee. And lastly, <hi>Lewis</hi> the King, with a Scepter in one hand, and holding <hi>Iustice</hi> by the other, and this written for his word;</p>
                  <l>My happy Scepter in calme peace doth flourish,</l>

                  <p>The buildings of this Citie are of stone, very faire, high, and uniforme, thorowout the Towne; only upon the port <hi>N.

They were pulled downe by <hi>Francis</hi> the first, and begun to be re-built, but finished by <hi>Henry</hi> the second, with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription: <hi>The most Christian King Henry the second began to repaire this time-ruined Edifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Vniversitie in times past was wont to have (by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) above thirty thousand Schollers of all sorts,<note place="margin">Vniversitie.</note> but many of these, children, such as our petty Schooles in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are furnished withall. The streets both in the Citie, Vniversitie, and suburbs, are very faire, strait, and long very many of them; the shops thicke, but nothing so full of wares, nor so rich, as they of <hi>London</hi>; in comparison whereof, these seeme rather Pedlars than otherwise: But for number, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, there be three for two of those.</p>
                  <p>The Faulxbourges are round about the Citie, ruined and utterly desolate, except those of <hi>Saint Germaines,</hi> which
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:6897:70"/>
was very fairely builded, and was very neere as great as the faire Towne of <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The benefit of this Towne is very great, which it hath by the River; as by which all the commodities of the Country are conveyed: whereupon <hi>Monsieur de Argenton</hi> reports of it:</p>
                  <l>Of all the Townes that ever I saw, it is environed with the best and fertilest Country.</l>
                  <p>And he there reports, that for twenty moneths that hee was prisoner, he saw such an infinite company of boats passe and repasse, but that he was an eye-witnesse, he would have thought it incredible: which he also after proves, by the maintenance of the three Armies, of the three Dukes of <hi>Burgundie, Guiennae,</hi> and <hi>Bretaigne,</hi> which consisted of an hundred thousand men, against the Citie of <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein they had besieged <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, and yet neither the Campe nor Towne had any want of victuals.</p>
                  <p>Some say, this Towne was builded in the time of <hi>Amazias</hi> King of <hi>Iuda,</hi> by some Reliques of the <hi>Trojan</hi> warre, and that it was called <hi>Lutece (à Luto)</hi> because the soile in this place is very fat, which is of such nature, as ye cannot well get it out, it doth so staine: whereof they have a By-word, <hi>It staineth like the durt of Paris.</hi> Others say, it was called <hi>Paris</hi> of <hi>(Parresia)</hi> a Greeke word, which signifieth (saith this Author) <hi>hardnesse or ferocitie,</hi> alleaging this verse:</p>
                  <l>Et se Parrisios dixerunt nomine <hi>Franci,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Quod sonat andaces, &amp;c.</l>
                  <p>And the <hi>Franks</hi> called themselves <hi>Parrisians,</hi> which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>Valiant.</hi> And by this Etymologie would inferre, that the <hi>French</hi> is a warlike Nation. But he is much mistaken in the word; for it signifieth only a boldnesse or libertie of speech: which whether they better deserve, or to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted valiant, you shall see when I come to speake of the <hi>Frenchmans</hi> humour and nature in generall. As for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the people of this Towne, their Histories tax it of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mutinies and seditions, matchable to the two most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Townes of <hi>Europe, Liege,</hi> and <hi>Gant</hi>; and yet this
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:6897:71"/>
last is praised in one thing, <hi>That they never harme their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces person:</hi> whereof the <hi>Baricades,</hi> as also the late assasinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, make <hi>Paris</hi> most unworthy. And <hi>du Haillan</hi> saith of them, when they stood fast to <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, against the three Dukes above named; <hi>That the Parrisians never held good side, nor never shewed any honestie but then only.</hi> But I can read no such matter in <hi>Commines</hi>; for I well remember, that even then divers of the chiefe of the Towne had practised secretly with the enemie, and were upon termes of concluding, when by the Kings wisdome they were prevented.</p>
                  <p>The Armes in this Citie were given them, <hi>Anno</hi> 1190, by <hi>Philip le Bel,</hi> who creating them a Provost and Eschevins, (like Office as our Maior and Aldermen) <hi>Gave them for Armes, Gules, a Ship Argent, and a Cheefe seeded with Flower de Lyce Or.</hi> Yee shall heare the French bragge, that their Citie hath beene besieged an hundred times by the enemie, and yet was never taken since <hi>Caesars</hi> time. The reason whereof, one of their best Writers gives; because (saith he) i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I compare <hi>Paris</hi> with <hi>London,</hi>

                  <p>Yea, if to some comparisons would not seeme distastfull, I dare maintaine, that if <hi>London</hi> and the places neere adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were circum-munited in such an orbicular manner as <hi>Paris</hi> is, it would surely exceed it, notwithstanding all its attributes of a <hi>Winding river,</hi> and the <hi>five Bridges,</hi> sorting forsooth to uniformitie of streets, as indeed we now behold it. And more than that, I am nothing doubtfull in opinion, that the Crosse of <hi>London</hi> is every way longer, than any you make in <hi>Paris,</hi> or in any other Citie of <hi>Europe.</hi> By this word <hi>Crosse,</hi> I meane, from <hi>Saint Georges</hi> in <hi>Southwarke,</hi> to <hi>Shoreditch,</hi> South and North; and from <hi>Westminster</hi> to <hi>Whitechapell,</hi> West and East, meeting at <hi>Leaden-hall:</hi> All

As for <hi>Paris,</hi> the better halfe are Gentlemen, Schollers, Lawyers, or Clergie-men: The Merchant liveth obscurely, the Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man penuriously; and the Craftsman in drudgerie: yet all insolent, and tumultuously affected upon the least unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed imposition, or supposall of alteration of their ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>Instead of a beastly Towne and durtie streets,<note place="margin">For neat and cleane streets.</note> you have in <hi>London</hi> those that be faire, beautifull, and cleanly kept.</p>

                  <p>In stead of a shallow River,<note place="margin">For River.</note> bringing only Barks and Boats, with wood, cole, turfe, and such Country provision, you have in <hi>London</hi> a River flowing twenty foot high, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with stately Ships, that flie to us with merchandize from all the parts of the world. And to descend to inferiour observations, I say, that the River only Westward matcheth that of <hi>Paris</hi> every way, supplying the Citie with all the fore-mentioned commodities at easier rates.</p>

                  <p>Or, if you please to view it without at all times, and yet consider the keeping of our Country houses, you may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say; There are not so many Gentlemen to be seene in any place, nor to so good purpose generally: for speaking somewhat liberally, like an Orator of Contentation, I aske, if the pleasures of <hi>Paris</hi> can bring you into walkes of such variety, with so little charge and expence, as <hi>London</hi> can: Surely no.

                  <p>And for their Watch and Ward, it goes by course, as in the City of <hi>Embden,</hi> and divers other in those low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.

Courts for Iustice, made Lawes and Ordinances to governe her Inhabitants, wherein no Countrey in <hi>Europe</hi> hath excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her: for so saith my Author; There is no Countrey in the world, where Iustice is better established, than in ours: which is true (but with this addition of a later Writer,) if the Officers thereof were not too too many, and if their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were rightly executed.</p>
                  <p>To force this Relation, with many notes of things here hapning in former ages, were both impertinent, and tedious; only I would wish you note, that in 482. the Christian Faith was here received, and in the yeare 800. the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire hither translated.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Countrie of <hi>France,</hi> the State is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, and the government mixt: for the authoritie of <hi>Maieurs, Eschevins, Consuls, Iureurs, &amp;c.</hi> is Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call: the <hi>Paires,</hi> the <hi>Councels,</hi> the <hi>Parliaments,</hi> the <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of <hi>Counts,</hi> the <hi>Generalities,</hi> &amp;c. are Aristocraticall. The calling of Assemblies, giving of Offices, sending Embassages, concluding of Treaties, pardoning of offences, ennobling of Families, legitimation of Bastards, coyning of moneys, and divers other, to the number of foure and twentie, are meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Regall, called of the <hi>French, Droicts Royaux.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And sure it is, that no Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> is a more perfect Monarch than he: for besides all these Privileges named, as we say of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> that it hath the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to be appealed unto, from all other Courts, which they call (<hi>the last appeale,</hi>) so is it likewise true, that the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath the meere and absolute authoritie over this. For though no Edict or Proclamation, no Warre or Peace which he makes, be good, without the consent and <hi>Arrest</hi> (as they call it) of this Court: Yet true it is, that when he, sending to them for their confirmation and ratifying thereof, if at first they refuse, and send Deputies to his Majesty to informe him of their reasons, with humble suit to revoke the same, he returnes them upon paine of his displeasure and deprivation of their Offices, to confirme it. <hi>Sic volo, sic jubeo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As touching the Lawes, we must know,<note place="margin">Lawes.</note> that most of them
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6897:75"/>
are grounded on the Civill Law of the Emperour: but so, as this State ever protesteth against them: insomuch as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times it was ordained, that he which alleaged any Law of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> should lose his head. Of the Lawes in force, some are fundamentall, as they call them, and immortall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Such as nor King, nor assembly can abrogate: others are Temporall.</p>
                  <p>Of the first sort, I will only remember you of two exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: the Law <hi>Salique,</hi> and that of <hi>Appennages.</hi> As for the first, they would needs make the world beleeve, that it is of great antiquitie, where with they very wrongfully tromped the heires of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, from the enjoying of this Crowne, which to them is rightly descended by the Mother; and whose claime is still good, were the <hi>English</hi> sword well whetted to cut the Labels of this Law. Of which <hi>Haillan</hi> himselfe confesseth, that before the time of <hi>Philip le Long,</hi> 1321. That the Law <hi>Salique</hi> was never heard tell of, before this Kings time, who caused it to be ratified by all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of his Kingdome, some by faire promises, and others by force and threats. Whereupon, they have since this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe, <hi>The Kingdome of</hi> France <hi>cannot fall from the Launce to the Distasse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> which another would needs as soundly prove out of Scripture, for that it is said, <hi>The Lillies spinne not:</hi> that is, the Lillies or Flowerdelyces, being the Armes of <hi>France,</hi> cannot descend to a <hi>Spinster,</hi> or woman.</p>
                  <p>Touching the <hi>Appennages,</hi> it is also a Law of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent for the Crowne: for by this, the Domaine cannot be aliened, and by the other, the Crowne cannot fall into the hands of strangers. You must note, that this Law imports, that the younger sonnes of the King cannot have Partage with the Elder; which till the time of <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> (when this was made) they might; they must onely have <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage suas propriete.</hi> By which Charter of <hi>Appennage</hi> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all profits arising of the said <hi>Apannes</hi>; as Domaine, the Hundreth, Rents, rights of Seigneurie, <hi>parties Casuelles,</hi>

                  <p>Concerning the other sort of Lawes in this Realme, they are infinite, which argueth <hi>(à consequente)</hi> that they be ill kept: for <hi>Gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas:</hi> and <hi>(ab an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedente)</hi> that the people of this Countrey have beene ill inclined: for <hi>Evill manners cause good Lawes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These <hi>French</hi> Lawes are too full of Preambles, Processes, Interims, and Provisoes, as by all their Ordinances and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts appeareth: There is nothing (me thinkes) colder, than <hi>a Law with a Prologue:</hi> Let a Law command, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade. Of all these Lawes I will only name you this one: <hi>That the minority of the King, shall be assisted with a Councell, chosen by the States of</hi> France, <hi>wherein the Princes of the bloud ought to hold the first place, and strangers to bee excluded:</hi> Which was enacted at <hi>Toures,</hi> by <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1484. I tell you of this, as of the true source and spring of all the late civill warres, because the Cadets of <hi>Lorraine</hi> by insinuation with the young Kings, <hi>Francis</hi> the second, and <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, under the favour of the Queene Mother, took upon them to manage all publike matters at their own pleasure, and thrust out the first Princes of the bloud of the house of <hi>Burbon.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Navarre</hi> and <hi>Condie,</hi> the Princes of this Family, assisted by many of the <hi>French</hi> Nobles, embarqued themselves in the action of reforming such an abuse, and displacing the <hi>Gursard</hi> out of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorite, tooke it upon themselves, to whom it rightly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, out of that which I there saw,<note place="margin">Officers of Court.</note> which I have heard of others, and read in Authors; I will adventure to relate, concerning the Officers of this Court; for as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Offices, as of <hi>Constable, Admirall, Marshall, Grand Master of the Eaues</hi> and <hi>Forests, Grand Master</hi> of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie,</hi> and others, I shall speake of them, when I come to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:6897:76"/>
relate of the Kings Forces in generall, to which place these Offices especially appertaine.</p>
                  <p>The first Office then of Court,<note place="margin">Great Master.</note> is that of the great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, which in elder times was called Earle of the Palace, and after changed into the name of <hi>Grand Seneschall,</hi> and now lastly into <hi>Grand Maistre.</hi> It is his Office, to judge of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of difference, betweene other Officers of Court. He had also the charge to give the word to the Guard, to keepe the Keyes of the Kings private Lodging, and to determine in disputes among Princes that followed the Court, for their Lodgings. In assemblies, he sitteth right before the King, a staire lower, as you reade in the <hi>Dern. Trobl.</hi> Great Butler or Taster, was in former times a great Office in the Kings House, they had place in the Courts of Iustice, as Peeres. This Office was long in the <hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Seulis</hi>: It is now va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and only there remaines that of the <hi>Grand Panetier.</hi> This Office is ancient: he hath besides the Kings House su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-intendence over all Bakers in the Citie and Suburbs of <hi>Paris.</hi> They which were wont to be called Pantlers, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Carvers, are now called Gentlemen Wayters of the Court.</p>
                  <p>The Office of great Chamberlaine was long in the House of <hi>Tankervile:</hi> he lay at the Kings feet, when the Queene was not there. His Privileges are now nothing so many as in times past.<note place="margin">Gentlemen of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  <p>No Sergeant can arrest any of the Kings House without their leave. They serve quarterly: they were wont to be but foure, but now I have heard it credibly said, they be eightie in name, but all of these doe not execute the Office.

His Office is to stickle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Servants, Pages, Lacquies, and <hi>Filles de joye</hi> (Punkes or pleasant sinners) which follow the Court, and to punish all offences in these people.</p>
                  <p>I should have named before these last, as a place more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, the Office of <hi>Great Faulconer,</hi> and <hi>Common Hunt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Great Faulci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hunt.</note> who have authoritie over all Officers of Chase.

                  </p>
                  <p>The hundred Gentlemen of his Guard (though there be two hundred of them) they hold and use a weapon,<note place="margin">Gentlemen of the Kings Guard.</note> called <hi>Le bec de corbin:</hi> They march two and two before him: they are part <hi>French,</hi> and part <hi>Scots.</hi> The <hi>Scot</hi> carries a white Cassocke, powdered with silver plates, and the Kings device upon it: The <hi>French</hi> weare the Kings Colours. There is also a Guard of <hi>Swisse,</hi> attired in partie-coloured-Cloth, drawne out with silke, after their Countrey fashion: these follow the Court alwayes on foot, the other on horse.</p>
                  <p>There belong to the Court also, the <hi>Marshals</hi> of <hi>Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings,</hi> and <hi>Harbingers:</hi> they have like Offices as the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers in the <hi>English</hi> Court: there bee also divers others which are here needlesse to be spoken of.</p>

                  <p>So did the Kings of <hi>France</hi> in former times bestow upon Gentlemen divers lands and possessions, freeing them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise from taxes and aids, upon condition to have their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall service in time of need. These Lands were called <hi>Feifs,</hi> instituted before <hi>Charlemaigne</hi> his time, but till then they were given onely for life (as at this day are those of the <hi>Turks:</hi>) but since, they bee hereditary.

and homage, and service of the King in his warres at their owne charge. Some <hi>Feif</hi> was bound to finde a man at Armes; some an Archer, some the third, and some the fourth of a man at Armes, according to the quantity of Land he held. He that had Land from the value of five to six hundred <hi>Livres</hi> rent, (that is, from fifty to sixty pound sterling) was bound to finde a man on Horse-backe, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed for a man at Armes: and from three to foure hundred a good light Horse-man; who, if it please the Prince, and upon occasion of service, shall quit his Horse, and serve on foot, provided that he have with him a vallet Harquebusier. But they that had lesse than three or foure hundred, had a lesse proportion of charge. There be foure exceptions where a man is not bound to serve in person; If he be sicke, if aged, if he beare some Office, if he keepe some frontier place or other Castle of the Kings; for in this case hee may send another.</p>
                  <p>They are bound upon forfeiture of their <hi>Feif,</hi> to serve three moneths within the Land, and forty dayes without; not counting the dayes of marching. You must observe, that as the <hi>Seigneurs</hi> hold their <hi>Feif</hi> of the King in <hi>Haute justice,</hi> so other Gentlemen hold of them in <hi>Basse justice,</hi> upon charge to follow these <hi>Seigneurs</hi> at all times to the wars.

himselfe confesseth, that <hi>Augustus</hi> had at one time enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in pay forty Legions, at eleven millions charge the yeare. But this Writer though he be approved, as he well deserves, yet I thinke if he failed in any of his discourse, it was in matter of warre, the profession whereof did ill agree with his long robe: yee shall therefore take the judgement of a discreeter souldier of <hi>France</hi> for your direction, what force the <hi>French</hi> can make, or entertaine of others, which is this. If our King perceived that any neighbour of his meant to invade his Frontiers, I thinke he might easily compose an Army of sixty companies of men at Armes, twenty Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of light horse, and five troops of Harquebusiers on horse-backe, amounting all to ten thousand horse. To which he might adde three or foure thousand <hi>German</hi> Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and one hundred Ensignes of <hi>French</hi> foot, and forty Ensignes of his good Confederates, the <hi>Swissers,</hi> and yet maintaine his other Frontiers sufficiently manned.</p>
                  <p>So that ye may conclude, that foure thousand men at Armes, well complete, and with a proportion of light-horse and foot answerable, sheweth the whole flower, beauty and force of <hi>France.</hi> Howsoever the Author of the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net confidently avoweth, that there may easily be mustred and maintained fourescore and odde thousand horse of one sort or other; that is, launce, and light-horse. But I feare me we may say of them, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith of the Nobles of <hi>Athens,</hi> having usurped upon the Democracie of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: <hi>They were indeed but foure hundred, and yet caused themselves to be stiled, the five thousand.</hi> So I feare me, hee reckoneth after the <hi>Athenian</hi> rate, ten for one.</p>
                  <p>The Cabinets reason is this: There be in <hi>France</hi> 50000. Gentlemen that are able to beare Armes: for (saith he) rate this proportion at a Gentleman in each league, by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>

Howbeit, saith he, in some Countries, yee shall have thirty or forty within the compasse of one league, besides their children. Out of these, if the King would, he might compose a <hi>Gens d' armerie</hi> of 8000. men

at Armes, and 16000. Archers: which body of 24000 Gentlemen, would represent in the field 60000. horse.

And yet might he have besides all this, foure or five thousand for the state of his Court, and government of his Provinces. This is his computation: But you shall see it proved, when we come to speake of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>France,</hi> that it is exceedingly shortned in number, and decayed in estate, and therefore nothing able to come neere this number.

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> reckon above an hundred and twenty strong Townes, some very strong already, all the rest easie to be made defensible. Their Ordnance and Field-peeces they have reduced to a proportion of boare and length, that so the gartridges and bullet of the same weight may be service. able for most of their peeces; and if a carriage breakes, the peece may be readily mounted upon another. The usuall length of their Field-peeces is almost ten foot, &amp; the length of the carriage fourteene foot; so that both together take up nineteene foot being mounted upon the Batterie.

                  <p>Before the invention of shot, there was an Officer in <hi>France</hi> called, <hi>Great Master of the Crosse-bowes and Engines:</hi> which office is now called, the <hi>Great Master of the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie</hi>; who at first also, immediatly after the invention of shot, was called <hi>Captaine Generall of the Artillerie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have also <hi>Treasurers for the warres,</hi> which are either ordinary, or extraordinary: Those pay the <hi>Gens d'armes</hi>; and these, the Regiments of the Infanterie. Treasurers ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:6897:81"/>
are so many, as there be places where they muster: of extraordinary there be alwayes foure.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Heraults</hi> of <hi>France</hi> are six; <hi>Normandie, Guyenne, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois, Bretaigne, Burgogne,</hi> so called of the Countries, (as with us in <hi>England</hi>) and <hi>Mont-joy,</hi> who is the chiefe of the rest. Their ancient office was, to be present at all Iusts and Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, to denounce warre or peace, to summon places, to defie enemy-Princes, to give Armes to men new enobled. But now they be only used at Feasts, Coronations, Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, Funerals, and such like; for they are no more used in the Treatie and negotiation with forren Princes: I thinke the reason is, because the office hath of late yeares beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon unworthy and insufficient persons. It shall here be needlesse to name all other his Officers of the Wars, which are all one with those of other Countries, as Colonel, Captaine, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Ensigne, Corporall, &amp;c. I will only remember in a word the French manner of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering, March, Charge, and service in generall, and then proceed to the next branch of this Relation. Wee must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that (excepting the <hi>Gens d'armes,</hi> and the Regiments above named) when any souldiers are taken up for the warres, they are not pressed, as with us, but the Captaine having his Commission gathereth them up by found of Drumme, entertaining only such as will; (which may be some cause of the badnesse and basenesse of the French foot) for being commonly the Rascall sort, and such as have no other meanes, there cannot settle in their abject minds, that true and honourable resolution requisite in a souldier. This Commission must first be shewed to the Governour, Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant generall, Bailiffe, or Seneschall of the Province, upon paine of death. Neither is it good, except it be signed by the King, and one of the Secretaries of Estate, and sealed with the great Seale. The souldiers levied, are at the charge of the Province where they be taken up, untill they depart the same. Their March (it should seeme) is somewhat more sharpe than ours: for I remember I have heard say, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a time the old Marshall <hi>Biron</hi> should bid Sir <hi>Roger Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:6897:82"/>
bring up his Companies faster, taxing the slow March of the English. <hi>Sir</hi> (saith he) <hi>with this March our fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers conquered your Countrey of</hi> France, <hi>and I meane not to alter it:</hi> A memorable answer of an honourable Souldier. For the <hi>French</hi> charge, ye shall heare the <hi>Spaniards</hi> opinion out of <hi>La Nove</hi>; The <hi>French</hi> Infantery skirmisheth brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a farre off, and the Cavallery gives a furious on-set at the first charge; but after the first heat, they will take Egges for their money. And indeed, this is that which all Writers give them, and which best agrees with their Nature: for we may say of them, as is said of <hi>Themistocles; He was so hot at the on-set, that he lost his wind in the midst of the carriers.</hi> Or say of them, as <hi>Fabius</hi> of <hi>Hannibal</hi>; his valour is like a fire of straw, and a flame kindled in matter of small conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>French</hi> discipline,<note place="margin">Discipline.</note> 
                     <hi>Caesar</hi> himselfe saith, They had it first from us. It is said, the discipline of the <hi>Gauls</hi> was first invented in <hi>Brittanie,</hi> and from thence trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into <hi>Gallia</hi>; and now such as desire to attaine the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thereof, commonly travell thither to learne it. But they have long since degenerated from their old discipline of war, and they themselves confesse, that since the beginning of the civill warres, where souldiers in all disordered and dissolute manner have beene given to pillage and thee every, that it is very much abastardized; whereof <hi>La Nove</hi> complaineth in his discourses. As for the Military discipline, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that she keepes her bed, sicke of a very deadly disease. The Noblesse fight alwayes on horse-backe, and thinke it a dishonour to serve on foot. But <hi>Commines</hi> saith of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> in the warres with <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, that they all qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t their horses: for they were then most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured that lighted on foot, to the end the people might be the more encouraged, and fight more valiantly: and this they learned of the <hi>English.</hi> And it is no question, but if some of the <hi>French</hi> Nobilitie would doe so, it would much confirme their foot, by the example of their valour and abiding, and recover that reputation which now their foot have lost in the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:6897:82"/>
world. Neither doe I thinke this the least reason, why our Ancestors have wonne so many battels upon them; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that ever we have had men of Noble Houses, to lead and serve on foot with our forces. A notable cause to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and assure the unsteadie headinesse of a multitude.</p>
                  <p>And for the opinion that the world hath of our foot, yee shall observe what the same Writer elsewhere saith; They be good foot, and better than their neighbours, as we may say now adayes, of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Swissers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in another place, where he opineth of the manner of service, he saith: My opinion is, that in battels, Archers are the weight that turnes the balance; And of Archers, the <hi>English</hi> are the flower: where he likewise discourseth, how dangerous a thing it is to abide a battell, except your foot be much the better: which in my opinion was no little cause, why the <hi>French</hi> King fought not with the Cardinall in the yeare 97, before <hi>Amiens,</hi> because the enemies foot were holden in number eighteene thousand (though I hardly thinke they were so many.) A number full as great as the <hi>French,</hi> and the souldier farre better, they being all <hi>French,</hi> except some three thousand <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Swissers</hi>; and theirs, the choice men of all his Garrisons, and experienced soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in those Low-Countries. For true it is, that the Kings <hi>Gens d'armes</hi> were two for one, and holden also much the better men, as well because there was in a manner all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and flower of <hi>France,</hi> as also that they had the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the manner of weapon; for that the <hi>French</hi> serveth with the Pistoll, and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> still holds him to his Launce. But I make no question, that the consideration of the oddes on foot was not the chiefe cause, why there was no battell that day: for wee had a goodly faire field, and plaine as might bee possible, as also large; a singular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for him which is strongest in Horse: So had wee the wind and Sunne in our backes, which are holden no small helpes.</p>
                  <p>But this was the reason: the King thought it no policie to play all his Rest at once, where hee might have lost more at
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:6897:83"/>
one Game, than he had got in eight yeares; he had no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but to make the Card that was now going, a Bridge of Gold, (as the Proverbe is) considering, that by this meanes he should gaine the Towne of <hi>Amiens,</hi> re-assure other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that then stood wavering, and recover his reputation in the world, which by the losse of that Towne was much disputed.</p>
                  <p>It now remaineth I speake of his Expence,<note place="margin">His Expence.</note> which chiefly consisteth in these two things before spoken of, namely, his Court and his Forces: wherein it is very hard to relate an exact proportion, considering not only the variety and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Writers, but also the uncertaintie of the number of Pensionaries, or provisioned: And lastly, the change and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of their allowance, not continuing alwaies the same. Howbeit, that which is most commonly reported, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth neerest the truth, is this: The maintenance of five Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of foot, at six crowns the moneth, commeth to foure hundred sixty eight thousand crownes the yeare, besides the pension of five Collonels, at two thousand crownes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece; thirtie Captaines at one thousand pension a man; as many Lieutenants at five hundred, and Ensigns at three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred apeece; which is in all, seventie foure thousand: which added to the first summe, makes the whole charge of these Regiments, yearely to amount to the summe of five hundred fortie two thousand crownes. This proportion differeth not much from that of <hi>Bodin,</hi> where he saith: The King might maintaine in ordinary twentie thousand foot, at the rate of three million, and five hundred thousand <hi>Livres,</hi> which if you reduce to crownes, and to one number of six thousand foot, commeth to a lesse rate than that other, namely, to foure hundred eight thousand three hundred thirty three crownes: but I thinke, that former is neerer the truth. For the allowance of his <hi>Gens d'armes,</hi> which are reckoning at six thousand, as is before said (though in truth there bee but foure) for he payeth thus many, I follow the proportion of them that say, that 51750. crownes is the ordinary allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for one company of an hundred yearely: for where are
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:6897:83"/>
six thousand men at Armes in the field, are eighteene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Horse in all. After this rate then of the hundred before set down, the whole <hi>Gens d'armery</hi> amounteth to 3105000. crownes.</p>
                  <p>For the expence of his Court, you shall heare it to be thus rated: The Table of the King, and those of the Gentlemen of the Chamber, at 112000. crownes: for his pettie pleasures, a thousand crownes a day: in all 165000. (But this was a proportion for the last King, who was a great giver.) For the great and little Stable, 190000. For the Constable, 24000. For the <hi>Gran Maistre,</hi> great Master, 20000. For the Marshals of <hi>France,</hi> 18000. apeece, when they were but foure; for now it is a Title only, without either pension or command, save only in the foure chiefe. For the Admirall, 15000. For the <hi>Grana Veneur,</hi> great Hunt, 16000. For the Governours of his Provinces in all, 188000. For the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of his Chamber, their pension 1200. crowns a peece; in all, six hundred thousand. For the Captains of his Guards on Horse, two thousand apeece. For their Lieutenants, eight hundred. For two thousand <hi>Swisses</hi> of his Guard, ten crowns a moneth, 24840. For all other domesticall Officers, one hundred thousand. For Heraults, six thousand. For Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shals of lodgings and Fourriers, 4600. For Prevost Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shals of Provinces, a thousand apeece, in all twentie foure thousand. For twenty foure hundred Archers, to attend these Prevosts in the execution of their Office, seven hundred and twenty thousand crownes. For his Ambassadours in divers Countries, two hundred and fiftie thousand. For his Officers of Finances, Treasurers, Receivers, Controllers, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Offices thorow <hi>France,</hi> an infinite and incredible summe: As also for such numbers of horse and foot, as the Cabinet setteth downe, besides these <hi>Gens d'armes</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, which ye heare provided for, and in the Kings pay.</p>
                  <p>But yee must observe, that of all these Court-charges and others here before mentioned (except those of his forces) yee are not to make any ground as of a truth: they being only the supposed charges, set downe by the said Author,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:6897:84"/>
who for his errours in other matters, hath also lost his credit in this.</p>
                  <p>To speake either particularly of the Court-expences, or generally what they be certaine, I cannot, not having heard any thing thereof, but only that it is supposed, the charge of the Kings House, is five hundred crownes a day.</p>
                  <p>It now remaineth to speake of his Entrade,<note place="margin">His Revenue.</note> or Revenue: for a Prince cannot have peace without warre, nor warre without men, nor men without money, nor money without meanes: nor are there any meanes but these: <hi>Domaine, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests, Gifts of his friends, Pension of his Confederates, Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke, Impositions upon Merchandize,</hi> brought in, or carried out; <hi>Impositions upon Subjects.</hi> And yet one other, which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> have lately invented, to helpe when all other failed; which is <hi>Sales of Offices,</hi> more dangerous and prejudiciall to the State, than any other.</p>
                  <p>Of these eight meanes, I will give you particular observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and then conclude, what is generally holden to bee the whole Revenue of the Crowne of <hi>France,</hi> by all these meanes.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">The <hi>Domaine.</hi>
                     </note> the <hi>Domaine,</hi> is as it were the Dowre which the State brings to the King her Husband, for her tuition, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and maintenance: And therefore one saith: It belongs not to the King, but to the Crowne.</p>
                  <p>There are two sorts of <hi>Domaines</hi>; first, the Rent which the King holds in his hands, of the <hi>Feifs</hi> given for service: Secondly, that which is united and incorporate to the Crowne. The rights of the <hi>Domaine</hi> are these: <hi>Rents, Feifs, Payments at alienations, Tributes, Penages, Toll</hi> of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enters or comes out of Cities, Woods, Forests, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other.</p>
                  <p>That is <hi>Domaine,</hi> which belongeth to the Crowne: First, either by <hi>Possession,</hi> time out of minde: Or secondly, by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union,</hi> for want of heires males, as the <hi>Apennages</hi> when they returne: or by <hi>Confusion,</hi> for want to such as can make just claime, much like our concealed Lands in <hi>England:</hi> Or last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by <hi>Confiscation</hi> of offenders inheritances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:6897:84"/>
Of this last sort we reade, that in the time of Saint <hi>Lewis,</hi> there were confisked to the <hi>Domaine,</hi> the Countries of <hi>Dreux, Bray, Fortyonne,</hi> and <hi>Monstrevil, Languedocke, Guyenne, Anjow, Maine, Turraine, Auvergne:</hi> And after in the time of <hi>Philip,</hi> the <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Alencon,</hi> the Countries of <hi>Perche, Perigort, Poutieu, La Marche, Angoulesme,</hi> and the <hi>Marquisat</hi> of <hi>Saluzzes.</hi> But <hi>Bodin</hi> saith, most of this came to the Crowne by force: <hi>La siur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Serre</hi> saith, it came by way of Exchange or purchase. But the Author of the Commentaries of the estate of the Religion, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie of <hi>France,</hi> is of the first opinion. Thus great was the <hi>Domaine</hi> in former times, that of it selfe, without oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the people with impositions, it was sufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the State and greatnesse of the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> but it is now utterly wasted. It is well knowne, that the <hi>Domaine,</hi> which alone maintained heretofore the beautie and lustre of the Royall Estate, is not now such as it was in the reignes of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, and <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth. The continuance of our warres hath caused it to be engaged in many hands, in such sort, that there is need of more than 15. or 16. thousand pounds sterling, to redeeme that which is worth above five millions of pounds. And <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> saith, that almost all the Countries, Baronies and Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuries of the <hi>Domaine,</hi> are aliened for the ninth or tenth part of that they be worth. Yee must observe, that the lands of the <hi>Domaine</hi> are not alienable, but in two cases. 1. <hi>For the Apennage of the Kings brother.</hi> 2. <hi>For the warres.</hi> And these must be confirmed by the Arrest of the Parliament. For all other cases, all Lawyers and Historians of <hi>France</hi> agree, That it is inalienable, and many Arrests have beene made of late yeares to confirme it. I have read, that the <hi>Charta Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> of <hi>England</hi> saith, the Kings when they are crowned, take an oath, not to alien ti: so doe they here in <hi>France.</hi> And there is no prescription of time, to make such sales or aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions good, but that they may be recovered and repurcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, whensoever the Crowne is able.</p>
                  <p>To this purpose <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith well, <hi>Men cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:6897:85"/>
against God, nor particulars against the Respublique.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Concerning the second meanes of raising Money by conquests,<note place="margin">Conquest.</note> the present State of <hi>France</hi> can yeeld no example, it hath beene long but on the saving hand.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 For the third meanes, it is now out of season; it was used in that good old world, when men wiped their nose on their sleeve, (as the <hi>French</hi> man sayes:) for now Princes are so farre from giving, as they hardly pay that they owe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The fourth meanes also of Pension,<note place="margin">Pension.</note> which Princes have upon some consideration of their Allies, helpeth the <hi>French</hi> Kings coffers nothing at all, for they rather give than take: As for example, to divers Cantons of the <hi>Swisses,</hi> to whom at first they payed not above one hundred and twentie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand <hi>Livres</hi> yearely: but for these sixtie yeares, they never pay lesse the yeare than two Millions. For saith <hi>Commines, Lewis</hi> the eleventh entered league with the <hi>Swisses,</hi> and they into his Pension: to whom he yearely gave forty thousand Florins, whereof 20. went to the Cities, and 20. to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, upon condition to have a certaine proportion of their forces to serve in his warres upon all occasions. An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious alliance for the <hi>Swisse</hi> in my opinion, who by this meanes enrich themselves, cleare their Countrey of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny idle and bad members; and lastly, breed good souldiers, to serve themselves upon need at another mans cost. The <hi>Turke</hi> hath also a Pension of the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> for certaine Lands hee holdeth in <hi>Hungary:</hi> which hee notwithstanding vaunteth to be a Tribute. Many examples might bee alleaged of this kinde, as of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> that by Pensions got all <hi>Greece</hi> partiall on his side: and the Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> by Pension, got ever the forces of <hi>Asia</hi> diverted.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The fifth,<note place="margin">Trafficke.</note> which is of Trafficke, availeth nothing the <hi>French</hi> Kings: for they hold it here a base and sordid kinde of profession for a Gentleman, much more for a King, to trade by Merchandize. And by the Lawes of <hi>England, France</hi> and <hi>Germanie,</hi> he loseth the quality of a Nobleman, that doth Trafficke.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:6897:85"/>
Notwithstanding these Lawes, and the disparagement that it brings to Nobility, yet so sweet is the savour of gaine, that many have used this, as no small meanes to increase their Finances. The great Duke of <hi>Tuscane</hi> present, gaines infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely this way, and the more by his most unlawfull and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous Monopolies: for he commonly buyeth up all the Graine of his owne Countrey, at his owne price: yea, and that which commeth from other places also, and then sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out a <hi>Bando</hi> or Proclamation, that no man shall sell any corne thorowout his State, till his owne be sold, forcing also all Bakers, and other people to buy thereof. This manner of ingrossing <hi>Alphonsus</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> also used, by the testimony of <hi>Bodin.</hi> The Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi> also, and the <hi>Seignory</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> have beene great Traders by Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, but it hath beene in an honester fashion, at sea, and not to the grinding of their poore subjects. The Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie also of <hi>Italy,</hi> in all Cities (except <hi>Naples</hi>) hold it no dishonour to Trafficke in grosse.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The sixth meanes of raising money upon all Wares and Merchandize, that come in and goe out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, is the most ancient and best agreeing with reason, and used by all Princes in the World. The particulars com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised under this branch, are these: <hi>Customes inward, and outward.</hi> By these the Prince is to have Impost, <hi>five in the hundred:</hi> So much just had the <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> witnesseth in his Praetorship of <hi>Sicilia.</hi> The <hi>Turke</hi> takes <hi>Ten in the hundred of the stranger, and five of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:</hi> the <hi>French</hi> quite contrarie. You must observe, that which here I call the <hi>Domaine forraine,</hi> is generally called, the <hi>Aides</hi>; first, granted by the Estates to <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandie,</hi> when <hi>Iohn</hi> his father was prisoner in <hi>England:</hi> which was the payment of twelve <hi>Deniers,</hi> upon all Merchandizes and Wares which should bee sold in this Kingdome, except upon Wine, Corne, Salt, and all manner of drinke: but since, it hath beene made perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and augmented by the imposition upon Wine sold eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and in <hi>Normandie</hi> by retaile.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="162" facs="tcp:6897:86"/>
This is like the slavish Gabell upon all manner of food, which the Princes take of their subjects through <hi>Italy,</hi> or the Assize upon Bread and Beare, which the States have in the <hi>Low-Countries:</hi> a grievance, whereof we smart not in <hi>England,</hi> as also we are free from many other burthens, which the people of this Country are forced to beare.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Gabell of Salt (which is also comprised under this head;) Some say it was first erected by <hi>Philip le Long:</hi> Others by <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> 1328. True it is, that the Ordinance of <hi>Francis</hi> the first, 1541. sets downe an Impost of 24. <hi>Livres</hi> upon every <hi>Muy:</hi> and in the yeare 1543. an ordinance was made, for Gabell to be taken upon all sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fish salted. And in 1544. it was ordained, that all Salt should be sold and distributed into the <hi>Magazines,</hi> or Storehouses of every severall generality. The benefit of this one commodity hath beene very commodious to the crown, till the yeare 81. when the king was forced for want of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to let it out to others; whereby he lost, as is in my Authour proved, eight hundred thirty six thousand crowns yearely. Here is also a kinde of tax, called the <hi>Equivallent,</hi> that is, an imposition laid upon some persons and places (but not generally) to have liberty to buy and sell salt, and to be exempt from the <hi>Magazines.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Impost of Wine is laid upon all, without exception or exemption whatsoever, it is the twentieth part to the King; besides all other rights, as of Billots entring into Cities, passages by Land, River, and such like: Besides a later im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of five <hi>Sols</hi> upon every <hi>Muy,</hi> levied by <hi>Charles</hi> the ninth, 1516.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>(Traicte forraine)</hi> it is of like nature with the <hi>Aids,</hi> save that it is leviable upon more particular sorts of merchandize: Besides, the <hi>Aids</hi> is an Impost upon things spent in the Land; and the <hi>traicte forraine</hi> is of such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities as are transported out: as of wheat, rye, barley, oats, wine, vineger, verjuce, cider, beeves, muttons, veales, lambes, swine, horses, lard, bacon, tallow, oyle, cheese, fish of all sorts, silks and cloaths of all sorts, leather of all sorts;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:6897:86"/>
and finally, all other merchandize, as fruits, parchment, paper, glasse, wood, ropes, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 The seventh ground or foundation of Finances, is the <hi>Imposition</hi> upon the subject: that is, not upon the wares or commodities, but upon the persons themselves, according to their abilitie; and it is much like the levying of the tax and subsidy in <hi>England,</hi> where every one payeth ratably to the lands and goods he possesseth. And therefore <hi>Haillan</hi> judgeth well, to say, they be neither personall, nor reall, but mixt: Assessed in the place of their dwelling, according to all the goods of the partie assessed, in what part soever they lie or abide.</p>
                  <p>These <hi>Tailles</hi> were first raised by Saint <hi>Lewis,</hi> but by way of extraordinary subsidie. <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh made them ordinary for the maintenance of his <hi>Gens d'armerie.</hi> And whereas at first they were never levied but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the three States, and to endure but while the warre lasted, he made them perpetuall. Therefore saith one, that which was at first yeelded of favour, is since exacted as patrimoniall and hereditary to our Kings. Yet is it to bee observed, that these <hi>Tailles</hi> are only liable upon the <hi>Flat Pais,</hi> all Cities are exempt; as also all Officers of the Kings house; all Counsellors, Lawyers, and Officers of Courts of Parliament; all the Nobility, the <hi>Gens d'armes,</hi> the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of warre, the Graduates of Vniversities, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Taillon</hi> is another imposition, raised by <hi>Henry</hi> the second, <hi>Anno</hi> 1549. which was to amend the Wages of <hi>Gens d'armes,</hi> who by reason of the smallnesse of their pay, lay upon the poore Villages, and eat them up; for the ease whereof, this imposition was devised: which also lieth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the poore Country-man; whereby at first he was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what eased, but now all is perverted; the poore is still op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and yet he payeth still both <hi>Taille</hi> and <hi>Taillon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, there is the <hi>Sold,</hi> or pay of 50000. foot, which were erected by <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, into eight Legions; six thousand to a Legion, which with their Officers came to about this number. To maintaine these Legions, there
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:6897:87"/>
was a tax levied upon all sorts of persons privileged in the <hi>Taille,</hi> but only the Nobles.</p>
                  <p>There are also of the <hi>Decymes</hi> (Tenths) levied upon the Church. For the levying of the <hi>Taille, Taillon,</hi> and wages of 50000. foot, you must note, that the King sends his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents by Commissioners, to the Treasurers of each generality. These according to the summe, rate each ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (this is, as ye would say, every hundred in a Shire, or Bailywicke) and then send to these elections, to have the said summe gathered in their severall Townes and Hamlets, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they be rated.</p>
                  <p>So doe they to the <hi>Maicures, Consuls, Eschevins</hi> and chiefe Officers of every City, that are liable to any of these payments; who rating every man according to his ability, give these Rolles to certaine Collectors to gather it up; these are bound to bring it quarterly to the Receivers. These carry it to the Receivers generall, in the same <hi>species</hi> that they received it; and from them to have an acquittance, after the accounts have beene perused by the Controler ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
                  <p>And these are all the meanes by which Princes raise their Finances, whereof ye see some nothing to pertaine to the <hi>French</hi> King, but to others: and some to him only, not to others.</p>
                  <p>There yet remaineth one other meanes (though extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary) to a Prince to get money,<note place="margin">Sale of Offices</note> which the necessities of the times, and the want of other meanes, have forced the <hi>French</hi> Kings of late yeares to use. This is the vent or sales of Offices, a very dangerous and hurtfull merchandize, both for the Prince and subject. This Lesson (saith <hi>Bodin</hi>) the <hi>French</hi> Kings first learned of the Popes, with whom it is still as familiar as old, to sell Bishopricks livings, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall promotions. This the Popes first beganne at <hi>Avignon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where their means was scant, and they in many necessities: which still continues both in the Courts of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> when there is no such necessity. Better is a bad President, than none at all. A course, saith one, <hi>of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:6897:87"/>
great and dangerous consequence, but clothed with necessity.</hi> It is indeed thrice dangerous, because sales of Offices cause sales of Iustice: for what these Purchasers pay in grosse, they must needs get in retaile, forgetting what was said to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles</hi> the Governour of <hi>Athens: A Governour must not; onely have his hands cleane, but his eyes also.</hi> They cannot say as <hi>Pericles</hi> did on his death bed, <hi>Hee had never made, any Athenian weare mourning Robe.</hi> For these by selling Iustice, and robbing the poore of their right, give the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse and oppressed. Widow just cause to complaine, and of wearing that mourning robe whereof <hi>Plutarch</hi> speaketh.</p>
                  <p>It is a strange thing to consider, and incredible to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, what infinite masses of money have beene made here in <hi>France</hi> by these sales, where there is not that Collector, Controller, Treasurer, Sergeant, or subalterne Officer what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, but he hath bought it of the Prince, and at no small rate: for I have heard it credibly reported, and yee shall read also in late Writers, that these Offices are bought in <hi>France</hi> at a dearer rate, than our Lands in <hi>England</hi> of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares purchase. Yee must observe, they have them for terme of life, and after to returne to the King who is againe to sell them. A man in his sicknesse, or in danger of death, or upon any need whatsoever, may sell this his office, or resigne it to his sonne or friend whatsoever: which sale is good, if the partie live forty dayes after the sale or resignation is confirmed, otherwise not.</p>
                  <p>Now we are to consider, what Entrade or Revenue the <hi>French</hi> King yearely maketh by any, or all of the meanes abovesaid.</p>
                  <p>The Estate of the Finances, Domaine,<note place="margin">Riches.</note> and all in <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth time, <hi>Anno</hi> 1449. was but 1400000. <hi>Livres. Henry</hi> the second, <hi>Raised upon his people by way of ordinarie Revenue, fifteene hundred thousand pound sterling a yeare:</hi> whereof some part hath since beene aliened for the debts of the Crowne, which notwithstanding the King raiseth as much now.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:6897:88"/>
But we may observe, that this summe is of late yeares growne much greater (by two thirds) as is generally belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: For whereas in those dayes, some three or fourescore yeares since, the ordinary summe was fifteene millions of <hi>Francs</hi> and <hi>Livres,</hi> it is now so many of Crownes. And <hi>Monsieur Rivault,</hi> Treasurer to the Duke of <hi>Mayen,</hi> sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not (some twenty yeares since) to say, that his Master had improved the Realme of <hi>France,</hi> to a better rent than any Prince had done before times: For, saith he, <hi>Where as it was worth but two millions of pounds, it is now worth five mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions sterling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And another saith, that only by the sales of Offices in twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares space, <hi>The King hath raised one hundred thirty and nine millions,</hi> which is after the rate of seven millions the yeare. So that it is probably to be inferred, that the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues are at least fifteene millions of Crownes; wherein all late Writers agree. Neither must wee thinke that men are mistaken, by counting Crownes for <hi>Livres,</hi> considering that <hi>Bodin</hi> and <hi>La Nove,</hi> and most elder Writers speake only of <hi>Livres,</hi> not of Crownes. For the manner of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in <hi>France,</hi> is by especiall ordinance commanded to be made by Crownes, and that of <hi>Livres</hi> to cease: So that whensoever ye read in the stories of <hi>France,</hi> of any summe of thousands,<note place="margin">A good note.</note> millions, or such like, without naming either <hi>Francs</hi> or Crownes, you are to respect the times when it was written: for if it was above thirty years past, they mean <hi>Livres</hi> or <hi>Francs:</hi> If of later yeares than thirty, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be understood they spake of Crownes; this rule will not faile them.</p>
                  <p>Having sufficiently spoken of these,<note place="margin">Officers of his Finances.</note> it remaineth I keepe the same course I have done hitherto; that is, after the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Court,</hi> to reckon up the Officers of Court, and after the discourse of <hi>his forces,</hi> to speake of his <hi>Officers of Warre.</hi> So here likewise, after mention made of his <hi>Finances</hi> and Revenues, to remember his <hi>Financers and Officers</hi> used for the collection, keeping, and disposing of the same. Of which Officers wee may say, as the Philosopher saith of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:6897:88"/>
Wives; that they be <hi>Necessarie evils.</hi> And as hee saith of them; <hi>The lesse of evils is the best:</hi> so say we of these, <hi>The fewer the better.</hi> But when we reade, that the old <hi>Romans</hi> had of these but one in a Province, you shall observe here in some Province, not so few as one thousand.</p>
                  <p>The chiefe of these is <hi>Treasurer of the Exchequer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Treasurer</note> insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in <hi>Francis</hi> the first his time, in place of the Receiver generall. There is also another Treasurer of <hi>Casualties.</hi> The third sort are the Treasurers <hi>generaux des Finances,</hi> whom they also call Treasurers of <hi>France.</hi> For, as for the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers ordinary and extraordinary of the Warres, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready spoken of them in the relation of his forces, and of the Treasurer of <hi>his petty pleasures,</hi> when wee spake of his Court. The number of these Treasurers generall, as also of all other Officers of Finances, yee may partly conceive by the number of generalities which are in <hi>France,</hi> and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall offices of each one of these.</p>
                  <p>Of these Generalities are twenty and one in all <hi>France</hi>;<note place="margin">Generalities.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>In each of these Generalities are divers Elections;<note place="margin">Elections.</note> that is, divers places for the receit of Finances: as in that of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> are eleven Elections; in the rest some more, and some lesse, to the number of 170. in all.</p>
                  <p>In every generality are ten Treasurers;<note place="margin">Receivers.</note> three Receivers generall of the Finances; three Receivers generall of the <hi>Taillon</hi>; one Receiver generall of the <hi>Dismes</hi>; two Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers generall of the <hi>Woods:</hi> and for every Receiver, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Controllers generall</hi>; two Treasurers generall extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie of the Warre, for the payment of Garrisons and soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in time of Warre.</p>

in all <hi>France,</hi> upon which they lie, as thicke as the Grashoppers in <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I must here also remember the chamber of Accounts, the chiefe Court of the Finances: wherein are foure Presidents, twelve Masters, eighteene Auditors, four<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>In conclusion, the Officers here, and of other places, are so exceeding many, as a President of this Court shewed the Estates of <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Court of <hi>Aides</hi> also is as full of Officers, as that other. These Finances (saith one) <hi>haue beene so shuffled, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, changed, and reduced into so obscure an Art, that very few either doe, or can understand it, except they have beene brought up in their Cabale that have obscured it.</hi> No marvell therfore, though there be much difference among men about the certainty thereof, either for the truth of the summe, or number of the Officers.</p>
                  <p>The Coines of <hi>France</hi> are either gold,<note place="margin">His Coine.</note> silver, or brasse. In those of gold I must be better instructed my selfe, for I know none but the Crowne (which is of three or foure sorts, whereof that of the Sunne is the best) and the halfe Crowne. Those of silver are the <hi>Livres</hi> or <hi>Franc,</hi> which is two shillings sterling: The <hi>quart d'escu,</hi> which is one shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling six pence. The <hi>Teston</hi> which is halfe a <hi>sous</hi> lesse: The peece of ten <hi>sous,</hi> which is one shilling sterling: the halfe <hi>quart d'escu,</hi> the halfe <hi>Teston,</hi> and the peece of five <hi>sous,</hi> that is six pence sterling. Those of Brasse is the price of six <hi>Blanks,</hi> which is three pence: that of three <hi>blanks,</hi> three halfe pence. The <hi>sous</hi> of twelve <hi>deniers:</hi> the <hi>liard</hi> of foure <hi>deniers,</hi> the double of two: and lastly, the <hi>denier</hi> it selfe, whereof ten make one penny sterling.

kind of money, hath not beene used in <hi>France,</hi> but since the beginning of the civill warres. The <hi>Teston</hi> is the best silver.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth I speake of the <hi>Administration and Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Iustice,</hi> and of those places and persons where and by whom it is done: I will therefore beginne with their assemblies, as the highest and greatest Court of all, which well resembleth the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Dyet</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> or the <hi>Councell</hi> of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </p>
                  <p>There are three especiall causes of calling these Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. The first, when the succession of the Crowne was doubtfull, and in controversie, or when it was to take order for the Regency, during the Kings Captivity or Minority, or when they had not the right use of their wits. Hereof yee have examples, <hi>Anno</hi> 1327. Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> an Infant: and <hi>Charles</hi> the sixth, <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1380. a Lunaticke: and 1484. <hi>Iohn</hi> a prisoner. For all which occasions Assemblies were called, to determine who should have the Regency of the Realme in the meane while.</p>
                  <p>The second cause is, when there is question of reforming the Kingdome, correcting the abuses of Officers and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, or appeasing troubles and seditions.</p>
                  <p>The third cause is, the want and necessitie of the King or Kingdome, in which case the Estates are exhorted to give subsidies, subventions, aids, and gratuities. For in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, the Kings contenting themselves with their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, and impost of such wares as came in, or went out of the land, (the two most ancient and most just grounds of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances) were not accustomed to levie and impose upon their Subjects any tax whatsoever, without the consent of the three States thus assembled.</p>
                  <p>The next Soveraigne Court (for so the <hi>French</hi> call it) is the Court of Parliament; <hi>The true Temple of French Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: Seat of the King and his Peeres: And as</hi> Haillan <hi>cals it, the Buttresse of Equity.</hi> This Court very much resembleth the Star-Chamber of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Arcopage</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Consiglio de' dieci of Venice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:6897:90"/>
There are no Lawes (saith <hi>Haillan</hi>) by which this Court is directed: it judgeth, <hi>according to equity and conscience,</hi> and mitigateth the rigour of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Of these Courts of Parliament, ye have eight in <hi>France.</hi> That of <hi>Paris,</hi> the most ancient and highest in prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, which at first was ambulatory, (as they call it) and ever followed the Kings Court whithersoever it went: but since <hi>Philip le Bel,</hi> it hath beene sedentary in this Citie. That of <hi>Grenoble</hi> was erected, <hi>Anno</hi> 1453. That of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse. Anno</hi> 1302. That of <hi>Bourdeaux, Anno</hi> 1443. That of <hi>Dijon,</hi> in the yeare 1476. That of <hi>Roven,</hi> in the yeare 1501. That of <hi>Aix,</hi> the same yeare. And lastly, that of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne</hi> at the yeare 1553. Anciently all Arch-Bishops and Bishops, might sit and give voices in this Parliament of <hi>Paris:</hi> but in <hi>Anno</hi> 1463. it was decreed, that none but the Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and Abbot of Saint <hi>Denis</hi> might sit there, except he be of the Bloud; for all these are privileged.</p>
                  <p>The Presidents and Counsellors of the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Paris,</hi> may not depart the Towne without leave of the Court, by the ordinance of <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, in the yeare 1499. <hi>The Senators ought alwayes to bee present, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause things are carried with more Majesty when the Court is full.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Parliament they appeale from all other subal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne Courts throughout the Realme, as they doe in <hi>Venice</hi> to the <hi>Consiglio grande.</hi> Neither can the King conclude any warre, or peace, without the advice and consent hereof: or at least (as <hi>Haillan</hi> saith) he demandeth it for fashion sake, sometime when the matters are already concluded.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> consisteth of seven Chambers: the <hi>Grande c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ambre,</hi> and five others of Enquests; and the <hi>Tournelles,</hi> which is the chamber for the criminall causes, as the other six bee for the civill. It is called the <hi>Tournelles,</hi> because the Iudges of the other Chambers sit there by turnes, every three moneths: the reason whereof <hi>Bodin</hi> giveth, that it might not alter the naturall inclination of the Iudges, and make them more cruell, by being alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:6897:90"/>
in matter of condemnations and executions. There be of this Court, of Presidents, Counsellors, Chevalliers of honour, Procureurs, Advocates, Clerks, Sergeants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Officers of all sorts, not so few as two hundred.</p>
                  <p>Besides this Court, there are also other Courts for the administration of Iustice in this Citie, as the <hi>Chatellet</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> with a Lieutenant civill, and another criminall; and the <hi>Hostel de Paris,</hi> with a Prevost, and other inferiour Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; which is, as ye would say, the Guild-Hall of the Citie. So have ye throughout the Realme certaine places, (as all Cities in generall) where there be <hi>Chatellets</hi> (like our pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Assise) and in them a Lieutenant, civill and criminall, to judge and determine all causes reall and personall; and here many Lawyers and Procurers (as our Counsellors at Law, and Atturnies) who plead before those Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Prevosts, and certaine Counsellors, which are the Iudges in these Courts, whereof the number is incredible in <hi>France.</hi> Insomuch, as you may well say of them, as is said of <hi>Sienna; There be more Readers, than Auditors: so here be more Pleaders, than Clients.</hi> This <hi>Chiquanery</hi> (Petti-fogging) &amp; multiplicitie of Pleaders, came first from the Popes Court, when his seat was at <hi>Avignon,</hi> (as my Author saith) who in the same place cals these Advocates, <hi>The Mice of the Palace.</hi>

                  <p>The processes and suits in these Courts throughout <hi>France</hi> are innumerable, wherein wee come nothing neere them; and yet there is no want of these in <hi>England.</hi> For I have heard of 340. <hi>Nisiprius</hi> between parties tried at one Assize in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke:</hi> as many I thinke, as in halfe <hi>England</hi> besides. But these are onely twice in the yeare, that causes are tried at Assises in our Country, whereas here they are tried every day in the yeare, that is not festivall. So that it is not much unlikely, that here are as many Processes in seven yeares, as have beene in <hi>England</hi> since the conquest.</p>
                  <p>There are besides these Courts of <hi>Chatellets</hi> in Cities, the Courts also of Bailywicks, and Sheriffalties, who as <hi>Haillan</hi> saith, keepe Courts in each Province, and judge in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters civill and criminall.</p>

Here is also the Privie Councell, or Councell of affaires: of the Counsellors (among which are his foure Secretaries) he calleth certaine every morning at his rising, to whom he communicates apart, his principall and most importing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, where are read all letters which come from other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and such like publike businesse, and after a conclusion what is to be done, the dispatch thereof is committed to the Secretaries.</p>
                  <p>The other, is the Great Councell, or Councell of Estate; which at first, was, as it were, a member of the Parliament, and consisted of the Princes of the Bloud and Nobility, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only to deale in the matters of the policy generall of <hi>France,</hi> or of warres; or of the enacting and publishing of Edicts. But the faction of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it to bee changed to a choice number of Counsellors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> provisioned of 1000. crownes pension apeece yearely. Of this Councell the Chancellor is chiefe, for neither the King himselfe, nor any Prince of the Bloud comes there. This is the Court of which the <hi>Frenchman</hi> saith, every time it is holden, it costs the King a thousand crownes a day. And now, (saith <hi>Haillan</hi>) he cannot keepe them so cheape, so infinite is the number of them growne. Where he also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines, that this <hi>Conseil d' Estat,</hi> which was wont only to determine publike affaires, as the establishment of justice, the Reglement of Finances, and redressing of common grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, is now so charged with private contentions, as the glory thereof is much diminished.</p>
                  <p>The Chancellor anciently served as a Secretarie, and so was called in the old Charters of <hi>France,</hi> where hee is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise called the <hi>Grand Referendaire.</hi> The Secretary doth signe, and the Chancellor doth seale.</p>
                  <p>The Secretary is next in office, who at first were called Clerks. They are either of the Finances (which have their place among the Officers of the Finances, before remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred) or of <hi>Affaires</hi> which we heare speake of. Of these are foure, which are called principall.</p>

are as it were, Vice-royes and Regents of those places committed to them: and indeed the persons sustaining these charges, are much more Noble than those of the Secre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The Governours of Cities were in old time called <hi>Dukes,</hi> and they of Provinces, <hi>Counts.</hi> They were at first only in Frontier Provinces, but now since the troubles of <hi>France,</hi> they have had the command over Cities and Countries, even in the midst and bowels of the Land: So that now, saith <hi>Haillan, France</hi> is become a Frontier to it selfe on every side.</p>
                  <p>There are but few Cities, whereof anciently there were Governours, as <hi>Rochel, Calais, Paronne, Bologne, Mondidier, Narbonne, Bayonne,</hi> and two or three others: Others, that had keeping of some small Castle or Fort, was onely called the Keeper, or Captaine at most. But now, saith <hi>Haillan, lib.</hi> 4. every paltry fellow that hath the keeping of a <hi>Pigeon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,</hi> must forsooth be called, <hi>My Lord the Governour</hi>; and my Mistresse his Wife, <hi>My Lady the Governesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Governour of <hi>Daulphenie</hi> hath greatest privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; for hee giveth all Offices in his Province: in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they can give none, except they have it by expresse words in their Patent. The Governour may not be absent above six moneths in a yeare; but the Lieutenant must never be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, without leave of the Prince, except teh Governour be present.</p>
                  <p>There is yet an Office, whereof I must remember you, which is one of the chiefest in <hi>France,</hi> either for honour or profit, called <hi>grand Maistre des Eaues &amp; Forests.</hi> All mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the Kings Chases, Forests, Woods and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whatsoever, are determined by him, by the <hi>Grand M.

                  </p>
                  <p>In this Church of <hi>France</hi> are twelve Archbishopricks, one hundred and foure Bishoprickes, five hundred and fortie

                  <p>The Church hath, for all this rabble to live upon,<note place="margin">The Temporal livings of the Church.</note> these two things: First, her Temporall Revenues, and secondly, her Spirituall, which they call the <hi>Baise-mani.</hi> Of her Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Revenues, divers men judge diversly.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cabinet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The grosse er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of <hi>France.</hi>

millions: with an infinite proportion of other necessaries, imaginary only, and incredible. And yet he there a voweth all things, with as great confidence, as if himselfe had had the true abstract from all the Bookes of Accounts in each Monastery and Benefice in this Land. For how is it possible, the Church should have 200. millions of crownes yearely Rent, when as by the computation, here are but just so many Arpens of Land in all <hi>France,</hi> which to rate one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at a crowne an Arpen, comes to this account, which he allowes the Clergie, and then is there nothing left for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two States, of the Nobilitie and people.</p>
                  <p>But inasmuch as the better halfe of their Revenue is by the <hi>Baise-mani,</hi> there remaineth the better halfe of the Land to the other two States; which notwithstanding is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion small enough.</p>
                  <p>Neere unto this reckoning commeth that which we reade in <hi>Bodin,</hi> of <hi>Alemant,</hi> a president of accounts in <hi>Paris,</hi> whose judgement must carry good authority in this case, as a thing belonging to his profession, and wherein he was best experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced:<q>The Church Revenues in Land are reckoned orderly, at twelve millions and three hundred thousand <hi>Livres:</hi> but I dare justifie (saith he) that of twelve parts of the Revenues of <hi>France,</hi> the Church possesse seven.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This opinion <hi>Bodin</hi> seemes to allow: But it is rather thought to be true, that the <hi>Comment de l' estat</hi> saith, who of the two hundred millions of Arpens, allowes the Church forty seven millions, which by particulars of their Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, Medowes, arable-Pastures, and Heaths, with their Woods, is there set downe: which here to follow in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar were too tedious. Besides this Temporall, they have their <hi>Baise-mani</hi> (as is said) that consisteth in Churchings, Christnings, Marriages, Burials, Holy-bread, Indulgences, Vowes, Pilgrimages, Feasts, Processions, Prayers for cattle, for seasonable weather, for Children, against all manner of diseases, and infinite such purposes; for which the supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious people will have a Masse said, which they pay the Priest for particularly: over and besides all this, there is
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:6897:93"/>
scarce that Arpen in all <hi>France,</hi> upon which there is not some <hi>Dirige,</hi> or <hi>de profundis</hi>; some <hi>libera me Domine,</hi> or some rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning or other liable.</p>
                  <p>Concerning them of the Reformed Religion, whom here in contempt they call <hi>Hugnonets</hi>; yee may note, that the number is not small, considering that after the conference of <hi>Poissie,</hi> above forty yeares since, here were found 2150. Churches of them; whereof not one hath escaped without some murthers or massacres: and we may imagine, that since that time this number is much increased.</p>
                  <p>But as for Religion, it hath onely beene the cloake and shadow of their ambitious pretences, without the which, they could never have insinuated themselves so farre into the hearts of the people, who are alwayes the <hi>gros de la bataille,</hi> the maine Battell: and without whom, the Nobilitie may well quarrell, but they cannot fight.</p>

                  <p>Having briefly spoken of the two first Estates of <hi>France,</hi> the Clergy and Nobility: It lastly remaineth, I speake of the people in generall, and namely, of their freenesse of Speech; manner of Diet; kinds of Buildings; sorts of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises; fashion of Apparell; diversitie of Language; sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dennesse of apprehending; rashnesse in executing; impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in deliberation, and divers other natures and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours proper to the <hi>Frenchmen</hi>; wherein ye shall not looke for a methodicall and large discourse, but a briefe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious remembrance of such things, as I have read and observed in this Nation.</p>

                  <p>He hath besides this liberty of speaking, a propertie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to such like natures: namely, an inquisitive listning and hearkning after newes, which is an old fashion of theirs, and hath continued with them many hundred yeares. It is
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:6897:96"/>
usuall with all the <hi>Gauls,</hi> both to constraine Travellers (though unwilling) to stay, and to inquire of each of them, what hee hath heard or understood of every matter: and with the popular in Townes, to flocke about Merchants, and compell them to tell from what parts they come, and what newes they heard there: And led by these rumours and heare-sayes, they determine many times of most weightie affaires, of which determinations they must needs eft-soones repent them.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the diet, it is, to keepe no diet: for they feed at all times, there being among them very few which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their ordinary of dinner and supper) doe not <hi>Gouster,</hi> as they call it, and make collations, three or foure times the day, a thing as usuall with the women as men, whom yee shall see in open streets before their doores, cat and drinke together. No marvell therefore though the <hi>Italian</hi> cals them the only Gourmands.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French</hi> fashion is to lard all meats; whose provision ordinary is not so plentifull as ours, nor his Table so well furnished: howbeit, in Banquets they farre exceed us; for he is as <hi>friand</hi> (licourish) as the Trencher-men of <hi>Media,</hi> or <hi>Aesope</hi> the Tragedian, who spent fifteene thousand crownes at one feast, in the tongues of Birds only.

Nor like the <hi>Scythian,</hi> who faith, hunger is my best cheere, the ground my bed, Beasts skins my clothing; but rather like <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> of whom <hi>Plutarch</hi> reporteth, that hee was over-delicate in his dyet, dissolute in love of wanton women, excessive in banquets, and over-superfluous and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of the <hi>French</hi> Buildings I have spoken before in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Paris,</hi> both that it is lately growne to be more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, than it was in former times, and that many thereby have much weakened their estate.</p>
                  <p>You may therefore observe, that as I there said, the Citie of <hi>Paris</hi> was better built than that of <hi>London:</hi> so are in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, all the Cities and Villages in <hi>France,</hi> fairer than ours in <hi>England,</hi> comparing the one with the other.</p>
                  <p>As for the manner of Building here, how beautifull soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be to the eye, the Offices and roomes, me thinkes, are not so well contrived as ours, to the use. One thing there is, by which they are much beautified; namely, the blewish kinde of Tyle, which here they have in great quantitie, the which is very hard, and therefore durable; and very thinne and light, and therefore not so burthensome to a house, as is our Tyle in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning their Apparell,<note place="margin">Their Apparel.</note> if yee well observe that of the Citizen, both men and women, it is very seemely and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: that of the <hi>Paisant,</hi> very poore, all whose apparell for the most part, is of Linnen: As for that of the Noblesse, yee shall heare what <hi>La Nove</hi> saith; <hi>The Noblesse in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in apparell, are excessive and very rich.</hi> And yet mee thinkes, nothing so rich and costly as ours; the onely excesse whereof, is the greatest prejudice and hinderance to the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>This Author reproveth two things in the <hi>French</hi> Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. First, that every Gallant, forsooth, must have many sutes at once, and change often in the yeare: and therefore (saith he) if in the Court they spie one in a sute of the last yeares making, they scoffingly say: <hi>We know him well enough, he will not hurt us, hee's an Apple of the last yeare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second thing he dislikes, is this; that every two yeare the fashion changeth. And hereof it commeth, that when yee see all other Nations painted in the proper habit of their Countrey, the <hi>Frenchman</hi> is alwayes pictured with a paire of Sheeres in his hand; to signifie, that he hath no peculiar habit of his owne, not contenteth himselfe long with the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:6897:97"/>
habit of any other, but according to his capricious humour, deviseth daily new fashions.</p>
                  <p>This varietie of fashions, a man may well note in the Fripperies of <hi>Paris,</hi> whereof saith <hi>La Nove,</hi> if one would make a pourtraict in a Table, it would be the most sportfull thing that may be.</p>
                  <p>I am now by order to speake of his <hi>Exercises:</hi> wherein,<note place="margin">Their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises.</note> me thinkes the <hi>Frenchman</hi> is very immoderate, especially in those which are somewhat violent for yee shall see them play Sets at Tennis in the heat of Summer, and height of the day, when others were scarce able to stirre out of doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es. This immoderate play, in this unseasonable time, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their intemperate drinking and feeding, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cause, that here yee see them generally itchie and scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; some of them in so foule a sort, as they are unfit for any honest Table.</p>
                  <p>Among all the other exercises of <hi>France,</hi> I preferre none before the <hi>Palle-maille,</hi> both because it is a Gentleman-like Sport, not violent, and yeelds good occasion and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of discourse, as they walke from the one marke to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: I marvell, among many more apish and foolish toyes, which wee have brought out of <hi>France,</hi> that wee have not brought this sport also into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning their shooting with the Crosse-bow,<note place="margin">Shooting.</note> it is used, but not very commonly. Once in a yeare, there is in each City a shooting with the Peece at a Popingay of wood, set upon some high Steeple (as also they doe in many places of <hi>Germanie.</hi>) He that hitteth it downe, is called the king for that yeare, and is free from all Tax: besides, he is allowed twentie crownes towards the making of a Collation for the rest of the shooters. And if it happen, that three yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether he carry the Prize, he is free from all tax and imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatsoever, all his life after.</p>
                  <p>This custome, no question, is very laudable, whose end tendeth much to a publike benefit: for by this practice and emulation, he groweth more ready and perfect in the use of his Peece, and so more able and fit to doe his Country service.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:6897:98"/>
And I suppose, if in times past we had had like Prizes for the long Bow (the ancient glory of our <hi>English</hi> service) we had not so soone quit the exercise thereof, nor degenerated so far from ancient custome. So doe I thinke, that in these dayes, wherein the Peece is only prized, if we have this fashion of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germanie,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> to reward him in every place that should best deserve therein; that our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would grow more perfect and expert in the use thereof: at whose unaptnesse and aukwardnesse in their first training, before they come to have served some time, I have often marvelled.</p>
                  <p>He hath also his sports of Bowling, Carding, Dicing, and other unlawfull, and unusefull games; whereof I will omit to speake, being too common both with them and us.</p>
                  <p>As for the exercise of Tennis-play,<note place="margin">Tennis-play.</note> which I above remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, it is more here used, than in all Christendome besides; whereof may witnesse the infinite number of Tennis-courts thorowout the Land, insomuch as yee cannot finde that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Burgade</hi>; or Towne in <hi>France,</hi> that hath not one or moe of them. Here are, as you see, threescore in <hi>Orleans,</hi> and I know not how many hundred there be in <hi>Paris:</hi> but of this I am sure, that if there were in other places the like propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yee should have two Tennis-courts, for every one Church thorow <hi>France.</hi> Mee thinkes it is also strange, how apt they be here to play well, that yee would thinke they were borne with Rackets in their hands, even the children themselves manage them so well, and some of their women also, as we observed at <hi>Blois.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is this one great abuse in their exercise, that the Magistrates doe suffer every poore Citizen and Artificer to play thereat, who spendeth that on the Holy-day at Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, which hee got the whole weeke, for the keeping of his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For yee shall onely see the Gentlewomen and them of the better sort, but every poore draggle-taile, even to the Cobblers daughter, that can dance with good measure and Art, all your <hi>Quarantes, Levaltics, Bransies,</hi> and other dances whatsoever: not so much but the Chamber-maid, and poore Citizens wife, dance usually in the City-streets, in a round, like our Country Lasses on their Towne-greene, about the May-pole, making musick of their owne voices, without any Instrument. And rather than saile, the old women themselves, both Gentle and base, who have moe toes than teeth, and those that are left, leaping in their heads, like Iacks in Virginals, will beare their part. This argueth (I will not say a lightnesse and immodestie in beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but) a stirring spirit, and livelinesse in the <hi>French</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: whereof also the musicke and songs they have,<note place="margin">Musicke.</note> is no small argument: for there is not almost a Tune in all <hi>France,</hi> which is not <hi>Ienicke,</hi> or <hi>Lydian,</hi> of five or seven tunes: a note forbidden youth by <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> because, saith <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> it hath <hi>great force and power to soften and esseminate mens mindes.</hi> The tune <hi>Doricke,</hi> which is more grave musick, and was commanded for the singing of Psalmes in the Primitive Church, their inconstant and stirring humour cannot brooke by any meanes.</p>

Such a one was the Gallant, who in the middest of his discourse with many Gentlemen, suddenly turned backe to his Lackie, and saith, Fetch me my Clocke, it lies in my lodging in such (or such) a place, neere such (or such) a Iewell.

as the curiousnesse of worke, and the beauty of the case, whereof hee is not a little bragge and enamoured. To speake thus particularly of all his severall humours and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, would be very prolix, and not much necessary: I will onely referre you to the fourth of <hi>Tullies Rhetorick,</hi> where he speaketh of a bragging Rhodomonte, and to the first Booke of <hi>Horace Satyres,</hi> speaking of an endlesse and needlesse Prater, a fastidious &amp; irksome companion.

                  <p>I will only speake of his impatience and precipitation in deliberations of Warre or Peace, and such other affaires of greatest importance, and so end. To this effect <hi>Bodin</hi> saith of him: The <hi>French</hi> is of so sudden and busie disposition, that he quickly yeelds to that a man demands, being soone tired with messages to and fro, and other delayes peculiar to the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> And in another place; The <hi>Spaniard</hi> had need of a more ready dispatch than he hath, and the <hi>French</hi> of more moderation in his actions and passions. And whereas <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> saith of us, that we be not so craftie in our treaties and agreements as the <hi>French</hi>; I thinke, saving the credit of so great an Author, he might better have said, so head-strong and precipitate. But where he saith, that he that will treat and determine matters with us, must have a little patience; I yeeld unto him, hee hath good reason so to say; for his Countrey-men, the <hi>French,</hi> can endure no delay; they must propound &amp; conclude all in one day. By this haste of theirs, they lost more, saith <hi>Bodin,</hi> by one Treatie at <hi>Cambrey, Anno</hi> 1559. to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> than he had before got of the <hi>French</hi> in fortie yeares by warre.</p>

                  <p>Whosoever shall consider what commodity they raise by the fishing and traffike onely, may well say, that no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through the whole world may compare with them for riches.

                  <p>For their Forces at Land,<note place="margin">Forces.</note> of them it may truly be repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they have not only made their parties good against the potent wealth and exact discipline of the <hi>Spanish,</hi> but have also at all times prevented the intimations, intrusions, and underminings of all their neighbours, and lately regai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the freedome of their ancient libertie, even to point of admiration; <hi>That where all other Nations grow poore by warre, they only thrive and become rich.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the store of shipping they are also immatchable. In the yeare 1587. the King of <hi>Denmarke</hi> upon some pretences of displeasure, arrested one with another 600. in the <hi>Sunds</hi> at one time. In 88. upon short warning they rigged to the narrow seas 100. good men of warre. And if suggestion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not, at this day, <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Freesland,</hi> are said to rejoyce in the possession of 2500. good ships, from 150. to 700. tun a peece.</p>
                  <p>In regard whereof, other nations professing the same reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and accommodated with like advantages, may first observe, to what height of courage and confidence this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is growne, by good order and faithfull dealing; who in truth (being but two or three small shires) have for forty yeares space resisted and beaten the forces of a mighty King, who keepes <hi>Millan, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Sicil,</hi> under great bondage, in despight of all the <hi>Italians,</hi> for valour and policie not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding proclaiming themselves to be the sole Minions of the habitable world. But truth is; These petty Princes have not now those daring spirits which they had in former times, when the <hi>Visconti, Neapolitans, Fortibrachio, Francis Sforza,</hi> with other Lords and Common-weales, were of power to invade the territories of the Church, and inforce the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves to thrust their Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> out of <hi>Rome,</hi> to save their citie from sacking.</p>
                  <p>The Country now representeth unto all Christendome nothing more livelier than a Schoole of Martiall Discipline,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:6897:104"/>
whereunto all Nations resort to learne and see the practice of Armes, and the models of Fortifications.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon no few considerations are to be observed: first, into what follies and extremities Princes run, by inuring their people to the assiduitie of warfare: and secondly, what great advantages a small or weake Estate gaineth, by forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying places and passages: for surely there is nothing that sooner undoeth a great Price, than to be forced to besiege a Towne which is excellently defended; because herein he consumeth his time, and most commonly loseth his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As did <hi>Amurath</hi> before <hi>Belgrade: Soliman</hi> before <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna: Charles</hi> the fifth before <hi>Mets: Francis</hi> the first before <hi>Pauie: Maximilian</hi> before <hi>Padoa:</hi> The <hi>Catholikes</hi> before <hi>Rochel:</hi> The <hi>Protestants</hi> before <hi>Saint Iohn de Angeli:</hi> And <hi>Albert</hi> before <hi>Oastend.</hi> This manner of defence grew in use first in <hi>Italie,</hi> by occasion of the comming of <hi>Charles</hi> to the Conquest of <hi>Naples,</hi> whose manner of warfare, together with the terrour of his Ordnance (never before that time practised in <hi>Italie</hi>) gave the Inhabitants occasion to raise their wits to the utmost of resistance. Then followed the famous overthrow of the <hi>Venetians</hi> at <hi>Caravaggio</hi>; where in an adverse battell, they almost lost all they held upon the sinne Land. By which examples, Princes being instructed in the danger that came by fields so foughten, the most part afterward turned all their imaginations of defence from the field to fortresses. And the first that put this in practice to his highest commendation, was <hi>Prosper Collouna,</hi> who at two severall times most honourably defended the Duchie of <hi>Milla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Whether the <hi>Netherlands</hi> borrowed this discreetnesse from the <hi>Italians,</hi> or more lately provided for their best safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, being by long time beaten with the rod of experience, I will not here dispute; but sure I am, that by this manner of discipline, they only of all Christendome have made best

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:6897:114"/>
than Art to worke upon. The <hi>Swevian</hi> Horse-men are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into thirteene Companies: <hi>Sweveland</hi> and <hi>Gothland</hi> maintaine eleven, and <hi>Finland</hi> two; and upon necessitie they can raise a greater force: for the Dukedome of <hi>Vrme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (as report goeth) is able to furnish better than ten thousand men with Horse. In <hi>Marchland</hi> there is such plentifull breed of Horse, that there they are sold at a very low rate: both these Provinces are in <hi>Gothland.</hi> Their Horse is not so bigge bodied as the <hi>Frieslander.</hi> but exceeding har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; active, able to endure travell, and fed with a little. I will not omit to speake of two Noble usages of the King of <hi>Swethland</hi> towards his Souldiers: one is that if a Souldier be taken prisoner, he is ransomed at the Kings charges; the other, that if his Horse be slaine, the King bestoweth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon him. To his Captaines, and those which serve on Horse-back, in part of payment of their wages, hee giveth yearely a Garment, which the <hi>Germans</hi> terme <hi>Idolis,</hi> and may be taken for a Cassocke.</p>
                  <p>The rest of the Captaines meanes, if he serves within the Kingdome against the <hi>Dane</hi> or <hi>Moscovite,</hi> is but foure Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars a moneth, and exemption for himselfe and family from other duties and payments to the King. The common soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is not thus exempted, unlesse in time of warre or danger: his other pay is one Dollar and a quarter for a moneth: small pay, if you consider not the cheapnesse of victuals. In their marches in loose troopes, they are billetted in the next hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses at the countries charges: But when the Armie is in the field altogether, the King findes them victuals, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting it out of their meanes. It was not long since that the Horseman in time of peace received more than twenty Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars standing for a yeare, with a Horsemans coat and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions: but this is increased in the warres. The Officers of Horse-troopes receive monethly pay for themselves, their servitors, horse-boyes, &amp;c. The Nobilitie and Courtiers also (Privie Councellors excepted) which may be about three hundred in all, are bound to wait on the King on horseback; every of which for himselfe and followers, receiving each
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:6897:114"/>
five Dollars a moneth. Every Captaine must be a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man borne.</p>
                  <p>As touching their Sea-affaires,<note place="margin">Sea-forces.</note> by reason of their huge Sea-coast, and infinite Havens, the Kingdome swarmeth with Mariners and shipping, which the King may arrest in his Dominions, as other Princes are accustomed to doe: hee maintaineth commonly fiftie Ships of warre, whereof every one carrieth fortie peeces of Ordnance, more or lesse. King <hi>Gustavus</hi> first brought in the use of Gallies. In the Warre which King <hi>Iohn</hi> waged with the <hi>Danes</hi> (before the Peace treated on at <hi>Stetin</hi> was agreed) he put to Sea seventie great ships, besides other of smaller burthen, in which were 22000. fighting men. In the Summer time they warre at Sea; in the Winter at Land: for then the Rivers are frozen, as likewise the Sea neere the shore for a great space. Seeing I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Guns, I will adde thus much, that the King is thought to have about eight thousand great Peeces, the most part of Brasse, and that hee could cast many more if hee had more store of Tin. In the Castle of <hi>Stockholme</hi> only are numbred foure hundred. Certaine it is that the King can on the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den rigge up a sufficient Fleet both for defence and offence; and that cheaper than any Prince of Christendome. For first he hath store of Mariners, and they easily paid; as desiring little more than cloaths and victuals. Their cloathes are sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple enough; and their victuals the Countrie is bound to send them; a proportion namely of Beefe, Bacon, Salt-fish, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Barly and Peason. As for materials for building a ship, he either hath them of his owne, (timber, pitch, iron and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,) or else they are brought him but from the next doore. Brasse peeces (such plentie of metall he hath) that they cost him little or nothing. So that well might King <hi>Iohn</hi> the third of <hi>Swethland</hi> affirme, that he would set out and maintaine as good a Fleet for 100000. Dollars, as the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> could for a million of pounds. The chiefe of the Kings Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie in time of peace, rides (like our Kings at <hi>Chatham</hi>) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in two places; either at <hi>Stockholme,</hi> where they may lye safe, even afloat without mooring, or so much as ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,

the Harbour being thirty <hi>English</hi> miles within Land, and the high cliffes keeping off all winds: The other Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are in <hi>Finland,</hi> still in a readinesse against the <hi>Muscovite,</hi> and to watch that nor Armes nor munition be brought them out of <hi>Germanie.</hi>

The Havens, the situation of the Countrey, and especially <hi>Gothland</hi> (which is a member of <hi>Gothia,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Swevian</hi> claimeth it as his right) affordeth the <hi>Dane</hi> this facility of invading at his pleasure.

In which, hee doth very wisely; for those peeces which lie in the Territories of our Enemies, are to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded most carefully, because they bring forth two notable effects: first, they defend what is ours, and offend what is the Enemies. The further they are distant from our borders, the better they stand us instead: for while the Enemie is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied in besieging thereof, our owne State standeth in quiet, and time affordeth meanes for rescue, or delivery thereof at leasure, and that without spoile to our owne people, or losse of our proper revenues. They grieve the Enemie with so much the more dammage, by how much the neerer they are situated unto him. Of this effect was <hi>Calais</hi> in the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>English,</hi> and the places which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugals</hi> hold in <hi>Africke.</hi> But the Fortresses built in our owne borders, serve to no other end, than to defend what is already ours, and that to our great disadvantage: for as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they are invaded, all things are done at a sudden, and it cannot be avoided, but somewhat will fall to the spoile of the Enemie.

To intreat first of <hi>Spaine,</hi> (because it is the centre of this spacious Empire) it is conserved by two meanes; that is to say, by Iustice and Religion, keeping this people in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence more with severity and chastisement, than with cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and mercy. The Province it selfe is barren, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider each part thereof by it selfe, but being reduced into one grosse, it aboundeth with all things necessary, especially towards the Sea coast: being also stored with divers Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. True it is, that it hath few men, and is not populous, both by reason that a great number are drawne from thence to serve in the warres, to re-enforce the garrisons, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the forts abroad, as well amongst the <hi>Indies,</hi> as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places of his dominions: as also, for that many of them doe exercise Merchandize and Navigation; Which although it bring some dammage to the State, because so many leave the Country, yet proveth it very beneficiall and commodious by their enricht returne unto their owne houses, and ridding by that meanes the Country of the more slothfull sort of home-livers. Two parts are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past with the <hi>Ocean</hi> and <hi>Mediterran</hi> Seas, the third is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from the power of the <hi>French</hi> Armes, not onely by reason of the craggy situation of the <hi>Pirenean,</hi> of <hi>Scialon, Pargnan,</hi> and <hi>Pampelone,</hi> where it is mountainous and hard to passe, and by the forts: but also through the difficulty that they should there finde in journeying, and the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity and want of victuals, entring into a Country so ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill and unfruitfull. The other part (confining (as aforesaid) upon the <hi>Mediterran</hi> Sea) remaineth onely exposed unto the <hi>Turkish</hi> Navie; from which it is well secured by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving few Ports, and those diligently kept and guarded with powerfull forces. But amongst all the offensive Potentates, the Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> is able to infest it more than any other: for in the late warres, it did beyond measure trouble the Kingdome of <hi>Portugal,</hi> in pitying the quarrell of <hi>Don Antonio</hi> (a man much favoured of that Crowne) in such sort, that the City of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> once famous and well inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, became poore, and well-nigh dispeopled.

Whereupon at all times his Majesty is constrained to maintaine a strong <hi>Armada</hi> in these Seas, to safeguard the Navigation to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and to secure the Merchants comming from thence into these Countries, over and besides twenty foure Gallies, which he keepeth to guard the coast, and to defend it from the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish</hi> fleet, and the incursions of Pyrats; the charges where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with the maintenance of the fortifications and defences, amount yearely to halfe a million of Gold. The number of souldiers in all the presidiarie places of <hi>Spaine,</hi> amount to eight thousand, not reckoning any man of sort, nor Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; for instead of these, the <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Turkish</hi> slaves doe serve in the Gallies. This Kingdome doth never send forth any Horsemen, because there be but few, and yet not sufficient for their owne affaires.</p>
                  <p>In the next ranke follow the <hi>Italian</hi> Provinces; <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Millaine,</hi> and <hi>Sicilie</hi>; wherein nature hath confined,<note place="margin">

Neither doth his Majestie care to bring these Churches to a greater number, for then should hee with greater difficulty make use of the revenues and riches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of when occasion required. And it is said, that the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Birago</hi> gave to his Majestie at divers times, more than a million and a halfe of gold, upon some simoniacall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
                  <p>So it is thought that the ordinary revenues of <hi>Spaine</hi> doe amount to six millions of gold, whereof much hath beene pawned for the debts of the Crowne, the rest is spent in charges of the warres, in the government of the Kings houshold, and in the Gallies, which he maintaineth to safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard the coast of the Kingdome, as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>In extraordinarie revenues he raiseth much more;<note place="margin">Extraordinary.</note> for in the Kingdome of <hi>Castile</hi> alone in one yeare, his Majestie had nigh eight millions of Gold. And while I was at his Court, his Majestie sent a Iesuite through all <hi>Spaine,</hi> who went from house to house, requiring their benevolence, as an almes for the expences in his warres: by which meanes he raised a million and a halfe of gold, but with much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, saving that it was said, that hee did better to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand this money for the love of God, than to take it by force: yet was not the request such, but that it had in it the effect of a command; his Majesty excusing himselfe, that the Emperour his Father whilest he lived, did the selfe-same thing in his greatest and most urgent affaires and necessities. There doe not want also other meanes and devices to raise money, as the imposition of the Milstone; which as it is supposed, if it once take effect, will amount to two millions of gold yearely. There be also sales of Offices, Escheats, Penalties, Amerciaments, and other like meanes to raise money, as in other Kingdomes.</p>

But to some he giveth the Order, and not the Fee; to others the Fee, not the Order; but to many for their good service, both Fee and Order.

True it is, that all these profits have their interest, but they arise not to above twenty in the hundred laid out, by reason of Convoyes, for security of the Fleet. For there is alwayes maintained strong guards in the Isle of <hi>Iava,</hi> apt by reason of the situation, to give the Empire of all these parts to him, that can make himselfe once Master thereof. The souldiers which hee sent into these parts, have for their pay two crownes a moneth, in such sort, that the Land-souldiers, the guarders of the Forts, and the Gallies which he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth for this purpose, is a speciall cause, that his Majestie expendeth in interests and charges amongst the <hi>Indies,</hi> more by a great deale than a million and a halfe of gold: Which maketh me nothing to wonder, that although this King by reason of his abundance of Treasure, and many other infinite riches brought yearely from the <hi>Indies,</hi> should seeme to be richer than other Princes, and his state much more wealthy and aboundant; yet in truth the great Turke, not having any mines of gold, is more mightier and farre wealthier: And so in true interpretation is <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Netherland,</hi> as late experience (the touch-stone of ambiguities) hath fully discovered.

                  <p>For, say they, it appeareth by record, from time to time, kept in the Citie of <hi>Sivil,</hi> that in threescore and fourteene yeares space there have come into <hi>Spaine</hi> two hundred and threescore millions of gold. Of all which summe there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth now in <hi>Spaine,</hi> by conjecture, in ready money and plate (wherewith this Nation is much delighted) about six and fifty millions: Five and twenty the <hi>Genoese</hi> have had for interest: Seven millions were spent in the <hi>French</hi> warres, and the conquest of <hi>Portugal:</hi> Eight were bestowed on that glorious and stately building of the <hi>Escuriall.</hi> And the rest (which is more than an hundred millions) hath beene all spent in the fruitlesse warres of Christendome and <hi>Flanders.</hi> So that it may be truly said, that all the enterprizes which this State hath undertaken, since the dayes of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, have beene performed with <hi>Indian</hi> gold: being certainly to be affirmed without contradiction, that <hi>Philip</hi> the second, during his raigne alone, spent more than all his predecessors, being in number sixty two, that have reigned since these Kingdomes shooke off the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that he alone spent more than an hundred millions: and notwithstanding all this here spoken of, <hi>Spaine</hi> is very poore and smally stored with wealth.

And so <hi>Philip</hi> the second would faine have done, supposing that those warres would the rather have drawne to an end, when hee gave his daughter <hi>Isabella</hi> for wife to the Arch-Duke (with the assignment thereof) for her Dower; and that the people would the sooner have quieted themselves under the obedience of that Prince, if they might be suffered to enjoy the libertie of their consciences; but time hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed what effects those projects have produced.</p>

                  <p>And whereas some object, that this Empire cannot long endure in so flourishing an estate, because the members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are so farre disjoyned: to such objections, let this Maxime be opposed; <hi>That spacious Dominions are best preserved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst forren attempts, as those of meane capacitie have the like advantage, against intestine divisions.</hi> But in this Empire thus divided, spaciousnesse and mediocrity are well united.

But this mightinesse of his, hath many disturbances
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:6897:125"/>
in it selfe, which hinder motion, and cruelly curbe designe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by reason wherof he sets forward with such dulnesse of speed, that for the most part the provision which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for effecting of future enterprises, commeth alwayes too late. For if he be to provide Souldiers in <hi>Italie,</hi> after they be pressed, inrolled, and set on wards, they lie waiting three or foure moneths at the River of <hi>Spaine,</hi> before they be embarked for their voyage, their pay still running on, to the great dammage and prejudice of that Crowne; so that wee may very well avouch, that what another Prince per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth with two hundred thousand Crownes expence, his Catholike Majestie can scarce execute so much with the cost of five hundred thousand.</p>
                  <p>Of no lesse danger is the dammage which that Crowne may very easily receive by a sudden and unexpected losse of their Fleet, because on it are grounded all the hopes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of the said State, that are of any importance. But more pernicious and fuller of trouble would be the losse of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> which with ease, either by Forren Fleets may be taken from them, or much molested and hindered: Or if neither of these, yet that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves, sent thither in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, combining themselves in one bond of unitie, having all the Fortresses in their owne hands, together with the Ports and Ships that are there, may one day resolve to be governed by themselves, denying all obedience to their Kings commandements. Another contrarietie also doth this great State incurre; That the Prince thereof hath farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meanes to get Money than Men. For howbeit upon every occasion, and when need serveth, he is served by the <hi>Swiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi> the <hi>Wallons,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> yet these of themselves are little or nothing worth, being upon every sleight occasion of slack pay, ready to make commotions, and in their furie to forsake his service. Of other Nations (besides that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie dareth lesse trust them) he cannot (although he would) have such a sufficient number as should supply his need and occasion. So, howbeit that this Prince be sole Lord and Master of so many mighty States, and of so great and potent
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:6897:126"/>
an Empire, yet liveth he full of continuall travels and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents.</p>
                  <p>Now having taken a full view and mature consideration both of the States,<note place="margin">Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie.</note> as also of the ends and intents of this mighty Monarch, together with those contrarieties which these States doe suffer; it resteth, that in this last place wee should intreat of the correspondencie which hee holdeth with other Princes: which as it is of all other knowledges the most necessary, so is it the hardest to be discovered, bringing with it for the most part greater difficultie, to be able fully and judiciously to pierce into the purposes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts of Princes, but especially into the secret Councels of the State of <hi>Spaine,</hi> being full of cunning dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</p>
                  <p>To begin therefore with this point:<note place="margin">With the Pope.</note> I say, that generally (to instance first of all the Pope) his Catholike Majestie will have him to be such a one, as may wholly depend upon him, and be confident of his fastnesse. And therefore in their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, his endevour is, that not any ascend to that dignitie, that doth any way savour of the <hi>French</hi> faction, (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alienated from his devotion) nor any that are of singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nobilitie, left their spirits might be too generous to be basely abused by him: nor any of the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> for feare (taught by former examples) of some new distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in that State: But his principall desire is, to create one of base linage, and of meane respect, and such a one, as shall (if it be possible) acknowledge his Cardinalship, and all other dignities, to proceed from him: and such a one, whose parents and kinsfolkes are poore, that by the bountie which he shall bestow upon them, and the pensions which he shall conferre on their friends, he may binde them unto him, and confidently assure himselfe of their favour and partaking, when occasion serveth.</p>
                  <p>And for this cause (in all that he can) he seeketh to weaken the Popes, and to detract from their dignities, to make them inclinable to his will, and wholly to depend upon him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing them to continue in this office of their love, by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:6897:126"/>
their State with Corne out of <hi>Puglia</hi> and <hi>Sicilie,</hi> and by upholding the authoritie of the holy See; in defending their Coasts from the incursions of the Turkish Fleets, and from the depredations and inrodes of Pyrats: and lastly, by giving them to understand, that it is in his power to call a Councell, and in it to take an account of their actions, and to call their prerogatives into question. And howbeit the absolution and re-benediction of the late King of <hi>Navarre</hi> did much move, nay beyond measure trouble the minde of <hi>Philip</hi> the second, who in those times did hope for great things at the Popes hands, yet did he dissemble this offence; As on the contrary, did his Holinesse the prejudice that was and is done him in <hi>Spaine,</hi> in regard of holy Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not only his orders and decrees are broken and modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Councell, but also sometimes rejected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned; whereof his Holinesse hath made often complaint to the Spanish Ambassadour, but to small purpose.</p>
                  <p>In the College of Cardinals,<note place="margin">With the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals.</note> the King at this present hath not much authoritie, by reason of his imperious proceeding, and lesse will have hereafter, the French Nation being now rise to some greatnesse, which will now every day more and more be able strongly to oppose themselves against the Spanish, by whose jealousies, greatnesse, and dissimulation one with another, that See hath gained such greatnesse and reputation in the world.</p>
                  <p>In requitall whereof, his Holinesse in favour of <hi>Philip</hi> the second (wasted forsooth in warre against the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ráns</hi>) cut off by his authoritie I know not how many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of debt, due to the <hi>Genoese.</hi> He hath given him also all Pardons sent to the <hi>Indies,</hi> worth by yeare halfe a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, with the collations of Benefices and Bishopricks, and the enjoyment of the two rich Orders of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Calatrava.</hi>

By this facilitie, experience hath proved, that the Easterne Navies have been often overthrowne by the Westerne, the Southerne by the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne,

As often as <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth rigged forth his Navie, it was so puissant, that the <hi>Turke</hi> never durst leave the harbour.

                  <p>At this day they are at peace: The <hi>Spaniard</hi> is doubtfull of the <hi>Turkish</hi> forces, especially by Sea, if he be not assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the league of <hi>Italie:</hi> And againe, the <hi>Turke</hi> is feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of him alone, and of his associates. For he knowes he is to deale with a Potentate of much estimation, and well practised in the world; and although of late there have fallen out betweene them certaine jarres and differences upon dammages done by the one and the other Prince reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally in each others dominions, yet it is to be thought, that these two so powerfull Princes will not easily bee brought to take Armes, seeing they emulate each others greatnesse, and contented with equall strife, to bring all Christendome to their subjection; pretending both one and the selfe-same end, <hi>viz.</hi> Religion. Besides, it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the Catholike King to have revenged his wrongs, and for the <hi>Turke,</hi> that he is no more molested by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Armadaes.</hi> As the one hath a warlike and well armed Empire, so hath the other an united and most rich King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But herein the <hi>Turke</hi> hath the greater advantage, that he spendeth but little in the warres, in regard of that, that not onely the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> disburseth, but even all the Princes of the world. For his souldiers receive for their pay, those lands which he hath given them to hold for life, with condition annexed, alwayes to bee in readinesse to serve at an instant. Certaine it is, that the <hi>Turke</hi> being
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:6897:129"/>
dreadfull to Christendome, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is the ablest to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him. For which reason <hi>Andreas Hoia</hi> would needs perswade us, that it were best for Christendome to chuse the <hi>Spaniard</hi> for their universall Monarch: but <hi>Boccalini</hi> argues better; that it had beene more convenient for <hi>Europe,</hi> if the <hi>Moores</hi> had still beene Lords of <hi>Spaine.</hi> Most sure it is, that the Protestants, yea, all Christians in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> live better under the <hi>Turke,</hi> than under the house of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> bee intolerable masters, witnesse the poore <hi>Indians. Hoia</hi> therefore vented this in an Oration at <hi>Doway,</hi> to inflame our <hi>English</hi> fugitives to treason.</p>

The <hi>French</hi> in nine yeares were subdued to the <hi>Roman</hi> yoke, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> held out two hundred. The power and person of <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> were requisite to the subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Cantabrians,</hi> whereas they not onely delivered their owne Country from subjection of the <hi>Moores,</hi> but invaded <hi>Africke,</hi> and therein tooke many strong pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. So the <hi>Portugals</hi> invaded <hi>Barbarie,</hi> tamed the coast of <hi>Guinea, Aethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Cafraria</hi>; they conquered <hi>India, Malaca,</hi> and the <hi>Moluccas.</hi> The <hi>Castilians</hi> sailing through the <hi>Atlanticke</hi> sea, subdued the <hi>New-world,</hi> with all the Kingdomes, Provinces, and people therein: and finally, drove the <hi>French</hi> from <hi>Naples, Sicil,</hi> and <hi>Millaine.</hi>

                  <p>As concerning their Cavalrie, it cannot be gain-said,<note place="margin">Their Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> but that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Genet is the noblest horse of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, farre excelling the Courser of <hi>Naples,</hi> or the horse of <hi>Burgundie,</hi> so much esteemed of the <hi>French,</hi> of the <hi>Frees<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> and in so great request with the <hi>Germans.</hi> It should seeme that nature herselfe hath armed this people, in giving them the Iron Mines of <hi>Biskay, Guipuscoa,</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> with the temperature of <hi>Baion, Bilbo, Toledo,</hi> and <hi>Calataiut</hi>; the Armories of <hi>Millan, Naples,</hi> and <hi>Boscoducis</hi>; the corne and provision of the inexhaustible Garners of <hi>Apulia, Sicil, Sardinia, Artesia, Castile,</hi> and <hi>Andaluzia</hi>; with the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull vintages of <hi>Soma, Calabria, San Martin, Aymont,</hi> and sundry other places.

If ever he chance to become Sole-Lord thereof it will adde a greater Dominion to his greatnesse, for the nature and quality of the situation of that Citie, whereof the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were wont to say; That if the King their Master were but once Lord of <hi>Marsettes</hi> in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> and of <hi>Genoa</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> by the benefit of these two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ports, hee might easily arrive to the Monarchie of the whole World. But howbeit the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> be not Lord thereof, nor yet hath so great a part therein, that he can as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly say, that it wholly rests at his command, yet by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring and upholding the greatnesse of the Prince <hi>Doria,</hi> he maketh him the Instrument to serve his turne, and by his meanes obtaineth what hee will, or can in reason desire of that people deeply interessed, in regard that his Majestie hath taken up great summes of money upon interest of them, and therefore will take heed how they breake with him; lest they be hindred of their gaines, peradventure of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall: It hath beene thought, that some Kings have beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde hand with them, for more than a million and a halfe of gold.

                  <p>Finally, for a perfect review of this tedious discourse, I wil recite unto you, these weighty, secret, and last instructions given by <hi>Philip</hi> the second, King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to his son <hi>Philip</hi> the third, father of this present King: teaching him how to governe himselfe and his Kingdomes after the decease of his said father; brought to light by a servant of <hi>Don Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phero di Mora,</hi> called <hi>Roderigo,</hi> and translated out of <hi>Spanish</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> into <hi>English,</hi> that the world may see how judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously this manuscript of the Kings owne hand agreeth with the purport of these Relations.</p>
                  <p>SOnne, I have often troubled my mind, and entered into most deepe and serious considerations, how to leave a
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:6897:132"/>
quiet and setled estate unto you after my decease: Howb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>, neither the long time of my life, nor the opportunity of Princes affected to my service, would afford me sufficient as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance in this behalfe. I confesse; that I have spent more than 594. millions of Duckets; in lieu whereof, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed nothing the space of three and thirty yeares, but heart-sorrow, and vexation of spirit. True it is, that I recovered <hi>Portugal</hi>; but as lightly as <hi>France</hi> is escaped from me, so likewise may <hi>Portugal</hi> slide backe. Would to God I had followed the counsell of <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, my Lord Father of famous memory: for then could I much more quietly brooke those my sorrowes, and die with a more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde, leaving to you the succession of this mortall life.</p>
                  <p>This then, besides so many stately Kingdomes and Seigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories, as a perpetuall testament I leave behinde unto you, as a mirrour and Looking-glasse, wherein you may see how to frame your actions, and to carry your selfe in your govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after my death.</p>
                  <p>Alwayes looke well to the charges and alterations of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther States and Countries, to the end you make use, and reap good profit thereby, as occasion shall serve; and withall, have a cautelous and circumspect eye over them that be in Counsell with you.</p>
                  <p>Two meanes you have whereby to maintaine your <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> Kingdomes; the one is Government; the other, the Trade of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching your Government, you must draw unto you, and relie either upon the Nobilitie, or the Spiritualtie of your Dominions.</p>
                  <p>If you leane unto the Spiritualtie, you must seeke to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ile and curbe the other, as I have done: but if you meane to strengthen your selfe with the Nobility, cut short the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and Revenues of the Spiritualtie, as much as is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. For holding them both in equall favour, they will consume you; and besides, you shall set your Realmes out of quiet, and never come to resolution, the ballance being over-weighed, sometimes by the one, and sometimes by the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:6897:132"/>
My Counsell is, that you hold in league with the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> especially if you meane to helpe your selfe with the Nobilitie: for they be friends to <hi>France, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Princes. And neither <hi>Italy, Poland, Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> nor <hi>Denmarke,</hi> can stand you much in stead: As for the King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> hee getteth his Revenues by forren Nations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sweden</hi> is alwayes at division, and unfit in regard of si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Polacks</hi> be as Masters over their Kings. <hi>Italy,</hi> though it be rich, yet it is farre distant from these before named; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, all the Princes therein are of divers humours and dispositions.</p>
                  <p>But on the other side, the <hi>Netherlands</hi> are exceeding po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, and abound mightily in shipping: the Inhabitants being a people most constant in labours, diligent in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out things profitable, couragious in their attempts, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in adversitie.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that I have bestowed those Provinces upon your Sister <hi>Isabella Clara Eugenia,</hi> howbeit in the transport thereof are comprized an hundred meanes, whereby you may helpe your selfe: The principall whereof be, that you are Tutor and over-seer of all her children; and that shee may alter nothing in the Catholike Religion: These two maine points being taken away, you are absolutely dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed and quit of the <hi>Netherlands</hi>; and other Kings would be so forward to draw them unto their allegeance, that it may haply redound to your overthrow.</p>
                  <p>Contrariwise, if you meane to rely and cleave to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and State Spirituall, you shall purchase your selfe many enemies: I have had the experience thereof: but hold all correspondencie with the Popes: Give them much; bee friendly alwayes to them: Entertaine such Cardinals as be most in credit with them: Make your selfe Master of the Conclave: Make much of the <hi>German</hi>-Princes Bishops, and use to bestow no more pension on them by the hand of the Emperour, but deale so; as they may acknowledge your selfe
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:6897:133"/>
for the giver; surely they will serve you the more willingly, and receive your gifts with greater gladnesse.</p>
                  <p>As for them that be of baser degree and qualitie, let them not come neere you, and so shall you seeme to give your Nobilitie and Commons the better countenance. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly I must needs say, their pride is great, they are mighty in substance, whatsoever they desire must be done, they will be chargeable unto you, and in the end will seeke to rule your Scepter. Wherefore make your partie good, by the meanes of such as are descended of Noble parentage, and great Families, and promote them now and then to some Spirituall livings. The common sort is not so serviceable; for they will procure you such unspeakable hatred, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you might be forced to consume your treasure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore repose your trust in none of them, unlesse they be of great qualitie.</p>
                  <p>Abandon and shake off your <hi>English</hi> Spies.</p>
                  <p>Cleare your selfe of the <hi>French</hi> charges.</p>
                  <p>Vse the service of some part of the <hi>Netherlandish</hi> Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so that you may joyne and knit them unto your best and, most trusty subjects. Now as concerning the travell and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation to the <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies,</hi> therein doth consist all the power and might of the Kingdome of <hi>Spaine,</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the straining and bridling of the <hi>Italians.</hi>

                  <p>I have for your sake, in the transport of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> put down a <hi>proviso,</hi> altogether to restrain the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> from dealing in the aforesaid Trade: but I feare that time and men will prove changeable: wherefore you must doe two things. First, alter often your Governours. Secondly, those which you draw from thence, you shall put in Office here at home, and make them of the Councell of <hi>India</hi> in <hi>Spaine.</hi> So shall you never (in my opinion) be deceived,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:6897:133"/>
but both parties will discover your profit, and seeke their owne honour.</p>
                  <p>If you perceive the <hi>Englishmen</hi> prepare to bereave you of these commodities, as being strong both in shipping and Mariners, (for the <hi>French</hi> I make small account) see that you strengthen your selfe with the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that a great part of them be Hereticks, and would so continue, with condition, that they shall have full liberty to utter all their commodities in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> paying their royall Incomes and Customes, and all duties belonging un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: and then also you may grant unto them passage to travell and trade unto your <hi>East</hi> and <hi>West Indies,</hi> provided that they put in good security in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and take upon them a corporall oath, that upon their returne from the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> they shall arrive in some part of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and there to unload upon paine of death, if they shall be found to doe otherwise. Mine opinion is, that they will never refuse to accept of this easie condition, and to accomplish the same: and by these meanes shall the <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> be linked and knit to the <hi>Netherlandish</hi> trade: and <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> must then live upon their owne purses.</p>
                  <p>My Sonne, I could relate unto you more secrets for the conquests of other Kingdomes and Countries, but all such advertisements, with the discourses thereupon delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto me, and by me amended, you shall finde in my Cabinet. Cause <hi>Christopher de Moro</hi> immediately to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the key unto you, lest these so weighty secrets come into the hands of some other.</p>

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:6897:136"/>
might long have flourished. The first was, the translating of the Imperiall Seat, from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Constantinople</hi>; which action weakened the West, and overthrew the Empire: as Plants removed out of their naturall soile, and transported into Regions contrary in temperature and aire, retaine small vigour of their radicall vertue: as also because the manly and martiall people of <hi>Europe</hi> if they should rebell, could not be reduced to obedience by the power of the effeminate <hi>Asians</hi>; whom, or none, the Emperours of <hi>Constantinople</hi> must of necessity make use of, by reason of their situation. In which regard, the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate would never consent, that the people should leave <hi>Rome</hi> and dwell at <hi>Veij,</hi> a Citie farre more pleasant and more commodious than <hi>Rome,</hi> especially after the sacking thereof by the <hi>French-men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second fault of <hi>Constantine,</hi> was, the division of the Empire to his children, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 341. By this division, of one Empire he made three, and withall, a memorable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of his authoritie and forces. For when his sonnes fell to civill dissention, they consumed one another so cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Empire resembled a bloudlesse, yea, a livelesse body. And though sometime, under some one Prince, it stood on foot againe, yet it remained alwayes subject to division, and parted into two Empires, the East and the West, untill the comming of <hi>Odoacer,</hi> King of the <hi>Herules</hi> and <hi>Turingi,</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> with a mightie Hoast: by which invasion, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustulus</hi> suffered such irrecoverable losses, that in extreme despaire hee was forced to cast himselfe into the protection of the East Empire. This happened in the yeare of our Lord 476. And about this time the <hi>Hunnes</hi> passed <hi>Danubius; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laricus</hi> King of the <hi>Gothes</hi> tooke <hi>Rome:</hi> the <hi>Vandals</hi> first spoiled <hi>Andaluzia,</hi> afterwards, <hi>Africke:</hi> the <hi>Alans</hi> wonne <hi>Portugal:</hi> the <hi>Gothes</hi> conquered the greater part of <hi>Spaine:</hi> the <hi>Saxons, Britanie:</hi> the <hi>Burgundians, Provence.

But this faire weather lasted not long: for in the yeare 713. the Armes and Heresies of the <hi>Mahumetans</hi>

Thus by little and little began the Westerne Empire to droope, and as it were, to draw towards his last age. As for the Easterne, it stood so weake and tottering, that with all the force it had it was scarce able to defend <hi>Constantinople</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Armes of the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> much lesse to minister aid to the Westerne Provinces. But in the yeare of our Lord 800. <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, King of <hi>France,</hi> obtained the Title of the Westerne Empire, and in some sort mitigated the fury of these barbarous Nations.</p>
                  <p>And thus the Westerne Empire stood then divided: That <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sipont</hi> East-ward, with <hi>Sicil,</hi> should belong to the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire; <hi>Bononia</hi> should remaine to the <hi>Lumbards</hi>; the <hi>Venetians</hi> were Neuters: the Popedome free; the rest <hi>Charles</hi> should possesse. <hi>Blondus</hi> saith, that the Empresse <hi>Irene</hi> gave the first counsell to this division which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was confirmed by <hi>Nicephorus.</hi> For before <hi>Charles</hi> his time, there was one forme of Government; and the Laws, Magistracies, and ordinances which were enacted for the well-fare of one Empire, tended to the good and honour of both, as to the members of one body; and if one Emperour died without issue, the whole Empire remained to the survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. But when <hi>Charles</hi> the great was chosen Emperour of the West, there was no more regard taken of the East Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, neither the Emperour of the East had to doe with the West, nor the West with the East. The Empire of the West continued in this line above one hundred yeares, and failed in <hi>Arnolph,</hi> the last of that house. In the yeare 1453. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humet</hi> Prince of the <hi>Turkes</hi> tooke <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguished the succession of the Easterne Empire.</p>
                  <p>And as for the West (<hi>viz. Italy</hi>) the Emperour hath no more to doe therein, than hath a pilgrime, who is admitted to visit the wonders of our Lady of <hi>Loretto.</hi>

rejected, the Creation of the Emperour was granted to the free election of seven Princes, termed Electors. The reason why the Empire became elective, which had so long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued hereditary in the House of <hi>Charles,</hi> was because <hi>Otho</hi> the third left no issue male: After whom the Westerne Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was marvellously curtailed and diminished: nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left but <hi>Germanie,</hi> and a part of <hi>Italy.</hi> The Pope held <hi>Romagnia</hi>; the <hi>Venetians</hi> lived free, possessing great Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions joyned to their State: the <hi>Normans</hi> (taking <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicil</hi> from the <hi>Greekes</hi>) held them in Fee of the Church, first under <hi>Clement</hi> the Antipope, then under <hi>Nicholas</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and his successours, who for their private gaine rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the former grant of <hi>Clement</hi> Antipope.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Tuscane</hi> and <hi>Lumbardie,</hi> partly by the quarrels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, <hi>Fredericke</hi> the first, and <hi>Fredericke</hi> the second, with the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops: partly by reason of the valour of the Inhabitants, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour reaped more labour than honour, more losse than profit. And therefore <hi>Rodulphus</hi> terrified with the misfortunes and crosses of his predecessours, had no great minde to travell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> but sold them their liberties for a small matter. They of <hi>Luques</hi> paid ten thousand crownes; the <hi>Florentines,</hi> but six thousand. And so every State by little and little forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Emperour, no part of <hi>Italy</hi> remained, but the bare Title. The Dukes of <hi>Millaine</hi> (and so every other state) usurped what they could catch, without leave asking, only they desired their investiture of the Empire. But <hi>Francis,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the conquest therof, did little regard this investiture, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>That hee was able to keepe it by the same meanes that hee had got it.</hi> The Princes beyond the Mountaines also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew their obedience, so that at this day the Empire is inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in <hi>Germanie.</hi>

The Empire was bound (at least wise accustomed) to furnish the Emperour, when hee went to <hi>Rome</hi> to bee crowned, with twenty thousand footmen, and foure thousand Horse, and to maintaine them for eight moneths, and therefore it was, called <hi>Romanum subsidium.</hi> The revenues of the Cities and Lay-Princes, have beene greatly augmented since the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing of Popery, and bringing in of new impositions, which taking their beginning from <hi>Italy,</hi> (evill examples spread farre) quickly passed over to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> In times of necessity great taxes are laid upon the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and levied extraordinarily; And that they may bee gathered with the greater ease, <hi>Germany</hi> is parted into ten divisions (or circuits) which have their particular assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies for the execution of the Edicts made in the generall Diets of the Empire.</p>
                  <p>As concerning their multitudes,<note place="margin">Forces.</note> it is thought that the Empire is able to affoord two hundred thousand Horse and Foot, which the warre (before spoken of) may prove to be true: As likewise the forepassed warres of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> which were ever continued in those two Provinces, for

the most part with <hi>German</hi> souldiers. Their forces may the better be transported from place to place, by reason of the commodiousnesse of many faire and navigable rivers. At one time, <hi>Wolfang</hi> Duke of <hi>Bipont</hi> led into <hi>France</hi> an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of twelve thousand footmen, and eight thousand horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in behalfe of the Protestants; and at the same time, the Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> was leader of five thousand horsemen of the same Nation, in behalfe of the Catholikes. <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi> had in his Armie eight thousand German horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ten thousand foot-men: the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> had at the same instant three thousand. What should I speake of the numbers that entred <hi>Flanders</hi> with Duke <hi>Casimere?</hi> Or those that entred <hi>France</hi> under the same Leader, in the yeere of our Lord 1578. Or to what end should I make mention of that Armie, whereof part served <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, part the league? But to prove that this Nation must be very populous, seeing that warres are continually open in some one or other part of Christendome; and no action under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken therein, wherein great numbers of <hi>Germans</hi> are not waged and entertained. To speake nothing of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> who in times past have resisted the whole power of <hi>France,</hi> with an Armie of fourescore thousand men; or of the <hi>Swissers,</hi> who in their owne defence, are thought able to raise an Army of one hundred and twenty thousand souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; I will only put you in minde of that expedition, which they made out of their owne Territories into <hi>Lumbardie,</hi> in defence of that State, against <hi>Francis</hi> the French King, with an Armie of fifty thousand foot-men.</p>
                  <p>The best foot-men of <hi>Germany</hi> are those of <hi>Tirol, Swevia,</hi> and <hi>Westphalia:</hi> the best horse-men, those of <hi>Brunswicke, Cleveland,</hi> and <hi>Franconia.</hi> But plainly the best horsemen of <hi>Germany</hi> will play the <hi>Pultrones,</hi> and the best foot, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.

                  <p>Of Weapons, they handle the Sword and the Pike, better than the Harquebuze. In the field they are very strong, as well to charge, as to beare the Shocke: for Order is of great effect, which is as it were naturall unto them, with a stately

pace and firme standing. They are not accounted of for the defence of fortresses; and for their corpulent bodies, I hold them not fit for the assault of a breach. And therefore they are to be accounted rather resolute and constant, than fierce and couragious; for they will never come to the service wherein courage and magnanimitie is to be shewed. After the victorie, they doe kill all whom they meet, without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of age, sex, or calling. If the warre be drawne out at length, or if they be besieged, they faint with cowardize. In Campe they can endure no delayes, neither know they how to temporize. If their first attempts fall not out to their mindes, they are at their wits end, and lose courage: if they once begin to run, they will never turne againe. He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines them, must be at extraordinary charges and great trouble, by reason of their wives, who consume so much provision, that it is a very hard thing to provide it, almost unpossible to preserve it; and without this provision they stand in no stead. Their horses are rather strong than coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; and because of ten which goe to the warre, eight are prest from the plough, they are of small service; and when they see their bloud, their heart quaileth. The Spanish Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets in this case wax more fierce.</p>
                  <p>In Sea-forces they are not much inferiour to their Land-forces,<note place="margin">Forces by Sea.</note> although they use no Sea-fights: the Cities of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, Lubeck, Rostoch,</hi> and some other places, are able to make an hundred ships; some say an hundred and fifty, equall to the forces of the Kings of <hi>Denmarke</hi> and <hi>Sweth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> When these strong and invincible forces are united, they feare no enemie; and in imminent perill they are sure of the aid of the Princes of <hi>Italie, Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Lorraine</hi>; for these Princes never forsooke the Empire in necessitie. To the <hi>Zegethan</hi> warre <hi>Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> sent six hundred <hi>Argolitrees.

It is a free State like <hi>Poland,</hi> and may make choice of whom they will to be the Lord, whose stile is to be called <hi>Margrave</hi> of <hi>Moravia.</hi> And for that infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times the Emperour and <hi>Matthias</hi> his brother offered them some wrongs concerning religion, they have sithence contracted a league offensive and defensive with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>Hungarie</hi> and <hi>Austria,</hi> as well against the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the <hi>Turke,</hi> as the oppressions of the <hi>Romanists.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these Provinces, <hi>Silesia,</hi> and <hi>Lusatia,</hi> are as large as <hi>Bohemia,</hi> but in strength and numbers of people farre infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour. These two Provinces with <hi>Moravia,</hi> are incorporate to the Crowne of <hi>Bohemia. Silesia</hi> lies on the East of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia, Poland</hi> on the South of it, to which it sometimes belonged; <hi>Hungaria</hi> and <hi>Moravia</hi> on the East. It is two hundred miles long and fourescore broad. It is a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and a plentifull Country, finely divided in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle by the faire River <hi>Oder:</hi> on which stand foure or five handsome Cities; the chiefe of which is <hi>Breslaw,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop whereof is for his revenue called the golden Bishop: here is also an Vniversity. <hi>Niesse</hi> is also another Bishopricke, who now is a Cardinall. The people (especially of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) be civill and generous; nor is there any where a more gallant or warlike Gentry, which the <hi>Turke</hi> well tried in the warres of <hi>Hungarie:</hi> for very sufficient serviters they be both on horse and foot, and they are able to levie great

numbers. The government is Aristocraticall, that is, by the States; yet in most things a dependant upon the will of the King of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> It was sometimes divided amongst fifteene Dukes, but all their families being extinct, nine of those Lordships are escheated to the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the other six still remaine, amongst three of the heires of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient owners. The two Dukedomes of <hi>Oppelen</hi> and <hi>Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor,</hi> in this Country, were by this present Emperour given to <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> in consideration of his relinquishment of the Crowne of <hi>Hungaria.</hi> For which two Dukedomes, and for the lands of the old Marquesse of <hi>Iegerensdorff</hi> in <hi>Lusatia,</hi> who being prescribed by the Emperour, and beaten out by the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> fled to <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> who had newly married his neece; that is, the sister to the present Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> whose fathers brother this <hi>Iegerensdorff</hi> was: For these lands (I say) came part of the discontents still depending betweene <hi>Bethlem Gabor</hi> and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Tis reported, that if King <hi>Frederick</hi> would have laid downe his right to <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the Emperour would have beene content to have made him King of <hi>Silesia.</hi>

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Emperour is not so weake a Prince, as those, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the State of Kingdomes, doe suppose him to be, reporting his Territories to be small, unprovided of necessaries, poore in money, and barren of people. But this is certaine, that as he is Lord of a large dominion, fertill, rich, and infinite of people; so let every man thinke, that by the neighbourhood of the <hi>Turke,</hi> bordering upon him from the <hi>Carpathian</hi> Mountaines to the <hi>Adriatike</hi> Sea, the forces of a mightier Prince may seeme small &amp; be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid. For what Prince is there bordering upon so puissant an enemie, but either by building of fortresses, or by enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Garrisons, is not almost beggered; I will not say in time of warre, but even during the securest peace; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering that the forces of the <hi>Turke</hi> are alwayes ready, strong, and chearefull; yea, better furnished in the time of peace, than any other Nation in the hottest fury of warre? Wherefore it stands him upon, who is a borderer upon so powerfull an enemie, either for feare or jealousie, to be ever watchfull, &amp; to spare no charges, as doth the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; retaining in wages continually twenty thousand soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, keeping Watch and Ward upon the borders of <hi>Hungarie.</hi> These aske great expences, and yet lesse than these are not to be defraied for the strengthning of other places; besides other expences not meet here to bee spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of.</p>

To conclude with the State of the Empire, though it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to be hereditary, nor to have (which is strange) any chiefe City appropriate to the residence or standing Court of the Emperour, (as <hi>Rome</hi> sometimes was:) yet for neighbourhood and conveniences sake, the Emperours have in this last age beene chosen out of the house of <hi>Austria</hi>; yea, when there have beene severall brothers of them, they have all lookt for the Empire one after another, and have had it too. And for the same reasons have the <hi>Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> made choice of the same person, yea, and sometimes the <hi>Hungarians</hi> also; the <hi>Austrian</hi> being the ablest Prince to defend them against the <hi>Turks.</hi> So that <hi>Bohemia,</hi> though in possession of the Emperour, yet is no more part of the Empire than <hi>Hungaria</hi> is, but a Kingdome absolute of it selfe, free to chuse a King where it pleases. So that the Emperour in <hi>Germany</hi> is to be considered two wayes: first, as a <hi>German</hi> Prince; secondly, as the <hi>German</hi> Emperour. First, as a Prince he hath by inheritance the lands and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of his family; such bee <hi>Austria, Alsatia, Tirol, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola,</hi> with some parts of <hi>Rhetia</hi> and <hi>Swevia:</hi> and these dominions are like other principalities, subjects of the Empire; and for them, the Emperour is his owne subject. Secondly, as a <hi>German</hi> Prince (though not by inheritance, but by election) may the Emperour be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered when he is King of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> Which though it be an independant kingdome, yet being included within <hi>Germany,</hi> and the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> by office chiefe Taster to the Emperour, and one of the seven Electors of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, (as having the casting voice, if the other six be equally divided, nay, and with power to name himselfe if he be one of the two in election,) in consideration hereof may he thus also be brought within the Empire. But yet neither of these wayes can the Emperour or Empire so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be considered. Thirdly, therefore to speake of him as the <hi>German</hi> Emperour, is to consider of him as Lord of those portions and States of the Empire properly so called. And those be either the States, or Imperiall Cities of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie.</hi>
                     <pb n="282" facs="tcp:6897:146"/>
The States and Princes of <hi>Germanie</hi> are naturally subjects to the Emperour, yea, and officers to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son too, (which is a part of their honour,) so the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> is chiefe <hi>Shewer,</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh Sword-bearer,</hi> &amp;c. They are also as subjects, to be summoned to the Imperiall <hi>Diets,</hi> their lands are to be charged towards the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours warres, made in defence of the Empire. But yet on the other side, the <hi>German</hi> Princes bee not such subjects as the Lords of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> but much freer. <hi>Lorraine</hi> is a member of the Empire, and yet will not that Duke suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Emperour to have any thing to doe in his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and if any other Prince should take up Armes against the Emperour, (as <hi>Saxonie</hi> did in the case of <hi>Luther:</hi>) yet cannot the Emperour escheat their lands (as other Princes may serve their Rebels) by his owne private power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent of the other Electors &amp; Princes in a <hi>Diet.</hi> So that the <hi>German</hi> Princes be subjects, and no subjects; The Emperour is as it were the Grand Land-lord, who hath made away his right by lease or grant, but hath little to doe till the expiration or forfeiture.</p>
                  <p>The second member of the Empire be the Imperiall and Hanse-townes, in which, because they have lesse power, the Emperour hath more than in the Princes Estates. The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e acknowledge the Emperour for their Lord, but yet with divers acceptions. For first, they will stand upon their owne privileges, and for them will deny any request of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. Secondly, they depend and trust unto their owne private confederacies amongst themselves, as much as to the Emperour; as the <hi>Switzers,</hi> and <hi>Grisons</hi> leaguers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves; and the Princes of the lower <hi>Creitz,</hi> or circle of <hi>Saxony,</hi> amongst themselves; in defence of which the King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> as Duke of <hi>Holstein</hi> being one of them, tooke up just Armes of late even against the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Subjects these Cities and States are, but yet were they no freer than the subjects of other Princes, they durst not make leagues amongst themselves to the prejudice of their Emperour. Thirdly, even these Imperiall Cities have some
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:6897:146"/>
other Lords besides the Emperour, or the Maior, or Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of their owne Townes. Thus the Marquesse of <hi>Onspach</hi> being of the House of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> stil challengeth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Office and Title of his Family, which is to be <hi>Burgrave</hi> of <hi>Nurembergh,</hi> which is a principall Imperiall Citie. We see also what power and favour the King of <hi>Poland</hi> had in these warres with <hi>Sweden,</hi> in the Imperiall Citie of <hi>Dantzik,</hi> which put it selfe under his protection. <hi>Wormbs</hi> also in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> under protection of the <hi>Palsgrave,</hi> received an Armie of the Princes of the Vnion in favour of him, even against the present Emperour.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the House of <hi>Austria</hi> holds the Empire in that fashion, that <hi>Adonias</hi> laid claime to the Kingdome, wherein another sate confirmed, and perished for want of supporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For besides that it is not hereditary, neither can he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Coronation command like an absolute Soveraigne, nor expect or inforce the reciprocall duties betweene Prince and Subject; nor is hee powerfull enough to countermand the Privileges of the Empire; no nor to call the <hi>Diet</hi> without the consent of the major part of the Electors. For some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces are as it were members of the Empire, yet disunited: for neither doe they, nor will they acknowledge that they belong at all to the Empire; as the Kings of <hi>Denmarke</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Prussia,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> that now is (who requires Investiture of the <hi>Polander,</hi> not of the Emperour) the <hi>Switzers</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands.</hi> Others confesse the Emperour for their Soveraigne Prince; but they come not to the <hi>Diets</hi> of the Empire, nor will beare the Tax and Tallages of the Empire: as the Dukes of <hi>Savoy, Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Italy.</hi> Others come to the <hi>Diets</hi> and pay all impositions: and these are properly the Princes' and Cities of <hi>Germanie.</hi> But the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> by the grant of <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, is exempted from all contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. As for the other Princes, they be so many, and by leaguing together so mighty, that they attend in Court at pleasure, contest with the Emperour at pleasure, raise forces at pleasure, and supply his wants of Exchequer at pleasure.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:6897:147"/>
Some of them have to doe both in the <hi>Diets,</hi> and at the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a new Emperour: those be the Electors; three Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and three Princes. But as at first <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was faine to bribe them with many Privileges and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships for their voices in his Election: so still they must be courted, if the Emperour desires to have his sonne or brother chosen after him, or any great favour done unto him. If they be displeased, they are strong enough to ruffle with him. The other Princes live of themselves, and the Emperour is oftner beholding to them, than they to him: so that these be but Lordly Subjects of the Empire. To speake now in a word,: These are truly termed the States, the Princes and Cities of the Empire; who have to doe in the <hi>Diets</hi> or Parliaments, and as members of one b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>die participate of good and evill, of advantage or disadvantage, thorowout the whole Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. These, living after the manner of a Commonwealth well united, make use (in manner aforesaid) of the Emperour for their head and common safetie.</p>
                  <p>And such be divers of the lesser Princes, together with the Hanse-townes, and Imperiall Cities. Free or Imperiall Cities, are they, which are not directly within the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of any Prince, though they stand within his Territory. For example: <hi>Heidleberg, Wormbs,</hi> and <hi>Spiers,</hi> are all in the <hi>Palatinate</hi>; whereof the first is the Princes owne, and not Imperiall; the other be Imperiall, and not the Princes. Such Cities have obtained their freedome either for money, or for service done to the Emperour: whereupon, some of them are so strong, so privileged, and so populous, that out of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate repining at Taxes and Impositions, they have many times opposed against their naturall Lords; yea, and in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile manner excluded them from the superioritie of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding: witnesse the contentions heretofore betweene the Citie of <hi>Brunswicke,</hi> and their owne Duke; the exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Cities and Princes, when the <hi>Landigrave</hi> of <hi>Hes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen</hi> was imprisoned; and the generall cause of the Protestants, protesting in every place against the Ecclesiasticall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and Imperiall threatnings. These Cities governe
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:6897:147"/>
themselves by their owne Lawes, being bound no further, than to pay two fifth parts of whatsoever generall contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is assessed in the Imperiall <hi>Diets.</hi> They pay tribute to the Emperour (some say) fifteene thousand Florens: but they have for the most part sufficient revenue of their owne to defray the charges. The nature of other Cities you have before read of.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Diets</hi> now be the things by which the Emperour rules all, if he be able to make a partie. The ordinances of these <hi>Diets</hi> cannot be frustrated but by another <hi>Diet:</hi> but of putting the Decrees in execution, the Emperour hath the full power and the sole authority. And therfore as touching pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence and dignity, hee is to be accounted the first and chiefe of the Christian Princes, as the person upon whom the Majestie of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire resteth, and who ought to defend the Nation of the <hi>Germans,</hi> the Church of God, the Catholike Faith; and to procure the peace and wel-fare of the whole Christian world. And this is something to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the understanding of the State of the Empire in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> Go we now to relate of the other chiefe Princes there. And first of those which worthily challenge the next place, the Electors: of which the <hi>Palsgrave</hi> is chiefe.</p>

                  <p>The Land naturally is very rich, the Mountains are full of Vines, Woods, and such excessive store of red Deere, that <hi>Spinola's</hi> souldiers in the late warres had them brought to

them like Beefe or Bacon. How famous the <hi>Rhenish</hi> Wines are, I need not say. Of Corne they have no want: Silver al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is here digged up. Goodly Townes and strong it had such store, as if they had had nothing but Cities. All which are now divided betwixt the Emperour, the <hi>Bavarian,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> The Prince also was said to have two and twenty Palaces. But the chiefest ornament was the incomparable, Library of <hi>Heidleberg</hi>; not for the beauty of the roome, (for it was but in the roofe of the chiefe Church, and that by a long wall divided into two parts) but for the numbers of excellent Manuscripts and printed bookes; with which it was then better stored, than <hi>Oxford</hi> yet is. The Princes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue arose first out of his owne Lands and Customes of his Manours. Secondly, out of the tenths and wealth of the Monasteries and estate of the Church confiscated: which perchance made up one quarter (if not more) of his whole estate. Thirdly, from the Toll of one Bridge over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> he yearely had about twentie thousand crownes.

These Walls are of faire and large squared stones, wel countermined with earth on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, and wonderfully fortified with seven strong Bulwarks, and as many great Mounts on the outside. On the which (as also on the walls) are one hundred and fifty goodly peeces of Brasse artillerie, with a garrison of five hundred well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

Souldiers in continuall pay. This City within the walls hath eight hundred houses, foure Churches, three Gates, two faire Market places, and a great Bridge of stone over the <hi>Elve.</hi>

                  <p>The Mote which incompasseth the wall is deepe and cleere without any filth or weeds, and is on all sides wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with faire stones to the bottome. The streets are not many, but very faire, the houses not very great, but of one uniformitie, and pleasing to behold. In most of the streets runneth from the River a small streame of water, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of these streets are tubs placed upon sleds full of water, alwaies ready to be drawne by horses or men, whither oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of fire should crave imployment. For prevention whereof, they maintaine men of purpose to walke every night in the streets, and some to watch carefully on the highest Towers. The Palace of the Duke is of great beauty and majesty: the Chambers are flowerd with coloured Marbles, and garnished round with Stags heads of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary greatnesse; many bed-steds and tables also are of divers coloured Marbles, most curiously carved and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Within the Palace is an Armory for horsemen of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable magnificence, with a great number of horses cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously framed in wood, and painted to the life, with as many woodden men on their backes, furnished most richly with all furniture fit for a horseman to use in the warres. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst these are the lively portraictures of many of the Dukes of <hi>Saxonie</hi> carved and painted to life, covered with such robes, armour, and furniture for their horses made of gold and silver, and set with precious stones, as they used to weare when they were living.</p>
                  <p>There are also thirty six sleds for pleasure of great beauty, and rare invention, with two carved and painted horses to every of them, richly furnished with silver bits, and the bridles and capar sons imbrodered with silver and gold, hanging full of silver bels according to the <hi>German</hi> custome. Here are also many Chambers full of Masking garments, and other abiliments for triumphs and pastimes both for
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:6897:150"/>
Land and Water. In this Armory also are many costly weapons, both offensive and defensive; such, so good, and so rich, as mony can procure, or the wit of man invent.</p>
                  <p>Vnder this Armory standeth a most princely Stable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with stone, and supported with goodly pillars of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Out of every of which pillars runneth sweet and fresh water for the daily use of the Stable: The rackes are of iron, the mangers plated over with copper, the stalles for the Horses of strong carved timber; every Stall having a faire glazed window, and every window a greene curtaine. The ground betweene the stalles is paved with faire broad stones. In this Stable are an hundred eight and twenty hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and yet no wet nor filth to be perceived, nor dung to be seene or smelt.</p>
                  <p>Neere unto the Palace standeth the Arsenall, wherein is seene such plenty of great Artillerie, yellow as gold, such strange Engins, and such wonderfull qualities of all kind of Armour and Munition whatsoever, necessary for the Wars, or a long siege, that for Land-service it farre excelleth the Arsnall of <hi>Venice,</hi> or any other Storehouse in <hi>Europe,</hi> able to arme 300000. Horse and Foot at a dayes warning. And as the Armory and Arsenall excell all others, so the City for its quantity (in my judgement) is to be accounted the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and strongest of <hi>Europe,</hi> and that far surpassing <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remberg, Anwerp,</hi> or <hi>Lubech,</hi> at this day reckoned to bee the prime Cities of Christendome.

                  <p>Other commodities of worth they have none, but flax,<note place="margin">Commodities.</note> and a kinde of thicke course cloth, which by reason of the exceeding falsifying and dearenesse of ours, groweth every day into more and more request with them.</p>

                  <p>In their chiefe Cities, some few give themselves at their great and principall Feasts, to a little use of their Peece, in shooting at a marke; but otherwise, by reason of their long peace, altogether untrained to the warres, or any warlike exercises.

                  <p>The Nobilitie and Gentilitie generally thorow all <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> and particularly in this Dukedome, have great roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties and revenues.

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:6897:153"/>
their want of knowledge every way, either in experience or contemplation. And truly I cannot so much as heare almost of any of them, either Noble or Gentlemen, that give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to any Noble studies, exercises, or delights, except now and then to the hunting of the wilde Boare; by which, and by accustoming their heads to the wearing of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie thrummed Caps in stead of a head-peece, they take themselves to be greatly enabled for service.</p>
                  <p>For the valour and warlike disposition of the people of this Dukedome,<note place="margin">Valour.</note> I cannot commend them above the rest of their Country-men; neither shall I (as I thinke) need to stand much upon that point, sithence their actions shall plead their sufficiencie in generall. The great matters which they have undertaken, and the little that they have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, will produce sufficient testimonie. What they did one against another in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, is not much materiall to prove their courage; since without question, Bulrushes against Bulrushes are very good Weapons. But in the same time, and under the same Duke and Captaine, they performed very little against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though with farre over-ballanced numbers, as in divers places of <hi>Sleyden</hi> manifestly appeareth. Touching their actions in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> in the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his time, &amp; in <hi>France</hi> during the civill warres, and sithence for the King, (if I mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it not) it hath alwayes beene praise enough for them, if they have helped to keepe their enemies from doing any great matters, though they have performed nothing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Of latter time they have rather increased than dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished this opinion, in the warres ten yeares since in <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> besides many other times of notable disorders amongst them by false Alarmes. They fled most shamefully out of the Island of <hi>Komora,</hi> being charged by a few <hi>Tartars,</hi> who with infinite hazzard and inconvenience swam over a part of the <hi>Danubie</hi> to come at them. The Summer after, Count <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Mansfielt,</hi> their Generall, had them in such je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, as when the <hi>Turkes</hi> only with some twelve or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene thousand men came to victuall <hi>Gran,</hi> and past almost
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:6897:153"/>
close by their Tents, and they being at least fifty thousand strong, he durst not set upon them till they retired, having performed the project of their journey, left the <hi>Germans</hi> (who were by farre the greater part of his Armie) being lustily charged, might give backe, &amp; so indanger the whole Campe. To omit many other particularities about this point, too long to dwell upon in this discourse, they are no more to be commended for their discipline, than for their valour: for though they be commonly very well armed, and keepe indifferent good order in their march, yet are they for the most part no more watchfull and provident in their Campe, than if they were safely intrenched in an Ale-house. Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relsome exceedingly, and in a manner given to drinking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, and almost every common souldier carrying with him his she-baggage, besides his bagge and other furniture. Of their unreasonable spoiling and free-booting, the French Stories make sufficient relation; and it hath alwayes beene hard to discerne, whether those Nations that have called them to their succour, have received more detriment by them, or by their professed enemies. For instance of their spoiling humour, the Marquesse of <hi>Turloch</hi> taking in the Marquesdome of <hi>Baden,</hi> and being constrained to keepe some foure or five thousand men in sundry places in garrison, they all offered (though he gave them very extraordinary pay) to serve without any wages, so they might have free libertie of pillage. Therefore let it not seeme strange, that I produce these generall examples of this Nation; for though in divers Provinces they are much differing in complexion, in stature, and many other circumstances, yet for warre, especially for their vices in warre, they are in a manner all of the same aire.</p>
                  <p>They have greatly affected the <hi>English</hi> Nation,<note place="margin">Conceit of the <hi>English.</hi>
                     </note> but of late were they not a little distasted, upon pretence of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done them about prizes, Sea matters, and suppressing their privileges of the <hi>Stillyard</hi>; wherein though they themselves (as being Inland people, and trading little by Sea) are nothing interessed; yet their neighbours of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:6897:154"/>
Lubech,</hi> and divers other Hanse-townes, making all these matters farre greater and worse than indeed they are, have spread even into their minds the contagion of their owne grudge.</p>
                  <p>The Councell of <hi>Saxony</hi> are at this time few:<note place="margin">Councell.</note> Amongst them there are some that are of the Nobility, Counsellours rather in name than effect. For in that they live in their Countries, they are seldome present at any consultations, and meddle little in the ordinary government of the State. The rest, after the manner of <hi>Germany,</hi> are most Civilians. The whole government of the affaires (as also the Court) is very private. Other particulars I cannot specifie, neither in truth if a man consider their outward portlinesse, though otherwise I doubt not, but wise enough, doe they merit the setting downe of any. For being (as all <hi>Germans</hi> are) plaine and homely in their behaviour and entertainment, they are both in their retinue, apparell, and all things else very su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; so that not onely in this Court, but in the Courts of divers great Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> they goe usually apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in blacke Leather, or Linnen died blacke, the chiefest having only an addition for ornament sake, of the Princes picture in gold, or a chaine of one or two boughts, whereby they seeme such leatherne and linnen Gentlemen, as, if they were in <hi>England,</hi> all men would take them for honest fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors unto Merchants, or else some under-Clerke of an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, rather than such great and chiefe Counsellours, to so great Princes and Estates. But as it should be great folly for a man to judge the preciousnesse of a Iewell by the case wherein it is kept, and much greater to esteeme it by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the case <expan>

So on the other side, it is an undeniable certainty, that not only the common people and strangers, but even wise men are moved and stirred up with outward shewes, and their mindes according to those exterior mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:6897:154"/>
prepared to receive a deepe impression, either of like or dislike, favour or disfavour, of reverence, or carelesse retchlesnesse, and debased dispositions.</p>
                  <p>The Revenues of this Dukedome are,<note place="margin">Revenues.</note> as most men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, very great, and without comparison the greatest of any <hi>German</hi> Prince whatsoever. The meanes whereby it ariseth to that greatnesse, are divers; first the great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Silver Mines, and such like, whose profit notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is very uncertaine, according to the goodnesse or badnesse of the veines: the great impositions upon all sorts of Merchandize, and the assize upon Beere, which only in the Citie. <hi>Liepsiege,</hi> being a little Towne of two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, amounteth yearely to above twenty thousand pounds sterling. The tenths of all sorts of increase, as Corne, Wine, &amp;c. The Salt-houses at <hi>Hall,</hi> and some other places, which being all to the Duke; besides the Lands of the Dukedome being very great, and the Taxes and Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies assessed at their Parliaments or Diets, with divers other casualties, which fall not within my knowledge. But above all, the greatest is an imposition which hath long time beene laid upon the people, towards the maintenance of the warres against the <hi>Turke</hi>; which notwithstanding they have beene suspended for a long space lately, yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of being sufficiently provided and furnished against future necessities, they have beene continued, and the treasure converted to the Princes private use, arising in all this time to that quantity, that if it had beene reserved to the pretended use, the warres might be continually very royally maintained, (I speake as much as is required on the behalfe of that Dukedome) and the people freed these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares from the imposition; which notwithstanding is not onely still continued, but since the last warres increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. What the generall summe of all the revenues arise unto I have nothing certaine, neither indeed is it certaine in it selfe, a great part thereof (as aforesaid) consisting upon casualties, as the Mines and Tenths, &amp;c. But for mine owne particular conceit, being not altogether unconfirmed by other mens
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:6897:155"/>
opinions, I cannot imagine how that it can arise to lesse than foure hundred thousand pound sterling yearely at the least.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I briefly runne over some few particulars of the great and noble Dukedome of <hi>Saxony,</hi> worthy a much more ample discourse, and a farre more worthier and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informed discourser; being (all things considered) not onely the greatest and mightiest Princedome under the Empire, but even greater and mightier (I meane as it stood united in the time of <hi>Christianus</hi>) than the Empire it selfe. For though the Emperour by his sacred Imperiall Seat bee his Liege-Lord, and in greatnesse of dominion farre su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, yet is he in revenue, in great love of his people, in warlike provision, and in <hi>German</hi> leagues and confederacies farre inferiour.</p>

                  <head>The State of the Marquesse Elector of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis Prince possesseth a larger tract of land than doth the other Electors, and hath more Noblesse, Gentry, and people, yet is a great deale of his land very wilde and barren, much of his people poore, and himselfe though of great revenue, yet farre short of that of <hi>Saxony. Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> lies on the East limited with <hi>Poland,</hi> on the West with <hi>Saxonie,</hi> touching upon <hi>Lusatia</hi> on the South. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe is about five hundred miles, wherein are reckoned fifty Cities great and small, and threescore and foure walled Townes. The whole Marquisate is divided into the <hi>Old,</hi> the chiefe Towne whereof is <hi>Brandenburg</hi>; and the <hi>Nen,</hi> the greatest Citie therein being <hi>Franckford</hi> upon <hi>Oder</hi>; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for the Mart and Vniversity. The Princes Seat is at <hi>Berlin.</hi> This twofold division is againe subdivided into eight Provinces, from which the Nobilitie take their titles; one of these (<hi>Crossen</hi> by name) being a Dukedome. For in <hi>Germany</hi> (you are to understand) a Dukedome may be contained within a Marquisate, yea, and a Duke come behinde a Count: for that in the Empire precedencie goes
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:6897:155"/>
not (as with us) by title, but by bloud and antiquity. The name of the present Elector is <hi>Iohannes Georgius,</hi> in whose line the title hath continued these two hundred and eleven yeares. Besides now the bare Country of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> this Prince hath other dominions: many townes and lands both in <hi>Lusatia</hi> and <hi>Silesia</hi>; which with that of <hi>Onspach</hi> by <hi>Nurenberg,</hi> goe commonly away to the younger of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; all which write themselves Marquesses of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi> The three Dukedomes of <hi>Cleve, Iuliers,</hi> and <hi>Berg,</hi> have also beene united to this family; though now almost twentie yeares since the Duke of <hi>Cleve</hi> dying without issue, these three States are yet in controversie betwixt this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse, and the Duke of <hi>Newenburg.</hi> Besides these, is hee Duke of <hi>Prussia,</hi> which is a great Country; into which the King of <hi>Poland</hi> is to give him investiture. So that hee and the Archbishop Elector of <hi>Cullen,</hi> be Lords of the greatest tracts of lands of all the Princes of <hi>Germany.</hi> The revenues out of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> are thought to amount to forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds sterling; and certainly his profits out of all his other Estates cannot but double that summe: A sufficient rent for such a Prince, if you consider the cheapnesse of all things in his Country. He is Lord of much people, and therefore of many souldiers.</p>

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:6897:156"/>
wholly governed, he hath spent, and daily doth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely in building them Churches, Altars, and Colleges, and endowing them with large revenues.</p>
                  <p>What is above written of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria's</hi> estate, was something to the truth at the time of the former edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this booke; for certainly the house of <hi>Bavaria</hi> is wholly Iesuited, insomuch as the father of this present Duke giving over the government, retired himselfe into a house of Iesuites: and this present Duke, besides other his large bounties and buildings, hath already estated eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred pound sterling a yeare upon the <hi>English</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites, with condition, that it shall goe to the Vniversity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> so soone as that shall be converted to Popery. So that the case is now altered with the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> hee hath gotten part both of the <hi>Vpper</hi> and <hi>Lower Palatinate</hi> into his hands; yea, and the Electorship it selfe is estated upon him. Thus (for the time) are the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and <hi>Bavaria</hi> fallen both upon one person againe, as they were before the yeare 1294. when as <hi>Lewis</hi> the Emperour, Prince of both of them, gave the <hi>Palatinate</hi> to his elder sonne, and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> to the younger: after which the <hi>Palatine</hi> marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heire of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> againe united them. But about 125. yeares since the Emperour <hi>Maximilian</hi> againe parted them, giving <hi>Bavaria</hi> to the Ancestor of this present <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian.</hi> He is Vncle to King <hi>Frederike:</hi> himselfe hath no issue; his second brother is the Elector of <hi>Cullen,</hi> and a third brother he hath who is not childlesse. <hi>Bavaria</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches both <hi>Austria, Bohemia,</hi> and the <hi>Vpper Palatinate</hi>; too aptly situated for the late warres, both to distresse his nephew, and to aid the Emperour.

The East and West parts thereof, standing continually full of water: The South part remaining dry continually, and is well defended with Casemats, the better to scoure the Curtaine: it is so much the stronger, for that it standeth almost in an Island, having the Lake aforesaid on the North, the River of <hi>Rhosne</hi> upon the West, and the River of <hi>Arba</hi> upon the South, being from the Towne halfe a mile, and by reason of the swiftnesse of the currant, and great moveable stones in the bottome, which are violently carried downe the River, it is not passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but with great danger.</p>
                  <p>The River <hi>Rhosne</hi> divideth the Towne into two parts, the one is called the high Towne, and the other Saint <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vais.</hi> Betweene the River (in passing) it divideth it selfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two branches, making a little Island, wherein are some few houses, and seven or eight mills to grinde corne.

Besides, till the time aforesaid, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> might pardon offenders that were condemned: and further, there was no sentence of Law executed, but the Dukes Officer was made acquainted therewith, in whose power it was to disanull, as hee liked best. Likewise in the yeare 1529. when as those of <hi>Geneva</hi> had leagued themselves with <hi>Friburge,</hi> the Duke disliking thereof, because it was done without his privitie, caused the league to be broken, alleaging, that the Towne of <hi>Geneva</hi> could not conclude a matter of such importance, without his allowance and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. Besides, all these reasons before remembred, this also is alleaged as most materiall, that Duke <hi>Charles</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Geneva</hi> with the Duchesse <hi>Beatrice</hi> his wife, those of the Towne presented him the Keyes thereof, therby acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him their chiefe Lord and Master.

                  <p>The Towne is governed by a Councell of two hundred,<note place="margin">Government.</note> called the great Councell, out of which is chosen another Councell, composed of five and twentie, and of these, foure especiall men, called <hi>Sindiques,</hi> who have the managing of the whole Common-wealth, unlesse it be in some great matters, wherein the whole State is deeply interessed, as in making of peace or warre, in leagues offensive and defensive, appeales, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The people are governed by the Civil Law: the Iudge whereof is called a Lieutenant Criminall, before whom all causes are tried, and from whom there is no appeale, unlesse it be to the generall Councell of two hundred. When the Towne was besieged in eightie nine, the <hi>Venetians</hi> did not only send them intelligence of sundry practices against them, but also sent them twenty foure thousand crownes to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their warres; and out of <hi>England</hi> they had thirteene thousand crownes. The Great Duke of <hi>Thuscan</hi> did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise send them many intelligences at the same time: and heretofore when as the Pope, the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> have joyned their powers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with purpose to besiege them, the Emperour hath not only revealed all their practices, but offered to aid them with men and money: yea, and sometime the Dukes of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> have lent them money to maintaine them against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

                  <p>Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> highly favoured it, and releeved it: so did all the Protestant <hi>German</hi> Princes, together with the <hi>French</hi> King. Who though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Ministers have a consistorie, unto which they may call publike offendors, and such as give scandall unto others, and there reprove them: and if the crime be great, and the partie obstinate, they forbid him the Communion; if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding hee persist, they may excommunicate him.

The <hi>Count</hi> agrieved hereat, offered to doe justice upon the offenders, but the Inhabitants of that Vallie valiantly resisted, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw two or three of his Castles in one day, and slew divers of his Officers.

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their order, they thinke it a matter impossible for any forces to breake them, or to enter upon them neerer than a Pikes length. In a pitcht field, without doubt, they are excellent good Foot-men, but to invade a Province they have little courage, and lesse to defend it; and commonly, where they are not able to maintaine their accustomed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of fight, they availe nothing; as in the warre of <hi>Italy</hi> was plainly manifested, especially when they were put to assaults (as at <hi>Padoa,</hi> and other places) wherein they gave but weake testimonies of valour: whereas when they fought it out in open field at the Pikes length, they carried themselves valiantly; insomuch that at the battell of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna,</hi> if the <hi>French</hi> had beene without their assistance, they had questionlesse lost the glory of that daies victory. For before both Armies came to handy-strokes, the Spanish had already overthrowne the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Gascoine</hi> Foot-men, and if the <hi>Swizers</hi> had not seconded them, they had beene all slaine or taken. So in the warre of <hi>Guien</hi> it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that the <hi>Spanish</hi> were more afraid of one band of <hi>Swizers,</hi> whereof the King had waged ten thousand, than of any of the rest of the French Regiments. Thus by the reputation of these and their former exploits, they wonne unto their Nation so glorious a perpetuity of their Armes and valour, that ever since they have beene called unto the aide of divers Princes, and in continuall action under some one State or other bordering upon them; but especially
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:6897:161"/>
under the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> of whom they entertaine some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, and sometimes lesse.

Governour superiour to any other, in case the cause (be it peace or warre) concerne the universall State of all the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, looke how the major part of voices shall sway in the Senate, so it prevaileth, and that which the greater number resolve upon, is without more adoe put in execution. The benefit which they gaine by a common warre, Is divided in common: but if sometimes two or three united Cantons purchase any bootie by their peculiar Armes, of that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the residue can claime no share. Yet hath it happened, that the residue thinking themselves injured in not partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating generally, have raised divers controversies; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as aforesaid) they are equally free, and as great is the soveraigne authoritie of one Citie as of another, both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have appealed unto the French King, who upon hearing of the cause in question, gave judgement, <hi>That a particular gaine appertained to particular persons.</hi> And so the rest.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when they are either occasioned or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to make any particular warre, the united Cantons erect lights and make bone-fires: but when they are to raise for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in generall, (as suppose they should for the French King) first they strike up their Drumme, then all the Cities doe presents as many persons as they thinke good, which may be to the number of five and thirtie or fortie thousand, of whom after the Captaines have culd out their limited portions, the residue are licensed to depart to their owne homes.

The nomination being ended, the chiefe of the companies demand of the people, which of these three thus nominated, they are willing to elect: So naming them anew, one by one, the multitude lift up their hands at the naming of him whom they desire to be their Governour. And oft-times it falleth out, that he that hath beene once <hi>Vnama,</hi> in desert of his justice and good carriage towards them, hath beene cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen againe the second time.

                  <p>These are from yeare to yeare confirmed by the people, although (as doth the <hi>Vnama</hi>) they continue their office for three yeares. These send Governours to the Castles on the Frontiers, and (to decide inferiour matters) they allow ten persons chosen out of the meaner sort; but the parties in controversie may appeale to the fifteene: other Iudges, or further appeales (as in the Civill Law) they have not to flie unto.

In it are many large valleyes, populous, and rich in commodities. But to speake of particulars: when we are past <hi>Magra, Sarazana</hi> offereth it selfe to our view, a Citie holden by the <hi>Genoise</hi> with great jealousie, by reason of the neighbour-hood of the great Duke, and a little higher lieth <hi>Pentrimoli,</hi> a Castle belonging to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> of great account, and situated not farre from the Sea; then <hi>Massa</hi> and <hi>Carrara,</hi> places famous for their quarries of white Marble. <hi>Lucca</hi> standeth on the River <hi>Serichio, Pisa</hi> on <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>

The Citie is three miles in compasse, strong in situation and wals, and well stored with Artillery and Munition. On the North it confineth <hi>Carfagnana,</hi> a fruitfull Valley, and well inhabited with serviceable people, on the other parts it is incompassed with the Territories appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Great Duke. <hi>Pisa</hi> was once of such wealth,<note place="margin">

                     </note> that at one instant, the Citizens thereof held warre against the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>Genois.</hi> They grew great by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw which the <hi>Sarazens</hi> gave to the <hi>Genois,</hi> in the yeare 1533. the remainder of which defeature, was received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the protection of their Citie; and declined by the slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their people, and also of their Navie given them by the <hi>Genois</hi> neere to the Isle <hi>Giglio.</hi> For thereby they became so weake, that not able to sustaine their wonted reputation, they were forced to submit themselves under the protection of <hi>Florentines,</hi> against whom (when <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded <hi>Italy</hi>) they rebelled. But being againe reduced to their former obedience, the Citie notwithstanding was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner left desolate, because the Citizens (impatient of the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines</hi> government) passed into <hi>Sardinia, Sicil,</hi> and other places to inhabit. So that the place wanting Inhabitants, and the Countrey people to manure it, the situation thereof being low and moorish, by reason of Fens and Marishes, it became infectious. <hi>Cosmo</hi> the great Duke, undertooke to re-people it againe, and to further his intention, he builded there a stately house for the receit of the Knights of Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> gracing it with many privileges, which yet to this day remaine unaltered.

The Citizens bought

their freedome of the Emperour <hi>Rodolfe</hi> for six thousand Crownes, as they of <hi>Lucca</hi> theirs for 10000. In whose time and ever since it hath flourished in great prosperity. For upon occasion, the City is able to arme 30000: men, and the Country 60000. It is strongly walled, the situation thereof being low, especially on the North side: but on the other parts is somewhat subject to the command of certaine hills which overlooke it, the inconvenience whereof they have prevented by fortifications. It hath a Citadell built by Duke <hi>Alexander,</hi> and after inlarged by <hi>Cosmo.</hi> The streets thereof are straight, large, and very cleane kept. There are to be seene the most artificiall buildings of all Europe, both publike and private. <hi>Charles</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Austrich</hi> was wont to say, that it was a City not to be showne but on Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidaies. No soile is tilled with more art, diligence, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity: for you shall see one little peece of ground to bring forth Wine, Oyle, Corne, Pulse, and Fruits. Notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it will not afford sufficient victuals for a third part of the yeere: to remedy which scarcity, it was not without good reason that they spent two millions of Crownes for the recovery of <hi>Pisa.</hi> The last Duke became an earnest Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner to the Pope, that he might be created King of <hi>Tus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canie</hi>; but the Pope not brooking so lordly a Title in so neere a neighbour, answered, that hee was content that hee <hi>should bee King in Tuscanie, but not King of Tuscanie</hi>; which scholler-like distinctions great Princes cannot well digest.</p>

From <hi>Florence</hi> it is not above thirty three miles distant; but the people thereof are much differing in Manners, as also disposition; they sparing, slow, and unsocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble towards Strangers; these bountifull, and of kinde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment: they loth to part with money, and provident; these liberall, and onely caring for the present: they grave, melancholie, and alwaies expecting their profit; these plaine and of cheerefull countenance: the one inclined to traffique

and gaine; the other content with their Revenues, and the fruits of their Farmes. <hi>Sienna</hi> hath a large and fruitfull Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, wherein are contained in the Cities of <hi>Pienza, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talcino, Chiusi, Soana:</hi> and in <hi>Maremma, Massa,</hi> and <hi>Cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The coast beginneth at <hi>Capiglia,</hi> and extendeth to the little River of <hi>Fiore,</hi> being all good soile for Corne, but the aire is so infectious, that none live long therein. The ports doe all belong to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> together with the Hill <hi>Argentino,</hi> a place famous by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course which <hi>Claudius Ptolomeus</hi> made thereof, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the situation fit for the building of a royall Citie. Next this Province beginneth the patrimony of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> bequeathed to the Church by the Countesse <hi>Matilda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These may be partly ghessed at by the numbers of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:<note place="margin">His forces at land.</note> which (not to over-reach with the <hi>Italians</hi>) are valued 800000. soules, or perchance a million in all his dominions. So then out of every 16000. people to allow three hundred souldiers (which is the proportion of the Muster-books in <hi>Prato</hi>) then will 800000. people allow 15000. souldiers: and though the Duke (as some writers affirme) hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times confessed that he hath thirty or 36000. souldiers: yet I suppose you shall doe him no wrong not to allow him above 20000. in ordinary; seeing a Captaine of their owne at once confessed but 15000. These are trained once a moneth, except in <hi>Florence,</hi> where they are not suffered to weare Armes; the liberty to weare which causes divers to sue to be souldiers; those in ordinary pay are bestowed in his Garrisons. Thirty Castles and Forts he hath, and in some of them fifty, in others but fifteene souldiers. Sixteene Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with Garrison also he hath, in some of which he keepes not much above the said number, though in others two or three hundred. He hath in ordinary for his Guard one hundred horse, at six and thirty shillings nine pence apeece a moneth; and foure hundred light horse more, at fifteene shillings nine pence; one other troope of horse he hath, for
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:6897:169"/>
what service, and in what pay I know not. The Garrison Souldier hath one and twenty shillings a moneth, the traine Souldier nothing.</p>
                  <p>His Force at Sea he never recovered since the defeat given by the Turkes, where hee lost two of his best Gallies,<note place="margin">At Sea.</note> and one Galleon. His whole Fleet is about twelve Gallies, and five Galleasses; for honour and increase of his power by Sea, hath hee instituted the Knights of the Order of Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> who are his Commanders. His chiefe Port and Arsenall is <hi>Porto Ferraro,</hi> in the Ile of <hi>Elba.</hi> Of great Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance were told in the Castle of <hi>Livorno</hi> threescore and foure, and in that of <hi>Florence</hi> one hundred and fifty, by which may be ghessed that hee hath no want of munition. The charge of his Gallies for these six moneths, in which they be commonly at Sea, is about 18000. gold Crownes, each Crowne worth six shillings sterling.</p>
                  <p>There is not so much as a root,<note place="margin">His Revenues.</note> nor the dunging of an Asse, for which something is not paid to the great Duke: Victuals, Lodging, Weddings, Bargaines, Law-suits, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of young Tradesmen, all must be paid for. So that his ordinary and knowne revenue is valued at 1100000. Ducats, which comes to 279000. pound sterling a yeere, besides his extraordinaries. A wonderfull summe for a petty Prince, especially in such a thrifty place, where all expences defrayed, he may in times of peace put up one halfe, if not two thirds of his intire Revenue; Ordinaries and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinaries arising to one thousand pound a day. His neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Princes are all jealous of him, hee of them, and all watchfull one over another. But the greatest eye-sore his greatnesse is to the State of <hi>Lucca</hi> which lies in <hi>Tuscany,</hi> and all the whole length (being fifty miles) surrounded by this Dukes dominions. This makes them at great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall charge of Garrisons, and to put themselves under the protection of the Spaniard, the feare of whose power slaves off the Duke from attempting upon that State; which might hee once obtaine, hee might truly then write him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe <hi>Great Duke of Tuscany.</hi> Whereas now having but part
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:6897:170"/>
of it, he may be answered as the Pope did his Predecessor. So he may write himselfe the Greatest Duke of all <hi>Tuscany,</hi> rather than The Great Duke of all <hi>Tuscany.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Citie of <hi>Padoa,</hi> which for goodnesse of soile excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Bolognia</hi> it selfe. There are also the Cities of <hi>Bergamo, Vicenza,</hi> and <hi>Crema.</hi> There is againe the State of <hi>Friuli,</hi> with two honourable Cities, <hi>Vdine,</hi> where the Lieutenant of the State resideth, and <hi>Cividal</hi>; besides a number other populous Townes, little inferiour to Cities. Lastly, there is the fruitfull <hi>Polesine,</hi> with the noble Citie of <hi>Rovigo</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, with other places of good respect.</p>
                  <p>If wee consider the water, there are few States of <hi>Italy</hi> that have more abundance in that kinde, either for standing Waters, or Rivers. In the Territorie of <hi>Bergamo</hi> is the Lake of <hi>Iseo</hi>; in the Country of <hi>Brescia,</hi> the Lake of <hi>Idro.</hi> In the <hi>Veronesse</hi> and <hi>Brescian,</hi> is the Lake of <hi>Guardo.</hi> It is also wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with many great Rivers, that not only serve to make the fields fruitfull, but also to fortifie the place. And those Rivers are <hi>Oglio, Chiese, Navilio, Mincio, Seri, Mela,</hi> and <hi>Garza,</hi> which indeed is rather a Mountaine Bourne, than a River, &amp;c. The Countrey of <hi>Polesine</hi> and <hi>Padoa</hi> are so stored with Lakes and Rivers, that therein is no Burg or place which standeth not within five miles of some fresh Water. And all this Countrey of the firme Land (whereof I have spoken) is also for aire exceeding wholesome and temperate, as the complexions and cheerefull countenances of the Inhabitants can well witnesse, together with the quicknesse of their apprehension and wit, as well for matter of Armes as Learning.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Land, this State hath in it many parts that are very diverse in qualitie; some-where exceeding happy and fruitfull, but lesse industrie in the people; other-where the people are exceeding industrious, but the ground defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. Againe, some parts there are, where both the people are exceeding carefull &amp; industrious, and the soile also good.</p>
                  <p>Of the first sort is the Territorie of <hi>Crema,</hi> of <hi>Padoa,</hi> of <hi>Vicenza,</hi> of <hi>Trevisa,</hi> and the <hi>Polesine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the second sort is the Countrey of the <hi>Bergomasche,</hi> the <hi>Veronise,</hi> and <hi>Friuli.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="344" facs="tcp:6897:177"/>
Of the third sort is the Country of <hi>Brescia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And touching the first, it is almost incredible what the riches and increase is of those grounds; what fresh Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, what fruitfull arable, what abundance of Cattell, of Flesh, of all things that come of Milke; what plenty of Corne, of Pulse, of Fruit, Wood, Flax, Linnen, and Fish. Amongst all which particularities, the <hi>Padoan</hi> doth not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding excell; which for goodnesse of soile, doth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the praise from all the rest of <hi>Lombardie.</hi> The wealth of this Territory may hence be conjectured, that it hath the richest Bishopricke and Prebendaries of <hi>Italy.</hi> It hath one of the richest Abbeies of Saint <hi>Benet</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> which is Saint <hi>Iustina.</hi> It hath one of the most beautifull Convents of the same order, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that of <hi>Praxa.</hi> It hath the richest Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery belonging to the <hi>Austen-Friers,</hi> which is that of <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diana.</hi> It hath two of the greatest Churches that may bee found in <hi>Italy,</hi> which are Saint <hi>Iustina,</hi> and Saint <hi>Anthony,</hi> with one of the greatest Customes of salt in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth, no City of the Empire had more Knights of <hi>Rome,</hi> than had <hi>Padoa.</hi> For that (as <hi>Strabo</hi> testifieth) there were sometimes counted five hundred of them at once. Which must needs proceed from the extraordinary goodnesse of the soile, and the greatnesse of private livelihoods. But at this day, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobilitie, hath in great part dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the Nobilitie of other Cities. Amongst which <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leia</hi> in old time tooke in compasse twelve miles, and made an hundred and twenty thousand Citizens. And <hi>Ravenna,</hi> which was situated in a Lake (as <hi>Venice</hi> is) was once of such respect, that it was thought fit, and chosen first by <hi>Honorius,</hi> and afterwards by the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Exarchs</hi> for the seat of the Empire. In our daies by the conjuration of <hi>Cambraie,</hi> it was besieged by <hi>Maximilian</hi> with seven hundred French Launces, a thousand two hundred men at Armes, <hi>Italians:</hi> 18000. <hi>Dutch</hi> foot: six thousand <hi>Spaniards:</hi> two thousand <hi>Italians</hi> in pay: and six hundred Adventurers of divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with a huge quantitie of Artillery, and all other
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:6897:177"/>
Munition. Against this force the Seigniory opposed as great a force for defence, and put into the Citie six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men at Armes, fifteene hundred light-Horse, as many <hi>Carabines,</hi> under very expert Commanders: And for foot they had above twelve thousand <hi>Italians,</hi> ten thousand drawne out of the Gallies, a great number of Gentlemen of <hi>Venice,</hi> and Peasants of the Country without number; together with an Army of inestimable quantity of Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and victuall: with which quantity of men and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, the greatnesse of their workes and fortifications well answered. Now there being about and in <hi>Padoa</hi> two so great and populous Armies, one to assault it, another to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, and that this infinite number of Horse on both sides did never cease from boot-haling and forraging the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about, setting fire on all that they could not carry away, and that the Peasants had also conveyed away as much as they could into the Citie, and the adjoyning holds, yet did neither of these Armies ever want victuals during all that siege.</p>
                  <p>And yet as fruitfull as is <hi>Padoa,</hi> the Country of <hi>Crema</hi> is no whit behinde it for all things; for store and finenesse of flax beyond it. Of <hi>Polesine</hi> it shall only suffice to say, that it holdeth the like proportion with <hi>Padoa.</hi> The Country of <hi>Vicenza</hi> hath the Champian exceeding fat, and for that part thereof which is hilly, few Countries come neere it for pleasantnesse. It leaneth its shoulders upon the <hi>Alpes:</hi> it hath on the right hand the new River, on the left <hi>Bronta,</hi> in the middest of it runnes <hi>Bacchilion, Remon,</hi> &amp;c. it is the Garden of <hi>Venice.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Now the Countries, where the industrie of the people is more than the goodnesse of the soile, are those of <hi>Verona, Bergamo,</hi> and <hi>Friuli.</hi> For in the <hi>Bergamash</hi> there is more than forty miles of mountaine: the <hi>Veronese</hi> hath many miles of champian, altogether barren and sandy. The like
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:6897:178"/>
hath <hi>Friuli,</hi> whence it commeth that these parts are much subject to dearths, and scarcity of corne; but what they want in Bread, is re ompenced in Wine abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly; so that as I understand, the Island alone of <hi>Scala,</hi> which is one great Village in the <hi>Veronesse,</hi> doth rent in this commodity to the number of five thousand crownes yearely. Nor are they destitute of very good Wooll, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they of <hi>Verona</hi> doe weave Cloths and Felts: The <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamash</hi> an infinite quantity of Dornix, besides Broad-clothes and Kersies, which they vent partly into <hi>Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,</hi> and partly into <hi>Almaigne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fruitfulnesse of the soile, and industry of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple together, is notably discovered in the territory of <hi>Brescia</hi>; insomuch that I beleeve that no part of <hi>Italy</hi> in these two points can be compared thereto for opulencie and plenty, in those two parts which for goodnesse of soile wee count to be fertill. There is no private mans Garden for art and gracefulnesse of compartment or order, more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitely cast, or more diligently planted, or more neatly kept and dressed than this whole territory.</p>
                  <p>Now touching that part of the <hi>

But a sufficient testimonie thereof will bee, that the barrenest part of this territory is no lesse well inhabited than is the best. In the towne of <hi>Cordove</hi> alone it is knowne, that if need require, they are able in one day to make two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Harquibushes at all points out of the Masse, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be no Harquebush that goeth through lesse than ten hands at the least.

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:6897:179"/>
the old Citie neere the old Seat of <hi>Pagiopili</hi>; the new Fort, and thereto adjoyning the Castle Saint <hi>Angelo,</hi> besides sixty eight Townes.</p>
                  <p>Next in order is <hi>Cephalonia,</hi> containing in compasse an hundred threescore and six miles. It hath two hundred Townes, with Havens belonging unto them: Two where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Argostoli</hi> and <hi>Guiscardo</hi> are most famous; the third is <hi>Nallo.</hi> It yeeldeth store of Graine, Oyle, Sheepe, Cheese, Wooll, Honey, and Currans, and these in such plenty, that thereby it receiveth great and yearely Revenues. <hi>Candia</hi> is likewise one of the most renowned Islands of the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> It containeth in length two hundred sixty miles, in breadth fifty, and in compasse, in regard of the many promontories, it maketh almost six hundred. It yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth great plenty of Wine, with us called <hi>Malvesies,</hi> Cheese, and Honey. It is seated so conveniently, and with such advantage for marine occurrances, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured it to be Lady of the Sea. His reason, because it lieth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neere the middle, betweene <hi>Europe</hi> &amp; <hi>Asia,</hi> and betweene <hi>Greece</hi> &amp; the Islands of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> which in a manner Court her as their Mistresse and Soveraigne. It lieth from <hi>Constantinople</hi> three hundred and fifty miles, from <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> and <hi>Soria</hi> five hundred, from <hi>Caramania, Epire,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> three hundred, from <hi>Afrike</hi> two hundred.</p>
                  <p>There remaine behinde two other Islands, <hi>Cerigo</hi> and <hi>Tine.</hi> Of which <hi>Cerigo</hi> containeth in compasse sixty miles. In situatian it is mountainous, having one good City seated on the top of a Hill. It hath two Havens, the one called <hi>Delphino,</hi> the other <hi>Tine:</hi> That looketh North, this South. It hath besides divers creeks, but narrow, and unsafe: with the ancients it was of good esteeme; for <hi>Leon</hi> of <hi>Sparta</hi> considering well the seat and quality of the place, wished that either it had never beene, or being it had beene drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as soone as it had beene made. Which wish, as things afterwards fell out, wrought him a great opinion of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and foresight. For <hi>Romaratus,</hi> who banished from <hi>Sparta,</hi> and sojourned with <hi>Zerxes,</hi> counselled him to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:6897:180"/>
bring up all his Navie unto this Island, if hee meant to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patronize himselfe of <hi>Greece</hi>; as hee might easily have done, if hee had followed that counsell, as in few yeares after did <hi>Nicius,</hi> Generall of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in the warre of <hi>Peloponnesus.</hi> In our time it is called the Lanthorne of the <hi>Archipelago.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tine</hi> is in the middest of <hi>Archipelago,</hi> six miles from <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> (round about which <hi>Delos</hi> lie the <hi>Cyclades,</hi> in number fifty three:) It hath in circuit forty miles, with one great and populous Citie; and by reason of the Site which is on a Hill very strong, very many Townes it hath besides. And herewith endeth the Sea-Dominion of the <hi>Venetian:</hi> In all which, there are little lesse than three hundred and fiftie thousand soules. Which number perhaps is greater, than a man at first would beleeve, especially if he consider withall, how some of these parts, as <hi>Sclavonia,</hi> are not very fruitfull, and many of the Islands are barren; besides the terrour of the <hi>Turkish</hi> incursions: Insomuch, that if their Countries were under any other Lord than the <hi>Venetian,</hi> they would surely be defarted. But the Seigniory, with entertaining peace with all their Neighbours, with building of Forts, maintaining of Garrisons in places of necessitie, and with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding expence of money, keepe and maintaine their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in this sort, as at this day we see them inhabited.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fame</hi> reporteth the <hi>Venetians</hi> to be exceeding rich:<note place="margin">Riches.</note> But besides opinion, there is great reason, why they should be so indeed. First, they are Lords of a large Territory, both by Land and Sea; but chiefly on Land: where they have Cities of the best ranke of <hi>Italy,</hi> with large and opulent Territories adjoyning unto them, and full of people, industrious and thriftie. They have also rich Bishoprickes, wealthy Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyes, with the fattest and most commodious benefices of <hi>Italy:</hi> Families both for Nobilitie and Revenue worshipfull; and Buildings, for State and Magnificence singular: Besides which, they have also very wealthy commonalties. Amongst which, to omit many, <hi>Brescia</hi> alone hath eighteene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand crownes of yearely Revenue: and <hi>Asola</hi> which is but a
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:6897:180"/>
Towne, subject to <hi>Brescia,</hi> ten thousand.</p>
                  <p>Another reason, is the great advantage which the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> hath for Trafficke, both in drawing unto himselfe other mens commodities, and in venting his owne. I call his owne commodities whatsoever is growing, or made within the State: or whatsoever Trade besides he hath ingrossed; or by prescription of time appropriated to himselfe. This advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is marvellous great throughout the whole State of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> for that the firme Land on every side, is full of naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rivers and Lakes. Besides, it is for the greater part a plaine Countrey, so that the conveyance of all sorts of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize by Cart or by Horse, is very easie. They are also in possession of the Valleyes and passages of the <hi>Rhetian, Giulian,</hi> and <hi>Carmian Alpes,</hi> by which lieth all the Traffick betweene <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germanie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The State of the Sea is full of excellent,<note place="margin">Of the Sea.</note> large and safe Harbours, especially <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Sclavonia.</hi> The Islands have the like, especially the greater ones, as <hi>Corsu</hi> and <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi> But the flower of gaine and emolument to this State, is the Trafficke of the great Sea of <hi>Soria</hi> and <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which the <hi>Venetian</hi> had altogether in his hand; especially so much of the ancient Trafficke for spice, which hath beene, and yet is of reasonable good consequence unto them. In summe, all the Overland trade of Cloves, Nutmegs, Ginger, Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Pepper, Wax, Sugars, Tapestries, Cloths, Silkes, and Leather, with all the commodities of the East doe passe this way, and are uttered from hence into the greatest part of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and a good part of <hi>Germanie.</hi> The greatnesse of this Trade, may the better be perceived by the greatnesse and multitude of private shipping, belonging to Citizens and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Strangers, Merchants of <hi>Venice,</hi> and other Haven Townes belonging to the State: As also by the multitude and wealth of the said Merchants, and of the great stirring and bartering, that is there every day. In which kinde the Merchants only of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Nation in <hi>Venice</hi> doe dispatch as much, as were thought sufficient to furnish a whole world. To which purpose I may not omit to note, that Cities of
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:6897:181"/>
Trafficke have three degrees of difference; For either the Trade lieth by the Ware-house, that dispatcheth by grosse; or by open shops that doe retaile, or by both. Of this first sort, are <hi>Lisbon, Civil, Antwerpe, Amsterdam, Hamburgh, Danske, Noremberg</hi>; and in <hi>Italy, Naples, Florence,</hi> and <hi>Genoa.</hi> Of the second sort, are all the other Cities of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germanie.</hi> And amongst the Cities of <hi>Italy, Millan</hi> is herein the chiefest; where there are to be seene shops of all wares so rich, and well furnished, that they may well serve for <hi>Magazins</hi> to many Cities. In both sorts, <hi>Venice</hi> goeth beyond all the Cities of <hi>Italy:</hi> For there are open shops of infinite number, and the Ware-houses there doe farre passe all other in <hi>Italy.</hi> So that this Citie doth Trafficke by way of shop, as much as any other Citie, and by Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, more. And to conclude, putting both together, it is the Citie of greatest Trafficke in <hi>Europe,</hi> and perhaps of the World. And over this, whereas wealth doth arise to every Citie, by three wayes; first, by profits of Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; secondly, by recourse from places, to Iustice: and thirdly, by Merchandize; <hi>Venice</hi> is by all these wayes continually inriched. First, the Revenue of the whole is brought to <hi>Venice,</hi> both of the firme Land, and of the Sea: Secondly, all Appeales and suits of importance through the whole State doe come thither; and thirdly, <hi>Venice</hi> is as it were the center of the East and West, the Store-house of all that is produced by Sea or Land, and in summe, the receit of the whole wealth of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To set downe precisely the Revenue of the State is no ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie matter: but a man may be bold to say, that it is held to bee the greatest of any Prince Christian, except those of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> But whatsoever it be, certaine it is, they doe lay up every yeare a great Masse, over and above their expences; notwithstanding their incredible charge they are at in the <hi>Arsenall,</hi> in the building of Gallies, in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, in Garrisons, and Stipends. To this, the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> hath beene for these many yeares in continuall peace
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:6897:181"/>
with all Princes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> during which intermission, they have set all their study to the augmenting of their Revenues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is now credible, that having some yeeres since dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their debts, and disburthened themselves of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of the said monies, they have saved together great quantity of treasure. Besides which treasure in ready coine, they have another treasure of no small consideration, and that is the wealth of the City and the private substance of particulars, with the Revenues of the greater Schooles, or as they terme them, Halls; which the Common-wealth in her need may use as her owne. For that in occasions, some doe give voluntarily, others doe lend frankly, or upon light use: And in the warre of <hi>Cambray</hi> they gathered five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Crownes, upon the sale onely of certaine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices amongst them.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Venetian</hi> Territorie, for the extent of it,<note place="margin">The strength of the State.</note> hath in length somewhat above one thousand miles; and the breadth thereof answereth not to the length. But whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are drawne unto service, they wage forren for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And hereupon they have alwaies amongst them ten bands of <hi>Albanesses</hi> and <hi>Croatians:</hi> They keepe moreover in entertainment certaine Colonels of the <hi>Swisses</hi> and <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> with divers Captaines besides out of the State of the Church. In former times they have beene able to draw un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their service such a Potentate as a Duke of <hi>Vrbine,</hi> unto whom they committed the Lieutenancie and leading of their Armies, making as secure an use of his forces as of their owne.

                     <pb n="354" facs="tcp:6897:182"/>

                     </hi> fell to their shares, the greatest part whereof they inseffed to their private Gentlemen. The Citie of <hi>Constantinople</hi> it selfe remained to the Emperour, but not without a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable consideration made to the Seigniorie.</p>
                  <p>In the league made with <hi>Azzo Visconti</hi> and the <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> against <hi>Martin Scala,</hi> they possessed themselves of <hi>Trevegi, Bassane,</hi> and <hi>Castilbaldo.</hi> Being confederated with <hi>Mathias Corvinus</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>G. Scanderbeg</hi> Prince of <hi>Albania,</hi> they made head against the <hi>Ottoman</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. In another league contracted with the <hi>Florentines</hi> against the <hi>Visconti,</hi> they inlarged their Dominions within <hi>Lombardy.</hi> Lastly, in the confederation which they had with <hi>Francis</hi> the first, King of <hi>France,</hi> they re-entred upon <hi>Brescia</hi> and <hi>Verona.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With their Money they have also not a little advanced their affaires. Of <hi>Emanuel Paleologus</hi> they bought <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panto, Napoli,</hi> and <hi>Malvalia.</hi> Of <hi>George Belsichius</hi> they had the Towne of <hi>Scùtary</hi> in pawne of money lent him.</p>
                  <p>Neither have they beene wanting to helpe themselves with honourable pretences. In the warres which <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth, King of <hi>France,</hi> made upon <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> undertooke to stand Head and Protectors of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon liberty; and in that pretence made all <hi>Italy</hi> arme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
                  <p>And because indeed this State may, and is rightly held for one maine Fort of <hi>Italy,</hi> and Christendome beside, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Turkish invasions, therefore have they had also in their assistance from time to time the forces of the Church, and of the King of <hi>Spaine</hi>; of whom the danger hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies beene accounted common, and as neere unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                  <p>Now,<note place="margin">Forces at land.</note> on the firme land they have a continuall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of twenty and eight thousand Foot, with Captaines, Ensignes, and all other Officers inrolled and paid. They have besides to the number of foure thousand Musketeers,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:6897:182"/>
men well trained to that kind of Weapon. For which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions they have also their times of Musters yeerely; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to approve their experience, and partly to render such rewards as are due to the best deservers. Of this multitude and their valour, the battell fought at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> to the utter rowting of the Turkish Navie is a sufficient Testimony. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these, they maintaine six thousand men at Armes, well mannaged and appointed, the like whereof is not to be found in all <hi>Italy</hi> besides.</p>
                  <p>Touching their sea-forces, they have on the firme Land ten thousand men inrolled to serve at the Ore: And of these kind of Men, all <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Sclavonia</hi> doth yeeld them what numbers they will besides; and that at a reasonable hand.</p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Venice</hi> alone,<note place="margin">At Sea.</note> armeth upon occasion fifty Gallies, and <hi>Candy</hi> forty.</p>
                  <p>What their whole power and forces every way may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount unto, they shewed in the Warre of <hi>Ferrara:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they had on foot two severall Armies, one about <hi>Ferrara</hi>; the other on the Confines of <hi>Millan.</hi> They had at the same time besides two severall Navies; the one upon the <hi>Po,</hi> the other upon the sea, to observe the proceedings of <hi>Naples</hi>; and all this without associats. In the warre against <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, King of <hi>France,</hi> their Armie was composed of two thousand men at armes, three thousand light-horse, and thirty thousand foot. In the yeare 1570. they armed forth one hundred and fiftie lesser Gallies, eleven great Gallies, one Gallion, and twenty five tall ships: al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eit, that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber by occasion of Pestilence happening in the Navie, was reduced to one hundred and twenty, and seven lesser Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and fourteene ships, the other Vessels remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht; like as had befalne them before in the yeere 36. when as they had the name onely to make one part of three: but indeed they made a full halfe of all the Christian forces besides.</p>
                  <p>But because there is nothing that can give more certaine conjecture of the power of any State, than to have sustained
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:6897:183"/>
and gone through with great and perillous warres: it will not be unpleasant to set downe some of their most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant actions, which in that kind they have supported.</p>
                  <p>Anciently they had warre with the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and in that warre they discomfited <hi>Pepin</hi> sonne to <hi>Charlemagne.</hi> They warred afterward with the King of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and tooke from them the Townes which they now hold in <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia</hi> and <hi>Sclavonie.</hi> They fell at debate with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and gat from them the Cities of <hi>Salonich</hi> and of <hi>Moria.</hi> One the most dangerous warre that they ever had, was that which they managed with the <hi>Genois:</hi> and yet at length, such was the issue thereof, that howsoever having lost to the Enemy <hi>Chiozza,</hi> and were neere driven to their utter desolation, yet was the Enemy so far off from gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an intire victory upon them, that in the pursuit thereof, he most of all destroied himselfe: insomuch that having for maintenance of that warre engaged the Revenues of the State of Saint <hi>Georgo,</hi> so by little and little through feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse growing upon them, they were compelled to throw the City within the armes and protection sometimes of <hi>France,</hi> and sometimes of <hi>Millan</hi>; so that to this day they could never recover their pristinat fortunes.</p>
                  <p>Then had they to doe with the <hi>Visconti,</hi> Princes of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> who were at that time dreadfull thorow <hi>Italie:</hi> yet by that warre the <hi>Venetian</hi> not only gained profit, but honour also.</p>
                  <p>They opposed themselves against all the Princes of <hi>Italie</hi> in the prosecution of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and that with such successe, that in fine they annexed to their owne Dominion all the <hi>Polesine</hi> of <hi>Raviso.</hi> And after they had irritated the Princes of <hi>Italie,</hi> these letted not to draw upon themselves a warre, undertaken by all the Potentates of Christendome, combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against them in the confederation concluded at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray:</hi> which warre, as it was the most haplesse and despaire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that ever they managed, through the miscarriages of their Armies at <hi>Carravaggio,</hi> at <hi>Brescia,</hi> and at <hi>Vicenza</hi>; yet in the end they remained Lords still of their owne, and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:6897:183"/>
of being conquered, at last remained with Conquest.</p>
                  <p>They have for many ages together waged warre with the <hi>Turke,</hi> especially with <hi>Amurath</hi> the second; <hi>Mahomet</hi> the second; with <hi>Bajazeth</hi>; and with <hi>Selim</hi> the second. They maintained a sixteene yeares warres with <hi>Mahomet</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, even him which had the fortune to have subdued two Empires, <hi>Constantinople</hi> and <hi>Trapisond</hi>; to have destroyed twelve Kingdomes, and to have sacked two hundred Cities: Which warre they finished, although not altogether to their profit.</p>
                  <p>They held warres for seven yeares (without intermission) with all the Princes of Christendome, and went away win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: neither in all these occasions were they destitute either of men or money.</p>
                  <p>In our memorie they warred with <hi>Selim</hi> the second, and in that warre they disbursed above twelve millions of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The like excessive summes they spent in their warres with <hi>Michael,</hi> Emperour of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> in the enterprize of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and in the warre undertaken of the confederacie at <hi>Cambray.</hi> All which so inestimable summes notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at this day, whether they were parcels of their owne treasure, or lones of money from others, they have re-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursed or extinguished.</p>
                  <p>The Princes that border and confine upon the <hi>Venetian</hi> are these, the <hi>Turke,</hi> the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi>

                  <p>The State of these presents considered, the <hi>Venetian</hi> for that part of dominion that confineth upon the <hi>Turke,</hi> had never more cause to thinke himselfe better secured from violence, especially having all Maritime Townes both by Sea and Land gallantly fortified: which strength is also the greater, by the facility the Sea affordeth to succour his owne, and to distresse his enemie.</p>

                     </note> upon whom they doe bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as well in the <hi>Adriatique</hi> as in <hi>Lombardie,</hi> it is now more than threescore yeares that there hath beene any va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance at all befallen them. Neither in truth can it turne the <hi>Venetian</hi> to any great gaine, to have warre with so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a King; nor the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> to make warre in <hi>Italy,</hi> where by putting things in uprore and tumult, hee might perhaps hazzard some part of his owne. For that Warre (as <hi>Emanuel</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was wont to say) hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the nature of Dice, which no man knoweth how they will runne.</p>
                  <p>I may say as much of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi>

                  <p>Of the <hi>Church</hi> it were alike superfluous to speake, for that neither Saint <hi>Peter</hi> can make any excuse to make warre upon Saint <hi>Marke,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Pope.</note> nor will Saint <hi>Marke</hi> seeke to trouble Saint <hi>Peter</hi> unprovoked.</p>
                  <p>In summe, the <hi>Venetian</hi> hath two maine advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other Princes: The one is, that they have a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell that is immortall, the other, that the heart of the State
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:6897:184"/>
cannot be pierced unto by any enemie. And so conclude, that the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Venetian</hi> at this time are more potent, and of greater antiquity in <hi>Italy,</hi> than ever heretofore they have beene; not only for that the Pope hath a more ample Territory, and that but little incumbred with petty Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships; and that the <hi>Venetian</hi> hath his Dominion better fortified, and his Coffers fuller than in times past: but also in regard that the States of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Millan</hi> are in the hands of a Prince, absent and farre off, and therefore cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect to raise innovations.</p>

                  <p>The greatnesse likewise of the Lords of <hi>Lombardie</hi> hath bin a great furtherance thereto.

his sonne <hi>Amadeus</hi> the eighth, did the Emperour <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> advance <hi>Savoy</hi> to the title of a Dukedome: Him did the Councell of <hi>Basile</hi> choose to be Pope; which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards quit, to compound the schisme.

                  <p>Finally, this present Duke of <hi>Savoy, Charles Emmanuel,</hi> first got that Marquisate of <hi>Saluzzes</hi> intirely into his hands which <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> wrung from him, and made him release the County of <hi>Bresse</hi> to have <hi>Saluzzes</hi> againe. And thus by degrees and yeares came this Family to these possessions.

The to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall is five hundred thousand <hi>French</hi> crownes. What his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinaries may amount unto, cannot be knowne; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that in a few yeares he raised eleven millions of crownes out of <hi>Piedmont</hi> alone: So that we may well allow him one million of yearely commings in, one with another: out of which these summes are yearely issued upon certaine expences: Diet, wages, &amp;c. of the Dukes owne Court, threescore thousand crownes: Allowed to the Duchesse, twenty thousand: The Duke of <hi>Nemeurs</hi> (his kinsman) pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, fourteene thousand: Standing wages to Iudges, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, &amp;c. on both sides the Alpes, fourescore and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand: Vpon Embassadors, Intelligences, &amp;c. sixteene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand:

The totall is three hundred and eightie thousand <hi>French</hi> crownes. The rest goes into the Treasury. But in this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer account, the expences upon building and repairing of Forts is not reckoned, which must needs amount to a masse of money; seeing that no Prince of <hi>Europe</hi> in so little ground (unlesse those of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> perchance) hath so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fortified places, and few stronger in the world, either by Nature of Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their common treasury is maintained by the gifts of Princes, by the admissions of novices into their order, (each Knight pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an hundred and fifty crownes, and every Frier-servant an hundred at his first entrance;) and lastly, by the deaths of their brethren; for when any of the Fraternity dies, the whole order is heire, excepting onely of one fifth part.</p>
                  <p>These consist not so much in the number of the Knights,<note place="margin">Forces by land.</note> (for they are but five hundred upon the Iland at once, though the other five hundred are to come in upon sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons) as in their valour and resolution: the whole Iland may perchance make six or eight thousand men able to beare armes, and <hi>Goza</hi> the third part of that number.

the booty. The expeditions which they make are little better than for bootie, either in the night time landing on the maine of <hi>Africa,</hi> and surprizing some villages, or scowring along the coast, and taking small and weake barkes, out of which they take the men and goods, and turne the hulke adrift with wind and weather.</p>

                     </note> than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the premises; it may reasonably be demanded, what hath beene the cause that the <hi>Turke</hi> in an hundred and fifty yeeres space (about which time hee invaded that Country) hath not made an absolute conquest thereof: For having in this time not conquered above two third parts thereof, it is manifest that he must be defective in the meanes before spoken of, wherewith Princes augment their Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>(viz.)</hi> either in Treasure, Munition, Men, Armes, or (that which is principall) in judgement to embrace or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute occasions. For answer unto which, I say; first, that the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperour hath not only above these foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres beene superiour to the Kings of <hi>Hungarland</hi> in Treasure and Munition, but also to any other Prince in the world: so is hee likewise in number of his Captaines and private Souldiers; but borrowing a conjecture from the managing of his actions, it is manifest that his councell of war (schooled above in the barbarous service of <hi>Persia</hi>) hath ever beene inferiour to that of Christendome, as it is at this present. Secondly, the Emperour hath of late served him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in all his occasions of worthy Chieftaines, as <hi>Count Charles Maunsfielt,</hi> the Marquesse <hi>Sanseverino, Alexander Malospina, Francisco de Monte,</hi> the Baron <hi>Swarzenburg, George Basta, Ferrant di Rossi,</hi> &amp;c. All which, either by their experience in their Netherlandish warres, or diligence in Historie, or else paines in both, have long since obtained the names of great Souldiers; which providence of late times used by the Emperours, and heretofore by other Princes, hath in part prevented the <hi>Turkes</hi> designes in the intirenesse of this Conquest. Another hindrance hath beene the evill arming of the <hi>Turkish</hi> Souldiers, the greatest numbers whereof are naked: And which is as great a defect, none of them carry Weapons of much offence, except the <hi>Ianizars.</hi> who serve with Muskets of longer and bigger bore than
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:6897:198"/>
the Christians: To which number of <hi>Ianizars,</hi> being 2000. tripled, if 20000. Pikes compleat were added, they would make an Armie of greater consequence for the Conquest of this Kingdome (which is secured by passages) than doth the multitude of Horses in which the <hi>Turke</hi> putteth so great confidence.</p>
                  <p>I must also confesse, that the <hi>Turke</hi> in all his attempts against <hi>Hungarie</hi> hath used irreproveable judgement, in making no inrode into that Country, but when hee had peace with his Neighbours, and the Christians at division amongst themselves, atchieving by such providence infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite victory; So, if he had prosecuted the least advantage with constancy and celerity, befitting the occasions; the Conquest of <hi>Hungarland</hi> had beene finished many yeeres since. Of all negligences in this kinde, none hath beene of greater note than that of <hi>Mahomet</hi> the third, superiour in the battell of <hi>Kerestur</hi> in 96. by which victory, not <hi>Hungarie</hi> alone, but all <hi>Austria</hi> stood in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For the Christian Armie being irrecoverably over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and all the Townes disfurnished both of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants and Munition, there wanted nothing (in mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to the gaining of that Kingdome, but the speedy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of that absolute victory.</p>
                  <p>But whether with the learned wee may beleeve, that great Kingdomes have their periods, or that Greatnesse in it selfe produceth carelesnesse, whose true symptoms are pride, effeminacy, and corruption in Militarie Discipline: most certaine it is, that those Empires which formerly have fallen from their prime felicity, <hi>have generally decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the Alteration of their ancient Orders and pristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate vertues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor can it otherwise bee, but that as those Ordinances and Lawes which reason at first introduced, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence afterward approved, doe settle and fortifie States: so the manifest neglect of the same should make them weake againe and crazie.</p>
                  <p>Which being duly considered, a Prince ought not in any
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:6897:198"/>
thing to be more watchfull and vigorous, than to keepe in life those Lawes by which his State at first became to bee exalted to that height, wherein he found it at the decease of his Predecessor: for let him be assured, that the same are still, and shall be the foundations and <hi>Basis</hi> of future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Causes of greatnesse of Empires.</note> Herein the <hi>Ottomans</hi> have by two meanes especially ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced their power, &amp; have raised it to the height wherein we see it at this day. The one was their personall presence and travelling to the wars; the other, theirmaking of great warres, and fierce to effect, but short. Their perpetuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions produced many profitable effects; as first, that it kept in awe and attendance the great Servitors of the State: Secondly, that the <hi>Ianizars</hi> were thereby the better inured to obedience, patience, and practice of their Armes with the discipline of the field: Thirdly, it caused their whole forces intirely to attend them.</p>
                  <p>For better understanding whereof, it behoveth to know how that the Port (or Court) of the Great <hi>Turke,</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently wont to make twelve thousand <hi>Ianizars</hi> monthly paid, and that without faile. Now that number by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the warres of <hi>Hungarie</hi> is much increased, and their pay raised to five Aspers a day; to some, more in regard of desert.</p>
                  <p>Out of the number of these <hi>Ianizars</hi> are chosen two hundred, whose Office is to runne by the stirrup of the Prince, and three hundred Porters that receive twenty Aspers a day above their ordinary stipend: The Cavalry ariseth to a farre greater number. The <hi>Spahi</hi> are six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, marshalled in two troopes; whereof the one guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the right hand of the Prince, the other the left in all marches. Every one of these <hi>Spahi</hi> is bound to maintaine three or foure servants on Horsebacke for the warre: and these servants, either in valour or costlinesse of furniture, doe in little or nothing give place to their Lords. Their place of march is in reare of their Masters, but in distinct troopes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:6897:199"/>
Besides these troops doe march two other squadrons, consisting of a thousand horse apeece: The one is made of certaine select &amp; stalled persons, knowne for some one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther famous exploit. Into which troope doe also entersome <hi>Ianizars,</hi> and many servants, as well belonging to the Prince himselfe, as to other of his principall Ministers, that have approved themselves by some notable endevour, to be worthy and capable of that degree.</p>
                  <p>The other squadron is all of naturall <hi>Turks,</hi> recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that honour, for some superordinary skill at their weapon; for horsemanship, or some such like quality.</p>
                  <p>The souldiers of these two troopes are not tied to keepe above two servants mounted at the most. So that these foure squadrons (whereof we have spoken) doe make in all as good as forty thousand horse, all excellently furnished.</p>
                  <p>Besides these, there are also neere 20 thousand men that are servants and attendants upon the supreme Officers of the State; as Judges, Treasurers, Counsellors, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders. Amongst which, some there are that bring into the field two or three thousand apeece; all well armed, and in like livery, being indeed tied for every five Aspers, that they have of provision, to finde one horse-man. So that what for pompe, and what for their owne safety, in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion they doe set all their slaves being Renegadoes on horse-backe. What shall I say of the infinite number of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of Mules and Camels accompanying this Equipage? Of which sort <hi>Bajazet</hi> led into the field forty thousand, and <hi>Selim</hi> in the enterprise of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> one hundred and thirty thousand: This was the ancient proportion. Now all these forces (whereof I have spoken) from the Court doe accompany the Prince, setting forward to the warres. But if his Person move not, then doe these also stay idle at home, where the <hi>Ianizars</hi> (for their too much ease) doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fall into mutinies, and the great Bashaes busie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves about nothing, but to disgrace or overthrow one another through envie and ambition. Which is well wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed on the one side by the extreme rancors and partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:6897:199"/>
that boyle amongst them, and sometime breaketh forth; and on the other, by their immoderate affection and swelling into titular dignities, which of necessity cannot be avoided; for that as trees which are lesse fruitfull doe thrust forth most leaves &amp; branches, to cover therewith the defects of nature: So doe men (in whose minds desert and vertue is wanting) seeke nothing so much as with outward vanity of apparell, and shew of great descent to shadow their inward imperfections. Through which abuse, it is not possible to imagine unto what number the titularie Officers of that State are augmented. The <hi>Bashawes</hi> which in the flourishing dayes of this Empire were only two, one in <hi>Asia,</hi> the other in <hi>Europe,</hi> are now seven in <hi>Asia</hi> alone, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of <hi>Natolia, Caramania, Amasia, Anadule, Damascus,</hi> and <hi>Cairo</hi>; who doe sucke from the Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this is sprung from nothing else, but that upon opportunity of the Princes keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at home, the Ministers of the State, especially such as lie farthest off, have by little and little presumed to usurpe and arrogate to themselves more power and authority than was anciently belonging unto them. Besides which, the Prince by his personall intervention in all expeditions, became by his experience better acquainted with the condition of his Armies, made himselfe cunning in the causes that did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigour or corrupt his souldiers; so that by cherishing of the one, and redressing of the other, the discipline of the field was made more firme every day than other.</p>
                  <p>And in truth it can seeme to no man lesse than a very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle that in this house of the <hi>Ottomans</hi> should follow a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall succession of twelve Princes together, that have been all men of great action, and extreme Warriers.<note place="margin">Causes of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</note> But since the successours of <hi>Soliman</hi> have disused themselves from the field, and to be personally absent from the Warres, it is wonderfull againe to see, how much the power of that Empire is impaired.</p>
                  <p>The first that gave passage to this disorder was <hi>Soliman</hi> himselfe, who howbeit he were a Prince of excellent cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:6897:200"/>
and great sufficiencie for State; and not only did put his owne person into many and hazardous attempts, but also did leave his life in one of them (which was at the siege of <hi>Sigeth</hi>) yet did he suffer his Sonne <hi>Selim,</hi> to lie shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully rioting and consuming himselfe at Court. By which custome once taken, he never after his fathers time would abandon the City, but managed all his affaires abroad by his Captaines and Ministers.</p>
                  <p>The selfe-same course held <hi>Amurath</hi> also, <hi>Selims</hi> sonne; <hi>Mahomet</hi> indeed his son hath not wanted to shew both spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and valour enough by his personall going into <hi>Hungarie,</hi> and forcing of <hi>Agria.</hi> But for all that, whether through the indisposition of their own persons, or through the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deepe rooting of disorders growne in the Empire, he was neither able to recover the old reputation of his predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, nor to reforme the lost discipline of his souldiers.</p>
                  <p>Besides, since those times men are now weighed by the abundance of their fortunes, not of their vertues; who buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their greatnesse of the Prince, like Merchants, must make their profit of the people: which violent humor in the great Ones, hath bred disobedience in the inferiours. So that the Princes commandement is no more esteemed in any remote part, than it fitteth with the profit of him to whom it commeth. From hence have budded all these so great inconveniences.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Ianizars</hi> lying idle, and having nothing to doe, are swollen unto such insolence, that they make every thing lawfull for them (as it were) by prescription, nor forbearing to sacke and pillage the naturall Townes of the State, in stead of the enemies: yea, falling into further fury and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, they were (these few yeares passed) the causes that <hi>Amurath</hi> was forced at their instance, to behead his best beloved <hi>Bassa, Hebraim.</hi> In which mutinie they also fired above five thousand houses in <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And even the last day almost, at the importunate request of the <hi>Spahi,</hi> he was saine to behead his <hi>Capi Aga,</hi> who was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test personage for counsell, and the most deare Servitor he
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:6897:200"/>
had in Court. Albeit indeed his death was afterward reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably well revenged, with the heads of three of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall of the said seditious <hi>Spahi.</hi> And of late yeares they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to such an height of insolencie, as to murther their Emperour himselfe, because hee had a purpose to change their <hi>Militia,</hi> to correct the lazinesse and cowardise of those <hi>Ianizars,</hi> and to prove a Prince of activity.</p>
                  <p>And forasmuch as through the want of exercise of Armes, and imployment of the <hi>Ianizars,</hi> their valour also is much abated. For (contrary to their first institution) the <hi>Ianizars</hi> are now married, have families and trades in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> from which profit &amp; pleasure the Emperors will scarce ever againe be able to draw then to any hazardous, long, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren expedition; they will mutiny, and fire the Towne ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for recompence of such defaults, they have beene saine to increase their number from twelve, to twenty and nine thousand. Which number also being not able to bee made up of Christian children, and the <hi>Azamoglam</hi> of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> they have beene fame to supply it with <hi>Asians</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> contrary to the first and ancient ordinance of the <hi>Ianizars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither are lesse the inconveniences and mischiefes that doe arise from prolonging of warres; whereas by contrary usages, the <hi>Ottomans</hi> were wont to reape two notable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. One was, that by leading a full force into the field, whether they wanne any Towne, or had the better of a field: they evermore in the same instant oppressed their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries; and againe on the other side, by making speedy and short warres, they gave respit and leasure unto the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of those parts where their Armies lay, to repaire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves againe: unto which subjects otherwise the neerenesse of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Campe doth bring unrecoverable dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: for it is observed, that the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Prince never doth conquer so much of the enemies Country, but that he destroyeth more of his owne. Nor can they otherwise chuse, having no peaceable or orderly way of provision, but for want of necessaries they must make prey of all they can come by.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="392" facs="tcp:6897:201"/>
And the reason is, that because the vast extent of that Empire, and the distance of the frontier parts from the head, they are faine to march more upon their owne ground, than upon other mens. And they passe it not once, but twice: first, in setting forth, and againe in the retreit. Whereby the people, and especially the husbandmen, being pilled and spoiled of their substance, are consequently constrained to forsake their tenures, and to leave their land unmanured.</p>
                  <p>Another benefit which they received by making great, but short warres, was, that thereby they kept their owne souldiers in continuall practice and exercise of warre, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving their enemie so much breath as to doe the like. For as soone as any one exploit was ended, their order was suddenly to bring the adversary asleepe by negotiating of some truce or peace; that done, as suddenly they transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the warre upon another part and enemie, never giving time to their owne to lay downe, or to their neighbours to take up their weapons. With these practices they tooke from the <hi>Venetian Cyprus,</hi> and making peace with them, they presently transferred the warre into <hi>Africke,</hi> where they surprized <hi>Goletta</hi> and <hi>Tunis:</hi> and that warre being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, <hi>Amurath</hi> himselfe without intermission put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into the expedition of <hi>Persia.</hi> And this course is indeed in it selfe of so great consideration, that <hi>Lycurgus</hi> amongst the three Lawes only, which he left to the <hi>Spartan</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, left this for one: first, that they should use no written Lawes; secondly, that they should admit of no other architecture, but of such as might be performed with an Axe and a Saw; and lastly, that they should never fight twice together with one enemie.</p>
                  <p>In this point <hi>Philip</hi> the second amongst many other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours committed the greatest over-sight, in protracting the wars so many years in the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> For by meanes thereof the people of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland</hi> (who in former times had little or no experience in the warres) became one of the most warlike and souldier-like Nations of <hi>Europe.</hi> So <hi>Amurath,</hi> contrary to the custome of all his predecessors,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:6897:201"/>
made warre in <hi>Persia</hi> that lasted twenty two yeares or more. And albeit he tooke from the <hi>Persian</hi> at that time a good peece of his State, yet doe I not thinke, but that the losse thereby received did more than counterpoise the gaine, not so much by fight and fortune of the field, as by length and tediousnesse of the journies; wherein, partly through want and distresse of victuall, with other sinister accidents arising from the quality of those Countries, hee lost the flower and vigour of all his forces; namely, above two hundred thousand horse, and five hundred thousand men: leaving the Country besides so naked of Inhabitants, so poore and ruinous, that in one Province alone <hi>(Armenia) Osman Basha</hi> was forced to destroy and set fire on above two hundred thousand houses. Moreover, by occasion of so long a warre, not onely the <hi>Persians,</hi> but the <hi>Georgians,</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> also, betooke themselves to the exercise of Armes, and therein attained to such ability, that to this day they are ever and anon in tumult, and beginne to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver some of their losses. This was the true reason (as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) that induced <hi>Amurath</hi> and his Counsellours, distrusting the obedience of that people, (against the Turkish custome) there to erect many Citadels, as at <hi>Chars, Nassivan, Lori, Teflis,</hi> and at <hi>Tauris</hi>; whereinto they thrust great Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons: as namely, into that of <hi>Tauris</hi> eight thousand. The predecessors of <hi>Amurath,</hi> who reposed the maine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of their forces to consist in being Masters of the field, made no account of these holds; maintaining this rule; <hi>That who is strong in the field needeth not the assistance of Holds, and who will maintaine many fortresses garrisoned, can never be very strong in Campania.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From these and such like oversights, have arisen all the corruptions whereof I have spoken in this relation of the <hi>Turkish</hi> greatnesse. Whereby those Armies, which were wont to amount to two hundred thousand fighting men and upward; and their Navies accustomed to bee of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred saile and more, are now brought to a farre lesse recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: They are now come to fifty thousand, the proportion
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:6897:202"/>
that <hi>Hebraim</hi> brought with him not many yeares since into <hi>Hungarie:</hi> And to some thirty six Gallies, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, with which <hi>Cicola,</hi> Admirall of that Empire, came of late into the <hi>Levant</hi> Seas.</p>
                  <p>By which diminutions it hath fallen out, that a poore Prince of <hi>Transilvania</hi> durst meet <hi>Sinan Bassa,</hi> and fight with him; and that the <hi>Vayvod</hi> of <hi>Valachia</hi> durst also make him the like opposition.</p>
                  <p>So likewise I say, that this one Kingdome and one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth hath done more in abatement of the ambition, and checking the fortune of the <hi>Ottoman,</hi> than all Christian States have done all together: For where all the rest of the Princes bordering anciently upon them, were in short time devoured &amp; spoiled of their Estates; the <hi>Hungarian</hi> and the <hi>Venetian</hi> alone, have for the space of one hundred and fifty yeares and more, maintained themselves. And though both the one and the other have quitted unto the <hi>Ottoman</hi> some parts of their Territories, yet have they well warded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the residue; So that to speake truth, Christianity hath at this day no other frontier upon the <hi>Turke</hi> but what is theirs: which, how much it importeth; no man can rightly judge, who hath not by experience made triall, how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full the <hi>Ottoman</hi> power is to all those that dwell neere it. And howbeit in these later yeares, the <hi>Hungarian</hi> hath had in his favour the continuall supplies of <hi>Germanie,</hi> and the <hi>Venetian</hi> hath beene assisted by the association of the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet it is to be understood, that unlesse both those and these had had of their owne a sufficient bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of warre, the cold assistance of others would finally have helped their sudden necessities.</p>

miles <hi>English,</hi> and the breadth two hundred. The Ancients made it a part of <hi>Dacia</hi>; but the latter Writers from the lying of it beyond the woods, have called it <hi>Transylvania.</hi>

Thorow these woods and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines there be but eleven <hi>Avenues</hi> or entrances out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries into <hi>Transylvania.</hi> Tis inhabited by three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Nations; the <hi>Siculi</hi> which be the ancientest, the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and the <hi>Saxons.</hi> The Religions publikely profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed are three also: The <hi>Arrian,</hi> the <hi>Romish,</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed:</hi> and this last divided into the <hi>Lutheran</hi> and <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisticall.</hi> The <hi>Popish</hi> hath continued there of old. The <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> heresie was first brought in by <hi>Blandrata, Anno</hi> 1556. It chiefly infected the Towne of <hi>Clausenburg,</hi> where even at this day the <hi>Arrians</hi> have a populous College and a free Church, though by the religious diligence of <hi>Bethlen Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor</hi> scarce one fourth part of the City be now infected with this poyson. Both <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Arrians</hi> professe in great freedome; for that the Prince at his Inauguration is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes sworne to defend them, <hi>As members politike of the Kingdome.</hi> The <hi>Saxons</hi> use their own mother tongue, the rest speak the <hi>Hungarian.</hi> The number of <hi>Seven</hi> is much observed in <hi>Transilvania:</hi> for by this number is the whole Countrey variously divided. For first, both the <hi>Siculi</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> and each severally have divided their portions into seven Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries or Seats, the Shire-towne (as it were) being head of the Villages about it; to which Townes those of that division repaire for matter of Justice. Secondly, there bee seven ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall Townes, unto which the Villagers round about are to bring their Taxes and Tributes; where being received by Auditors and under-Treasurers, it is afterward returned into the grand Exchequer. Thirdly, over and above all these is the whole land of <hi>Transilvania</hi> divided into seven larger Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. First, <hi>Coloszien,</hi> whose Metropolis or chiefe City is <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senburg.</hi>
                     <pb n="396" facs="tcp:6897:203"/>
Secondly, <hi>Szolnok,</hi> whose chiefe Towne is <hi>Dees.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Dobocen-Landt.</hi> The fourth Countie hath <hi>Alba Iulia</hi> or <hi>Weisenburg</hi> for its chiefe, and that famous for the Residence and Palace of the Prince. The fifth is named <hi>Thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> from <hi>Thorda,</hi> its Metropolis. The sixth is <hi>Keokeollea,</hi> which takes name from the River <hi>Keokeolleo,</hi> and gives name to its chiefe Towne <hi>Keokeolleovar.</hi> The seventh and last Towne and County is <hi>Hungad,</hi> which gave birth and name to the famous Family of <hi>Hungades.</hi> Seven principall Cities it also hath: First, <hi>Hermanstadt,</hi> the ancient Metropolis of <hi>Transylvania.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Cronstat.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Szas.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Clausenburg.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>Bestereze.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>Sespurg.</hi> And seventhly, <hi>Medroish,</hi> in the middle of all the Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The whole Countrey is very fruitfull in one commoditie or other;<note place="margin">Riches.</note> Corne, Beeves, Muttons and Fish, Gods plentie; all cheape beyond imagination: a fat one being not worth above ten or twelve shillings <hi>English.</hi> So much Wine they have in some places, that at Vintage time it may be bought for an English farthing or halfe-peny a pinte. Very rich it is also underground; as in Salt-pits, Stone-quarries (whereof some be pretious) and mines both of Gold and Silver, Iron, Quick-silver, and other metals: So that nothing is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the life of man, either for nutriment or ornament; and (that which is part of a wonder also) though there be no where more store of money, yet be there no where mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner prizes for their commodities.</p>
                  <p>For proofe of this, at the election of <hi>Bethlen Gabor,</hi> there were an hundred measures of Wheat sold in <hi>Clausenburg</hi> Market, for one Rix Dollar: and few Gentlemen there be, who yearely reape not ten, twenty or thirty stacks of Wheat as big as houses, saith mine Author: Their droves and flocks be answerable also. This did <hi>Trajan</hi> expresse in his-Coine or <hi>Medaglia,</hi> which had the Image of <hi>Ceres</hi> on the Reverse, with this Motto, <hi>Abundantia Daciae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the Riches of the Countrey comes in the Revenue of the Prince.<note place="margin">Revenues.</note> This is raised first out of his own Crown-lands: the Tenants (it seemes) paying as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> so many Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:6897:203"/>
of victuals. So that one where or other in the Country, the Princes yearly parts come to a thousand mowes or stacks of wheat, foure thousand Beeves, and as many Horses hee hath still running, and of sheepe about thirty thousand. His second way of Revenues is by his Tenths out of the mines, &amp;c. whereof <hi>Transilvania</hi> hath three of Gold, two of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, with Quick-silver among; three of Iron, some of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Steele, and Antimony: Lastly, out of eight Salt-pits something comes to him also. The third way arises out of the yearely Tribute and ordinary impositions; besides his extraordinary Subsidies in times of warre. So that though we by reason of distance and information cannot certainly value his <hi>Entrada,</hi> yet verily hath it never beene read, that the Princes of <hi>Transilvania</hi> ever wanted either money or victuals for their Armies, either in warres offensive or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive.</p>
                  <p>The neighbours unto <hi>Transilvania</hi> bee the <hi>Moldavians</hi> and <hi>Walachians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Neighbours.</note> all three Confederates: who in a leaguer war have not only resisted the <hi>Turks,</hi> but freed their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of them; The <hi>Turke</hi> at this day being glad of a small Tribute for an acknowledgement from them; knowing, that if he should oppresse them, the Emperour would be glad to take them into his protection. His other neighbours be the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Russes</hi>; who being Boot-halers rather than Souldiers, he keeps them out of his Countrey by fortifying upon the eleven Gates or Passages. But the two neighbours most to be accounted of, are the <hi>Turke</hi> and the Emperour; able friends, but too mightie enemies for the <hi>Transilvanian</hi>: But this helpe he hath against them both; that if one proves his enemie, hee puts himselfe under the protection of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus <hi>Iohn Zepusio,</hi> beaten by <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> was restored by the Armes of <hi>Solyman:</hi> and <hi>Sigismund</hi> of <hi>Transilvania</hi> falling out with the <hi>Turkes,</hi> committed himselfe to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Rodulphus.</hi> Againe, for these last thirtie yeares, have three severall Princes of <hi>Transilvania</hi> thought it more ease and safetie to incline themselves unto the <hi>Turkish</hi> favour, than unto the Emperours.</p>

This is the native soile of our famous <hi>Gabriel Bethlen</hi>; who was here borne in a Mannor house of his owne, called <hi>Iktar:</hi> hereabouts also is the Seat of <hi>Kornis,</hi> the Family of his mother. A Country it is plentifull in Woods, Cattoll, Corne, Iron and Copper mines; and on the South part it reaches unto the Castle of <hi>Illyem,</hi> the Inheritance of his brother <hi>Stephan Bethlen:</hi> on another side touching upon the County of <hi>Torontali,</hi> which is under the <hi>Turke</hi>; who hath also incroached into a part of this Countrey. Here be the two strong Castles, <hi>Ieneo,</hi> and <hi>Baiom</hi>; this latter is built in the middest of a Lake, and is in the Maps falsly called <hi>Echyed.</hi> And those be the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> which lying neere to the <hi>Turke,</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Emperor, did for their owne safeguard, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily at first put themselves under the protection of <hi>Bethlen Gabor,</hi> whom with the <hi>Transilvanians</hi> they also elected for their Prince.</p>
                  <p>And now follow those seven Counties which the same Prince hath by the sword and conquest taken from the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Emperour, which lie next in situation unto those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.

The chiefe Towne gives name to the Shire; being a very strong one, and served by a most plentifull Country about it. The next Country so conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is <hi>Zabolczi:</hi> whose Burrough Towne is <hi>Debrecen,</hi> situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in a large and most fertile levell of an hundred English miles long and broad, and adorned with a goodly College of Students. This County from the Southerne parts of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia</hi> subject to the <hi>Turkes,</hi> reaches over the goodly River
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:6897:205"/>
                     <hi>Tibiscus,</hi> fifty English miles right out, ascending from the East to the South and West; in which parts be the townes and villages of the warlike <hi>Hayduks,</hi> so famous in the Turkish History; a free people they held themselves; all Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in service of no Lord, but of their Leaders in time of warres; and those are still of their owne Nation, yet all bound to serve in the Armies of the Prince of <hi>Transilvania.</hi> They live by their owne private Lawes, and are most stiffe for the <hi>Calvinist</hi> Religion.</p>
                  <p>Next come those Counties which lie in the midst of these aforenamed. The first of which is <hi>Bereghez,</hi> whose Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis is <hi>Berekszas:</hi> and this is the driest and barrennest Country of <hi>Hungaria.</hi> Here is the Fort of <hi>Echyed,</hi> so built in the midst of Lakes and Bogs, that there is no approach to be made within foure miles of it, either by horse or foot but by one bridge onely: This makes it have the name of the strongest peece of all <hi>Bethlen Gabors</hi> Dominions (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of the whole world) and therefore chosen by him to keepe the Crowne of <hi>Hungaria</hi> in, when he had it in his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody, <hi>Anno</hi> 1622.</p>
                  <p>All these three Countries aforesaid, conquered from the Emperour, together with these former which belong unto him by Election, lie situated in the forme of a ragged Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle, betwixt <hi>Transilvania</hi> and the River <hi>Tibiscus:</hi> the first line whereof is made up by the County <hi>Maramaros,</hi> out of which <hi>Tibiscus</hi> flowes originally.

                     <hi>Hommona,</hi> where the Iesuites have a College.</p>
                  <p>This Country touches upon <hi>Poland.</hi> The second of these conquered Counties (a member also of this latter) is called <hi>Zemlen,</hi> as its chiefe City also is. Its second City is <hi>Saros Patak,</hi> where the <hi>Palatine</hi> or <hi>Earle-marcher</hi> of that part of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> subject to <hi>Bethlen Gabor,</hi> usually keepes his resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Ennoblished it is besides with the greatest College belonging to the reformed Religion in all those parts: wherein (namely) are fourescore Fellowes, three hundred Schollars, a Master and foure Readers, all maintained by their owne setled Revenues like ours in <hi>England,</hi> and all planted in a dainty aire, a rich and most delicate Country. The third conquered County is <hi>Porsod,</hi> whose Metropolis is <hi>Tokay</hi> aforesaid; which with its Fort and Castle was in consideration of 60000. pounds rendred by the Emperour unto <hi>Bethlen Gabor</hi> in the yeare 1628. <hi>August</hi> the 10. which its new Lord hath since re-edified. This towne is overlookt by that which they call <hi>The golden Mountaine,</hi> three Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish miles in height, and seven in compasse, which beares a wine of a more delicate and rich race than the <hi>Canaries,</hi> and inestimable plenty too, here and all abouts the Country. This Country confronts upon the Turkish Territories; and beyond <hi>Rudabaneya</hi> in the west parts begins the dominion of the Emperour. The fourth of these Counties of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Tibiscus,</hi> and the utmost bounds of his conquests, is called <hi>Abavyvar</hi>; whose Metropolis is <hi>Cassovia,</hi> the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and richest of all those parts, and newly walled and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by the Conquerour. Inhabited it is by the <hi>Hungarian</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Nations, both of which here have their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Churches. Here likewise is a College, as there also bee at <hi>Geonez</hi> and <hi>Sepsi,</hi> two neighbour Cities. Here also is the Bishopricke of <hi>Lelesz,</hi> which being popish, was upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest delivered up unto the Emperours disposing in that late treaty of Pacification.</p>
                  <p>And these be the goodly dominions of <hi>Bethlen Gabor</hi> in <hi>Hungaria</hi>; which on the East are bounded with <hi>Transil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,</hi> on the West with the Turkish parts of <hi>Hungaria,</hi> on
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:6897:206"/>
the North with <hi>Poland,</hi> and on the South with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Heves, Torn,</hi> and <hi>Genevar,</hi> &amp;c. all subject to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. As for his two Dukedomes of <hi>Oppelen</hi> and <hi>Ratibor</hi> in <hi>Silesia,</hi> they being farre distant and chargeable to hold, hee made a faire surrender of them into the Emperours hands in that treaty of Peace concluded betwixt them, <hi>Anno</hi> 1624.</p>
                  <p>What Revenues and Certainties may bee raised from hence, is not to bee ghessed at in these troublesome times; in which seasons quiet possession is to bee accounted the chiefe part of the Revenues, seeing the subject is then rather to bee releeved than oppressed. The Forces which hee is able to raise from hence with his owne pay and money must needs be very great, seeing that with them hee hath not onely defended himselfe, and gained upon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, but so farre pressed upon him as to set so many townes on fire in <hi>Austria</hi> it selfe; that by the light of those Bonefires the Emperour might reade a Letter in his owne Bed-chamber in <hi>Vienna. Bethlen Gabor</hi> finally, both for his valour and fortune is more dreaded by the Emperour than any other Christian King or Potentate of <hi>Europe.</hi> And now for that this Prince hath so arrested the incroching greatnesse of the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> in those parts, that he may well be called, <hi>The scourge of the house of Austria:</hi> he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most mortally hated by all the Papists of Christendome, who are sottishly addicted unto that Family. Hence those scornes and slanders of him, that he was <hi>basely borne,</hi> that he was <hi>a Turke in Religion,</hi> yea <hi>Circumcised,</hi> and an hundred other <hi>Iesuiticall</hi> knaveries. And for that hee hath not still beene ready to doe as we would have him in <hi>England,</hi> since these infortunate warres of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> even we good Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants have thought that hee hath hitherto done nothing. To rehearse therefore what hee is, and how his time and Armes have beene imployed, may against these calumnies serve for a reall Apologie.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Gabriel Bethlen</hi> (whom we call <hi>Bethlen Gabor</hi>) now writing himselfe <hi>Prince of the Sacred Roman Empire, Lord
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:6897:207"/>
of some part of Hungaria, Duke of Oppelen and Ratibor,</hi> &amp;c. was about the yeare 1580. borne of an ancient Nobility; in his owne inheritance of <hi>Iktar</hi> aforesaid. His Fathers name was the Lord <hi>Wolfgang Bethlen</hi>; his Mother was descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded also of the house of <hi>Kornis,</hi> a Noble and an Ancient Sept or Tribe of the <hi>Sicali,</hi> which bee the eldest Inhabitants of <hi>Transilvania.</hi> His childhood was rather addicted to Armes than to Letters; &amp; his Tutor had much adoe in keeping him from his delight of riding the great horses, &amp;c. But com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to more maturity and discretion, he so well redeemed his time lost at schoole, that he attained to so much perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Latine tongue, as he was able <hi>extempore</hi> to answer the Emperours Ambassadours Oration in that language, <hi>Anno</hi> 1622. Being afterwards brought up in the Court of <hi>Stephan Bathori,</hi> Prince of <hi>Transilvania,</hi> (whose house in those dayes was a very schoole of military knowledge and exercises) he so approved himselfe to that judicious Prince, as he first of all made him a Captaine; and to be briefe, he was by the next Prince <hi>Stephan Boczkai</hi> made Generall of his Armies. This honour, and his fortunate management of it, obtained him a wife of the noble Family of the <hi>Caroli,</hi> by whom he had divers children, though now all deceased. Prince <hi>Boczkai</hi> dying, the next Prince <hi>Gabriel Bathori</hi> continued him likewise in his military honour aforesaid, swearing him also of his Privie Councell. But this double greatnesse made him envied of the Nobility; and this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing occasion rendred him hatefull to the Prince. It fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that in the yeare 1611. this <hi>Gabriel Bathori</hi> most unjust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bereaved the <hi>Saxon</hi> Nation of their chiefe City of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mansradt:</hi> whereupon complaint is made to the great <hi>Turke</hi> abroad, and at home that Nation makes choice of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and greatnesse of <hi>Bethlen Gabor</hi> to be their mediator to the Prince: Youthfull <hi>Bathori</hi> hereupon suspects him to be too popular, offers him both ill language and blowes to boot. <hi>Bethlen</hi> avoiding the Court escapes to <hi>Buda,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where hee was faine to stay two whole yeares. Meanes being made in the meane time for

the <hi>Saxons,</hi> they obtaine an Armie of the <hi>Turke,</hi> and request him to appoint <hi>Bethlen Gabor</hi> for his and their Generall. Thus in <hi>October</hi> 1613. is he called backe to redresse the wrongs offered by a hated Prince, and to releeve the miseries of his owne Countrie. So welcome he proves and so suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessefull, that the States and Chiefes, both of the <hi>Saxons</hi> and the <hi>Siculi,</hi> run amaine to <hi>Clausenburgh</hi>; in the chiefe Temple wherof they for three daies together hold a great Councell about the deposing of their Prince. Whereupon <hi>Bathori</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king shew freely to relinquish that which he could not hold, did with a loud voice (in the hearing of our Author then 15. years old, and a studient in the Towne) grant a free election; for himselfe professing in these very words; <hi>That whatsoever Prince this Kingdome of Transilvania shall make choice of, I</hi> (saith he) <hi>am ready also to acknowledge for my Prince, upon condition, that he exercises no tyranny upon the three Nations of the</hi> Siculi, Saxons, <hi>and</hi> Hungarians.

                  <p>For the most part <hi>Poland</hi> is a plaine Country, and but for certaine mountaines (rather hils than mountaines) situated in the lesser <hi>Poland,</hi> dividing it from <hi>Prusland,</hi> all the residue of the Countrey stretcheth it selfe into most ample plaines, wherein are very many woods, especially in <hi>Lituania.</hi> The greater and lesser <hi>Poland</hi> are better inhabited than any other Province of the Kingdome.

<pb n="413" facs="tcp:6897:211"/>
making his soveraignty but a slavish royalty.</p>
                  <p>These diminutions of Regality beganne first by default of King <hi>Lewis,</hi> and <hi>Iagello,</hi> who to gaine the succession in the Kingdome (contrary to the Lawes) one for his daughter, and the other for his sonne; departed with many of his Royalties and Prerogatives, to buy the voyces of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Whereupon by degrees the King of <hi>Poland</hi> (as <hi>Stani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaus Orichovius</hi> confesses) is little more than the <hi>Mouth of the Kingdome,</hi> which speakes not but what his Councell prompts him. The great Officer (whom they call the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of their liberty, and Guardian of it) is still joyned with the King, as it were to Tutor him, and to moderate his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. The power royall there, is no more but what King <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismund</hi> assumed in full Parliament at <hi>Petricovia, Anno</hi> 1548. which was to conclude nothing but by advice of his Councell. To give instances of the power of these great Counsellours; they made void the testament of King <hi>Casi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire:</hi> forbade King <hi>Iagello</hi> to warre upon the Knights <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitalers:</hi> unto whom in his expedition into <hi>Lituania</hi> they adjoyned the Bishop of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> limiting their King to doe nothing but with his approbation. <hi>Casimire</hi> the third had foure Commissioners joyned with him. Without their leaves the King cannot chuse his owne wife: for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son King <hi>Iagello</hi> was by them perpetually perplexed. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales (the supreme marke of Soveraignty) are not made to the King, but to the States. King <hi>Alexander, Anno</hi> 1504. was faine to remit the disposing of the publike treasure unto the Lord Treasurer: to which Officer <hi>Iagello, Anno</hi> 1422. could not but grant the royalty of coining monies also. Well therefore (as <hi>Cromerus</hi> reporteth) might Queene <hi>Christina</hi> complaine, That her Husband was but the shadow of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne. They have neither law nor statute, nor forme of government written, but (by custome from the death of one Prince to the election of another) the supreme authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in the Archbishop of <hi>Gesna,</hi> who is President of the Councell, appointeth the Diets, ruleth the Senate, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth the new elected King. Before King <hi>Stephen</hi> erected
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:6897:212"/>
new Bishops, Palatines, and Castellanes in <hi>Livonia,</hi> few other besides the Archbishop of <hi>Leopolis,</hi> and his thirteene Suffragans, eight and twenty Palatines, and thirty of the chiefest Castellanes were present at the election of the new King. They hold an assembly of the States every yeare, for two causes; the one, to administer Justice in Soveraigne causes; unto which are brought appeales from all the Judges of the Country: the other, to provide for the safety of the Common-weale against their next Enemies the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> who make often incursions upon them.</p>
                  <p>In the time of their Diets these men assemble in a place neere unto the Senate-house, where they chuse two Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shals, by whom (but with a tribune-like authority) they signifie unto the Councell what their requests are. Not long since their authority and reputation grew so mighty, that they now carry themselves as heads and Governours, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Officers &amp; Ministers of the publike decrees of the estates. One of the Councell, after the manner of <hi>Clodius,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused his Senators place to become one of these Officers. When a King is to be chosen, these men doe more and more limit his authority, not suffering it to stretch one jot farther than accustomed. But although the Crowne of <hi>Poland</hi> bee at the disposition of the Nobility, yet was it never heard that they rejected or overslipped the Kings successour, or transferred the Kingdome into any other line, more than once, when deposing <hi>Ladislaus,</hi> (whom notwithstanding they afterward restored) they elected <hi>Wenceslaus</hi> the <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian.</hi> Likewise, they have alwayes a regard to the Kings daughters, as of <hi>Hedwiga,</hi> married by them to <hi>Iagello,</hi> and in our times of <hi>Anne,</hi> given in marriage to King <hi>Stephen.</hi> It was no small cause of the advancement of <hi>Sigismund</hi> the third, to the Crowne of <hi>Polonia,</hi> that hee was the sonne of <hi>Katherine,</hi> sister to <hi>Sigismund</hi> the Emperour, and of the foresaid <hi>Anne.</hi> And although the Kingly authority bee elective, yet after he is chosen, his power is absolute in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things: As to call the Diets, to appoint the times and place at his pleasure; to chuse Lay Counsellours, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:6897:212"/>
the Bishops, and whom he will have to be of the Privie Councell; he is absolute disposer of the Revenue of the Crowne, &amp; Lord of those which hold of him immediate, but over the Tenants of the Nobility he hath no jurisdiction; he is absolute establisher of the decrees of the Diets, and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Judge of the Nobles in criminall causes; it is in his power to reward and advance whom pleaseth him; to speake in a word, such as is his valour, dexterity, and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, such is his power, authority, and government. As the <hi>Polanders</hi> say, the decrees of their King indure but three dayes, and they converse not with him as Cosins, as in <hi>France,</hi> but as Brethren. And as the King hath absolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them which immediately hold of him, so the Nobility dispose absolutely of their vassals, on every of whom they exercise more than Kingly authority, in manner as upon slaves. In establishing their Kingdome they have done one thing worthy the noting, which is, that as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> increast their Name and Dominion, by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Lawes and Honours of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the City of <hi>Rome</hi> to other Cities, yea, whole Provinces: so the Kings of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi> have inlarged, united, and strengthened their estate, by participating the privileges of the Polish Nobility to those Provinces, which either they have conquered by Armes, or otherwise purchased, gracing the Nobles thereof with favours equall to any bestowed on the Polish Nation. By this equallizing, King <hi>Ladislaus</hi> strongly united <hi>Russia</hi> and <hi>Podalia; Sigismund Augustus, Lituania: Stephen, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia:</hi> for respect in offices and promotions knitteth affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in peace and warre.</p>
                  <p>The force of this Kingdome (as of others) consisteth in graine, Coine, Foot-men, Horse-men, Armour,<note place="margin">Forces.</note> and Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Of graine we have spoken already. In coine it is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich: for excepting <hi>Danske,</hi> they have never a Mart-Towne worthy estimation; and the warres that are brought from <hi>Prussia</hi> and <hi>Livonia,</hi> doe not enrich the Kingdome with ready money; yea, they doe hardly suffice to barter with the English and Flemish for Cloth, Silks, or Woolls;
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:6897:213"/>
or with the Spanish, Portuguize and other Merchants, for Sugars, Spices, Fruits, and Malueseies. For when the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is not given to traffike, nor the Cities to buy and sell, nor the people to labour; and the Nobility is very gallant, prodigall in expences, spending more than their Revenues in diet and apparell, and the seasoning of their Viands, (for the Polanders use more Spices than any other Nation:) and their Wine, their Silke, &amp; the greatest part of their Woollen Cloth is brought from forren Nations, how can the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome be rich in Silver? For in transporting of much ware, and returning of little, consisteth the wealth of every domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; gathering together (by venting home-bred commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities) the come of forren Nations, and keeping it once brought in, from passing abroad. In this practice consisteth the wealth of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Millan:</hi> for <hi>Naples</hi> sendeth to Sea great store of Corne, Wine, Oyle, Silke, Woad, Horses, Fruits, and such like commodities, which bring in huge masses of forren coine: <hi>Millan</hi> supplieth the want of other Provinces, with Corne, Rice, Cloths, Iron-workes, wares of all sorts; and returneth little againe. If the Kingdome of <hi>Sicil</hi> were as well stored with manual workmanship, as it is provided with Corne, Sugar-canes, and Silke, no other Kingdome could compare with it.</p>
                  <p>To returne to <hi>Poland:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Riches.</note> notwithstanding, their riches are not so small as some say they are; for the Revenues of the Crowne raised of the Mines of Salt and Silver, amount yearely to 600000. Ducats. True it is, that <hi>Sigismund Augustus</hi> pawned part of these Revenues: and King <hi>Henry</hi> a moneth before his flight (to binde some part of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility unto him) sold unto them more than three hundred thousand Ducats of yearely rent. It is lawfull for the King by sales of escheats (falling to the Crowne) to purchase livings for himselfe, and of the said Revenues to retaine great portions to his proper use, and to spare his owne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences: for when the King with his Court <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the ordinary Revenues of <hi>Scotland, Naples,</hi> or <hi>Sardinia,</hi> exceed not yearely one hundred thousand Ducats, nor the Kingdome of <hi>Arragon</hi> to yeeld above one hundred thousand crownes every three yeares; cannot lightly esteeme of the Revenues of this Kingdome; yet the King might raise his Revenues to a higher reckoning, if he were lesse bountifull to his Palatines and Castellanes. For most commonly he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth on them two parts, and three parts; yea, now and then the whole profits arising in their governments. But in the time of warre (yet by the decree of the assemblies of the Kingdome) the King doth lay grievous impositions and taxes on the people, which are either levied of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, or of the excise of victuall: and these tallages have amounted to such a reckoning, that therewith King <hi>Stephen</hi> sustained the burthen of a most heavie three yeares warre against the great Duke of <hi>Moscovie:</hi> yea, the Gentlemen for defence of the Kingdome are bound to serve at their owne charges. These serve on Horse, some armed as our men at armes, some more light, some like the <hi>Tartars</hi>; And those they terme <hi>Cossaches,</hi> or Adventurers, trained up to steale, to depopulate, waste, and to turne all things up-side downe. These Gentlemen serve in the field gallantly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, attired in Cassocks and Hose shining with Gold and Silver, and a thousand other colours: they adorne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with plumes and feathers of Eagles, with the skinnes of Leopards and Beares, and with many Banners and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-coloured Ensignes. These and such like furnitures doe cause them to bee discerned of their fellowes, make them seeme terrible to their Enemies, and doe encourage their minds to fiercenesse and prowesse: Their Horse are but small, yet very nimble, and farre more couragious than the Dutch.</p>
                  <p>It is thought that upon necessity <hi>Poland</hi> is able to raise an hundred thousand horse,<note place="margin">Forces.</note> and <hi>Lituania</hi> seventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, but far inferiour in goodnesse to the Polish. They have so great trust in the great number of their horse, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fearing the power of any Enemies, they regard not
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:6897:214"/>
the building of Fortresses, but resolve that they are able to defend their Country, their Wives and Children, their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and goods, in the open field against any Prince what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; boasting, that in either chance of warre, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver turned their backes. <hi>Sigismund Augustus</hi> laboured, that in the Diets of the Kingdome, order might be taken for the fortifying of <hi>Cracovia,</hi> because of neighbour-hood of the Emperour: but he could never effect it, partly because it should not give their Kings opportunity of absolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and tyrannicall Emperie, partly because they thinke themselves by noble courage sufficiently able to defend the Kingdome. They have no infanterie; for all the people of the Kingdome are divided either into Merchants and Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers (which inhabit the Cities,) or labourers which live in the country, in such subjection as we spake of before: and this is the reason that the Gentlemen onely goe to the war, and will not in any case serve on foot; but alwaies when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion serveth, they doe give wages unto the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Hungarish</hi> footmen;<note place="margin">Infantery.</note> and of these King <hi>Stephen,</hi> in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into <hi>Livonia,</hi> entertained under his colours little lesse than 16000. to convey his great Ordnance: 1609. <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> being called into <hi>Moscovie</hi> by the treason of <hi>Sulskey,</hi> who had slaine <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Lord and Master in <hi>Mosco,</hi> departed from <hi>Cracovia</hi> with 30000. horse and 10000. foot, exceedingly well furnished and resolute: Wherein in truth consisteth the sole commendation of the <hi>Polish</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen. As for manners, for the most part they are discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and uncivill, a very murderous and wicked people, especially in their drunkennesse, and that towards strangers.</p>
                  <p>For Pioners they use the <hi>Tartars,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pioners.</note> and their owne unplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish people. The Kingdome is sufficiently furnished; stored with great Ordnance, and all furniture belonging thereto, of which it can suffer no manner of scarcitie: first, because the Gentlemen and Noblemen keepe many in their castles; next for the neighbour-hood of <hi>Germany,</hi> which is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rich in Metall to that use, and plentifull of Antificers to forge anything belonging thereunto. And though it is not
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:6897:214"/>
usuall to see many castles in <hi>Polonia,</hi> yet the Fortresses of <hi>Leopolis</hi> and <hi>Camentzie</hi> in <hi>Russia,</hi> the Castle of <hi>Cracovia</hi> in the lesse <hi>Poland, Polocensis</hi> on the Frontiers of <hi>Moscovia, Mariembourge,</hi> and some other Townes in <hi>Livonia,</hi> are peeces in truth of great strength.</p>
                  <p>These forces of <hi>Polonia</hi> (which wee have spoken of) are such in quantity and quality, that few Nations in <hi>Europe</hi> can equall them, none surpasse them: one thing they want, and that is Celeritie: For to the sure strengthening of every Kingdome foure things are required; that is to say, That their forces be of their owne subjects; That it be Populous, Valiant, and Quicke: their owne, because it is dangerous trusting to a stranger; Populous, because of re-enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after checkes or overthrowes; Valiant, because num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber without courage little availeth; yea, it bringeth forth confusion; And Quicke, that they may lightly move, and speedily be drawne whither necessitie enforceth. The last of these foure are <hi>Polacks</hi> especially want; that is, Celerity; occasioned two waies: First, for defect of absolute autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Prince, which is much checked by prolonging and adjourning of Parliaments, procured many times by the frowardnesse of the Nobilitie: And secondly, for want of ready money, and quicke levies thereof.</p>
                  <p>For the King hath no power to determine any thing; to denounce warre, to impose taxes, or to gather treasure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the consent of these Parliaments, and these Parliaments (where it is necessary that many be present) are like an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine made of many peeces, which (without losse of time) can neither easily be joyned, nor readily moved. For in warlike affaires, those Princes make best speed which are best able to command, and have most money in readinesse: otherwise, in appointing and ordering the Diets, and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing that the Actions may answer the Counsels; than in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting and in providing of money, there hapneth such losse of time, that little is left for the beginning of the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, much lesse to accomplish. Besides, the Barons and Nobles are at such charges, and tarry so long when they are
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:6897:215"/>
there, that at their departure they have little left to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine after-charges. It may be, that for the defence of the State, quicker and readier resolution would bee taken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the imminent danger fatall in generall. But for the conquest of any forren place, I beleeve they will alwaies proceed with like flownesse and irresolution; for the hope of good doth not so much move vs, as the feare of evill: Yet hath our age seene (in the reigne of <hi>Sigismund Augustus</hi>) the <hi>Moscovite</hi> to have conquered the Provinces of <hi>Moloch</hi> and <hi>Smolock,</hi> and that without resistance or revenge; a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize ill beseeming so great a King, and so mighty a State: as likewise hee invaded <hi>Livonia</hi> without impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which had shadowed it selfe under the protection of the said <hi>Sigismund.</hi> In the daies of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Anjow, Iohn</hi> Prince of <hi>Moldavia</hi> (even he that with an undaunted spirit and famous victory held warre against the Turke) was shamefully forsaken of them, contrary to the covenants of confederacy betweene him and this <hi>Sigismund</hi> concluded. So that we must needs confesse, that such as is the courage, valour, and reputation of the Prince; such is the resolution alacrity, and forces of the <hi>Polackes</hi>; of themselves populous, valiant, and couragious. <hi>Stephen Bathori</hi> had good testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hereof, in whose time <hi>Polonia</hi> not onely maintained the honour of a King, sufficient to defend it selfe from forren Armes, but also to make conquests of great matters from most potent Enemies. And seeing we have spoken of Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, a vertue most necessary for every State, it shall not bee amisse to speake of the causes thereof, which (as is afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) are two: (<hi>viz.</hi>) The reputation of the Prince, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it life; and store of Coine, which preserves it in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for wee have seene in mightiest Armies, the body by the slownesse of the head, to have spent the time most idly, and very famous victories for want of money (to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall motion to action) to have brought forth small or no effects. Besides the disposition of a Souldier is a great helpe hereunto: for no man can truly praise the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemian</hi> Foot-men for Celerity; but this commendation
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:6897:215"/>
without doubt is proper to the <hi>Italian, Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> not onely for that they are of better constitution of body, but for that (which in warre is all in all) they are better contented to live with a little: Though they want Coine they are not discouraged, neither wax sicke with fruits, if flesh be wanting; and happen what may, they lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and better can indure hardnesse and scarcitie. Their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding light armed, is of more execution than armed at all pieces, and their Argolitires more serviceable than Lanciers: for which cause the <hi>French</hi> also in their late broiles have quitted their Lances, wherein of old did consist the glory of their Armes, and now taken themselves to the Pistoll. But to what purpose they have thus done, let another dispute; for I say not, that a light armed man is absolutely to be preferred before a man at armes in chances of warre, but only affirme, that he is more active and more ready: yea, the goodnesse of the Horse is of great consequence.

Here likewise live the wilde Oxen, and the wilde Asse. The <hi>Adimain</hi> is like the Ramme, but in stature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling the Asse, with cares long and slagging.

There are a kinde of <hi>Lions,</hi> which in many places dare to adventure upon two hundred Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The <hi>Leopards</hi> are strong and cruell yet seldome hurt they men.

This beast will dig mens Carcases out of their graves and devoure them; towards all other Creatures he is harmelesse. The sorts of Apes are very diverse. Here liveth the Mus-cat and the wilde Conie.

                  <p>Now because the glory and Majesty of this Kingdome consisteth especially in the City of <hi>Fez</hi>; I thinke it not amisse to describe the situation thereof. It is divided in two parts, a little distant one from another, the one is called the old Town, the other the new. A little River likewise divideth the old Towne into two parts: the East part is called <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyda,</hi> containing foure thousand housholds: the West part is commonly called old <hi>Fez,</hi> and hath fourescore thousand and upward, standing not farre from the new <hi>Fez,</hi> which likewise hath eight thousand. Old <hi>Fez</hi> standeth partly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hils, partly on plaines, and hath in it fifty Mahumetan Temples of admirable largenesse. All of them have their fountaines and pillars of Alablaster and Jasper: Besides these, there are six hundred of a lesse sort: amongst which that which is commonly called <hi>Carucen</hi> is most beautifull, built in the heart of the City, and containing halfe a mile in compasse: In breadth it containeth seventeene Arches, in length an hundred and twenty, borne up by two thousand five hundred white marble pillars: under the chiefest Arch (where the Tribunall is kept) hangeth a most huge Lampe, incompassed with an hundred and ten lesser. Under the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arches hang very great Lamps, in each of which burne an hundred and fifty lights. They say in <hi>Fez</hi> that all these
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:6897:222"/>
Lamps were made of the Bels which the <hi>Arabians</hi> brought out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who not onely made prey of Bels, but of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes, Pillars, Brasse, Marble, and whatsoever was rich, first erected by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and afterwards by the <hi>Gothes.</hi> There are in <hi>Fez</hi> above two hundred Schooles, two hundred Innes, and foure hundred Water-mils, every one driven with foure or five wheeles. There are also divers Colleges, among which that which is called <hi>Madarac,</hi> is accounted for one of the most finest peeces of workmanship throughout all <hi>Barbarie.</hi> There is likewise 600. Conduits, from whence almost every house is served with water. It were a long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to describe their <hi>Burse,</hi> (they call it <hi>Alcacer</hi>) it is a place walled about, having twelve gates, and divided into fifteene walkes, where Merchants meet to dispatch their businesse under Tents. Their delightsome Gardens and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Parkes, with the Rillets and waters running thorow them, I can hardly describe.</p>
                  <p>For the most part the King keepeth his Court at <hi>Fez,</hi>

                  <p>For greatnesse and statelinesse thereof (by the grant of former Kings) it injoyeth this strange privilege;<note place="margin">Its privileges.</note> not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any siege, unlesse the Citizens shall thinke their Prince for strength and force able and equall to cope with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: if not, without reproach of treason they may yeeld their City before the enemie approach within halfe a mile of it. This have they done, that so goodly and so flourishing a City should not suffer spoile under pretext of unprofitable temporizing.</p>
                  <p>It is of no lesse moment for situation, store of Corne,<note place="margin">Plentie.</note> Oyle, Flax, and Cattell, than for pleasantnesse of territory, and plenty of Water.

This man deriving his pedigree from <hi>Mahumet,</hi> and emboldned by the civill warre of <hi>Africke,</hi> and the differences of the States and Common-weales thereof (wherein in those daies the <hi>Portugals</hi> were of no small puissance) began to dreame on the conquest of <hi>Mauritania Tingitana.</hi> Which the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to effect, he first sent his three sonnes <hi>Abdel, Abnet,</hi> and <hi>Mahumet</hi> on pilgrimage to <hi>Meca</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> to visit and worship the Sepulcher of their great Prophet <hi>Mahumet.</hi> The young men returned from their pilgrimage, with such opinion and estimation of holinesse and Religion, (if it bee lawfull to use these termes to so great impiety and foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie) that the Inhabitants as they travelled could hardly be kept from kissing their garments, and adoring them as Saints.</p>
                  <p>They againe, as men wrapt in deepe contemplation, jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied through the Provinces sighing and sobbing, and crying with a high voice, <hi>Ala, Ala.</hi> They had no other sustenance but the almes of the people. Their father received them with great joy and contentment, and perceiving the favour and opinion of the people not to bee like a nine dayes wonder, but to continue fresh and the same as at the first, resolved to
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:6897:223"/>
make use thereof, and thereupon sent two of them. <hi>Abnet</hi> and <hi>Mahumet</hi> to the Court at <hi>Fez.</hi> The King received them kindly, and made one of them President of the famous College of <hi>Amadorac,</hi> and the younger Tutor of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. In processe of time when they perceived the King to grace them, and the people to favour them, by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of their father, (taking occasion of the grievances which the <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Moores,</hi> serving under the <hi>Portugall</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, had done to the professors of their superstition) they desired leave of the King to display a Banner against the Christians, making him beleeve that they would easily draw the <hi>Portugal Moores</hi> to their partie, and so secure the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Sus, Hea, Deucala,</hi> and <hi>Maroch. Muly mazer</hi> the Kings brother resisted this petition, alleaging that if once under the shew of holinesse they grew to head, it would not afterwards lie in his power to suppresse them under his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: For warre makes men awlesse; victories insolent; popularity ambitious and studious of innovation. But the King, in whose heart their hypocriticall sanctimony had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a deepe impression, little regarding his brothers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, gaue them a Banner, a Drumme, and twenty horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to accompanie them, with Letters of credence to the Princes of <hi>Arabie,</hi> and Cities of <hi>Barbarie.</hi> In these begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings many things falling out to their honour and good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, they beganne to make incursions into <hi>Deucala,</hi> and the Countrey of <hi>Safi,</hi> ranging as farre as the promontory <hi>Aguer,</hi> then under the government of the <hi>Portugals:</hi> and perceiving themselves to be favoured, strong, and well fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, urged the people (who for the most part in those dayes lived in liberty) to aid those, which fought for their Law and Religion against the Christians, as likewise with willing mindes to give God his tithes, which they obtained of the people of <hi>Dara.</hi> Then by little and little they incroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched upon the territory of <hi>Taradant,</hi> (of which they made their Father Governour) and invaded <hi>Sus, Hia, Deucala,</hi> and the neighbouring places. They first seated themselves in <hi>Ted<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="438" facs="tcp:6897:224"/>
(but with the losse of their Brother) they defeated <hi>Lopes Barriga,</hi> a great Warriour, and Captaine generall of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall</hi> Armie. By flattering speeches they entred <hi>Marocho,</hi> poisoned the King, and proclaimed <hi>Amet-Xeriffe</hi> King of the Country. After this hapned the warre of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> of <hi>Deucala,</hi> and <hi>Xarquia,</hi> with the <hi>Arabians</hi> of <hi>Garbi,</hi> where while each party weakned other, and either promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to himselfe the favour and assistance of the <hi>Xeriffes:</hi> they turned their armes upon both factions, and carried rich preyes from both Nations. Before this warre they sent unto the King the fifth part of all their spoiles, but after this victory, little regarding their Soveraigne, they sent him onely six Horses, and six Camels, and those very leane and ill shapen. Which the King disdaining, sent to demand his fifths, and also the Tribute which the Kings of <hi>Marocho</hi> were accustomed to pay to him; which if they denied, hee vowed revenge with fire and sword. In the meane time the King died, and <hi>Amet</hi> his Sonne, once the pupill of the younger <hi>Xeriffe,</hi> not onely allowed, but also confirmed <hi>Amet</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Marocho</hi>; upon condition that in some things he should acknowledge the King of <hi>Fez</hi> to be his Lord paramount. To this the <hi>Xeriffes</hi> (whose power and estimation daily increased) when the day of paiment of the tribute came, willed the messenger to say unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that they were the lawfull successors of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> and therefore that they were bound to pay tribute to no Man; yea, that they had more right to <hi>Africke</hi> than he had: but if he would reckon them in the number of his friends, no doubt but it would turne to his good and honour, for if hee diverted them from the warre of the Christians, they would not leave him so much as a heart to defend himselfe.</p>
                  <p>The King taking this in ill part proclaimed warre against them, and besieged <hi>Marocho,</hi> but for that time was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to dislodge. Afterward returning with eighteene thousand Horse-men, and two thousand Harquebusiers to renew the siege; as soone as he had past the River, hee was overcome of the <hi>Xeriffs,</hi> who led an Armie of seven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:6897:224"/>
Horse, and one thousand two hundred shot. In the pride of this victory they exacted Tribute of this Province, and passing <hi>Atlas</hi> they tooke the famous City <hi>Tafilet,</hi> and partly by love, and partly by force compelled divers people of <hi>Numidia</hi> and the Mountaines to beare the yoke of their subjection. In the yeare 1536. the younger <hi>Xeriffe,</hi> which called himselfe King of <hi>Sus,</hi> gathering together a mighty Armie, with great store of Artillery, part whereof hee tooke from the King of <hi>Fez,</hi> and part whereof were cast by certaine Renegada <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> made a journey to <hi>Cape Aguer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This place is of great consequence, and possessed by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who built it and fortified it, first at the expences of <hi>Lopes Sequiera,</hi> and then at the charges of King <hi>Emanuel,</hi> after he understood of the commodious situation thereof. It was fiercely assaulted, and as valiantly defended, untill the fire beganne to take hold upon the Bulwarke, where their Gun-powder was stowed; with which misfortune the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies appointed for the defence of that quarter, growing fearefull and faint-hearted, gave way for the <hi>Xeriffe</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who made slaves of the greatest part of the defendants. After which victory, they subdued almost all <hi>Atlas,</hi> the Kingdome of <hi>Marocho,</hi> and the <hi>Arabians</hi> which were vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals to the Crowne of <hi>Portugal</hi>; the residue, as <hi>Safi, Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Arzil,</hi> and <hi>Aleazar</hi> (places situated upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coast of <hi>Mauritania</hi>) King <hi>Iohn</hi> the third perceiving the prose not to equalize the charge; voluntarily resigned.</p>
                  <p>These prosperous beginnings brought forth sowre ends; for the Brethren falling at discord, twice put their fortunes upon the hazard of a battell, twice the yonger overcame the elder, tooke him, and cast him into prison in the City <hi>Tafilet.</hi> Then turned he his Arms against the King of <hi>Fez,</hi> tooke him prisoner, and restored him to his liberty: but taking him againe, for breach of Covenants, deprived him and his Son of life and Kingdome.

recovered <hi>Tremissen,</hi> put the <hi>Xeriffe</hi> to flight, tooke <hi>Fez,</hi> and bestowed it with the Territory upon the Lord of <hi>Velez,</hi> who afterward in a battell against the <hi>Xeriffe,</hi> lost both life and Kingdome. At last, in his journey to <hi>Taradant,</hi> by the subordination of the Vice-Roy of <hi>Algier,</hi> he was murdered in his Tent by certaine <hi>Turkes,</hi> who with their Captaine <hi>Assen</hi> comming to <hi>Taradant,</hi> rifled the Kings Treasures, but were all slaine (except five) by the Inhabitants in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney homewards.

                  <p>Let this suffice for the originall of the <hi>Xeriffe:</hi> now let vs see how these risings were like the fortunes of <hi>Ismael</hi> King of <hi>Persia.</hi> Both of them in small time conquered many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces: both grew great by the ruine of their Neighbours: both suffered crosses by the armes of the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and to them lost part of their Dominions. <hi>Selim</hi> tooke from <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael Caramit,</hi> and divers other Cities of <hi>Mesopotamia.</hi> The Vice-Roy of <hi>Algier</hi> drove the <hi>Xeriffe</hi> from <hi>Tremissen</hi> and the adjacent Territory. <hi>Selim</hi> won <hi>Tauris,</hi> the chiefe seat of <hi>Persia,</hi> and then gave it over; <hi>Sal Aries</hi> tooke <hi>Fez,</hi> the head City of <hi>Mauritania,</hi> and left it.</p>
                  <p>This Potentate is absolute Lord of the bodies and goods of his Subjects;<note place="margin">His manner of government.</note> whatsoever imposition he layeth on them, they repine not thereat. For Tribute hee taketh the tenth, and the first fruits of their fruits and cattell: yet is it most true, that for first fruits he taketh not above one in twenty: and though it exceed that number, even to one hundred, yet he nevertaketh above two. Of every Acre of Land he taketh a ducat and the fifth part, and so much of every hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold, and so of every pole male and female above fifteene yeares of age yearely. If he want, he taketh a greater summe. To make the people more willing to pay what is imposed, he alwaies demandeth more than is paid, that so by paying their due, they may thinke they are well dealt withall, in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be forgiven somewhat of his full demand. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Mountaines, a savage people, for the difficult accesse unto them, hee cannot inforce to pay tribute, but
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:6897:225"/>
those that manure the plaines, hee constraineth to give the tenth of their harvest.</p>
                  <p>Besides these Revenues, he taketh Toll and Custome of all kindes of Merchandize in Cities: inward,<note place="margin">Revenues.</note> of a citizen two in the hundred, of a stranger ten. His rent of Mils is a great matter: for upon every Asse load of Graine grinded in <hi>Fez,</hi> he taketh halfe a reall: in this Towne there are above foure hundred Mils. The Church of <hi>Carruven</hi> was indowed with 80000. Ducats of yearely Revenue, the Colleges and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries of <hi>Fez</hi> with much more, which now are escheated into the Kings Coffers. Moreover he is heire to all the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (whom they call <hi>Alcaids</hi>) and hath the bestowing of all their Offices. When they die he seizeth upon all their Horses, Armour, Apparell, and all their other Chattels.

                  <p>Hee hath no Castles or peeces well fortified,<note place="margin">Forces.</note> but onely <hi>Aguer, Larach,</hi> (lately taken) and <hi>Tituan</hi> upon the Sea side. His chiefest confidence is in the valour of his Souldiers, especially his Horse-men, like the <hi>Turke</hi> and <hi>Persian.</hi> In this regard he taketh no great care to furnish himselfe with Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, yet hath he great store thereof in <hi>Fez, Marocho, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radant,</hi> and in the aforesaid haven Townes taken from the <hi>Portugals</hi> and others. As he seeth occasion he causeth new to be cast, for which service he can want no workmen out of <hi>Europe.</hi> In <hi>Marocho</hi> he hath an Arsenall, wherein he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up monethly at least forty six Quintals of Gun-powder: Here he causeth his Harquebushes and Bowes likewise to be made. In the yeare 1569. by fire which hapned among

                  <p>His souldiery is of divers sorts: the first consisteth of 2700. Horsemen, and 2000. Harquebushers, part lying in Garrison in <hi>Fez,</hi> and part in <hi>Maroc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o,</hi> where also lyeth the Court. The second consisteth (as a man may say) of a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all troope of 6000. horse, all Gentlemen Pensioners, and of great reputation. These ride upon brave Horses, with rich Caparisons, their Armes and Furniture shining with Gold, Silver, Stones, and all things else, which for variety of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, or rich devices, may delight the eye with a gallant shew, or feed the humour of the curious beholder. To these servitors, besides their allowance of Corne, Provender, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Flesh for themselves, their Wives, Children, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, they receive yearely from seventy, to one hundred ounces of Silver. The third sort are a kinde of <hi>Timariots:</hi> for the <hi>Xeriffe</hi> doth allot a certaine portion of Land and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to his Sonnes, Brethren, and Men of quality amongst the people of <hi>Africke</hi> and <hi>Arabia,</hi> for the maintenance of their degrees. Those whom they terme <hi>Alcaids,</hi> looke to the manuring of the fields, gather the rents of Corne, Rice, Oats, Oyle, Butter, Flesh, Poultry, and Mony, and distribute it monthly amongst the Souldiers, to every man according to his place. They likewise give them Linnen, Woollen, and Silke for their Garments: Armour and Horses for service. If their horses chance to be slaine, they give them new: so did the <hi>Romans</hi> to those which served on the horses of the State. The Commanders of these troops are very carefull to see their souldiers in heart and full of life, excellent well armed and competently attired. They receive betweene foure and twenty and thirty ounces of Silver yearely. The fourth sort make the <hi>Arabians,</hi> who commonly live in Tents, divided by 120. under their severall Leaders, to bee alwaies ready upon all occasions. They serve on Horse-backe, but more like Theeves and Out-lawes than Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. The fifth sort is like the presse of the Christian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weales. These companies consist of Citizens, Villagers,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:6897:226"/>
and Mountaine-people. Of these men the King maketh no reckoning, neither doth he willingly arme them, for feare of sedition and innovation, unlesse it be to war upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, wherein he cannot forbid them to serve. For upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the slaughter of the <hi>Moors</hi> by the Christians, spoken of in their Mahumeticall Legend, the more Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans they slay, the easier they thinke shall be their passage to Heaven: Hereupon you shall see herds of people running to this warre, desiring there to die upon hope of meriting salvation by the slaughter of our people. The same fury (be it spoken to our shame) inrageth the <hi>Turkes:</hi> especially for the propagation of their heresies, you shall see them more liker people running to the celebration of a mariage-feast, than to a war-journey; hardly induring to stay the limited time of the <hi>Randevou.</hi> They account them Saints which die with their weapons in their hands, and those most unhappie which depart this world amongst the teares of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the mournings of their wives.</p>
                  <p>By this, it may sufficiently appeare what forces the <hi>Xeriffe</hi> is able to bring to the field, but examples will make it more cleare. <hi>Muley Abdala</hi> beleagred <hi>Magazan</hi> with two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand men: He filled the ditch with a mount made of earth, and with his Ordnance beat the wall levell with the ground; but by the prowesse of the <hi>Portugal,</hi> and fury of their Miners, he was forced to raise his siege and depart. It is certaine, he is not able to hold any warre above three months, because the souldier liveth upon his daily allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Diet and Apparell: and when such like provisions cannot be conveyed to the place of necessitie, without great labour and hazard, it commeth oftentimes to passe, that for want of provision the armie is constrained to breake and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. <hi>Molucco</hi> King of <hi>Fez,</hi> who defeated <hi>Sebastian,</hi> had under his standard forty thousand Horse-men, and eight thousand hired foot-men; and with the <hi>Arabians</hi> and other common souldiers, it is thought that hee is able to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie seventie thousand horse, and a farre greater number of foot.</p>

They have Vines, but make no Wines, unlesse it be in the Kings Court, or the Patriarchs Palace, instead wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they brew a kinde of sharpe Beverage,-made of the fruit of <hi>Tamerind.</hi> The Orange, Limon and Cedar tree grow wilde. They make Oyle of a certaine fruit which they call <hi>Zava,</hi> it is of a good colour, but unsavoury. The Bees build their Hives even in their houses, whereupon ariseth a great quantitie of Wax and Honey. Their garments are woven of a Cotton-wooll. The richer sort are clothed in sheep-skins; the Gentlemen in cases of Lions, Tygers and Linces. Their riches consist in heards of Oxen, Goats, Sheepe, Mules, Asses and Camels. Of horses their breed is small, but they have great store of goodly Coursers brought them from <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Aegypt.</hi> They have Hens, Geese, wilde-swine, Harts, Goats and Hares, but no Conies; yea, and such Beasts, of which we have not the like; as Panthers, Lions, Elephants and Linces. To speake in a word: there is no Countrie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:6897:228"/>
heaven fitter for increase of Plants, and all living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but none lesse helpt by art or industry, for the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are idle and unthriftie. They have Flax, but make no cloth, they have Sugar-canes and Iron-mines, but know not the use of either, and as for Smiths they feare them as fiends. They have Rivers and streames, yet will not they take paines in droughts to cut the bankes to water their Tillage,-or hearten their grounds. Few give themselves to hunting or fishing, which causeth their fields to swarme with fowle and venison, and their Rivers with fish. But it seemeth, that the true ground of their idlenesse ariseth from their evill usage; for their poore people perceiving their Land-lords to pole and pill them, never sow more than they needs must. They keepe no method in their speeches, and to write a letter, many men (and that many dayes) must lay their wits together. At meales they neither use cloth, nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin nor tables. They are utterly ignorant in Physicke. The Gentlemen, Burgers, and Plebeians dwell apart, yet may any man rise to honour by vertue and prowesse. The first borne is heire to all, even to the uttermost farthing. Thorow the whole Land, there is not a Towne containing above six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred housholds, and but few of that quantity: For, for the most part they dwel dispersed in small Villages. They have no Castle or fortification, in imitation of the <hi>Spartans,</hi> maintaining that a Countrey ought to be defended by the Sword, and not by strength of earth or stone. They barter one thing for another, and to make reckonings even, they supply the want with Corne and Salt. For Pepper, Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, Myrrh and Salt, they give Gold, and that by weight, as for Silver it is in little request. The greatest concourse of people is about the Kings Court, which never stayeth long in one place, but is ever in progresse, sometime in one place, sometime in another, and ever in the open fields, under Tents and Pavillions. It is said to containe ten miles in circuit. His government is tyrannicall; for he intreateth his Vassals, rich and poore, more liker slaves than subjects: which to doe with the greater safetie, he carrieth himselfe amongst them
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:6897:228"/>
with a holy and Saint-like adoration: for at his bare name they bow their bodies, and touch the earth with their hands. They reverence his Pavillion, yea though he be absent.</p>
                  <p>In old times they were accustomed to shew themselves to the people but once in three years,<note place="margin">State.</note> but since they are growne lesse Majesticall, shewing themselves thrice in one yeare; to wit, on <hi>Christmas-day,</hi> on <hi>Easter-day,</hi> and on <hi>Holy-Rood-day</hi>; yea and in these times, the Kings, which now reigne, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more gracious. When any matter is committed in the Princes name to any man, hee is to attend his Commission starke naked to the middle. Being called to witnesse a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in controversie, they hardly speake truth, unlesse they sweare by the life of the King. Hee giveth and taketh, to whom, and from whom he pleaseth, neither dare he, from whom he taketh, for his life make shew of a discontented countenance. He presenteth to holy Orders, and disposeth at his good pleasure of the goods of the Spiritualtie, as well as of the Laitie. In travelling, he rideth shadowed with red Curtaines, high and deepe, incompassing him round about.</p>
                  <p>He weareth on his head a Crowne, the one halfe wrought with Gold: and the other of Silver, in his hand he beareth a Silver Crucifix. He covereth his face with a peece of wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet Taftata, which more or lesse he lifteth up and putteth downe according as hee is minded to grace him with whom he talketh. Sometimes he sheweth his whole legge, lifting it without the hangings, then may no man approach but by degrees, and after many courtesies, and divers messages pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to and fro. No man hath vassals but the King, to whom once a yeare they doe homage, and protest obedience as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to their Liege Soveraigne. Hee derived his pedegree from <hi>Milech</hi> the sonne of <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Saba.</hi> In the reigne of <hi>Candaces,</hi> they received the Christian Faith: and about that time, one <hi>Gasparis</hi> became famous in <hi>Aethiopia</hi>; from whom after thirteene generations, descended that <hi>Iohn,</hi> who first tooke upon him the Surname of <hi>Sanctus,</hi> and left it an hereditary Title to his house and successours.</p>
                  <p>This man having no issue of his body, about the time of
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:6897:229"/>
                     <hi>Constantine,</hi> gave the Kingdome to the eldest sonne of his brother <hi>Caius,</hi> and invested the younger (<hi>Balthasar</hi> and <hi>Melchior</hi>) the one with the Kingdome of <hi>Fatigar,</hi> the other with the Kingdome of <hi>Goiam</hi>; and so divided the bloud royall into three Families, the <hi>Gaspars, Balthasars,</hi> and <hi>Melchiors.</hi> To avoid sedition and innovation, hee made a Law, that the sonnes, brethren, and neerest kindred of the Emperour should be kept and shut up in the Castle of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mara,</hi> and that they should neither succeed in the Empire, nor enjoy any honourable estate, for which cause the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours ever since have seldome married. He manureth his Domaines with his owne slaves and Cattell; who by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they are suffered to marrie, and their issues remaine in the same estate of villenage, as doe their Fathers; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease to infinite multitudes. Every man that hath any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance doth likewise pay tribute, some Horses, some Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, others Gold, Cotton-wooll, or such like. It is thought that he is Lord of infinite Treasures, and to have store of houses full of Cloth, Jewels, and Gold. In his Letters to the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> upon condition that he would wage war against the Infidels, he offered him a Million of Gold, and a Million of men, with provision according. He is reported to lay up yearely in the Castle of <hi>Amara</hi> three Millions of Gold. And true it is, that before the dayes of King <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> he did hoord up great store of Gold in rude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought Masses; but no such quantity as is spoken, because they know not how to refine it.<note place="margin">Revenue.</note> His Revenues are of three sorts: the first ariseth of his Crowne-land; the second of the Taxes of his people, who pay every man by house some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, besides the tenth of all that is digged out of their Mines: the third he levieth of the great Lords, and they give him the Revenue of any one of their Townes (which he will chuse,) so he chuse not that wherein themselves inhabit. And albeit the Prince be very rich, yet the people are idle and beggarly: partly because they are intreated as slaves, which usage taketh from any people that courage &amp; alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of spirit which should be in men professing armes, and
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:6897:229"/>
undergoing dangers; and partly because in respect of that base bond of servile fidelity, wherewith they are over-awed to his Majesty, they perceive their hands are fast bound, through feare whereof, they have no other weapon fit for service, than a rusty head-peece, a Scull or Curasse, which the <hi>Portugals</hi> have brought thither. So that having neither fortresse to slie unto, nor weapons to repulse wrongs; their Villages and substance lie alwayes open to the prey and spoile of whosoever will invade them. Their offensive wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons are certaine darts, and arrowes without feathers. They observe a Lent of fifty dayes, which by reason of their true (or rather superstitious) abstinence, doth bring their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies so weake and low, that for many dayes after they are not able to gather strength to move themselves from one place to another. At which time the <hi>Moores</hi> watching op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, invading their Dominions, carry away men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and wealth. <hi>Francis Alvarez</hi> writeth, that he is able to bring into the field an hundred thousand men: but expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath manifested, that even in his extremities, his numbers were far inferior to that reckoning. He hath Knights of an order dedicated to the protecton of S. <hi>Anthony.</hi> Every Gentleman Father of three sons (except the eldest) is bound to give one to the service of the King; out of these are chosen twelve thousand Horsemen for the guard of his person. Their vow and oath is to defend the bounds of the Empire, and to fight against the enemies of the Christian Faith.</p>

It is plaine, sandy, and low Land without Mountaines, which is the reason that it cannot be seene afar off: the aire is hot and infectious; and therefore either to avoid or mollifie the intolerable heat of Summer Sunne, the Inhabitants are accustomed in all their Cities upon the tops of their Houses to build open Tarases, to let the wind drive in thorow all their roomes. Yet is not this Country as the rest of <hi>Africke,</hi> infested with the Southerne winds ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of heat; but is especially refreshed with the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne, which here is moist, and in other places drie. It hath no Earth-quakes nor showres, but of very able fertility; and if it raine (as it seldome doth) it bringeth many diseases, as Murres, Catars, Agues, and such like.</p>
                  <p>The inundation of <hi>Nilus</hi> is mother of all fertility,<note place="margin">Fertility.</note> the want thereof an assured prediction of famine and scarcitie.

                  <p>Howbeit it cannot be but at this day very great, for that in feare of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Fleet, the grand Seigniour dare not commit the treasure thereof to the passage by Sea; but is at charges every yeare to transport it over land by a convoy of <hi>Ianizars.</hi>

                  <p>Besides wilde Beasts and harmefull in abundance, it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth infinite store of tame cattell, as the Buffall, the Oxe, Camell, the Horse, the Asse, the Ramme, and the Goat.

                  <p>And for that the Winter is very pleasant, and the soile moorish, it is no lesse stored with Fowle, especially with Storkes, who for their infinite abundance (especially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Nile</hi>) a man would imagine the fields to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with white: But as these flockes of Birds are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, no lesse noisome are their swarmes of Frogs.

                  <p>This seemeth most incredible to me, (if it bee true as some write) that <hi>Plescovia,</hi> when King <hi>Stephen</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged it, had within it fifty thousand foot-men, and seven thousand Horse. Truly this is a great number, and though they were not all <hi>Moscovites,</hi> yet this reckoning asketh a great proportion of Inhabitants; For if the King thrust in fifty seven thousand fighting men, it must needs be that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were very many moe. Some will have it, that in times past the Country was better replenished with people, and that afterwards it became desolate for three causes: the first was the Plague (a new disease in <hi>Moscovie</hi>) which gleaned away many thousand soules: the second, the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of their Emperours, who have put infinite numbers to death, especially of the Nobility: the third the Incursions and robberies of the <hi>Tartars, Precopians,</hi> and the <hi>Nagayans,</hi> which never cease vexing their bordering neighbours. For the nature of these roguish <hi>Tartars</hi> is, to make spoile of all men, and to captivate their bodies, selling them to the <hi>Turkes</hi> and other Nations. By reason whereof, many farre removed Provinces (partly upon feare, and partly upon po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie) are suffered to lie waste and unmanured. And this is all the good which ambitious Princes gaine by their undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet invasions of their neighbours, to the destruction of their people, and their owne vexation.</p>
                  <p>No Prince made longer journeyes and greater expences than the great Duke <hi>Iohn:</hi> he vanquished the Kingdomes of <hi>Casan</hi> to <hi>Volga,</hi> and <hi>Astrachan</hi> on the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea; he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:6897:238"/>
a great part of <hi>Livonia.</hi> But what honour, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or what continuance of security gained he by these vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories? What was the end of this warre? In those expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions perished infinite numbers of men, in journeying, in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, with the Sword, with sicknesse, with hunger, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extremities. When he had overcome them, he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to keepe great Garrisons; yea, to bring thither whole Colonies. Besides, when men were so farre from home, either busied in getting other mens goods, or in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping what they had got, their wives stayed at home like widdowes, and the inward part of the Realme remained empty, as a heart void of bloud, wanting his necessary nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, whilst the Inhabitants were wasted on the skirts of the Kingdome. And therefore when it was invaded by King <hi>Stephen</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> these remote forces were wanting to make resistance; and through this oversight he lost againe <hi>Pozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> and other peeces of good reckoning; yea, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to leave the whole possession of <hi>Livonia</hi> to the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi>

it is a very pleasant and fruitfull Countrey, yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Pasture and Corne, with Wood and Water in great store and plenty.

                  <p>The Countrey differeth very much from it selfe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the yeare; so that a man would marvell to see the great alteration and difference betwixt Winter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

And this continueth commonly five moneths, (<hi>viz.</hi>) from the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> till towards the end of <hi>March,</hi> about which time the snow beginneth to melt. The sharpnesse whereof you may judge by this: for that water dropped downe (or cast up into the aire) congealeth into Ice before it come to the ground. In extremity of weather, if you hold a pewter dish or a pot in your hand, or any other metall (except in some chamber where their warme Stoves be) your fingers will freeze fast to it, and draw off the skin at parting: when you passe out of a warme roome into a cold, you shall sensibly feele your breath to wax thick and stifling with the cold as you draw it in and out: Divers, not onely that travell abroad, but in the very markets and streets of their Townes, are monstrously pinched, yea, killed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; so that you shall see many drop downe in the streets, many travellers brought into the Townes, sitting dead and stiffe in their sleds. And yet in Summer-time you shall see such a new hue and face of a Countrey, the Woods so fresh and so sweet, the Pastures and Meddowes so greene and well growne, (and that upon the sudden) with such variety of flowers, and such melody of Birds (especially of Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales) that a man shall not lightly travell in a more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santer

Countrey. Which fresh and speedy growth of the Spring, seemeth to proceed from the benefit of the Snow; which all the Winter time being spread over the whole Countrey, as a white robe, keepeth it warme from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of the frost; and in the Spring-time, when the weather waxeth warme, and the Sunne dissolveth it into water, it doth so throughly drench and soke the ground (being of a sleight and sandy mould) and then shineth so hotly upon it againe, that it even forceth the Herbs and Plants to shoot forth in great plenty and variety, and that in short time. As the Winter season in these Regions exceedeth in cold; so likewise I may say, that the Summer inclineth to overmuch heat, especially in the moneths of <hi>Iune, Iuly,</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> being accounted the three chiefest moneths of burning heat in those places, much warmer than the Summer in <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>To returne to our relation of the soyle and climate; for the most part it is covered with Woods and Lakes: these Woods are the branches of <hi>Hircinia,</hi> spreading it selfe through all the North, and perhaps more in this Province than in any other. Here grow the goodliest and tallest trees of the world, thorow which for their thicknesse, the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Sun-beames can hardly pierce. An unspeakable quantity of Rozin and Pitch distilleth out of these trees, and here is the never-wasting Fountaine of Wax and Hony. For without any industry of man, the Bees themselves build their Hives in the Barks and hollownesse of trees. Here is all plenty of Cattell and wilde Beasts: Beares, Martins, Beasts called <hi>Zibellini,</hi> Wolves and blacke Foxes, whose skins doe beare highprices. Of the timber of these trees a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>re squared all necessaries, aswell for buildings, as all other uses; the Wals of the Cities are framed of beames cut foure-square, fastned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, filling all the chinks &amp; vacant places with earth. And of these beames likewise they build platformes of such height and thicknesse, that they beare the weight of great Ordnance how massie soever. They are subject to fire, but not easily shaken with the fury of battery.</p>

Rivers and Lakes: witnesse <hi>Duyna, Boristhenes, Volga, Duyna, Onega, Moscua, Volisca,</hi> and the famous <hi>Tanais</hi>; the Lakes of <hi>Ina,</hi> upon which standeth the great <hi>Novograde, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luppo,</hi> and many others. The abundance of these Waters doe make the ayre colder than is requisite for the increase of Cattell, or growth of Plants, and although cold is thought more wholsome than heat, yet are their Cattell of small growth thereby, and many times their fruits come not to ripening; and the earth being drowned with the waters, for the most part becommeth light and sandie, and then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with too great drought, or too much moisture, it destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the fruit. Winter in some sort lasteth nine moneths, little more or lesse, &amp; in seasonable times the soyle bringeth forth plenty of graine, and feeding for Cattell. It also bringeth forth Apples, Nuts, and Filberds: other kinds of fruits they scarcely know. Of Fish they raise their greatest gaine, as having greatest abundance of that commodity; they dry them in the frost and wind, as in <hi>Norway</hi> and other Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Nations, and they lay it up for store, as well in their Townes of Warre, as for their private Families. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not full of Merchants, because by nature the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are idle: And that Province cannot abound with Merchants, where Arts and Artificers are not favoured. And againe, the government is absolute, mixed with a kind of tyranny, enforcing slavish prostitution. So that in the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest and best ordered Townes of <hi>Novograde</hi> and <hi>Mosco,</hi> many strange and fearefull concussions have beene practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Concerning which you have whole Commentaries, from whence you may take notice, how he once nailed an Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours Hat to his head, because he abated him of that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence appropriate to so great a Majesty; How Sir <hi>Tho.

They have not the use of the
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:6897:240"/>
Sea, because it is not lawfull for a <hi>Moscovite</hi> to travell out of his Princes Dominions: such, and such store of wares as they have (as Skinnes, Rosin, and Wax) they barter for Cloth, and divers other commodities, which the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> bring to <hi>Astrachan</hi> by the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, and the <hi>English</hi> to Saint <hi>Nicholas</hi> by the Bay of <hi>Graduicum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Government is more tyrannicall than of any other Prince in the World:<note place="margin">Forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> for he is absolute Lord and disposer of the bodies and goods of his subjects. Therefore <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> the Visier was wont to say, That the <hi>Moscovite</hi> and the great <hi>Turke,</hi> amongst all the Princes of the earth were only Lords of their owne Dominions, and in that regard thought the journey of King <hi>Stephen</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> would prove full of danger and difficulty. The Kingdome is divided into foure parts (by them termed <hi>Chetferds</hi>) &amp; those governed by foure Lieutenants, not resident upon their charges, but attending on the Emperours person wheresoever he goeth; and there holding their Courts, but especially at <hi>Mosco,</hi> the prime seat of the Empire; where from their under-Deputies they receive the complaints of the Provinces, and informe the Kings Councell of the businesse, and from them againe receive instructions for amendment or reformation. For you must note, that the great <hi>Duke</hi> doth not trust any particular Nobleman with any eminent place of honour or dignitie; but placeth therein a certaine Duke of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest ranke, and no great capacitie, adjoyning with him in commission a Secretary to assist him, or to speake more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, to direct him; for in execution the Secretary doth all. And being thus united, they have authority over all persons in criminall and civill causes, in levying of Taxes and Subsidies, in mustring of Souldiers, and commanding them to all services imposed by the Emperour or his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. And to prevent all popular Innovations, he will be sure that they shall neither bee borne within the territories of their Government, neither that they possesse one foot of inheritance within their jurisdictions: And being every yeare subject to change (of which hee will not faile) for
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:6897:241"/>
their new avarice, they stand assured first to bee extremely hated of the people, and worse used of the Emperour: For few of them have the favour to avoid the Pudkey (or whip) when their time is expired: and therefore doe make full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as they cannot otherwise chuse, being to bribe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, the Lieutenant of the Chetfird, and to provide for themselves, having in allowance, the best, not above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred markes; the worst, but thirty <hi>per annum.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fuan Vasilowie</hi> shall be an example of this severity: who having before him a Diak (or Secretary) accused for taking a Goose ready dressed, stuft full of silver by way of a bribe, caused the offender to be brought into the Market place of <hi>Mosco,</hi> &amp; there himselfe, making an honest Oration unto the people, asked his Polachies or Executioner, Who could cut up a Goose? And then commanded he one of them first to cut off the parties legs, about the midst of the shins, then his armes above his elbowes; (still asking the miserable offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, If Goose-flesh were good meat) in the end to chop off his head, in similitude of a Goose ready dressed.</p>
                  <p>But in the foure Townes, whereof three border upon the <hi>Polonian</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the other upon the <hi>Chrim Tartar, (viz.) Smolonsko, Vobsko, Novograd</hi> and <hi>Cazan,</hi> he is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more advised and honourable. For being peeces of great import, in them he appointeth men of more sufficient and better ranke, two in each Towne, whereof one is ever of his Councell of Estate. These have larger commission, and without adjournment or appeale may proceed to execution in all criminall causes; yet are they changed every yeare, and have for their allowance, some seven hundred rubbles, and some foure hundred.</p>
                  <p>To preserve his Majesty and reputation, he useth as incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible policy, as hee doth unusuall severitie: First, it is not lawfull for any of his subjects to depart the Realme upon paine of death; and therefore no man there dare goe to Sea, no, not speake to an Ambassadour, or use the counsell of a forren Physician, without licence. He weareth apparell of inestimable value, joyning the Ornaments of a Bishop to

the Majestie of a King; by wearing a Miter on his head, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with Diamonds and rich stones: When he weareth it not on his head, he placeth it before his Chaire of Estate, and oftentimes changeth it, in boast of his riches. In his left hand he beareth a most rich Crosier, apparelled in a long Garment, not much unlike to that which the Pope weareth when he goeth to Masse: his fingers are full of Gold Rings, and the Image of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his blessed mother the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin are over the Chaire wherein he sitteth. The Privie Chamber and great Chamber are full of men, cloathed in Cloth of Gold downe to the foot, but never used unlesse upon occasion of Festivals, or entertainement of Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours. In matter of Ceremonie, for the most part they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Greeke Church; the Priests marrie, maintaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of Images, Fast, and compel to confession; which the common people suppose most necessary,<note place="margin">

                  <p>That no man should prove a better Scholler than himselfe, he suffereth no schoole, but of writing &amp; reading to be kept.

Which is the reason that their Notaries, nay the Secretaries themselves, commonly can neither write, nor answer Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors of forren Princes, no farther than they are taught by the great Duke. When they negociate, they no sooner name the great <hi>Duke,</hi> but all of them rise up with great reverence: the like is done at his Table, when he drinketh, or carveth to any man, and so in a thousand like casualties: they are taught, even from their cradles, to beleeve and talke of their great Duke, as of God: using these phrases in

Bestowing upon one a Hamlet, upon another a Farme; and these not hereditarie, unlesse he confirme it: and when he hath confirmed it, the Farmers not withstanding pay him a portion of their fruits, and owe him villaine-service: which is the cause, that every man dependeth on the will of the Prince, and looke by how much the richer, by so much the deeper, is he indebted unto him.</p>

thirty or forty rubbles into the Caback, vowing themselves to the pot, till the stock be spent; and all this (as the drunkard will vaunt,) for the honour of <hi>Hospodare, viz.</hi> the Prince. For, for hindering this base and ungodly profit, none may dare to call, or intreat him out of the Caback.

                  <p>Sometime he will cause his <hi>Botarens</hi> (or Nobles) to feigne themselves robbed, and then will he send for the Aldermen of the Citie, to finde out the fellon, and upon an <hi>Ignoramus,</hi> he will sesse the Citie (upon colour of misgovernment) eight thousand, nine thousand or ten thousand rubbles.</p>

So sent he to the Citie of <hi>Mosco,</hi> to provide a Colpack (or measure full) of live fleas for a medicine: They returned answer that the thing was impossible: whereupon he praved (or beat out of their shins) seven hundred rubbles for a mulct. So at another time, he praved thirty thousand rubbles from his Nobilitie, because he missed of his game when he went on hunting: Which they againe praved out of the <hi>Monsicks,</hi> or common people of the Countrie, as the manner is.</p>
                  <p>Besides, in their Diets (or Parliaments) they are repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of no degree or order. For therein the Nobilitie and Clergie onely have voices.</p>
                  <p>In all their supplications and petitions to any of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or chiefe Officers, they subscribe <hi>Kelophey,</hi> slaves; and so doe they of the Nobilitie, to the Emperor: So that if a poore <hi>Mousal</hi> meeteth any of them upon the way, hee must turne himselfe about, and not dare to looke this Magnifico in the face, but conge to the ground with his head, as Priests doe to their Wafer-cakes.</p>

As well you may perceive in this one Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie, wherein I will shew you two rare accidents, how three Brethren Merchants did rise up to great wealth, and in what manner they were fleeced.</p>
                  <p>They traded together in one stocke, and were found to be worth three hundred thousand rubbies, besides lands, stocke and other commodities.

                  <p>Neither is this State content to tyrannize ouer their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, goods and lands, but he doth the like ouer their wits and capacities. For, for any extraordinarie perfection in any common Art, much lesse in learning, you shall never see them excellent, from which they are kept of purpose, as they are also (being no <hi>Boiardi,</hi> Gentlemen) from all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie practice.</p>
                  <p>And because they should prove utterly unapt for any profession, save servilitie, they are forbidden to travell; so that you shall never meet with a <hi>Russe</hi> in forren Countries, except it be some Ambassadour, or perhaps some stragling companion, who hath narrowly escaped the watch on the borders.</p>
                  <p>The penalty upon taking, is no lesse than confiscation of all his goods. Neither will they suffer any stranger willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to enter their Countrie, further than the necessitie of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their commodities, and taking in of forren doth inforce them.</p>

                  <p>By this a man may ghesse of his riches: for he is not only absolute Lord of all, but also he useth the service of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at his pleasure, and what portion of their goods him listeth.

The skins are sold or given, as pleaseth him: the Fish (dried in the winde) is kept for victualling the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons. In the market no man may sell his wares, before the King hath sold. He hath not many Mines of Gold or Silver. The best Mart-Townes, from whence he gathereth the
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:6897:244"/>
greatest part of his Revenues, are <hi>Astrachan</hi> at the <hi>Caspian</hi> sea, whither the wares of the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> are brought; and S. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> whither the ships of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> doe arrive, laden with Cloth and other Merchandize, which from thence are transported to <hi>Volog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi> When his Ambassadors returne, he taketh from them the presents given them by forren Princes, and in stead thereof bestoweth upon them some other reward, and many times nothing at all. To speake in a word: he gleaneth whatsoever is good or ought worth, through his whole Kingdome; it is thought that he hath great store of Treasure in his Castles of <hi>Mosco, Ieraslave,</hi> and the Marishes of <hi>Albi</hi>; which may be true: for the great Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> wasted in a manner all <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonia,</hi> sparing neither Relique, Chalice, Crucifix, nor any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of silver: and of that which is once brought in, he suffereth no part thereof to be transported, unlesse it be for the ransome of souldiers taken in the war, or of the poore people carried into captivitie. This is most true, that when he lost <hi>Livonia,</hi> which King <hi>Stephen</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> reconquered, in the yeare of our Lord 1582. he lost the richest Province of all his Dominions, for the Traffike of the <hi>Baltike</hi> sea; and the best, for the strength of 34. castles standing therein.</p>
                  <p>The strength of the Kingdome consisteth in the manifold<note place="margin">Of his strength</note> numbers of Rivers and Marishes, and in the thicknesse of woods. Besides, they use to lay wast the parts neerest their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, that there the Woods may grow thicker, which for the moisture of the soyle quickly commeth to passe, and are as available, as a wall or trench to the defence of the next townes. This policie brought great travel to the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> for they were constrained to lose much time in cutting downe the woods, before they could come to the inhabited places of their enemies. They have a few fortresses, some built of stone, some of bricke after the <hi>Italian</hi> fashion, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out strength of moderne devices or cunning workmanship. Such are the Castles of <hi>Mosco, Novograd, Plescovia, Porco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, Slobadie:</hi> some are wrought with twigs and earth, well troden downe, as <hi>Smoloncke.</hi> But commonly the wals of
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:6897:245"/>
strong places are built of great beames stuffed with Turffe or Mosse leaving loop-holes for shot. This fortifying is very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable against great Ordnance, but exceeding subject to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. They serve in the field (as we told you before, treating of his government) rather bearing themselves valiantly for feare of punishment, than of their own natures shewing any alacritie or willingnes to the service. He hath his Captaines at a becke, his Souldiers suffer all extremities patiently; they care not for frost or raine: they indure hunger and scarcitie with incredible contentment; they live with a little: better able to defend a fortresse, than to fight in field; for here cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and agilitie, there constancie and resolution are most serviceable: whereas the <hi>Polanders</hi> are better to fight in the field, than to keepe a Castle: as well appeared in either Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the siege of <hi>Vobsco,</hi> where the <hi>Russe</hi> repulsed the <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> King <hi>Stephen Battore,</hi> with his whole Armie of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand men, &amp; forced him in the end to give over his siege, with the losse of many of his best Captaines and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: but in a set field the <hi>Russia</hi> hath beene ever noted to have had the worse of the <hi>Polonian</hi> and <hi>Sweden.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Great Duke <hi>Iohn,</hi> finding by experience the unapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his Souldiers, and the readinesse of the <hi>Polonians</hi> in skirmishes, was wont to say; That his men had need of a spur to drive them forward, and the <hi>Polonians</hi> wanted a bridle to hold them backe. His chiefest force is in horse; but what number he can raise, who can shew? For I doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that hee is able (as some say) to arme three hundred thousand, because though his Empire be large, yet for the greatest part it lieth unmanured; as the many dayes journey between <hi>Cazan</hi> and <hi>Astrachan,</hi> and scarce meeting one Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage in the way, may well witnesse. In the war which King <hi>Stephen</hi> waged against him (being not above sixtie thousand Foot and Horse strong) hee was not able to raise so great a force, I will not say, as to meet him in the open field, but not to hinder him from forcing of <hi>Pocovia, V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="481" facs="tcp:6897:245"/>
Souldiers, pierced even into the bowels of his Kingdome, and set fire on his Imperiall seat <hi>Mosco.</hi> Therefore I thinke, that they who report, that the Great Duke can levie three hundred thousand men, and the King of <hi>Polonia</hi> 200000. doe rather meane heads of Horses than Riders; for there may be so many thousand Horse, and yet every one is not to be counted a Horse of service, no more than every Horseman a Rider, or able to finde himselfe Armour. One hath his heart in his horse; another wants abilitie; a third wants strength of bodie; a fourth, both courage and strength: yea, admit he could raise so many men (as these Writers speake of) yet would it be a hard matter, perchance impossible, for him to assemble them in one place; or if he could, where would wages or victuals be found sufficient to sustaine them For two hundred Horsemen in <hi>Moscovie,</hi> require three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Packe-horses, and so many tenders, who must all be fed; as likewise the victualers, the Merchant, the Artificers, and such Servants as can hardly be spared in warlike enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. To performe this, whole <hi>Moscovie</hi> must of necessity be gathered into one place; and then it were to be feared, lest in so great a journey from one part of the Kingdome, the other part opposite would runne to ruine and decay. Likewise, although such a proportion of Horse, as hath beene spoken of, might be raised, it were not wisdome for the State to strip the Borders of their Garrisons, the Provinces of their finewes, the Cities of their Magistrates, and the Countrie of Husbandmen.</p>
                  <p>In which point <hi>Basilius,</hi> in the conquest of <hi>Lituania</hi> and <hi>Livonia.</hi> committed a great oversight; for that, taking away with him the upland and Country people; who should have tilled the ground, and might easily have been kept in order without any danger, by other good policies; by this course was afterwards driven many yeres together, to victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the Countrie (especially the great Townes) out of his owne Countrie of <hi>Russia.</hi> And againe, when he first conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Countries, he committed no lesse an error in suffering the Natives to keepe their possessions, and to inhabit
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:6897:246"/>
all their Townes, onely paying him a tribute, under the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his <hi>Russe</hi> Captaines, whose conspiracies and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were the losse of these places. The like fell out at the Port-Towne of <hi>Narve</hi> in <hi>Liesland,</hi> where his Son <hi>Iuan Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siliwich,</hi> built a Towne and a Castle on the other side of the River (called <hi>Ivangorod</hi>) to keep the Countrie in subjection, which so fortified, was thought to be invincible: When it was furnished, for reward to the Architect (being a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian</hi>) he put out both his eyes, to disable him to build the like againe. But having left all the Natives within their owne Countrie, without abating their number and strength in due order, the Towne and Castle not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was betraied to the King of <hi>Sweden.</hi> Therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that that Prince whose Kingdome is able to afford him an hundred and fiftie thousand Horse, to be bravely fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, if he can bring into the field but the third part (I speake of war, and not of incursions.)</p>
                  <p>Some more modest in writing affirme, that the <hi>Mosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite</hi> could levie an hundred and fiftie thousand Horse, if necessitie to defend himselfe forced him thereunto: And that <hi>Iohn</hi> the third, in the voyage of <hi>Astrachan,</hi> entertained an hundred &amp; twentie thousand Horse, and twentie thousand foot. The same King invading <hi>Livonia</hi> in the time of King <hi>Alexander,</hi> levied a mightie Army, and notwithstanding, maintained another upon the borders of the Kingdome. The great Duke <hi>Iohn</hi> adjoyning to his troops of Horse certaine thousands of shot, most Strangers, which yeelded him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table service in the defence of his Cities.</p>
                  <p>And to make good the aforesaid proportion of Cavalrie, the Englishmen, who by reason of their intercourse in those Countries, are best acquainted with these Relations, doe write, that the ordinarie number of souldiers enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in continuall pay is this: first, hee hath his <hi>Dowran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> (viz.) Pensioners, or guard of his person, to the number of 15000. horsmen, with their Captaines &amp; other Officers, that are alwaies in a readinesse. These 15000. are divided into three sorts: the first are cheife Pensioners, &amp; they receive some
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:6897:246"/>
an hundred, some fourescore rubbles a yeare, none under seventie. The second sort receive betwixt sixtie and fiftie, none under fortie. The third and lowest sort receive thirtie a yeare, some 25, some 20, none under 12. the whole summe ariseth to fiftie five thousand rubbles by yeare.</p>
                  <p>Besides these 15000 Horsemen, (being the guard of the Emperours owne person, when himselfe goeth to the wars, resembling the <hi>Roman</hi> praetorian souldiers) there are 110. men of speciall account for their Nobilitie and trust, chosen by the Emperour, who are bound to finde 65000. Horsemen, with all necessaries meet for the wars, after the <hi>Russian</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. For the which service, they are yearly allowed for themselves, and their companies, the summe of 40000. rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. These 65000. are bound to repaire to the field every yeare, towards the borders of the <hi>Chrim Tartars</hi> (except they be otherwayes appointed) whether there be wars with the <hi>Tartar,</hi> or no. And because it should not prove dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous unto the State, to intrust so great a power to Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, first as they are many, <hi>viz.</hi> 110. so are they changed by the Emperour at his pleasure. Secondly, they have their maintenance of the Emperour, being men otherwise borne but to small Revenue. Thirdly, for the most part, they are about the Emperours person, being of his Councell, either speciall, or at large. Fourthly, they are rather pay-masters than Captaines to their Companies; themselves not going forth ordinarily to the wars, save when they are directed by speciall command. So the whole number of horsemen alwayes in readinesse and continuall pay, are fourescore thousand, few more or lesse. If he need a greater number (which seldome hapneth) then he entertaineth those Gentlemen which are out of pay: If yet he want, he giveth charge unto his Noblemen that hold Lands of him, to bring into the field everie man proportionable number of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (called <hi>Rolophey, viz.</hi> such as till his Lands) with their furniture: the which service being done, presently they lay downe their Weapons, and returne againe to their servile labours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="484" facs="tcp:6897:247"/>
Of Footmen in continuall pay, he hath twelve thousand all Harquebushers, whereof five thousand attend about the citie of <hi>Mosco,</hi> or where the Emperour shall abide; and two thousand (called <hi>Stremaney strelsey,</hi> or Gunners at the stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rop,) about his own person at the Court or House where him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe lodgeth. The residue are placed in Garrisons, till times of service, and receive for their salarie every man seven rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a yeare, besides twelve measures apeece of Rice and Oates. Of mercenary souldiers being strangers, (1588) he had three thousand <hi>Polonians:</hi> Of <hi>Chyrchasses</hi> (who are under the <hi>Polonians</hi>) about foure thousand: Of <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> 150. Of <hi>Greekes, Turkes,</hi> and <hi>Swedens,</hi> all in one band, a hundred or thereabouts. These they imploy only upon the <hi>Tartarian</hi> side, and against the <hi>Siberians,</hi> as they doe the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> souldiers (whom they sometime hire, &amp; but only for the present) on the other side, against the <hi>Polonian</hi> and <hi>Sweden.</hi> Concerning their arming, they are but sleightly appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: The Common Horseman hath nothing but his Bow in his case under his right arme, and his Quiver and Sword hanging on the left side, except some few that beare a case of Dags, or a Iavelin, or short Staffe along their Horse side. The Noblemen ride better and richer appointed; their Swords, Bowes and Arrowes, are of the Turkish fashion, and practise as the <hi>Tartars,</hi> to shoot forwards and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as they flie, or retire.</p>
                  <p>The Footman hath nothing but his peece in his hand, his casting-hatchet at his backe, and his sword by his side; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of victuall the Emperour alloweth none, either for Captaine or Souldier, neither provideth any, except per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure some corne for their money. Every man is to bring sufficient for himselfe for foure moneths, and if need require, to give order for more to be brought after him to the Campe from his Tenant that tilleth his Land, or some other place: for diet and lodging, every <hi>Russie</hi> is prepared a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier before-hand; for though the Chiefe Captaines carry tents with them after the fashion of ours, with some better provision of victuall than the rest: yet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

sort bring nothing with them, save a kinde of dried bread, with some store of meale; which they temper with water, and so make it into a ball, or small lumpe of dough, and this they eat raw in stead of bread: their meat is Bacon, or some flesh, or fish, dried after the Dutch manner. If this Souldier were as hardy to execute, as he is able to beare out toyle and travell, or as apt &amp; well trained, as he is indifferent for his lodging and dyet; he would farre exceed the servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of other Provinces. For every Souldier in <hi>Russia</hi> is a Gentleman, and none Gentlemen but Souldiers, so that the son of a Gentleman is ever a Gentleman, and a Souldier with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, bound unto no other profession, but meere Souldierie.</p>
                  <p>It is thought, that no Prince in Christendome hath better store of munition, which may partly appeare by the Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-house at <hi>Mosco,</hi> where are divers sorts of great Ordnance, all of Brasse, very faire, and to an exceeding great number.</p>

                  <p>Their common practice (being very populous) is to make divers armies, and so drawing the <hi>Russe</hi> into one or two places of the frontiers, to invade at some place unsuspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and without defence. Their order of fight is much after the <hi>Russe</hi> manner; that is, to thrust on all together without
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:6897:249"/>
discipline in a hurry, as they are directed by their Generall; save that they are all Horse-men, and carry nothing else but a Bow, a sheafe of Arrowes, and a Cemiter, after the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish fashion. They are very expert Horsemen, and use to shoot as readily backward, as forward. Some will have a Horse-mans staffe like a Boare-speare; besides their other weapons. The common Souldier hath no other armour than his ordinary apparell, <hi>viz.</hi> a black Sheepe-skin, with the wooll-side outward in the day time, and inwards in the night time, with a Cap of the same. But their <hi>Morseis</hi> or Noblemen imitate the <hi>Turke</hi> both in Apparell and Armour. When they are to passe over a River with their Army, they tie three or foure Horses together, and taking peeces of wood, they binde them to the tailes of their Horses, and so sitting on the poles, they drive their Horses over. At handy strokes they are counted farre better men than the <hi>Russes,</hi> fierce by nature, but more hardy and bloody by continuall practice of war, as men never inured to the delights of peace, nor any civile practice.</p>
                  <p>Yet their subtiltie is more than may seeme to agree with their barbarous conditions. By their continuall invasions and robberies, they are very pregnant and witty, to devise strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems on the sudden for their advantage. As in their Warres against <hi>Beala,</hi> the fourth Kings of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> whom they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded with 500000. men, and obtained against him a great victory. Wherein having slaine his Chancellor, they found about him the Kings privie Seale, and there with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently counterfeited Letters in the Kings name to the next Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with charge, That in no case they should convey them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or their goods out of their dwelling places; encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the people to abide therein without feare of danger, and withall recounting how base a resolution it were, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon their countrey and possessions to so barbarous a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the <hi>Tartar</hi>; dispraising themselves in all despightfull manner, letting them to understand, that though he had lost his carriages with some few straglers; who had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched disorderly, yet hee doubted not but to recover that
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:6897:249"/>
losse with the fortune of a noble victory, if the savage <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> durst abide him in the field. To this purpose having writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their Letters in the <hi>Polish</hi> Character (by the helpe of certaine young men taken prisoners in the field) signed with the Kings seale, they dispatched them forth to all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent quarters of the Countrey; whereupon the <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> that were now posting away with their goods, wives, and children, on the rumour of the Kings overthrow, by the comfort of these counterfeit letters, stopped their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and so being surprized, were hem'd in, and made a prey to the huge numbers of these barbarous <hi>Tartarians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When they besiege a Towne or Fort, they offer much parle, and pretend many flattering courtesies to perswade a surrender, and being once possessed of the place, they leave no cruelty unpractised, affirming, that faith &amp; justice is to be kept toward no people but their owne. In their encounters (where they alway practise by ambushments) they retire as repulsed for feare, so to draw their enemies within dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: but the <hi>Russe</hi> being well acquainted with this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie, is very wary of them. When they warre in small numbers, like Rovers, to make their Army seeme greater, they set counterfeit shapes of men on horsebacke.</p>
                  <p>When they give the onset, they make a great and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous shout, crying all together <hi>Olla Billa, Olla Billa,</hi> God helpe us, God helpe us; They contemne death in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate manner, that they chuse rather to die than yeeld: and when they are wounded to death, &amp; past recovery, they have beene seene to bite their weapons in rage; wherein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth the great difference of courage between the <hi>Tartar,</hi> the <hi>Russe,</hi> and the <hi>Turke:</hi> For if the <hi>Russe</hi> souldier be once put to retire, all his safety is set on speedy and resolved flight, and being once taken, he neither defendeth himselfe, nor intreateth for mercy, as reckoning straight to die: and the <hi>Turke</hi> commonly, when he is past hope of escaping, falleth to intreat, and casting away his weapon, offereth both his hands as it were to bee manacled, chusing rather to live a slave, than to die constantly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="490" facs="tcp:6897:250"/>
The chiefest bootie they desire is to get store of captives, especially young Boyes and Girles, whom they sell to the <hi>Turkes,</hi> or other their neighbours. And the <hi>Russe</hi> borderers (being used to their invasions, lightly every Summer) keepe few other Cattell on the borders save Swine, which the <hi>Tartars</hi> will not touch nor drive away, because they are of the Turkish Religion, and will eat no Swines flesh. Of <hi>Christ,</hi> they confesse as much as the <hi>Turke</hi> doth in his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran, viz.</hi> That he came of the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>; that he was a great Prophet, and shall bee Judge of the world at the last day. In other matters likewise they are much ordered after the manner and direction of the <hi>Turke,</hi> as having felt his force at the winnings of <hi>Azon</hi> and <hi>Caf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa,</hi> with some other territories about the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea, which before were Tributaries to this <hi>Chrim Tartar.</hi> So that at this day, most usually the Emperour of the <hi>Chrim</hi> is chosen out of the <hi>Tartar</hi> Nobility by the <hi>Turks</hi> appointment, and to him they give the tenths of their spoiles gotten by warre from the Christians. Under the Emperour they have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Dukes, whom they call <hi>Morses</hi> or <hi>Divoy morses,</hi> that rule over a certaine number of 1000. 20000. or 40000. apeece, which they terme <hi>Hords.</hi> When the Emperour hath use of them in his warres, they are bound to come and to bring with them their proportion of Souldiers, every man with two horse at least, the one to ride on, the other to kill, when it commeth to his turne to have him eaten. For their chiefe victuall is horse-flesh, which they eat without bread, or any thing else with it. And yet (with marvell) though they serve all on horsebacke, and eat all of horse-flesh, there are brought yearely to the <hi>Mosco</hi> to bee sold 30 or 40000 Horse. So they have great droves of Kine, and flocks of blacke Sheepe, which they keepe rather for their skinnes, than for their flesh, though sometime they eat of it. Townes they plant none, nor other standing buildings; but have moving houses built on wheeles, like a Shepherds cottage: these they draw with them wheresoever they goe, driving their Cattell with them, and when they come to their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:6897:250"/>
end, they plant these Cart-houses in a ranke, in forme of a Towne with large streets: neither hath the Emperour himselfe other place ormanner of dwelling; saying, That the fixed and standing buildings of other Countries are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholesome and unsavoury.</p>
                  <p>In the Spring they beginne to move their houses from the South parts towards the North, and so driving on till they have grazed up all to the farthest part of the North; they returne backe againe towards the South (where they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue all the Winter) by ten miles a stage. Of Money they have no use at all, preferring Brasse and Steele before other Metals, which they use for swords, knives and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries; gold and silver they neglect of purpose, as also tillage, to be more free for their wandring kinde of life, and to keepe their Countrey lesse subject to invasions. Which course indeed cannot but prove disadvantagious to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders, as it hapned in old time to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Darius Hista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spis.</hi> For their manner is, when they are invaded, by flying, reculing, and fained feare, to draw their enemies some good way into the bowels of their Countrey; and then when victuals beginne to grow scarce, and other extremities to oppresse their enemies, (as needs they must, where nothing is to be had) they stop up the passages, and inclose them with multitudes. By which policy (as some write) they had well-nigh surprized the Army of <hi>Tamerlane,</hi> had hee not with all expedition retired towards the River <hi>Tanais.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For Person and Complexion; they have broad and flat visages, of a tawny colour, firce and cruell in lookes, thinne-haired on the upper lip and a pit of the chinne, light and nimble bodied, and short leg'd, as if they were naturally created for horsemen. Their speech is very sudden and loud, speaking as it were out of a deepe hollow throat. Their chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest exercise is shooting, wherein they traine their children from their infancie: and to conclude, are the very same peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> called <hi>Scytha-Nomades,</hi> or the <hi>Scythian</hi> Shepherds.</p>
                  <p>There are divers other <hi>Tartars</hi> (as I have afore said) bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:6897:251"/>
upon <hi>Russia,</hi> as the <hi>Nagaij,</hi> the <hi>Cheremissens,</hi> the <hi>Mordwits,</hi> the <hi>Chircasses,</hi> and the <hi>Shalcans:</hi> all differing in name, more than in custome or condition, from the <hi>Chrim Tartar,</hi> (except the <hi>Chircasses</hi> that border South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>East toward <hi>Lituania,</hi>) who are farre more civill than the rest of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> of a comely personage and stately behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as imitating the fashion of the <hi>Polonian:</hi> whereof some of them have subjected themselves to this Crowne, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Christianity. The <hi>Nagaij</hi> lieth Eastward, and is recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the best man of warre among the <hi>Tartars,</hi> but very sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage above all the rest. The <hi>Cheremissen Tartar</hi> lieth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>Russie</hi> and the <hi>Nagaij,</hi> and are of two sorts, the <hi>Luganoy,</hi> that is, of the valley; and the <hi>Nagornay, viz.</hi> of the hilly Countrey. These have so troubled the <hi>Russe</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, that under colour of a yearely pension of <hi>Russie</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, he is content to buy his peace, yet with conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to serve him in his warres.</p>
                  <p>The most rude and barbarous is the <hi>Mordwit Tartar,</hi> a people having many selfe-fashions, and strange kinds of behaviour differing from the rest.</p>
                  <p>Next to the Kingdome of <hi>Astraehan,</hi> the farthest part South-East of the <hi>Russie</hi> dominion lieth the <hi>Shalcan,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Media,</hi> whither the <hi>Russie</hi> Merchants travell for raw Silks, Syndon, Saftron, Skins, and other commodities.</p>
                  <p>The next bordering neighbour by <hi>Finland</hi> side, is the King of <hi>Sweveland.</hi> Of late times this King holding a long warre against him, tooke from him by force the Castles of <hi>Sorenesco,</hi> and <hi>Pernavia</hi> the great, and the lesse in <hi>Livonia,</hi> on the one side, while King <hi>Stephen</hi> vexed him with a cruell warre on the other. In the utmost bound of the <hi>Finland Bay,</hi> the <hi>Swevian</hi> to his great charge possesseth the fortresse of <hi>Viburge,</hi> maintaining therein a great Garrison to resist the attempts of the <hi>Russe.</hi> Likewise in that Sea, and on the coast adjoyning, he keepeth the ships of warre, as well to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at all assayes against the approaches of this great Duke, as also to forbid the Easterlings the bringing in of muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and warlike furniture into any part of the <hi>Russies</hi>
                     <pb n="493" facs="tcp:6897:251"/>
Dominions: neither doth he suffer other Ships to saile in those Seas, without a speciall Placard signed with his owne hand: By the benefit of this Navy, the King (wheresoever he finds meanes to use it) becommeth master of the Sea, and by vertue thereof seizeth upon many places on the coast of <hi>Livonia,</hi> and the bordering territories. But where the Dukes horse, or his great numbers of footmen may stand him in stead, (as in the open field removed from the Sea) there he maketh his part good enough, and most commonly puts the <hi>Swevian</hi> to the worst. The best is, Nature hath placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them such rough Mountaines, such cold, such Ice, and such snowes, that they cannot greatly endamage one another.</p>
                  <p>The last neighbour is the King of <hi>Poland</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Pole.</note> betweene whom and the great Duke, this is the difference. The <hi>Moscovite</hi> hath more territories, the <hi>Polonians</hi> better inhabited, and more civill: the <hi>Moscovite</hi> more subjects, and more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; the <hi>Polonian</hi> better souldiers, and more couragious: the <hi>Moscovites</hi> are apter to beare the shocke, than to give a charge; the <hi>Polonians,</hi> to charge: the <hi>Moscovite</hi> is fitter to keepe a fortresse; the <hi>Polonian,</hi> to fight in the field: the <hi>Moscovite</hi> forces are better united; the <hi>Polonian</hi> more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate, and better armed: the <hi>Moscovite</hi> lesse careth for want and extremities; the <hi>Polonian,</hi> death and the sword: yea, either Nation is of greater worth, when either of their Princes is of greater magnanimity: As it hapned, when <hi>Basilius</hi> conquered the great Duchie of <hi>Smoloncke,</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loncke,</hi> and the large circuit of <hi>Livonia</hi>: And againe, when <hi>Stephen,</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> in his last warres against <hi>Iohn Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius</hi> his sonne, reconquered <hi>Poloncke,</hi> with divers other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of good reckoning; besieged the City of <hi>Plesko,</hi> and forced the <hi>Moscovite</hi> to leave all <hi>Livonia</hi>; whereby I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, such as is the valour and wisdome of either Prince, such is the force and courage of their people.</p>

                  <p>As I told you,<note place="margin">The ancient division.</note> the ancient Provinces were divided into three particulars; and in those dayes knowne by the names of <hi>Sarmatia Asiatica,</hi> both <hi>Scythiaes,</hi> and the Regions of <hi>Serica,</hi> now <hi>Kataia.</hi> Most fierce and barbarous Nations did alwaies inhabit this Country, as first the <hi>Amazons,</hi> a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like kinde of women, which in their daies casting away the properties of their sex, vexed the whole world, usurped <hi>Asia,</hi> and built <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Upon their small extirpation arose the <hi>Scythians,</hi> no lesse dreadfull than the former. Then succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Gothes</hi> or <hi>Getes,</hi> termed by their neighbours <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louci,</hi> that is, ravenous or theevish. These the <hi>Tartars</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and then erected their Monarchie about the yeare of our Lord, 1187. or as others say, 1162. electing for their King one <hi>Cingis,</hi> a man of base birth and calling. This mans followers at that time lived without Manners, Law, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the plaines of <hi>Caracoram,</hi> tended their Cattell, and paied their duties to K. <hi>Vn-cham,</hi> otherwise <hi>Presbyter Iohn,</hi> who without doubt in those daies kept his Court in <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duch,</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Argon.</hi> But this King <hi>Cingis</hi> first subdued the Kingdome of <hi>Vn-cham,</hi> and afterwards imposed the yoke of subjection on the bordering Provinces.

the discovery of those Provinces: and the great Duke of <hi>Moscovie</hi> (by whose Dominions we may easiest travell thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) will suffer no strangers to passe thorow his Kingdome. The <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, a passage no lesse fitting for the journey, is not frequented; and by the way of <hi>Persia</hi> infinite Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and vast Desarts, dividing both Provinces, oppose themselves against us: And to the further hindrance of this discoverie, neither the great <hi>Cham,</hi> neither the King of <hi>China,</hi> nor the Duke of <hi>Moscovie,</hi> will suffer any of their subjects to travell out of their Dominions; nor any stranger to enter in; unlesse he come as an Ambassadour: neither (in this case) is it lawfull for him to converse freely, or to range at pleasure.</p>
                  <p>They live under divers Princes, the principall whereof are those that weare greene on their Turbants.

                  <p>Never was there any Nation upon the face of the earth, that enjoyed a larger Empery than they doe, or have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken haughtier exploits; and I would that they had had some, who might have recommended (by writing) their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. Paul.

They (as before) acknowledged <hi>Un-cham</hi> (whom some interpret <hi>Prester Iohn</hi>) for their Soveraigne Lord, to whom they gave the tenth of their cartell. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of time they multiplied to such numbers, and <hi>Un-cham</hi> being jealous of their neighbour-hood, began to lessen their numbers and forces, by sending them now hither, now thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon most long and desperate voyages, as occasion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Which when they perceived, they assembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:6897:255"/>
resolving to leave their naturall soile, and to remove so farre from the borders of <hi>Vn-cham,</hi> that never after hee should have cause to suspect them: this they performed. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter certaine yeares, they elected amongst them a King, called <hi>Changis,</hi> to whom for the greatnesse of his glory and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, they added the Sir-name and <hi>Great.</hi> This <hi>Changis,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from his owne Territories in the yeare of our Lord 1162. with a most fearefull Armie, subdued partly by force, and partly by the terrour of his name, nine Provinces. At last, being denied the daughter of <hi>Un-cham</hi> in mariage, he made warre upon him, and overcomming him in battell, cast him out of his Kingdome. After the death of <hi>Changis</hi> his successours afflicted <hi>Europe.</hi> In the yeare 1212. they drove the <hi>Polesochi</hi> from the bankes of the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea. In the yeare 1228. they spoiled <hi>Russia.</hi> In the yeare 1241. they razed <hi>Kiovia</hi> the chiefe Citie of the <hi>Rutheni</hi>; and <hi>Batu</hi> their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine wasted <hi>Polonia, Silesia, Moravia,</hi> and <hi>Hungarie.

                  <p>The circuit of this Empire,<note place="margin">Bounded.</note> in the times above spoken of, stretched from the uttermost bounds of <hi>Asia</hi> to <hi>Armenia,</hi> and from <hi>Bengala</hi> to <hi>Volga,</hi> yea, their incursions pierced to <hi>Nilus</hi> and <hi>Danubius.</hi> The <hi>Macedonian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Empires were never so large. But because they were rather Runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates than men of warre, wanting politicke government and military discipline, sometime ruling one Province, sometime another; they rather wrought spoile and terrour to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Nations, than feare of bondage or subjection, and at last seated themselves beyond the Mountaine <hi>Caucasus.</hi> After, it became divided into many Principalities, yet so, that the Title and Majestie of the Empire, remained alwayes to the <hi>Cham,</hi> who (as wee said before) tooke the originall of this name from the Great <hi>Changis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Region for the most part is very populous,<note place="margin">Fertilitie.</note> full of Townes, rich and civill, which you may the rather beleeve;
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:6897:255"/>
first, for that the <hi>Tartars</hi> choosing this for their Countrey, beautified it with the spoiles of <hi>Asia, China,</hi> and that part of <hi>Europe</hi> which they harried, and were never wonne or taken from thence againe to this day: next, for that the Provinces are most commodiously situated for Trafficke and Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; partly by reason of their admirable Plaines, and huge Lakes; (Amongst which are <hi>Cazaia,</hi> whose waters are salt, <hi>Guian, Dangu, Xandu,</hi> and <hi>Catacora:</hi>) and partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their large Rivers, which with a long course doe run by the Provinces of <hi>Curato, Polisango, Zaiton,</hi> and <hi>Mecon.

                        </gap>r Iohn</hi> is thought to be Lord of inestimable Treasure, while he maketh graines of Salt and Pepper, to passe for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Coine amongst his subjects.

As the <hi>Arabians,</hi> so they delight in sowre milke, or <hi>Cosmus,</hi> a kinde of churned sowre Mares-milke, very forcible to turne the braine.</p>
                  <p>His force consisteth first (as we told you) in situation,<note place="margin">Forces.</note> in spacious Territorie, in goodly Cities, in plenty of provision, and in rich Revenues: for amongst other things, hee taketh
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:6897:256"/>
the tenths of Wooll, Silke, Hempe, Graine, Cattell, and is absolute Lord of all: but the chiefe sinews of his State consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in his armed troopes. These live alway in the field, 4. or 5. miles remote from the Cities. Over and above their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larie, they are allowed to make profit of their Cattell, Milke and Wooll. When he goeth to warre, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> hee mustreth part of the Souldiery, which lyeth dispersed thorow the Provinces. For the most part, all the Nations of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> (except the <hi>Varcheni,</hi> who are not subject to the Great <hi>Cham</hi>) fight on horseback. Their Weapons are the Bow and Arrow, with which they fight very desperately. They are very swift, their Tents are made of woven Wooll, under which they keepe in foule weather. Their chiefest meat is milke dried in the Sunne, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Butter is squeezed out; yea, the bloud of their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, if famine enforce them. They fight not pell-mell with their enemies, but sometime on the front, sometime on the flanke, after the <hi>Parthian</hi> manner, overwhelming them, as it were with a showre of arrowes. Whosoever carrieth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe valiantly, standeth assured of reward, and is graced with honour, immunities and gifts. Twelve thousand horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are appointed for the guard of this Prince, and it is said, that of this kinde of force, he is able to levie a greater power than any other Potentate.</p>
                  <p>Howsoever it be, two things in his Kingdome are worthy consideration: the one is Numbers, which may be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the spaciousnesse of his Dominions: the other, their Discipline, because he keepeth them in continuall pay. For as discipline rather than rash valour, is to be wished in a souldier; so in armies, a few trained and experienced souldiers are more worth than many strong and raw bodies: the one may well be compared to Eagles, Lions, and Tygers, which obtaine principalitie amongst other beasts, not because they exceed them in hugenesse of bodies (for then should they be a prey to the Elephant, Horse and Bufall) but because they excell them as well in agility of bodie, as incourage.</p>
                  <p>This Potentate the <hi>Moscovite</hi> termeth the <hi>Caesar</hi> of <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taia,</hi>
                     <pb n="503" facs="tcp:6897:256"/>
and the Turke <hi>Vlu-chan,</hi> that is, the Great Prince. And not without reason, for in magnificence of Court, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenesse of Dominion, abundance of Treasure, and number of Souldiers, he goeth farre beyond all the Kings and Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of <hi>Asia,</hi> and raigneth in such Majestie, that his subjects foolishly call him, <hi>The shadow of Spirits, and the Sonne of the immortall God.</hi> His word only is a Law, wherein consisteth life and death. He maintaineth Justice with admirable seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, except for the first fault; for which the offender is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously whipped: for every other fault he is cut in peeces by the middle: herein it should seeme, they imitate the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> concerning the equalitie of offences. A theefe is likewise slaine, if he be not able to repay nine fold, as well for a farthing, as a pound. The first Sonne is heire to the Crowne, and installed with these ceremonies.<note place="margin">His Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> The chiefe of their seven Tribes clothed in white (which is their mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning colour) cause the Prince to sit upon a blacke woollen cloth spread upon the ground, willing him to behold the Sunne, and to feare the immortall God; which if hee doe performe, he shall finde a more plentifull reward in heaven, than in earth; if not, that peece of black cloth shall scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be left him, whereupon to rest his wearied body in the field; besides a thousand other miseries that shall continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attend him. Then they set the Crowne upon his head, and the Great Lords kisse his feet, sweare fealty, and honour him with most rich presents. Then is his name written in golden letters, and laid up in the Temples of the <hi>Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi> Citie. He hath two Councels, the one for War, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are twelve wise-men: the other for Civill affaires, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting likewise of as many Counsellours. These manage all things belonging to the government, rewarding the good, and punishing the evill, taking speciall care to see those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, who have done best service, either in War or Peace, to his Countrey or Emperour; and others severely punished, who beare themselves carelesly and cowardly in the charges unto them committed. In these two points (that is, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding and punishing) consisteth so high a policie of good
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:6897:257"/>
government, that it may well be said, That the greatest part of these barbarous Princes by these two vertues only, have imprinted so majesticall a reverence in the hearts of their barbarous subjects.</p>
                  <p>For,<note place="margin">Government.</note> what other face of good Government see you in the <hi>Turke, Persian, Mogor,</hi> or <hi>Xeriffe?</hi> Whom reward they, but Captaines and Souldiers? Where use they liberalitie, but in the field amongst weapons? Surely they built the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their States upon no other ground-works, neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they for peace and quietnesse, but by victory and strong hand: yea, they keepe no meane, in disgracing base minds and cowards, and in honouring high spirits and valiant soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. Never was there any Common-weale or Kingdome, that more devised to honour and inrich the souldier, than these <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and the <hi>Turke</hi> more than all the rest. The <hi>Tartars, Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> honour Nobilitie in some good measure; but the <hi>Turke</hi> rooteth out all the Families of Noblemen, and esteemes of no man, unlesse he be a souldier; committing the fortunes of the whole Empire to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of slaves, and men base borne, but with a speciall care of their good parts, and sufficiencie.</p>
                  <p>Let us returne to the <hi>Tartar,</hi> and his forme of government. <hi>Astrologians</hi> are in great request in those Provinces; for <hi>M. Paul.</hi> writeth, that in the Citie of <hi>Cambula</hi> are fiftie thousand. When <hi>Cublay-Cham</hi> understood by them, that that Citie would rebell against him, he caused another to be built neere unto it, called <hi>Taindu,</hi> containing foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie miles besides the Suburbs. There are also great store of Fortune-tellers and Necromancers in the Kings Palace of <hi>Xandu:</hi> As also in <hi>China,</hi> they are in high esteeme. <hi>Ismael</hi> King of <hi>Persia</hi> enterprised few matters without their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: and it is no wonder, that it is of such repute in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for betweene the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and the <hi>Assyrians</hi> it tooke the first originall in those Countries. The <hi>Turkes</hi> cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide it. The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors did more than once banish it, and the professours thereof, out of their governments. I would to God the like might be done amongst us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:6897:257"/>
for it is nothing else but a branch of Paganisme.</p>
                  <p>As part of these <hi>Tartarians</hi> inhabit Cities, and are called <hi>Moores</hi>; part live in the Fields and Mountaines, and are termed <hi>Baduin</hi>; so some of these people dwell in Cities, as the <hi>Kataians, Bochars,</hi> and those of <hi>Shamercand:</hi> others wander thorow the plaines, and are divided into Hords, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five in number, as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>Those <hi>Tartars,</hi> who are farre situated from the residue, and inhabit that remote <hi>Scythian</hi> promontory, which <hi>Pliny</hi> calleth <hi>Tabin,</hi> lying upon the fret of <hi>Anian,</hi> are also disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into divers Hords, wandering up and downe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and are in a manner all subject to the Great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Kataia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certaine Writers affirme, that these Hords issued from those ten Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> which were sent into captivitie of <hi>Salmanasser</hi> King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> beyond the <hi>Caspian</hi> mountains.

Only <hi>Algier</hi> lifteth up the head of a strong Castle, protesting a generall entertainment to Pirats, and bragging of the defeature of <hi>Charles</hi> and Emperour.</p>
                  <p>Now if you demand, how from so small a mole-hill such mountaines have beene raised? know, That in the yeare of grace 1300. did <hi>Ottoman,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Zichis,</hi> step before other Families, and (as if hee were adopted the darling of successe) in his fathers behalfe, obtaine jurisdiction over <hi>Bithynia, Cappadocia,</hi> and most part of <hi>Pontus.</hi> His successour <hi>Orchanes</hi> conquered the great Citie of <hi>Prusia,</hi> and made it the Seat of his Kingdome, but in the two and twentieth yeare of his Progresse he was slaine by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and left his sonne <hi>Amurath</hi> to succeed both in his honour and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; who perceiving the dissention of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the Empire, spent not his labours without a great satisfaction: for with the water that drave the Mill, hee drowned the same, and invited (as a guest) to this banquet of Combats, became Master of the feast. So he made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of <hi>Gallipolis, Cherfonesus, Peloponnesus, Hadrianopole, Servia, Bulgaria,</hi> and <hi>Mysia,</hi> but after three and twentie yeares convulsion of the <hi>Grecian</hi> glory, hee was stabbed
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:6897:259"/>
with a dagger, and so gave way to his sonne <hi>Bajacet</hi> to fill the chaire of imperiousnesse. He began well, attaining <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, Macedonia,</hi> and had indangered the most part of <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> had not fortune kept him from insulting, and tript up his heeles even in the race of his Triumph. For with the losse of two hundred thousand <hi>Turkes</hi> against the valiant <hi>Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi> he also lost his freedome; and how he died, our Stages have instructed Mechanicall men: yet in the meane while did <hi>Calephin</hi> his sonne take up the Colours of defiance, and (forbearing the revenges of <hi>Asia</hi>) he wrecked his anger on <hi>Sigismond,</hi> and determined to have over-run the other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of <hi>Europe.</hi> But prosperitie was not so attendant, for ere six yeares had inlarged the branches of his strange sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tree the axe was put to the root; and, as in <hi>Daniels</hi> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>-like, hee fell to the earth. But this stumpe sprung againe, and <hi>Mahomet</hi> his sonne in imitation of his fathers progresse, set forward his journey, and wan <hi>Valachia, Slavonia,</hi> and infested all the borders of the <hi>Ionian</hi> sea, making <hi>Hadrianople</hi> the store-house of his projects; wherein for foureteene yeares he raised up such ornaments of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Bellona,</hi> that he terrified the Emperour of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> and all the Confederates of <hi>Hungarie.</hi> Presently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Amurath</hi> the second, who filled up his Inventorie with <hi>Epyre, Aetolia, Achaia, Beotia, Attica,</hi> and <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi> now <hi>Salenica,</hi> subject to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> with the gulph of <hi>Napoli</hi> adjacent to <hi>Nigropont.</hi> Next him <hi>Mahomet</hi> the second overthrew the Schoole of <hi>Athens,</hi> &amp; on a fatall day, the nine and twentieth of <hi>May,</hi> 1452. forced <hi>Constantinople:</hi> whereof when <hi>Corinth, Lemnes, Mitylen, Caplea,</hi> (a Towne belonging to the <hi>Genois</hi>) and many other Ilands understood, they tooke the course of prostitution, and had some mercie extended. The like part played <hi>Trebisond,</hi> after that, God gave him leave to continue two and thirtie yeares in pompe and jollitie.</p>
                  <p>After him, <hi>Bajacet</hi> the second obtained <hi>Naupast, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon,</hi> and <hi>Dirachium</hi> from the <hi>Venetians.</hi> Then made hee a contract with Fortune for the most part of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:6897:259"/>
thought to have bargained for <hi>Austria,</hi> but the conditions were somewhat too unreasonable, and an envious hand poysoned his bodie, as ambition had inthralled this minde; which was imputed to his sonne <hi>Selimus,</hi> in detestation of his long life, after whose departure this <hi>Selimus</hi> set forward for the conquest of <hi>Africa,</hi> uniting <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Damascus,</hi> to the Empire.</p>
                  <p>Now behold <hi>Fortunes wanton, Soliman</hi> the magnificent, who stepped backe againe into <hi>Europe,</hi> and over-reached <hi>Belgrad, Buda,</hi> and <hi>Strigonium,</hi> leaving <hi>Hungarie</hi> as a sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull mother mourning for the losse of her dearest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. Yet herewith not satisfied, he besieged <hi>Rhodes,</hi> loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Camels with the broken <hi>Colossus</hi> therein sometime erected, to which hee added the devastation of the five Churches, and <hi>Iula.</hi> At <hi>Zigoth</hi> he was arrested, with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious interdiction from his supreme Commander, and so died. His sonne, <hi>Selim</hi> the second, lived and reigned untill <hi>Cyprus</hi> fell from the <hi>Venetians,</hi> 1570. This losse resembled a stone pulled from a ruinous wall, which being loose before, did not much indanger the foundation, which the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing battell of <hi>Lepanto</hi> did somewhat repaire; by the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof, the enemie ever since hath beene more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate to try Masteries at Sea. After him, time wrought <hi>Amurath</hi> the third great Lord of Lords, over-looking the most part of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the West of <hi>Asia,</hi> more proud of <hi>Sinan Bassa</hi> and <hi>Cicala,</hi> (the one his Admirall at Sea, the other Visier of his Army) than of the conquest of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; because by their industrie the honour of the Empire flourished, and he being a corpulent man, presumed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his pleasures, fatting himselfe with all the delights that luxurie and incontinencie could invent: At last, this lumpe was extinguished, and <hi>Achmat,</hi> the first of that name, is left at this present to manage the Horses of this Phaëtonticall Chariot.</p>
                  <p>Let no man therefore wonder at this excesse of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, considering how thirteene of their Princes successively have delighted in Armes, and prosecuted warres in person;

Insomuch, that when a Sister or a Daughter of a Sultan is given to wife to a Beglerbeg, the children begotten on them doe seldome rise above the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of private Captaine, so carelesse are they of Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, knowne parentage, kindred, or hereditary posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
                  <p>These slaves are either the sonnes of Christians, tithed in their childhoods, Captives taken in the warres, or Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadoes, such as have willingly quitted their Religion and Countries, to fight against both, and are to the Christians the most spightfull and terrible adversaries.</p>

All of them, thrice every weeke within the courts of their houses, learne and exercise some military discipline, rise every morning before day, wash their bodies in cold water, and then repaire to Church. After they have performed these duties, they are allowed a small breakfast, and then are they againe to follow their Bookes, or severall dispositions. At mid-day, at foure of the clocke in the after-noone, and two houres within night, before they goe to bed, they must againe to pray, and he that is missing at any of the prefixions, is sure to have many bastinadoes on the soles of his feet. They never have liberty to walke abroad, no, not so much as to approach the gates of their College, no, nor suffered to speake with any Christian or stranger.</p>

                  <p>The residue (being alike brought up in their youths) are either preferred to be <hi>Chauses, Ianizars, Spaheioglans,</hi> and <hi>Silistarspaheis,</hi> or taken into the Port, or Gardens, to ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile drudgeries an inferiour offices, as to fetch Hey, Wood, and such like provision, for the Stables, the Court, and the Kitchins.</p>

In the Citie sixteene thousand are said to be continually abiding, who are there imployed Constables, for keeping of the peace, and observation of good orders: for Clerks of the Market, to look to the prices, and wholesomnesse of victuals: for arresting of offenders, and warding of the gates. Some are appointed to guard the houses of Ambassadours, or of such particular Christians, who will bee at the charge, either about the Citie, or in their travels, towards whom they shew themselves both civill and faithfull. Notwithstanding amongst themselves (as I said before) they are very insolent and mutinous, in regard of their great multitudes, and many privileges, so dangerous is an armed Souldier in a rich and peaceable

City. For whereas their first privileges were given them for safety of the Provinces, as rewards of their abstinence and vertues, as also to re-answer their benefactors confidence. In these daies their insolencies are become so exorbitant, that they will seldome obey any Authority; but by combining themselves together in mutiny, will tyrannize the Countries committed to their charges, in such rude manner, that they seeme not onely to play the Princes over the people, but doe also terrifie their greatest Officers.</p>
                  <p>In them, two properties are to be noted; their birth-place,<note place="margin">Their birth-place.</note> &amp; training.

From thence, some are sent into <hi>Natolia,</hi> and other Provinces, to learne their Law and Language; where being nuzled in the superstitions customes of them, with whom they converse, they turne <hi>Mahumetans</hi> before they have discretion to discerne good from evill. Another sort is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed into the offices of the <hi>Seraglio:</hi> The third sort (of the fairest complexions, and comliest proportion) are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to services in the Port of the Grand Seignior.

no certaine Governour, nor trained up in prescript orders, but some are set to keepe Gardens, some to manure Fields, other to manual occupations, and to dispatch houshold businesse, as aforesaid. At riper and abler yeares, they are called into the Schooles of the <hi>Azamoglani,</hi> (for so they are still termed till they are inrolled in the seroule of <hi>Ianizars</hi>) and then delivered over to prescribed Schoole-masters, who traine them up in exercises of labour and travell, allowing them spare diet and thin clothing. When they are well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited in that profession, whereunto they have most addicted their minds, then are they inrolled either in the roll of the <hi>Ianizars,</hi> or of <hi>Spachie.</hi> For their maintenance, the one sort are allowed no lesse than five Aspers,<note place="margin">Their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> nor more than eight a day, the other ten.</p>
                  <p>Being inrolled for <hi>Ianizars,</hi> immediatly they enter into action, to Garrisons, or to wait in the Port.</p>
                  <p>In their journeys and expeditions, they count it religious service to spoile the cottages and houses of Christians,<note place="margin">Their licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty.</note> who must not finde fault with any outrage: whatsoever they bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for, they must carry it at their owne prices.

Besides, contrary to their custome, they marry wives without limitation. By their long residence about <hi>Constantinople</hi> (than the which there is not a more effeminate City in the world) they are growne vile, base, and men of small service; yea lazie, insolent, and proud above measure. It is the received opinion, that in their prowesse and discipline, consisteth the flourishing estate of this Empire; but the degenerate carriage of these men at this present (as I have before related) may afford us good hopes, by the favour of the Almighty, shortly to see an end of their licentious tyranny, as heretofore it hath befallen to the preceding Monarchies.</p>

                  <p>At Sea; there is no Prince furnished with better meanes for building of Ships,<note place="margin">Forces at Sea.</note> than he; for not only the woods of <hi>Epyre</hi> and <hi>Sicilia,</hi> but also of <hi>Nicomedia</hi> &amp; <hi>Trapezond</hi> are so huge, so thicke, and full of tall Trees, fit for all sorts of buildings, that a man would take the Trunkes, falling sometimes by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of storme from the bankes of their Woods into the <hi>Luxine</hi> Sea, to be Triremes already built and framed. They can want no workmen to fit and square this Timber; for vile Covetousnesse hath drawne whole flocks of Christian Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights into their Arsenals. The yeare after his defeature at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> he shewed his Navie whole and entire, yea, itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cope with the Christian <hi>Armada.</hi> Neither can hee want a competent number of Marriners: for out of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which he maintaineth in <hi>Lesbo Rhodes, Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> and from the Havens of <hi>Tunis, Bugia,</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier,</hi> he is able to draw a sufficient proportion of Sea-men and Gally-slaves, as often as occasion requireth, to furnish his Royall Army.

The siege of <hi>Malta,</hi> wherein they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged threescore thousand Bullets, may well declare their

abundance of powder and shot: at <hi>Famagusta</hi> they dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged an hundred and eighteene thousand: at <hi>Goletta</hi> in nine and thirty daies, they rased with their uncessant vollies a Fortification which was forty yeares in building: in the last <hi>Persian</hi> warre, <hi>Osman Bassa</hi> drew after him five hundred field peeces. Where ever they come, they never cease play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with their Ordnance, till they have laid all levell with the ground; if that prevaile not, they goe to worke with Spade and Pickaxe: if that faile too, they will never give over till they have filled the Ditches with the bodies of their slaughtered souldiers.</p>
                  <p>They are Lords of three things, wherewith they terrifie the whole world: multitudes of men unconquerable; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie Discipline (if so at this day) uncorrupted; of Corne and provisions, store infinite. Multitudes in times past have bred confusion, and commonly we have seene great armies overthrowne by small numbers; but the <hi>Turkish</hi> multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are managed with so good order, that although it be farre more easie to range a small Armie than a great, yet even in order have their great Armies so excelled our small ones, that I must needs conclude, that they goe farre beyond us both in discipline and numbers; herein giving place, no not to the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> much lesse to any moderne Nation, how warlike soever. And this their due commendation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth not onely in Armes, but in thirst, patience, and hard diet; as for Wine, by their Law they are utterly forbidden it. In the field every ten souldiers have their Corporall, to whom without grudging they dutifully obey. You shall never see Women in their Armies; their silence is admirable, for with the becke of the hand, and signe of the countenance, they understand without words what they are to doe: ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they will make any noise in the night, they will suffer their slaves and prisoners to escape. They punish theft and quarrelling extremely. They dare not (for their lives) step out of their rankes to spoile Vineyard or Orchard. They feare not death, beleeving their destinies to be written in their foreheads, inevitable: The valiant are assured of
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:6897:264"/>
preferment, the cowards of punishment. They are never bilited in Townes, nor suffered to lodge one night within them. To keepe them in breath and exercise, their Princes are alwaies in action with some neighbour or other, being very jealous of the corruption of their Discipline.</p>
                  <p>The which notwithstanding, either time, pride, or the covetousnesse of the great ones hath much impaired. For in comparison of what they have beene, they are now nothing equivalent to those of other Christian Princes. The <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine</hi> (in despight of him) with six ships only hath so kept the bottome of the Streits for these six yeares past, that they have not dared to hazard the Revenue of <hi>Aegypt</hi> by Sea; but have sent it over land with a guard of Souldiers. And because the Gallies dare not looke upon such Instruments; and yet the Admirall, supposing it no policy to let them lie unaffronted, hath done what he may to imploy and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the Pyrats of <hi>Algier</hi> and <hi>Tunis</hi> to undertake the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. And in truth, they have many tall Ships (the spoile of Christian Merchants) warlike appointed, yea growne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in Navigation and all kinde of Sea-fights, by the wicked instruction of our fugitive Sea-men, and other Renegadoes. But false men will alwaies deale falsly; having no mindes to attempt any enterprise, where the victory is like to prove bloudy, and the booty worthlesse.</p>
                  <p>The Royall Navie is set forth in the beginning of <hi>Mar,</hi> to annoy the enemy, to suppresse Pyrats, to collect tribute, and to reforme disorders in the maritime Townes. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists not of above threescore Gallies, which are all that can be spared from imployment in other places. In <hi>October</hi> the Admirall returneth from his circuit; and during Winter the Armada is dispersed, and the Gallies drawne into their dry Stations. Meane time the Pyrats, both Christian and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan flie out, and rob on the <hi>Aegean</hi> and <hi>Mediterran</hi> Seas uncontrolled, more than by the defensive strength of the assailed.

Woods, all things laid waste; few Cities well peopled, and especially the better part of the fields lying unmanured. An assertion easily and probably to be proved by <hi>Constantinople</hi> it selfe. No object in the world promiseth so much afarre off to the beholders; and entered, so deceiveth expectation; the best of their private buildings being inferiour to the more contemptible of ours, and is said to containe but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred thousand soules, halfe of them <hi>Turkes,</hi> and the other halfe <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Christians,</hi> and those for the generall <hi>Grecians.</hi> An estimate neere which (as I have heard) our <hi>London</hi> may affoord. And no wonder: for in our Countries, by the abundance of people ariseth the dearenesse of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; but in <hi>Turkie,</hi> through the scarcity of Inhabitants, the greatest number of the Husbandmen perish with carrying provision, and other necessaries to the remote places, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which their Armies are to travell.

                  <p>The whole trade of Merchandize for the most part is in the hands of <hi>Iewes</hi> or <hi>Christians</hi> of <hi>Europe; Epidaurians, Venetians, Frenchmen,</hi> and <hi>Englishmen.</hi> In so large a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory as the <hi>Turke</hi> hath in <hi>Europe,</hi> there is never a famous Mart-towne, but <hi>Constantinople, Capha,</hi> and <hi>Thessalonica</hi>; In <hi>Asia,</hi> but <hi>Aleppo, Damasco, Tripoli,</hi> and <hi>Adena</hi>: In <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke, Cair, Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Algier.</hi>

                  <p>Although the ordinary Revenues are no greater than aforesaid,<note place="margin">Extraordinary.</note> yet the extraordinary arise to a richer reckoning, and that by confiscations and presents. For the <hi>Bassaes</hi> and great Officers (as Harpies) sucke the very bloud of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and after they have heaped up inestimable riches, for the most part they escheat to the coffers of the Grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior.

                  <p>Yea, to give you an estimate of his Revenues, I have seene a particular of his daily expences, amounting by the yeare to one million, nine hundred threescore and eight thousand, seven hundred thirty five pounds, nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene shillings eight pence sterling, answered quarterly, without default; with the allowance of foure hundred ninety two thousand, an hundred threescore and foure pounds, foure shillings, and eleven pence; which is for every day, five thousand three hundred ninety and three pounds, fifteen shillings and ten pence; upon which account runneth for his owne diet, but one thousand and one Asper a day, according to the frugall custome of his Ancestors, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting in sterling money by the yeare, to two thousand one hundred ninety two pounds, three shillings eight pence. Amongst five and forty thousand <hi>Ianizars,</hi> dispersed thorow his whole Dominions, every one at six Aspers a day, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended five hundred ninety one thousand, and three hundred pounds. The tribute-children farre surmount that number, and are allowed one with another three Aspers a day. The five Bassaes, besides their ordinary revenue, receive one thousand Aspers a day: and of ordinary revenue, the chiefest receiveth for his Timar or annuitie, threescore thousand Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats; the second, fifty thousand Ducats; the third, forty thousand; the fourth, thirty thousand; and the fifth, twenty thousand. In <hi>Europe</hi> he maintaines three <hi>Beglerbegs, viz.</hi> in <hi>Greece</hi> one, another in <hi>Hungary,</hi> and a third in <hi>Sclavonie,</hi> at a thousand Aspers a day; the fourth in <hi>Natolia</hi>; the fifth in <hi>Carmania</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> at like allowance.

The <hi>Imbrabur Bassa</hi> (Master of the Horse) receiveth three hundred and eight and twenty pounds, his annuitie is fifteene thousand Ducats.

                  <p>To raise his Donatives to a high reckoning, it is a custome, that no Ambassadour appeare before him empty-handed; no man may looke for any office or honourable preferment, if money be wanting: no Generall may returne from his province (or journey) without presents: and you must thinke, that so magnificent a Prince will swallow no trisles.</p>

<pb n="523" facs="tcp:6897:266"/>
value of Gold was raised above beleefe; insomuch that a <hi>Chechin</hi> of Gold went for double his value, and the alay of Gold and Silver was so much abased, that the <hi>Ianizars</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves aggrieved thereat, brought great feare, not onely upon the Inhabitants, but also to the Grand Seignior, in threatning, That they would set fire on <hi>Constantinople.</hi> In <hi>Aleppo</hi> threescore thousand Ducats were taken up of the Merchants, in the name of the Grand Seignior.</p>
                  <p>But although his Revenues are not so great, as the spaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apprehension of so mightie an Empire, may seeme to produce; yet hath he an assistance of greater value than his surest revenues, and that is, his Timariots, or stipendaries.<note place="margin">The Tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots.</note> For it is the custome of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes, to seize on all the land which they take from their enemies; and assigning a small parcell (peradventure none at all) to the ancient Lords, they divide the residue into Timars, to every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitor a portion, <hi>viz.</hi> to every one about foure and twenty or thirtie Acres of our measure, with seed to sow it; Upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to pay halfe the fruits the seventh yeare, and halfe of the twelfth. Herein consisteth the chiefest preservation of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; for unlesse, upon this consideration, the care of manuring the Land were committed to these Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; and they againe set it over unto others for their profit and lucre, all would lye waste thorow the whole Empire: themselves affirming, That whatsoever the Grand Seignior once treadeth with his horse-hoofe, (were it not for this course) there never after would grow grasse againe. With these Timars, he also maintaineth an hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand horse-men, excellent well armed, and alwayes readie at their owne charges to march whither their Leaders will command them. So great a Cavalry can no other Prince maintaine, with the yearely expence of fourteene Millions of Gold. Which maketh me to wonder, that some Writers comparing the Turkish receits with the Entrado of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,<note place="margin">Report saith, that this is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by the <hi>Persian.</hi>

<pb n="524" facs="tcp:6897:267"/>
thousand Timars, and a new Exchequer at <hi>Tauris,</hi> from whence he receiveth yearely a Million of gold.</p>
                  <p>By these troopes, the Grand Seignior so aweth his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that they no sooner can stirre, but (as so many Falcons) these Timariots are presently on their necks; And this is the drift of this dispersing them thorow the Provinces. So that one part of them is alwayes readie at the sound of the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet upon all occasions to march, while the other stay at home to keepe the Inhabitants in their due obedience.</p>
                  <p>With his Treasure his Bassaes intermeddle not.

Upon hearing of both parties, judgement definitive is given, and may not be repealed. When the Councell hath sitten seven or eight houres, the <hi>Bassa visier</hi> maketh true relation to the Prince of all that hath beene handled; if he lye, it is present death: For the Prince often listeneth at a window, termed <hi>Dangerous,</hi> right against the <hi>Divan,</hi> being made in such sort
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:6897:267"/>
that he may heare and see, and not be perceived: Though he be seldome there, yet are they alwayes suspitious: After he hath heard the discourse and advice of his Councell, he sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome gain-sayeth, but confirmeth or moderateth the same. These things thus ordered, they are written and registred by Officers appointed.</p>
                  <p>To the management also of the Civil Government, they, as the Christians, have many severall degrees of <hi>Civilians:</hi> or rather Church-men; which is a kinde of Ecclesiasticall Law, the professours whereof are all of the Clergie, if I may so terme them. And to the training up of these profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, there are certaine Houses (or Colleges) called <hi>Medres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sae</hi> in <hi>Constantinople, Andrianople, Burssia,</hi> and other places, in which they live, and studie their Sciences: wherein they have nine severall degrees.</p>
                  <p>The first, are called <hi>Saffi,</hi> and are the puisne Students, or Novices.</p>
                  <p>The second, are <hi>Calsi,</hi> Readers (or Tutors) unto the first.</p>
                  <p>The third, are <hi>Hogi,</hi> Writers of Bookes; for they have no Printing.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, are <hi>Naipi,</hi> or young Doctors, who are not yet so well studied in their Lawes, as to be profound, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Judges, but yet are of sufficiencie to supply a Judges place, in case of absence.</p>
                  <p>The fifth, are <hi>Cadi,</hi> who are both Judges and Justices, to punish offences. Of this sort, there is one atleast in every Citie thorowout all the Grand Seigniors Dominions, they are distinguished from other men by their high Turbants, being at least two yards in compasse.</p>
                  <p>The sixth, are called <hi>Mudressi,</hi> who are as Suffragans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Flamins, or Bishops. Their authoritie stretcheth to over-looke <hi>Cadies,</hi> and to see that they doe their duties in their severall charges.</p>
                  <p>The seventh, are <hi>Mulli</hi> (Bishops) and are the principall Church-governours next unto the <hi>Mustee.</hi> Their office is to place and displace Church-men at discretion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="526" facs="tcp:6897:268"/>
The eight are <hi>Cadeliscari:</hi> they are two great and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Judges (or Cardinals) the one of <hi>Grecia,</hi> the other of <hi>Natolia. Selimiu</hi> the third added another over the Provinces of <hi>Aegypt, Syria, Arabia,</hi> and part of <hi>Armaria,</hi> equall in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to the former. These sit every Session in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Divano</hi> amongst the <hi>Bassaes</hi> to determine temporall suits, being (as it were) chiefe Justices in dignitie and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>
                  <p>The ninth and principallest is the <hi>Muftee:</hi> Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth and governeth all Church-men (or Judges) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; and his sentence in matters of Law and Religion is uncontrollable: yea, the greatest Bashaws in matters of Law or difficultie referre all to his decision without appeale. Such is his greatnesse, that he may not abase himselfe to sit in the <hi>Divano</hi>; neither when he commeth into the presence of the great Seignior will he vouchsafe to kisse his hand, or to use greater reverence towards his Highnesse, than his Highnesse will afford unto him. And therefore when hee entereth the Grand Seigniors Chamber hee will presently rise, and then both sit downe face to face, and so conferre. And these be the degree; and no other, by which the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest scholler may ascend unto the highest place of Honour in this Turkish government.</p>

                     </note> and first the King of <hi>Poland:</hi> what either of these Princes can effect the one against the other, hath beene manifest by their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed actions. In some sort it seemeth that the <hi>Turke</hi> fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the <hi>Polaques:</hi> For, upon sundry occasions being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked (as in the reigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, in that war which <hi>Ivonia Vaivod</hi> of <hi>Walachia</hi> made with the said <hi>Turks,</hi> wherin great numbers of <hi>Polaques</hi> served) and (in the reigne of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gismund</hi> the third,) notwithstanding the incursions of the <hi>Kosacks,</hi> and the inrodes of <hi>Iohn Zamoschus,</hi> Generall of <hi>Polonia</hi>; he stirred not, neither with wont-like disdaine; once offered to revenge so great an indignity. Againe, They, since the unfortunate journey of <hi>Ladislaus,</hi> never enterprized journey against the <hi>Turks.</hi> no, nor at any time aided the <hi>Walachians</hi> their neighbours, their friends and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, but suffered whatsoever they held upon the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea to bee taken from them. But the smothering of this, wrong I rather attribute to the base minde of their King, than to want of good will or courage, either in the Gentry or Nobility. <hi>Sigismund</hi> the first, being by <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to warre upon the <hi>Turke,</hi> answered; Few words shall serve; first make firme peace betweene the Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then will I be nothing behinde the forwardest. <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> the second bare a minde so farre abhorring from war, that he also never made attempt against this enemie, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing injured by the <hi>Moscovite,</hi> he let him likewise doe that what he would, unrevenged. King <hi>Stephen,</hi> a great politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, thought the warre of <hi>Turki</hi> full of danger, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing discoursing with his familiars, he would often say, that if he had but thirty thousand good footmen joyned to his Polonian Horsemen, hee could willingly have found in
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:6897:269"/>
his heart to have tried his fortune with this enemie.</p>
                  <p>The Princes of <hi>Austrich</hi> are borderers by a farre larger circuit of land than any other Potentate,<note place="margin">The <hi>Austrian.</hi>
                     </note> and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to spend the greatest part of their revenues in the continuall maintenance of twenty thousand footmen and horsemen in garrisons; they seeme rather to stand content to defend their owne, than any way minded to recover their losses, or to inlarge their bounds. <hi>Ferdinands</hi> journey to <hi>Buda</hi> and <hi>Possovia,</hi> was rather to be counted couragious, than prosperous: the reason was; not because his souldiers wanted strength and courage, but skill and discipline. For numbers he was equall to the enemie, and reasonably well furnished with necessaries, but his troopes consisted of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Bohemians,</hi> Nations by influence heavie, slow, and nothing fit to match the <hi>Turkes,</hi> skilfull and ready in all warlike exercises.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> likewise are borderers for many hundred miles space by Sea and land:<note place="margin">The <hi>Venetians.</hi>
                     </note> but they maintaine their estate by treaties of peace, by traffike and presents, rather than by open hostilitie; providing very strongly for their places ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to danger, and avoiding all charges and hazard of warre, yea, refusing no conditions; (if not dishonourable) rather than willing to trie their fortune in battell. And the reason is, not because they want money and sufficiencie of warlike furniture, but souldiers and proportionable provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions for one sole State to provide against so extraordinarie an enemie.</p>
                  <p>For, if time hath proved, that neither the Emperours of <hi>Trapizond</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> nor the <hi>Sultans</hi> of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> nor the puissant Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Hungarie,</hi> have beene able to maintaine themselves against this enemie; who can but commend this honourable State, for their warinesse, and moderate carriage?</p>
                  <p>For howsoever of custome, for affectation, or admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we carry to Antiquity, we use to extenuate things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and (like old men) we fashion our selves to extoll the ages past, and complaine of times: yet if we will speake
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:6897:270"/>
without partiality, we must needs confesse, that never since the worlds first creation in any age was there found a body of warre so politickly devised, so strongly cemented, and so severely disciplined as is this, for greatnesse and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse.</p>
                  <p>Which the effects thereof may well witnesse, with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate successe of continuall victory. I may not stand hereto recount the extreme diligence and circumspection of <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> the first raiser and founder of this Empire; nor the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wit and cunning of his sonne and successor <hi>Orchanes,</hi> who first passed his Turkish forces into <hi>Europe,</hi> after he had taken <hi>Prusia</hi> from the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and subdued <hi>Carmania:</hi> nor yet the wisdome and dexterity of <hi>Amurath,</hi> in espying of advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and prosecuting of them: Nor will I make any long dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to intreat of <hi>Bajacet,</hi> who conquered <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> and destroyed <hi>Bosnia:</hi> neither of <hi>Amurath</hi> the second, who in person fought six and thirty battels, and in all departed Conquerour: And yet his sonne <hi>Mahumet</hi> the second ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, and all before him. Equall to him was <hi>Selim</hi> the first, who in eight yeares razed and extirpated the whole Empire of the <hi>Mamelukes,</hi> defeated two <hi>Sultans,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to the purchases of his predecessors <hi>Aegypt, Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naica,</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> a good part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> and all that which lieth betweene the <hi>Syrtes</hi> of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Euphrates.</hi> And more than this, did in a pitched field overthrow the <hi>Sophy</hi> of <hi>Persia.</hi> The memory of <hi>Soliman</hi> is yet fresh, who for Armes was no whit inferiour to his ancestors, but for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, constancie, civill carriage, and fidelity of his word, went beyond them all. He wan the Island of the <hi>Rhodes</hi> from the Knights of S. <hi>Iohn of Ierusalem,</hi> tooke <hi>Belgrade</hi> from the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> with a great part of that Kingdome; and from the <hi>Persians Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Dyerbecha,</hi> the two maine fortresses of the Turkish Empire in those quarters. All which notwithstanding this honourable State, having both before them, and on both their skirts this so-powerfull an enemy, covering both Sea and Land with his forces, have to this day by their provident wisdome, so governed
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:6897:270"/>
their affaires, that in despight of him they have hitherto maintained themselves not onely in liberty, but also in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity and reputation of greatnesse.</p>
                  <p>His last neighbour is the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
                     </note> betweene whom there is no great difference, you shall heare the <hi>Spaniard</hi> say, that the Kings revenues (they meane those of <hi>Europe</hi> only) exceed the Turkish: for he receiveth more than foure millions out of his Provinces of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sicilie,</hi> two and upward out of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and three from the <hi>Indies,</hi> one yeare with another. In these onely he equallizeth the <hi>Turke,</hi> yea, and in the ordinary revenues of <hi>Castile, Arragon,</hi> and <hi>Belgia</hi> he farre exceeds him. But what can you finde (say some men) to compare to his <hi>Timars?</hi> First I answer, that as the Kings revenues are farre greater than the <hi>Turks</hi>; so also his Subsidies which he levieth extraordinarily (of late times for the most part turned into ordinary, as his <hi>Croisa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos</hi>) doe amount to as much as the entire profits of some whole Kingdome. His tenths of the spirituall livings, are able to maintaine one hundred strong Gallies: his eicheats in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> bring more into his Coffers than a man would thinke. His benevolences and presents sent him from <hi>Naples, Sicily, Sardinia, Millan,</hi> and the <hi>New-world,</hi> are infinite and magnificent. Not long since <hi>Castile</hi> granted a contribution of eight millions of gold to be paid in foure yeares, which summe amounteth to the <hi>Turks</hi> whole Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of one yeare. What should I speake of his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams of the orders of <hi>Montegia, Calatravia, Alcantara,</hi> and S. <hi>Iames,</hi> which were enough, if he had nought else to suffice him: he is great Master of the said orders, and thereby hath meanes to advance and enrich his servants, whomsoever he pleaseth, as freely as if he were King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Poland.</hi> Also in <hi>Spaine</hi> he keepeth three thousand good horsemen, and as many in <hi>Flanders</hi>; in <hi>Millan</hi> foure hundred men at Armes, and a thousand light-horse: in <hi>Naples</hi> fifteene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men at Armes, and a great company of light-armed <hi>Italians.</hi> The number of his souldierie in <hi>Sicily</hi> is one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand five hundred. Neither are his feodaries lightly to bee
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:6897:271"/>
esteemed, who upon necessity are bound by their tenures, at their owne charges to serve personally in the field, especially if you consider their numbers, wherein are reckoned three and twenty Dukes, two and thirty Marquesses, nine and forty Viscounts, seven Archbishops, (for they likewise in this case are bound to contribute, as the great Lay-Lords) three and thirty Bishops. And in <hi>Naples</hi> fourteene Princes, five and twenty Dukes, seven and thirty Marquesses, foure and fifty Earles, foure hundred forty eight Barons, to speake nothing of <hi>Portugal, Sicily, Sardinia,</hi> and <hi>Millan.</hi> Lastly, you must note, that these troopes to whom the <hi>Turke</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth these Timars, are not so renowned for their valour, as for their number: For the Timars and profits of their Villages and possessions, together with the greedy desire of enriching themselves with the demaines of their Farmes, hath bred such love of ease and peace in their mindes, that they are growne cowardly and base minded; by their good wills hating the travels of warre and journeyes, and marching with a greater desire of returning home to enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of their Gardens, and the plenty of their Granges, than with stomacks to cope with their adversaries, or to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themselves by hazard. For if by a little pillage, fierce and valiant Souldiers have become cowards, and men of small service; what will faire possessions, a pleasant seat, a rich dairy, and wife and children left behind, bring to passe? I may well say, and say truly, that these <hi>Timariots</hi> are fitter to bridle and keepe under the subdued Provinces, than to fight in field against armed Nations: and to this use it is good policy to maintaine them. For who knoweth not that the Turkish subjects doe hate his Government, his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Tyranny? For Religion onely, the <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians,</hi> who differ in opinion: and for Religion and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, the Christians, who make more than two third parts of his Subjects. For jealousie hereof, hee is forced to keepe the greater part of these troops at home, unlesse hee should lay naked his estates to infinite casualties. To speake in a word, his Cavalrie is so farre and wide dispersed thorowout
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:6897:271"/>
the Provinces, that they cannot easily be drawne to any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous journey in great numbers, without losse of long time; neither are they able to stay long from their houses, but they will fall into diseases and extremities: so that if the Grand Seignior had no other aids neerer hand but these <hi>Tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots,</hi> hee might happen to make very many unfortunate journeyes.</p>
                  <p>The experience offore-passed exploits, doth well shew the difference of their severall forces. The losse of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Fleet at <hi>Zerby,</hi> may bee put in the balance against the Turkish flight from <hi>Malta.</hi> The losse of <hi>Goletta,</hi> against the taking of the Rocke of <hi>Velez. Tunis</hi> is alwaies to be taken at his pleasure, who hath a liking thereto. The Spanish King never enterprized any sole journey against the <hi>Turke</hi>; but he hath valiantly defended his owne at <hi>Malta</hi> and <hi>Oran.</hi> I will speake nothing of the defeature at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> for other Princes had their shares therein.</p>
                  <p>A treaty of truce was mentioned betweene both Princes not many yeares since, and equally accepted of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For the one was invested in the Warre of <hi>Persia,</hi> the other in the commotions of the Low Countries. These Warres, by reason of their remote distances, were extreme chargeable to both Princes, but worser to the King than to the <hi>Turke:</hi> for although <hi>Persia</hi> be farre from <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> (from whence the principall smewes of the warre were to bee drawne) yet it bordereth upon <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> and other subdued Provinces, from whence his Armies were supplied with provisions and treasures, but <hi>Belgia</hi> is farre distant from any part of the Spanish Dominions. The <hi>Turke</hi> hath to doe with the <hi>Persian</hi> (a State without any mighty confederate worth speaking of) but the King was ingaged in a warre (of greatest difficulty) favoured by the <hi>English,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Germans,</hi> Nations severally equall in all points to the <hi>Persian.</hi>

                  <head>Of those Countries which the <hi>Turkes</hi> terme <hi>Romania.</hi>

                  <p>ANd now that we have runne over the spacious Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this mighty, rich, and dreadfull Potentate; we will also in some sort, to the pleasure of the Reader, relate many the particulars of those good and ancient Regions, which at this day this Saracenicall Nation termeth by the names of <hi>Romania</hi> and <hi>Natolia. Romania</hi> at this day is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for that part of Christendome which was anciently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Grecia,</hi> and containeth the Provinces of <hi>Thrace,</hi> with his <hi>Chersonesus</hi> vulgarly, the streight of <hi>Gallipoli, Macedon, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre,</hi> now <hi>Albania; Achaia,</hi> now <hi>Livadia; Peloponnesus,</hi> now <hi>Morea</hi>; and the Iland of the <hi>Archipelago.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Untill the comming of <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> these Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces remained in freedome, but of all others he first gave them the yoke of subjection. After him <hi>Xerxes</hi> the sonne of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> with the succeeding Princes of <hi>Persia,</hi> did no lesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict them. When their turne was past, <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon</hi> acted his part, and united them under his owne Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, untill the daies of <hi>Perseus,</hi> whom the <hi>Romans</hi> subdued and subjected. But the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the East and West, the <hi>Grecians</hi> beganne their Empire under <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, and ruled honourably many ages, untill the descent, first of the <hi>Goths,</hi> secondly of the <hi>Bulgars,</hi> thirdly of the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> and lastly of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who slew their Emperour, and seized on the Empire. Who at this day (except some Relikes, remaining under the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Dominion) possesse the greatest part thereof, as well upon the Continent as in the Ilands. Those that are under the <hi>Venetian</hi> jurisdiction (saith <hi>Bellonius</hi>) little differ, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Religion, from those that are tributary to the <hi>Turke:</hi> for both sorts being mingled, those that are subject to the <hi>Turks,</hi> live like the <hi>Turks</hi>; and those that live under the <hi>Venetians,</hi> doe as doe the <hi>Venetians.</hi> So unspeakable is the rudenesse of either, that through all their Cities you shall
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:6897:272"/>
not finde a Schoole to instruct their youth. Promiscuously all speake the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue corrupted from the ancient, but some better than others. The Burghers subject to the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> speake <hi>Italian</hi> as well as <hi>Greeke,</hi> but the <hi>Villagois</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <hi>Greeke.</hi> And so the <hi>Grecians</hi> which are subject to the <hi>Turke,</hi> in Cities speake <hi>Turkish</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi>; the <hi>Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gois</hi> onely <hi>Greeke</hi>; and in places of Trafficke they borrow one from another, according as their businesse is with those with whom they negociate. And as they differ in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, so doe they in attire. Those that serve the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> goe apparelled like <hi>Venetians</hi>; those that live under the <hi>Turke,</hi> like <hi>Turkes.</hi> Both the Ilanders and those that live on the Continent, as well in <hi>Europe</hi> as in <hi>Asia,</hi> although subject to <hi>Turkie,</hi> keepe their ancient Christian faith. Long agoe they rejected the primacy of the Latine Church, and elected to themselves Patriarches, whom they acknowledge for their chiefe Pastors, and have appointed them their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Sees. Whom not onely the <hi>Grecians</hi> thus obey, but likewise all those Provinces which follow the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, as <hi>Circassia, Walachia, Bulgaria, Moscovia, Russia,</hi> the better part of <hi>Polonia, Mongrelia, Bosnia, Albania, Sclavonia,</hi> some part of <hi>Tartarie, Syria, Croatia,</hi> and generally all the Provinces about the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea.

So base, as to be imagined, that they had rather remaine as they be, than indure a temporary trouble to redeeme their pristinate estates, delighting in nothing but in ease, in shades, in dancing and drinking.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thrace</hi> hath on the East the <hi>Euxine</hi> Sea,<note place="margin">

                  <p>In it stands many goodly Cities: <hi>Philipopolis, Nicopolis, Hadrianopolis,</hi> and amongst many other <hi>Constantinopolis,</hi> by Heaven erected to be the head of an Empire; as the onely seat which the <hi>Romans, Greekes,</hi> and now the <hi>Turks,</hi> have
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:6897:273"/>
chosen and reputed to be most commodiously seated, not for the government onely of the Empire, but as they conceit of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gallipolis</hi> is another famous portion thereof:<note place="margin">

                     </note> I will not stand to describe these trivials, yet is it a place of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therein resideth a Governour, or Lord Admirall, without whose licence no ship of what Country soever may passe the streight, but he must there cast Anchor at least for three dayes, untill the Turkes have made full search, whether they transport any slaves or prohibited wares by stealth, or no.</p>
                  <p>Next followeth <hi>Macedon,</hi> a fertile region inclosed with hils, and neere the <hi>Ionian</hi> sea, plaine and woodie.<note place="margin">

                     </note> That it was once the Empresse of the East, it is well knowne, but at this day it is Turkish, and without any famous Cities, save in a peece of <hi>Albania.</hi> In it is nothing memorable but the Mount <hi>Athos,</hi> or the holy Mount. It is 75. miles in compasse, three dayes journey long, and halfe a dayes journey broad, resembling the shape of a man lying with his face upward, whose highest Cone, alwayes covered with snow, is seene thirtie miles off at Sea. It is exceeding fertile in Grasse, Fruit, Oyle, and Wine. Long agoe it was dedicated in honour of Saint <hi>Basile</hi> to the Greeke <hi>Caloieri,</hi> and endowed with privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, which at this day it enjoyeth by the <hi>Turkes</hi> good favour; that is to say, that no man neither <hi>Grecian</hi> nor <hi>Turke</hi> may inhabit in this place, except he be a Priest. So that their number in these dayes are about six thousand, dispersed into twentie and foure Monasteries, ancient and warlike, so built for feare of theeves and pyrats, although there be no such great cause. In these Monasteries are many relickes, which cause great concourse of people, and they are stately built, and richly adorned.</p>
                  <p>This hill is in as great request with the <hi>Grecians</hi> for their sanctimonious strictnesse of life, as is <hi>Rome</hi> with the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>; yea, the <hi>Turks</hi> themselves doe send hither many boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull almes. None of them live idly, but must doe somewhat, and so doe daily for the oeconomike of the house; as to
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:6897:274"/>
dresse Vines, fell Timber; yea to build ships, and such like mechanicall labours. They are poorely clad, like Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, neither weare they shirts of Linnen, but Woollen; and them they spin, and sow themselves, never giving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to studie: and that more is, many of them can neither write nor read. And yet notwithstanding, if any man have occasion to journey by their houses, he shall, if he please, finde viands scot-free, according to his calling.</p>

                  <p>NOw following mine Author, and having finished this tedious discourse of this great Empire, by the patience of my Reader, I will once turne backe againe and relate the Originall, the manners, the discent, and the Religion of this warlike and infidelious people, composed partly of Natives, lineally descended from the <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Apostata and <hi>Renegado</hi> Christians.</p>
                  <p>Generally the Natives have broad visages, correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the proportion of their members, faire and tall, and somewhat inclined to grossenesse. Their haire they regard
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:6897:282"/>
not, save onely that of their beards. They are of a grosse and dull capacitie,-wayward, slow and lazie, hating hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie, and yet above all people in the world covetous and desirous of riches, yea, selling all places of Justice and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to their best Chapmen. Amongst one another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding courteous, and as servile toward their superiours; in whose presence they keepe admirable silence, and yeeld due reverence: but toward strangers they are all fashioned of pride, insolencie, and boasting, thinking no Nation in the world to equalize them; in their speech, entertainment and gesture, bewraying their inherent insolence; faithfull to none, but where fidelitie may produce advantage. By na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are as idle, and given to excessive eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, sitting close by it three dayes together, and secretly not abstaining from Wine, although by their Law they are forbidden the drinking thereof. No lesse are they addicted to lechery and lothsome unnaturall venery, exceeding cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, superstitious, relying upon dreames, fortunes, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and destiny, beleeving every mans fortune to be written in his forehead, impossible to be avoided: the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall reason why they adventure like brute beasts, into so many desperate dangers.</p>
                  <p>As concerning their Religion, a man might write much, but we studying brevity, doe relate, that generally, as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple too too credulous, they embrace many absurd and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall opinions, touching the Creation and end of the world, of Paradise, Heaven, Hell, the Earth, the creation of Man, and <hi>Mahumets</hi> journey to Heaven, even such and so grosse, as would make our children to laugh, if they heard them fabled. They doe all acknowledge one <hi>God,</hi> they reverence <hi>Christ,</hi> not as the Sonne of <hi>God,</hi> but as a Prophet borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and not crucified on the Crosse, but some other man foisted in by the subtiltie of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> Idols and Images they will not endure, and observe the Friday, as wee doe the Sabbath. They keepe a Lent of thirtie dayes, which they call <hi>Ramadan,</hi> and fast all day; but in the night they make amends for all, abstaining from nothing that
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:6897:283"/>
commeth to hand, save Swines flesh, Wine and Women. Next this Feast followeth their Easter, by them termed <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> it continueth three dayes, and during that time, they take no delight in any pastime. This feast falleth not at all times alike, but sometimes in the Winter, sometimes in the Spring, and sometimes in Autumne; by reason that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count not their yeare according to the course of the Sun, but of the Moone: the rising whereof at first quarter they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, bearing the Figure thereof, as we the Crosse, in their Ensignes.</p>
                  <p>They are circumcised <hi>Iew</hi>-like, but not as they on the eighth day, but at the eighth yeare. They have no Bels after the manner of Christendome, neither will they suffer the Christians to have any, but five times in one day and night, their Priests ascend the Steeples, with their lowd roarings and out-cries to call and assemble the people to prayers. By their good will they will not be called <hi>Turkes</hi>; for in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue that denomination signifieth a <hi>Vagabond</hi> or <hi>banished man,</hi> and is accounted a word of disgrace; and therefore forsooth they must be stiled <hi>Musolmans,</hi> that is, <hi>Right-beleevers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They have likewise amongst them (as amongst the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists) foure Orders of professed persons, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Torlaci,</hi> the <hi>Darvisi,</hi> the <hi>Calenderi,</hi> and the <hi>Hughie mali</hi>; the most wicked Sect of all the residue, giving themselves to all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture and uncleannesse.</p>
                  <p>They are not very daintie to converse with Christians, but with small intreatie will eat, drinke and trafficke with them; yea, and sometimes marry the daughters, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to live peaceably after their consciences: but to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> they are most insociable, detesting their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and hating their tables, accounting them the basest people in the world, neither will they marry with any of that progenie, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor receive them into the Mahumetan Religion, unlesse they be first baptized. By their Lawes they may have but foure wives, yet by prescription every man taketh as many as he can well maintaine: one of these
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:6897:283"/>
is accounted the wife; to her the residue are underlings, and may at any time be divorced. Their women goe seldome abroad, but if they doe, they maske their faces, are gallant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attired, and shine in gold, Stone, and Jewels: Twice a weeke (as doe men) they frequent the Baths. They never blaspheme the name of <hi>God,</hi> nor of <hi>Mahumet,</hi> nor of <hi>Christ,</hi> nor of our <hi>Ladie,</hi> nor of any other <hi>Saints,</hi> but if any bee heard so to offend, he is grievously punished, let him be of what calling or religion soever. At Dice and Cards they never play, but only at <hi>Alveolo.</hi> They are very charitable, disbursing their Almes, not only to <hi>Turkes,</hi> but also to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> and men of all professions, yea to brute beasts, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times buying quicke Birds, which for charities sake, they will againe let flye at libertie. Their garments are long, and open before to the foot, except their shirts, which they weare without their Broges, so that as they goe they are openly seene. Their rayment is very faire and costly, <hi>viz.</hi> of cloth, silke, imbrodery, and set with pearle. They cover their head with a Turbant, except those of the discent of <hi>Mahumet</hi>; these weare altogether greene, but the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans inhabiting among them, weare no one colour, but as they please (greene except.) They are all clothed in long garments like the <hi>Turkes,</hi> and are not distinguished by any apparell they weare (of what profession soever they be) but only by the attire of their heads. In salutations they never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their heads, neither doth the meaner salute his better; the left hand with them is the place of honour, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort ride about their affaires on horsebacke.</p>
                  <p>In diet they are very rude; they fare basely, and grosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and yet they eat thrice a day, at morning, noone, and evening, alwayes without Table-cloth or Napkin; not sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting orderly at Table, but on the ground, or some low stoole, with their legges acrosse, Taylor-like. They feed upon all sorts of flesh, except Porke, which is forbidden them by their Law. Their chiefest food is Rice; and the <hi>Asian Turks</hi> care not much for Fish, but the <hi>European Turks</hi> for nothing more. By Law they forbeare Wine, and therefore drinke
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:6897:284"/>
water, whereunto the better sort mix either Honey or Sugar, and in cold weather in stead of a tost they throw in a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning coale, to take away the offensive operation of this raw Element. They make great use of <hi>Opium,</hi> and there is not one of them but eateth it, beleeving that thereby his courage increaseth, and thereby lesse dreadeth the hazard of warre. They make water, cowring downe like women, and their private buildings for the most part consist of timber and morter, very narrow and ill contrived; wherein to say truth, they are not intensive, esteeming it an hainous sinne to bestow more cost upon the frame, than is likely or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to last longer than during the life of one man: but in building of Temples to the honour of God, in providing for publike receptacles of travellers, in erecting Hospitals, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Baths, watering places for men and cattell, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines to wash away their imaginary pollutions, before they enter into their <hi>Mesehits,</hi> they are most sumptuous, most prodigall. No lesse a pride take they in building of Conduits, in erecting of Bridges, and in paving of high-wayes, all which in <hi>Turkie</hi> you shall see very carefully repaired, &amp; as a man may say, sumptuously and magnificently provided for.</p>
                  <p>Except upon the frontiers, in <hi>Turkie</hi> you shall see no fortified Cities, but rather the wals, that have beene fortified, ruinated, and the fields wasted, according to their proverbe, <hi>Quà Ottomanicus aliquis transivit, ibi nec folia nec gram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In invention of engines against their neighbours they are admirable industrious, not caring to obtaine that by craft and faithlesse cowardize, which they cannot gaine by force, or the effusion of much bloud: but
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:6897:284"/>
those base projects not prevailing, without respect of honour or military glory, they are not ashamed to betake themselves to their heeles. Yet to speake truth, they are good souldiers, and to their especiall advantage excellently disciplined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obedient to their Commanders, most laborious in the fabrikes, content with a small refreshment of victuall, and that most grosse, contrary to gluttonous behaviour of all Christian warfare. Their Armes are a Launce, a Bow, and a quiver of Arrowes, an iron Mace, a Battle-axe, and a Cemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and those enchased with Gold and Silver: besides their great Ordnance, whereof at this day they are Lords of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite peeces.</p>

                  <p>They first seated the modell and majesty of their Empire in <hi>Prusia,</hi> a City of <hi>Bithynia</hi>; then they transported it to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianople,</hi> and lastly to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> In which Imperiall Citie is now his Court or Palace, three or foure miles in compasse, wholly inclosed with a strong wall, and situated the pleasantest of any Palace on the face of the earth, termed by them the Port, or <hi>Seraglio.</hi> Within the inclosure of this

Within this inclosure likewise, are two other inclosed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles or lodgings for women; in the one are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally kept at least fifteene hundred damosels, out of which are culled one hundred and fifty for the daily service of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and those sequestred into the other of the lesser lodgings.</p>

also divers honourable Offices for the government of the Empire, the chiefe whereof is their <hi>Mufii</hi> or Pope. In the second ranke are their <hi>Cadeleschers, viz.</hi> chiefe Justices.

                  <p>And were it certaine, either for yeares, or life; For pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and honour, this place would not be much inferiour to the estate of many great Princes in Christendome. But such is the tyranny of this Monarch, that upon every suggestion and jealousie, he is sometime deprived, and sometime strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Within these sixteene or seventeene yeares last past, it hath beene observed, that fourteene of these Officers have thus beene used.

                  <p>A people scattered over the face of the earth, hated by all men amongst whom they live, yet of incredible patience; as subjecting themselves to times, and to whatsoever may advance their profit: worldly wise, and thriving whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they set footing.

But his sonne <hi>Iacob-beg,</hi> fearing the power and estimation of <hi>Adar,</hi> caused him to be slaine, and delivered his two sons, <hi>Ismael</hi> and <hi>Soliman,</hi> to his Captaine <hi>Amanzar,</hi> willing him to cast them in prison in <hi>Zaliga,</hi> a Castle in the mountaines: but <hi>Amazar</hi> detesting the tyranny of his Lord, conveied the children to his owne house, and brought them up like Gentlemen amongst his owne sonnes; and falling sicke of a deadly disease, forecasting what might happen after his decease, gave them horses and money, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to flie, and to betake themselves to their mothers house and tuition. <hi>Ismael</hi> the eldest was no sooner returned to his mothers place, but he vowed revenge for his fathers death, and after some fortunate expeditions, tooke upon him the cause and protection of the followers of <hi>Halie,</hi> from whom hee derived his pedegree. Hee made the Turbant higher, and sent Ambassadours to all the Orientall Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, to exhort them to unity in Religion and Cognisan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. By these meanes and fortune of his armes, he became a terror to the East, and slew <hi>Ossan</hi> then Usurper of the <hi>Persian</hi>

This <hi>Ismael</hi> at the Lake <hi>Vay,</hi> overthrew with a great slaughter the Prince of the <hi>Tartars Zagatai,</hi> and in heat of his victory had passed the River <hi>Abbian,</hi> if his Astrologian, in whom he greatly trusted, had not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told him that his passage should bee prosperous, but his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne unfortunate. Hee left to his sonnes a most spacious Empire, bounded with the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulfe, the Lake <hi>Sioc,</hi> the Rivers <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Oxus,</hi> and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> which Provinces containe more than twenty degrees from East to West, and eighteene from North to South. And although these Kingdomes lying within these bounds held not immediatly of the Crowne of <hi>Persia,</hi> yet all acknowledge the <hi>Persian</hi> for their soveraigne Prince, that is to say, the Kings of <hi>Matam, Patan, Guadel,</hi> and <hi>Ormus.</hi>

There are also many desarts,<note place="margin">Desarts.</note> and many mountaines dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the Provinces farre asunder. Herein it resembleth <hi>Spaine,</hi> where for want of navigable Rivers (except to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea-coast) traffike is little used, and mountaines and Provinces lie unmanured for scarcity of moisture. But Nature, unwilling that humane life should want any ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, hath so provided for mutuall commerce in these sandy and barren places, that through the labour of Camels, the want of Navigation is richly recompenced thorowout <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> &amp; the bordering Countries. These beasts carry wondrous burdens, and will longer continue than either Horse or Mule. They will travell laden with a thousand pound weight, and will so continue forty dayes and upward. In ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile and deepe sandy Countreyes (such as are <hi>Lybia, Arabia,</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi>) they drinke but once every fifth day, and if extremity enforce, they will endure the want of water ten or twelve. When their burdens are off, a little grasse, thorns, or leaves of trees will suffice them. There is no living thing lesse chargeable, and more laborious, certainly ordained of nature a fit creature for those sandy and deepe places of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africke,</hi> wherein even man himselfe feeleth the want of food and water. Of these there are three sorts, upon the lesser men travell; the middle sort have bunches on their backs, fit for carrying of Merchandize; the greater and stronger are those which carry burdens of one thousand pound weight, these are their ships, the sands their Seas.</p>

In this warre which lasted from the yeare 1591. to 1597. the <hi>Turks</hi> altered their forme of warfare: for whereas they were wont to lay their whole hopes upon their numbers, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of their horsemen and footmen, their store of artillery and warlike furniture, scorning to be cooped up in Castles and Fortresses, for the most part spoyling and burning what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they overcame, or became Lords of, and taking as little care to keepe what they had conquered (supposing it no good policie to fortifie Castles; or strengthen Townes, by weakning of their companies) in these warres to avoid the inconveniences, where into <hi>Selim</hi> and <hi>Soliman</hi> were plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, they were glad to build strong places upon commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous passages, and Citadels in the chiefest Townes, furnishing them with good Garrisons, and great store of Artillery. This warre cost them very deare; for by surprises, by famine, and extremities of weather, infinite thousands perished, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to the losse of the <hi>Persian</hi> or his Confederates.

                  <p>I know, that if these preparations and provisions for war be compared with our forces of Christendome, they will hardly be taken for true: but we have already declared the causes, why the Princes of the East and South may gather greater Armies than wee can, and consequently that those things which are spoken of their incredible store, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull provision of furniture, may be answerable to their levies and proportions. And as they are able to levie mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:6897:294"/>
of men (for arming and for feeding them, they take no great care;) so likewise doe the Provinces afford great plenty of provision, and an inestimable multitude of their usuall warlike Engines: for they carry nothing with them save that which is necessary and needfull for service: Wines, Cates, and such like, which cannot but with great expence, labour, and trouble be carried along with Armies, are by these men wholly omitted and utterly rejected. All their thoughts tend to warlike provision, as to get Brasse, Iron, Steele and Tinne, to forge Pieces, and cast great Ordnance; Iron and Lead to make Bullets; Iron and Steele to temper Cemiters; Oxen and Elephants to draw their Artillery; Graine to nourish their bodies; Metals to arme them, and Treasure to conserve them.</p>
                  <p>They are all tyrants, and to preserve their estate, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce submissive awednesse, they hold hard hands over the commonalty, committing all government into the hands of slaves and souldiers. And to make these men faithfull and loyall, they ordaine them Lords of all things, committing unto their trust, Townes, Castles, and expeditions of great weight: but the expectation of the Prince is often decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the rebellion of these vassals, for sometimes they usurpe whole Provinces, and impose upon the people all kinde of injuries. But let good Princes thinke it as necessary to build their safety on the love of their subjects, as upon the force of their souldiers. Feare admitteth no securitie, much lesse perpetuity: and therefore these tyrants expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no surety at the hands of their subjects, trust wholly upon their men of warre, flattering them with promise of liberty, and bestowing upon them the goods of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as rewards of their service. So with vs, the <hi>Turke</hi> strengtheneth his State with <hi>Ianizars,</hi> and as he coveteth to be beloved and favoured of them (to that end bestowing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the riches and honours of the Empire) so they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge no other Lord and master, I may very well say, father and protector. And so many of the <hi>Malabor</hi> Princes using &amp; accounting the Commons but as beasts, lay all their
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:6897:295"/>
hopes and fortunes on the <hi>Naiors:</hi> the Kings of <hi>Ormus, Cambaia, Decan,</hi> and <hi>Achan,</hi> lay all upon the shoulders of these slaves. In a word as a lawfull and just Prince hath a great regard and singular care to have the liking and love of his people, by which being guarded and environed (as with a strong rampire) hee is able to withstand all attempts; so contrariwise, tyrants knowing themselves hatefull to their subjects, imploy their whole study how to win the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their souldiers and slaves, thereby to represse inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations at home, and invasions from abroad. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the safety and foundation of their greatnesse is built on the entertainment of their Souldiers, as their <hi>Naiors,</hi> their <hi>Ianizars,</hi> free or bond, strangers, or subjects, yea, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, it must needs follow, that onely actions of warre may be the end and scope of their cogitations; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise that they be very prodigall to keepe their estates very well furnished and appointed with souldiers and provisions. And these reasons I take to be sufficient inducements to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the reports of this King of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> and these other barbarous <hi>Indian</hi> Princes. For (besides that I spake of before) it is reported that with this army did march a thousand pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ordnance, among which were foure Basiliskes, every one drawne with an hundred yoke of Oxen; five hundred Wagons laden with Gun-powder and Bullets, two hundred armed Elephants, five hundred Chests full of Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to pay souldiers wages; besides many Princes and pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lords, with their Followers, Merchants, Victualers, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers, and their Seruants, numberlesse. Notwithstanding this his incredible preparation, hee was twice overthrowne by <hi>Marhumedio:</hi> once in the Territory of the City of <hi>Doce,</hi> and another time at <hi>Mandao,</hi> from whence disguising his apparell to save his life, he fled to <hi>Diu.</hi> Being out of danger and feare, he sent Ambassadors to <hi>Soliman,</hi> with a present esteemed worth, 60000. Crownes, desiring his aid in these warres. But afterward weighing in his minde, that these affaires required speedier succours, hee contracted a league with those <hi>Portugals</hi> which were neerest adjoyning, to
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:6897:295"/>
make them his friends and partners of the Warre: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position was, that he should permit them to build a Castle in the Iland of <hi>Diu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now to speake of <hi>Marhumedius,</hi> his fortunes were not much unlike to those of <hi>Tamerlan:</hi> for as this Prince brought terror and feare upon the inhabitants of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi>; so did that no lesse innovation and trouble upon <hi>India</hi> and the <hi>Orient:</hi> This defeated in battell <hi>Bajazet</hi> Emperour of <hi>Turkes</hi>; that overthrew <hi>Badurius</hi> King of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> and his army farre greater than his owne: both of them had the sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of Great. When the <hi>Mogors</hi> understood of the riches of <hi>India</hi> and the fertility thereof, they never ceased by a continuall course of victory their armes and invasions, till they had made themselves Lords of the Provinces, lying betweene <hi>Caucasus</hi> and the Sea <hi>Ganges,</hi> and the River <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi> In this tract are contained seven and forty Kingdomes. For <hi>Adabar</hi> the successor of <hi>Marhumedius</hi> won <hi>Madabar,</hi> with the better part of <hi>Cambaia.</hi> Of what goodly conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence this Province is, may bee imagined by the famous City of <hi>Madabar Campana</hi> (so called for situation upon the top of a high hill rising in the midst of a spacious plaine) and <hi>Cambaia</hi> (a City consisting of an hundred and thirty thousand houses) as likewise by the populous host of King <hi>Badurius,</hi> his warlike provision for such an army, and plenty of graine to sustaine such multitudes. I assure you, the world affords not a soile for all necessaries for the life of man (as Rice, Corne, Pulse, Sugar, Oxen, Sheepe, Pullen of all sorts, and Silke) more richer or plentifull than this Province, wherein also there are reported to be sixty thousand Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs; which number certainly is very great and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <hi>Guicciardine</hi> writeth, that in <hi>Netherland,</hi> within the Territory of the seventeene Provinces are contained two hundred and eight walled Townes, and an hundred and fifty Burroughs, enjoying the rights and privileges of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and six thousand three hundred Villages, having Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Churches. In <hi>Naples</hi> are a thousand eight hundred of these, some are Townes, some but Castles. In <hi>Bohemia</hi> are
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:6897:296"/>
seven hundred and fourescore Townes, and thirty two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Villages. In <hi>France</hi> (as <hi>Iohn Bodine</hi> writeth) are two thousand seven hundred Boroughs, having Parish Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, besides those in <hi>Burgundie,</hi> which in those times were not numbred amongst the Townes of <hi>France.</hi> I write this, to induce a true and absolute judgement of the power of any Province, by the number of Parishes (for I know that that ought to be made according to their greatnesse) but yet their number maketh much to the purpose, as in both which <hi>Cambaia</hi> may carry the credit and esteeme of a most spacious, populous, and puissant Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Acabar</hi> also conquered the rich Kingdome of <hi>Bengala</hi>; so that a man may truly say, that in this part of the Orient there are three Emperours; one in <hi>Cambaia,</hi> the other in <hi>Narsinga,</hi> and the third in <hi>Bengala:</hi> whereof <hi>Cambaia</hi> and <hi>Bengala</hi> farre exceed all the other Provinces in fertility of soile, and concourse of Merchants, both riotously aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in Sugar, Cotton-wooll, Cattell, Elephants, and Horses: In <hi>Bengala</hi> also groweth long Pepper and Ginger. The first is watered and cut as it were into two halfes by the River <hi>Indus,</hi> the other by <hi>Ganges,</hi> having two famous Mart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>townes, <hi>Satagan</hi> and <hi>Catagan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great <hi>Mogor</hi> doth likewise possesse the Kingdomes of <hi>Citor, Mandao,</hi> and <hi>Delly,</hi> wherein he keepeth his Court. He hath infinite store of Horses, Elephants, and Camels, as also all sorts of Artillery and warlike furniture, by meane: whereof he is growne fearefull to the whole Inhabitants of the East. It is written of him that he is able to bring into the field three hundred thousand horse, and that there are within his Dominions fifty thousand Elephants.</p>
                  <p>Some man perhaps will aske how it commeth to passe that this Prince (being so mighty, and his neighbours so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, unarmed, and poore) doth not get into his possession the Dominion of the rest of <hi>India</hi> and the <hi>Orient?</hi> In this as in the former unlikelihoods, the wisest man is soonest an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered. There are many obstacles; one is, that as the spirit and body of man cannot endure in continuall travell and
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:6897:296"/>
motion (for that is onely proper to God and Nature:) so a continued and open passage is not evermore given to the ambitious apprehensions of Kings and Princes. Great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires seldome feare forren invasions, yet oftentimes faint they under their owne weight. It is not destinied unto great things to stand alwayes at the highest, much lesse to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease: they have their floud, but upon a remedilesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that there follow an ebbe. They are lifted on high, but by the irrevocable decree of Nature, that a fall succeed: yea, and that themselves by themselves decline. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are, the more subject to mutabilitie: the larger, the harder to hold and mannage, they move but slowly, and of what effect celerity is in warre, who knoweth not? The greatest conquest carrieth the greatest envie with it, and greatest care to conserve what is got, and yet not care, but long continuance perfecteth these actions: and while time passeth, the neighbouring Nations provide (if not infest) for their owne safety; yea, most commonly by losse of time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the losse of victories opportunity. Hee that hath overcome his enemie, standeth oftentimes in feare of his friend, yea, of such as have been fellowes and partners with him in all his fortunes: so that to secure himselfe of these and such like casualties, hee is constrained even in the course of victory to found the retreit, and surcease his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Againe, continuall victory maketh leaders insolent, souldiers mutinous, refusing to passe forward at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Generall, as it hapned to <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus.</hi> Great enterprises even brought to their wished end, enrich the purses of certaine private men, but leave the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Coffers empty, who neverthelesse must be at the charge to maintaine continuall companies, and keepe them in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall pay; without which course the casher'd souldier is ever ready to follow any faction whensoever it shall be offered.</p>
                  <p>Moreover this numberlesse Army which <hi>Marhumedius</hi> led against the King of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> did not onely waste the Regions where thorow it passed and encamped, but likewise by devouring all things that the face of the earth yeelded,
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:6897:297"/>
bereaved it selfe of the meanes, which Nature in measure had afforded to every creature to maintaine li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e by: and so it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hapneth, that those Armies which in apprehension seeme invincible for their hugenesse, are most commonly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by famine, the fore-runner of pestilence. For proofe hereof, we have seene the invadations of <hi>Attila, Tamerlane,</hi> and those barbarous Nations, stand on foot but a little space, whereas the <hi>Grecians, Macedonians, Carthaginians, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> have done great matters with meane Armies. For things that are moderate last and dure, as small Rivers, which what they cannot doe in one yeare, in two or more they finally accomplish; whereas immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and violent are like to torrents, making more noise and fury, than hurt or hinderance; violently comming, and violently againe carrying themselves away. Therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such mighty impressions, the surest safety is to draw the warre out at length, and onely to stand upon the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive: for, let such Armies rest assured, that they cannot so long hold out, but they will waver, either for want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, scarcity of coine, infection of the aire, or infirmities of their owne bodies. The other thing is, that prosperity blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the winner, making him carelesse; adversitie ripeneth the loser, and maketh him wary and industrious: so fortune changing her copie, the affaires of the winner decline, &amp; the good successe of the loser groweth every day better than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Besides, conquests are not perfected but by processe of time, old age creepeth upon the person of Princes, and how fit a crasie body, &amp; a vigorous spirit nummed with old age, is for the consummation of a conquered estate, the lives of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth may stand for examples.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, to answer those, who unlesse they be eye-witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, will never be answered, let them know, that nothing so much hindereth the invasive ambition of this Prince, as the Nature of places. For <hi>Caucasus</hi> stretcheth it selfe into a thousand branches in those parts, incompasseth whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes with some parcels thereof: by some it runneth by the sides: to others, it is more defensive than any artificiall

rampire; sometime it wholly shutteth up passages, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time it maketh them inaccessible. These difficulties are more iujurious to the <hi>Mogor</hi> than to any other Prince, because the strength and sinewes of his forces consist in horse; which as they are of great consequence in <hi>Campania,</hi> so amongst hils and rocks they are of small service. Of this quality are the frontiers of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the Kingdome of <hi>Sablestan,</hi> on every side hem'd in with that part of <hi>Caucasus,</hi> which the <hi>

Segestan</hi> is likewise so invironed, that the River <hi>Il-mento</hi> (were it not for searching out infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite windings and turnings thorow naturall vallies) could hardly finde passage to pay his tribute to the famous <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi> In <hi>Cambaia</hi> it selfe, when the <hi>Mogors</hi> are of such fearfull puissance, live the <hi>Resbuti,</hi> not dreading them one whit by reason of the strength of the Mountaines. These <hi>Resbuti</hi> are the remainder of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that betooke themselves to the mountaines betweene <hi>Cambaia</hi> and <hi>Diu,</hi> when the Mahumetans first entred these Countries; and since that day, by strong hand they have preserved their libertie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing often the plaine Countrie with their incursions. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Provinces there are utterly barren, not onely wanting water, but all necessaries else: of this kinde is <hi>Dolcinda,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the skirts of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> through which it is impossible to lead an Army. To these discommodities you may adde the losse of time, which Princes (being Lords of ample and spacious dominions) are constrained to make in their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages. For the better part of Summer is spent before they can arrive at their <hi>Rendevous,</hi> with their horses halfe dead through travell, and the Armie halfe in halfe in number and courage diminished; yea, Winter overtaketh them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for their enemies, and disadvantagious for them: for they must lie in the field and open aire among mire and frosts, their enemies under a warme roofe, and wholesome harbour.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon wise Princes, which have beene to make long Land-journies, thorow divers Provinces of divers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for feare of such like discommodities, have thought it
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:6897:298"/>
best to provide shipping, and to use the opportunity of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers or Sea, as did <hi>Caesar Germanicus</hi> in the warre of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> after he perceived, that in the protracting of time (which was requisite for the marching of his Armie) the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of his men and horses were idle, consumed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, labours, and the length of journeyes. But the <hi>Mogor</hi> is utterly destitute to this advantage: upon one side he hath no Haven, on another the <hi>Portugals</hi> are his jealous. neighbours, who with two Castles of great strength at <hi>Diu</hi> &amp; <hi>Damain,</hi> have shut up the whole gulfe of the <hi>Cambaian</hi> sea.</p>
                  <p>Finally, the puissance of their neighbours hath beene as great a controler to their furious invasions, as any other naturall cause, <hi>viz.</hi> the King of <hi>Barma,</hi> who is nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in power and riches: for he is Lord of so many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and of so fierce and warlike a people, and can bring such swarmes into the field, that he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For by nature man is more prone to provide for his owne safety, than ready by wrong to oppresse others, being alwayes more carefull to conserve, than forward to destroy. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expressed how full of subtilty, shifts, devices, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry man is to defend him and his: for hee useth for his owne safeguard, not that onely which is properly defensive; but even that also which humane wisdome hath invented, or Nature created any way offensive. Neither ever was there any instrument invented for offence, but that the same hath beene turned to defense: Of which kinde are Castles built of later times, and the devices of moderne fortification; whereby few souldiers have resisted great Armies, and a small place (made tenable) hath wasted the forces and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of a mighty Emperour; as well witnessed the fortunes of eight hundred <hi>Portugals</hi> at <hi>Domaine</hi> upon the coast of <hi>Cambaia,</hi> who by this Art scorned and deluded the whole forces and attempts of this mighty <hi>Mogor.</hi>

For it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by their Histories (containing the Annals of 2000. yeares and upward) and by other of their manuscript Chronicles written in their owne language (whose fragments are yet to be seene) that their Kings were Lords almost of all the Sea-coast of <hi>Asia,</hi> from the streight of <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> to the Kingdome of <hi>Pegu,</hi> the Provinces of <hi>Meletai, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam, Calan, Boraga,</hi> and other territories situated upon the North side of <hi>Pegu</hi>; where their monuments, with their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs &amp; devices, are to be seen at this day. For in all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Regions, the relicks of their ancient ceremonies, wherby the knowledge of the Mathematicks (as the division of the yeare into moneths, the Zodiacke into 12. signes, true testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of their Empire) are taught by tradition. Neither is the time long, sithence all those Kingdomes accounted the King of <hi>China</hi> for their Soveraigne, sending their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors with presents to his Court every third yeare.</p>
                  <p>These Ambassadors ought to be foure at least; for before they could arrive at their journeyes end, some of them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by remotenesse of place, difficult accesse of audience, or delay in dispatch, could not but surely die; those whose chance it was to scape, the <hi>Chinois</hi> in some set banquet would poyson, and erect unto them stately tombes, with the inscription of their names, the place from whence they came, and with the stile of Ambassadors: thereby (say they) to commit to eternity the remembrance of the bounds of their Empire. They inlarged their dominions no lesse upon the Ocean, than upon the Continent. For they first of all inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Isles of the <hi>Orient</hi>; next unto them the <hi>Giavi:</hi> then the <hi>Moluccans</hi> and <hi>Moores</hi>; and lastly, the <hi>Portugals</hi> and <hi>Castilians</hi>; who hold them at this day. But none of these

Nations were equall of power and magnificence to the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois:</hi> for besides the conquest of the bordering Isles (which in regard of their numbers, their spaciousnesse and fertilitie, were of great reckoning) they became Lords of the greatest part of all the inhabitable places in that vast <hi>Archipelago,</hi> even to <hi>Zeilan,</hi> where they left their speech and characters, as also they did the like upon the opposite continent. Wre reade also in the papers of certaine Jesuites, that in one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Island of Saint <hi>Laurence,</hi> they found white peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which said, that they descended of the <hi>Chinois.</hi> They first discovered the <hi>Moluccas,</hi> gave names unto the Spices, and planted Colonies in many of them: which to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent keepe their old name, as <hi>batta china à Maur, batta chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Mauri: batta</hi> signifieth a Towne, <hi>batta china,</hi> a Towne of the <hi>Chinois.</hi> It is likewise thought that the Inhabitants of <hi>Iava</hi> descended from them; and to speake the truth, there is no great difference betweene their manner of living, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, building, industry, trafficke, and manuall occupations.

                  <p>When this surrender was resolved in full councell, they set the people, whom they had vanquished, free: yet some of their good wils remained feodaries, shadowing their estates under the wings of their puissance, as the Kings of <hi>Corea, Lequi, Cauchinchina</hi> and <hi>Siam.</hi> But notwithstanding their retreit within their owne bounds, yet possesse they a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion little lesse than <hi>Europe:</hi> for from the North towards the South, it reacheth from seventeene to two and fiftie degrees, from East to the West, are two and twenty degrees.</p>
                  <p>It is divided into eight severall Kingdomes, over whom one principall Monarch controlleth; by whose high and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious titles of <hi>Mundi Dominus,</hi> and <hi>Solis filius,</hi> he would seeme to challenge all Natures immunities, and withall, that their prescriptions before the dayes of <hi>Adam,</hi> were true and canonicall.</p>

For, as you have read in the History of <hi>England,</hi> That from the <hi>Twede</hi> (betweene <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi>) even to the <hi>Irish</hi> Seas, there was a wall, called <hi>Picts wall,</hi> one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles long, and at certaine spaces fortified with watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towers, which thorow hollow trunkes placed within the curtaines, received advertisements of Alarmes, excursions, and such like; so that in a moment the whole Countrey was up in armes, and the ordinary proceedings of military disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline executed: So here, from the Sea to Mount <hi>Caucasus,</hi> or rather <hi>Imaus,</hi> eight thousand furlongs together, is raised a fortification, and at every miles end a strong rampart, or bulwarke, wherein is continuall garrison.</p>

                  <p>It is not so spacious, but it is as fertill: for it yeeldeth not only what is fitting for humane life, but whatsoever the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and esseminate appetite of man may lust after. Many Plants yeeld fruit twice or thrice a yeare, and that not only by the temperature of the ayre, but by the number of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and plentie of waters, which doe both cause trafficke thorow every corner of the Region, and so water it on all sides, that it resembleth a most pleasant and delectable gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-plot. Of this plentie there are three causes: one, the prodigall expences of the King in digging of trenches tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout the whole Land: sometime cutting thorow rockie Mountaines, sometime damming up deepe valleyes to make them levell with high mountaines, and to draine the waters of Lakes and Marishes: the other, for that the whole Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is situated under the temperate <hi>Zone,</hi> and in no place, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by nature or mans industrie, wanteth moisture; so that all creatures, taking nourishment of heat and moisture, must needs here wonderously prosper. In no place Plants may take larger scope to spread their branches, nor Cattell larger walkes to wander in, than in this Country. The last reason is, for that the idle are neither severely punished, nor altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tolerated, but every one is forced to doe somewhat, no
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:6897:300"/>
foot of land is left unhusbanded, nor dramme of stuffe cast away unwrought. Among other things note-worthy, this one is of great consideration, that in <hi>Cantan</hi> they maintaine foure thousand blind people to grinde corne and Rice; every childe is set about somewhat according to his yeares and strength; those only who are truly impotent in their limbs, and have no friends living to succour them, are provided for in Hospitals. That none may excuse themselves, in saying hee can doe nothing, every one is bound to learne his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers occupation, which is the reason that the children (borne as it were tradesmen) learne their fathers occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before they perceive it, by continuall practice becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in time most artificiall mechanickes. He that cannot live at Land, seeketh his maintenance at Sea, (for that is no lesse inhabited than the Land) yea, infinite housholds live on the Rivers in Boats, without comming to Land for a long season: Some whereof live by ferrying over peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, some by transporting passengers and their merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize: others keepe shops, others vessels of lodging for their Merchants and Travellers. Whatsoever is needfull for cloathing, for food or nourishment, delight or ease of a civill life, is to be found in the middest of great Rivers. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny likewise nourish all sorts of Poultrie, especially Duckes in their vessels: To hatch the egges and to nourish the young ones, they use not the dams as we doe, but an artificiall heat, in a manner as they doe in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> especially at <hi>Cair</hi>: All night he keepeth them in his Boat, and at morning sendeth them to feed in the fields sowed with Rice, where all day long having fed on the weeds, to the great good of the husbandman, they returne toward evening to their Cages, at the sound of a little Bell or Cimball. Many live by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fish, both salt and fresh, into the high Countries: for in the Spring, when the Rivers rise through thawes, and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stouds, so incomparable quantities of sea-fish doe abound in the havens and creekes, that the fishermen depart rather wearied than wanting. This fish the Skippers buy for a small matter of the fishermen, and keeping them alive in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:6897:301"/>
vessels made for the purpose, they transport them into Provinces farre remote from the Sea. There they are sold and preserved in Pooles and Stewes neere Cities and great Townes, to serve the Markets and Tables of the richer <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois</hi> all the yeare long. Because it is forbidden any inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant to passe out of the Land without leave, and therewith neither, but for a certaine time limited, it must needs be that by the daily increase of people, the Country is even peste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with inhabitation. It hath beene observed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that for every five that have died, seven have beene borne. The Climate is so temperate, and the aire so whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, that in mans memory any universall pestilence hath not beene knowne to infest the Country. Notwithstanding left any man should thinke this people to enjoy all sweets without some mixture of sowre, you must note that their earth-quakes are more dreadfull unto them than any pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to us: for whole Cities have beene swallowed, and Provinces made desart by this punishment. These casualties choke up the course of ancient Chanels, and make new where were never any before; they lay Mountaines levell with the ground, and make havocke of the people. In the yeare 1555. a deluge breaking out of the bowels of the earth, devoured an hundred and fourescore miles of firme land, with the Townes and Villages standing thereupon: those which escaped the floud, lightning and fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven destroyed.</p>
                  <p>There are said to be in <hi>China</hi> one hundred and fifty Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, two hundred thirty five great Townes, one thousand one hundred fifty foure Castles, and foure thousand two hundred Boroughs without walls, wherein souldiers are quartered: of Villages and Hamlets (some of them contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a thousand housholds) the number is infinite; for the Country is so covered with habitation, that all <hi>China</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth but as one Towne. They have two Metropolitan Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>Nanquin</hi> and <hi>Panquin.</hi> In <hi>Nanquin</hi> toward the North, the King keepeth his Court: under the jurisdiction of the one are seven Provinces, under the other eight. Both of
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:6897:301"/>
them are so spacious, that it is a daies journey for a horseman to ride from one end to the other. Of the number of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants no certainty can bee produced, but according to manuscript relations, and the report of travellers, it is said, that the Kingdome containeth threescore and ten millions of living soules. This is an admirable report, and not to bee beleeved, if it be compared with the Provinces of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; but surely something above conceit is to be credited to those spacious, populous, and barbarous Nations. Let us set the largenesse of their Provinces, the circuit of their Cities, their plenty and abundance of all things and in all places, either in prospering by nature or mans industry, with their number and inhabitation, and we shall finde a Country like enough to afford such a reckoning, with pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, cities, and dwellings able to containe them, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment sufficient to maintaine them. <hi>Italy</hi> exceedeth not nine millions: <hi>Germany</hi> (excluding the <hi>Swizzers</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi>) not ten, and with the foresaid Provinces not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove fifteene, which number peradventure <hi>France</hi> may reach unto. <hi>Spaine</hi> is farre inferiour to <hi>Italie: Sicilie</hi> hath but one million and three hundred thousand: <hi>England</hi> three milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and <hi>Belgia</hi> as many, if by the continuance of the warre in those Countries that number be not much decayed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> conceit marvellous highly of themselves, thinking no Province upon the face of the earth for wealth and people comparable to <hi>Italie</hi>; but they forget, that as it is long, so it is narrow, and nothing wide or spacious, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that two third parts have not one navigable River (a want of great consequence) neither that the <hi>Apenine,</hi> a Mountaine rockie and barren, doth spread it selfe over a fourth part thereof. Let them nor deceive themselves, nor condemne anothers plenty by their owne wants, nor measure others excesse by their handfuls. For fertility, doth <hi>France</hi> in plenty of Graine or Cattell give place to <hi>Italy?</hi> or <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for Cattell, for Wooll, Fish, or Metall? Or <hi>Belgia,</hi> for number or goodlinesse of Cities, excellency of Artificers, wealth or merchandise? Or <hi>Greece,</hi> for delectable situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:6897:302"/>
commodious Havens of the Sea, or pleasant Provinces? Or <hi>Hungarie</hi> for Cattell, Wine, Corne, Fish, Mines, and all things else? But I will not stand upon these discourses; only let me tell you that <hi>Lombardy</hi> containeth the third part of <hi>Italy,</hi> a Province delightsome for battle-plaines and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Rivers, without barren mountaines or sandy fields, and to be as full of people as the whole halfe of <hi>Italy</hi> besides. Yea, what may bee said of <hi>Italy</hi> for profit or pleasure, that may not bee spoken particularly of <hi>France, England, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therland</hi> and both the <hi>Panonies?</hi> Wherefore since the Country is not onely large and spacious, but united, popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, plentifull and rich, at least let it bee beleeved and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for one of the greatest Empires that ever was.</p>
                  <p>The Government is tyrannicall:<note place="margin">Government.</note> for thorowout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome there is no other Lord but the King, they know not what an Earle, a Marquesse, or a Duke meaneth. No fealty, no tribute, or toll is paied to any man but the King. He gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth all magistracies &amp; honors. He alloweth them stipends wherewith to maintaine their estates, and they dispatch no matter of weight without his privity. His vassals obey him, not as a King, but rather as a God. In every Province standeth his portraicture in gold, which is never to be seene but in the new Moones; then is it shewed and visited of the Magistrates, and reverenced as the Kings owne person. In like manner the Governours and Judges are honoured; no man may speake to them but upon their knees. Strangers are not admitted to enter into the Kingdome, left their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes and conversation should breed alteration in manners, or innovation in the State. They are onely permitted to trafficke upon the Sea-coasts, to buy and sell victuall, and to vent their wares. They that doe trafficke upon the Land, assemble many together, and elect a Governour amongst them, whom they terme Consull.

of their returne they grant no leave, but for traffickes sake, and that in Ships of an hundred &amp; fifty tun and not above; for they are jealous, that if they should goe to sea in bigger ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, they would make longer journies. To conclude, it is a religious Law of the Kingdome, that every mans endevours tend wholly to the good and quiet of the Common-wealth. By which proceedings, Justice, the mother of quietnesse, Policy, the mistresse of good Lawes, and Industry, the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of peace, doe flourish in this Kingdome. There is no Country moderne or ancient, governed by a better forme of policy than this Empire: by vertue whereof they have ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Empire 2000. yeares: And so hath the State of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> flourished 1100. yeares, the Kingdome of <hi>France</hi> 1200. It is a thousand two hundred yeares since they cast off the yoke of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> after their ninety yeares go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>For their Arts, Learning and Policy,<note place="margin">Arts.</note> they conceive so well of themselves, that they are accustomed to say that they have two eyes; the people of <hi>Europe</hi> but one; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue of the Nations none. They give this report of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans,</hi> because of their acquaintance with the <hi>Portugals,</hi> with whom they trafficke in <hi>Macoa</hi> and other places, and the renowne of the <hi>Castidians,</hi> who are their neighbours in the <hi>Philippinae.</hi>

                  <p>Printing, Painting, and Gun-powder, with the materials thereunto belonging, have beene used in <hi>China</hi> many yeares past and very common, so that it is with them out of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry when they first began. Their Chronicles say, that their first King, being a great Necromancer, who reigned many thousand yeares past, did first invent great Ordnance: and for the antiquity of Printing, there hath beene Bookes seene in <hi>China,</hi> which were printed at least five or six hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares before Printing was in use with us in <hi>Europe,</hi> and to say when it first began, it is beyond remembrance. But not to make our Readers beleeve reports beyond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability or credit, we must needs informe the truth, That the Arts and Manufactures of <hi>China,</hi> are not comparable to
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:6897:303"/>
ours of <hi>Europe.</hi> Their buildings are base and low, but one story high (for feare of earth-quakes) which makes them take up more roome on the ground than in the ayre; no marvell then if their Cities be great. Their Painting is meere, steyning or trowelling in respect of ours. Their Printing is but stamping, like our great Letters or Gaies cut in wood; for they cut many words in one peece, and then stampe it off in paper. This makes their Printing very difficult and charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and therefore so little used. Of liberall Arts they know none but a little naturall Rhetoricke, which he that there excels in, is more beholding to a good wit and a fine tongue than to the precepts of his Tutor. Their great Ordnance be but short and naught. Finally, they are a people rather crafty than wise; their common policy is made up of wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and wilinesse.</p>
                  <p>By the multitudes of people (before spoken of) you may imagine the state of his forces,<note place="margin">Forces at land.</note> for herein all other provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons take their perfection. But to speake somewhat in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: The power of this Prince (remembring his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and nature, detesting all invasions) is more ready and fit to defend than offend, to preserve rather than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease. His Cities for the most part are builded upon the bankes of navigable Rivers, environed with deepe and broad ditches, the walls built of stone and bricke, strong above be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, and fortified with ramparts and artificiall bulwarks. Upon the borders toward <hi>Tartarie</hi> (to make sure worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such an enemy) they have built a wall beginning at <hi>Chioi</hi> (a City situate betweene two most high mountaines) and stretching it selfe toward the East, six hundred miles between mountaine and mountaine, untill it touch the cliffes of the Ocean. Upon the other frontiers you may behold many, but small holds, so built to stay the course of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, untill the Country forces bee able to make head, and the Royall Army have time to come leasurely forward; for in 400. great Townes hee keepeth in continuall pay forces sufficient upon the least warning, to march to that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whither occasion calleth. Every City hath a Garrison
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:6897:303"/>
and Guard at the gates, which at nights is not onely fast locked, but sealed, and may not be opened before the seale at morning bee throughly viewed. To speake truth, their souldiers, horsemen, and footmen, by land or sea, are more famous for their numbers, their gallant furniture, and plenty of provision, than for strength and courage. For the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants partly by their effeminate and wanton kinde of life, partly by their forme of government, whereby they are made vile and base, have little valour or manhood left them. They use no forren souldiers, except those whom they take in war; these they send into the in-land Countries, where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marked (to distinguish them from other) they serve more like slaves than souldiers; yet have they pay, with rewards for their good service, and punishment for their cowardize: true motives to make men valorous. The rest which are not inrolled, are not suffered to keepe weapons in their houses.</p>
                  <p>Their Sea-forces are nothing inferiour to their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces:<note place="margin">Force at sea.</note> for besides their ordinary Fleets, lying upon the Coasts for the safety of the Sea-townes, by reason of the abundance of navigable Rivers, and so huge a Sea-tract full of Havens, Creeks, and Islands, it is thought that with case they are able to assemble from five hundred to a thousand such great Ships, which they call <hi>Giunchi,</hi> we <hi>Iunks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To thinke that treasure cannot bee wanting to levie so<note place="margin">Treasure.</note> great a number of Ships, Souldiers, and Marriners, many men affirme, that the Kings revenues amount to an hundred and twenty millions of gold, which value, although it may seeme impossible to him that shall make an estimate of the States of <hi>Europe,</hi> with the Kingdome of <hi>China</hi>; yet may it finde place of beleefe, if he doe but call to minde, First, the nature and circuit of the Empire, being little lesse than all <hi>Europe</hi>; Next, the populousnesse of the Inhabitants, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with inestimable riches: Then the diversity of Mines, of Gold, Silver, Iron, and other sorts of Metall, the unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quantity of Merchandize, passing from hand to hand, by so many navigable Rivers: so many armes and in-lets of the Sea, their upland Cities, and maritime Townes, their
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:6897:304"/>
Tolls, Customes, Subsidies; and lastly, their rich wares brought into <hi>Europe.</hi> Hee taketh the tenth of all things which the earth yeeldeth; as Barley, Rice, Olives, Wine, Cotton, Wooll, Flax, Silke, all kinds of Metall, Fruits, Cattel, Sugar, Hony, Rubarbe, Camphire, Ginger, Wood, Muske, and all sorts of Perfumes. The custome only of Salt in the City <hi>Canto</hi> (which is not of the greatest, nor of the best traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke) yeeldeth 180000. Crownes yearely: the tenth of Rice of one small Towne, and the adjacent Territory, yeeldeth more than 100000. Crownes. By these you may conjecture of the rest. He leaveth his subjects nothing save food &amp; clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. He hath under him no Earles, Lords, or Nobles of any degree, no nor private persons indowed with great wealth.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore since this Empire is so huge, and all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits thereof are in his hands, how can the former assertion of so great and yearely a revenue to men of reason seeme any thing admirable at all? There are two things moreover, which adde great credit to this reckoning; one is, that all his impositions are not paid in Coine, but some in hay, some in Rice, Corne, Provender, Silke, Cotton, Wooll, and such like necessaries; the other is, that the King of 120. millions which he receiveth, disburseth againe three parts thereof. And so since it goeth round from the King to the people, it ought to seeme no wonder, if the people be able to spare it againe for the Princes use at the yeares end. For as waters doe ebbe as deepe as they flow, so impositions easily le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied suffice for the expences of the State, and the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive againe by those expences as much as they layed out in the beginning of the yeare.</p>
                  <p>This King feareth no neighbour,<note place="margin">Borderers.</note> but the great <hi>Cham</hi> of <hi>Tartaria</hi>; all the rest acknowledge vassalage. Against this enemy the ancient Kings built that admirable wall, so much renowned amongst the wonders of the <hi>Ortem.</hi> Towards the Sea, hee bordereth upon the <hi>Iaponians</hi> and <hi>Castilians.</hi> The distance betweene <hi>Iapan</hi> and <hi>China</hi> is divers. From <hi>Goto,</hi> one of the Islands of <hi>Iapan,</hi> to the City <hi>Liampo,</hi> is threescore leagues: from <hi>Canian</hi> 297. The Islanders of
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:6897:304"/>
                     <hi>Iapan</hi> doe often spoile the Sea-coasts of <hi>China</hi> by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions, descending on land and harrying the Countrey, more like Pyrates than men of Warre. For in regard that <hi>Iapan</hi> is divided into many Islands, and into divers Seignio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (ill agreeing amongst themselves,) though they excell the <hi>Chinois</hi> in armes and courage, yet are they not of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient power to performe any action of moment against them. Upon another Frontier lye the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> of whom the <hi>Chinois,</hi> not without good cause, are very jealous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the situation of the <hi>Philippinae</hi> (commodiously sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the invasion of <hi>China</hi>) and the fame of the riches well knowne to the <hi>Spanish.</hi> But the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> wisheth rather to plant Christianitie peaceably amongst them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there was once good hope, that God had opened a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage. For though the <hi>Chinois</hi> will suffer no stranger to enter within their Dominions, yet certaine Jesuites (zealous in the increasing of Christian Religion) in a Territory, so spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as that is, entred with great secrecie and danger, and procuring the favour of certaine Governours, obtained a privilege of naturalization, specially Frier <hi>Michael Roge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who in the yeare 1590. returned into <hi>Europe</hi> to advise what course were best to take in this businesse. After whose departure, intelligence was brought from two Friers which remained behinde, that after divers persecutions they were then constrained to forsake the Citie wherein they sojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and to make haste to sea-ward. Nor plainly would the <hi>Chinois</hi> suffer the said Frier <hi>Rogerius</hi> to come into their Countrey, as himselfe confessed to an <hi>English</hi> Gentleman of very good worth and curious understanding, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>W.F.</hi> who purposely asked that question of him. If any man of <hi>Europe</hi> hath beene in <hi>China,</hi> it is <hi>Matthew Riccius</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite. The <hi>Portugals</hi> are likewise eye-sores unto them, but by the report of their justice and the moderation, which <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand Andrada</hi> shewed in the government of the Island of <hi>Tamo,</hi> and by the Traffick which they exercise in those seas, they can better digest their neighbour-hood, than that of the <hi>Spanish.</hi> This was the first <hi>Portugal</hi> that arrived in the

Citie of <hi>Cantan,</hi> and set on land <hi>Thomas Perez,</hi> Legier for <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal.</hi> But other Captaines being there afterwards dis-embarked, behaved themselves so lewdly, that they occasioned the said Ambassadour to be taken for a Spie, and cast into prison, where hee died most miserably, the residue were intreated as enemies. At last it was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Portugals,</hi> for traffick sake, to set a Factory in <hi>Macao,</hi> where againe before they had strongly fortified their Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, they were constrained to submit to the limitations of the <hi>Chinois</hi>; to whom in short time for their strength, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, friendship, and alliance with the <hi>Castilians,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came suspitious: and therefore they doe daily more and more bridle their libertie of Trafficke, carrying so heavie a hand toward them, that they would faine give them occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to leave <hi>Macao</hi> of their owne w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares since, one of these Captaines, Ruler of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Tengu,</hi> by the aid of his faction, and reputation of his Vertues, entered into Rebellion, and slaying the Nobles of the Land, usurped the Kingdome. Afterward he forced the Cities, and conquered the Kingdome of <hi>Prom, Melintati, Calam, Mirandu</hi> and <hi>Ana,</hi> all inhabited by the <hi>Bramians,</hi> for the space of one hundred and fiftie leagues towards the North. He assayed likewise the conquest of <hi>Siam</hi>; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming before <hi>Vdia,</hi> the chiefe Citie of the Kingdome, he was forced to raise his siege and depart. Hee undertooke this journey with three hundred thousand footmen, consuming more than three moneths in making way for his armie tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row stonie Mountaines, huge Woods, and inaccessible pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in prosecution whereof, he lost two hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thousand of his Souldiers, and re-enforced his losses with captive <hi>Siamus.</hi> At this returne home, he invaded the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and won it. Afterward, in the yeare 1507. he renued his journey against <hi>Siam,</hi> and overcame the King thereof, who slew himselfe with poyson; but he tooke his sons, and with them the better part of the Kingdome. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagred <hi>Vdia</hi> with a million of men and upward. Our late Writers call this man and his successors (because their fames arose by the conquest of the Kingdomes of <hi>Brama</hi>) Kings of <hi>Brama</hi> or <hi>Bramia,</hi> but the <hi>Portugals</hi> of a more sound judgement grounded upon neerer Neighbour-hood, call them Kings of <hi>Pegu.</hi>

shewing how, and by what likly-hoods, both in this, and other like barbarous dominions, such huge and numberlesse companies are levied and nourished. First therefore it is a ground infallible, that all Monarchies consist of people, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and revenues, and that howsoever in times of peace Princes may live at pleasure, yet populous Armies neere home, or farre off, cannot long indure without great supplies, and a continuall Sea of ready money: For as the members of our bodie cannot move without sinewes, nor motion availe us if joynts were wanting; so without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney an Army can never bee gathered, nor being gathered, kept together, if coine be wanting; which preventeth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mischances, and draweth after it Armour, Provision, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and whatsoever else is necessary for life or armes. And sithence the wealth of Princes, even as of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (from whose purses they supply their occasions) hath limits and measure; Let them not thinke to beginne any long warre, much lesse to continue it, unlesse they through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provide aforehand: for when this torrent breaketh forth, no man can make an estimate what will bee the expence of reparation therein: which moved a certaine <hi>Portugal</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to tell King <hi>Sebastian,</hi> providing for his journey into <hi>Barbarie,</hi> that warres should be accompanied with three streames: The first, of men; The second, of Victuall; The third, of Silver. For whosoever will rightly judge of a Princes estate, must examine whether his ordinary receits be sufficient to answer his ordinary issues, (leaving alwayes a portion to answer extraordinary accidents) which are so certaine in proofe, as all men must provide for, though they know them not beforehand, especially in the condition of a great Prince.</p>
                  <p>The great <hi>Turke</hi> in his <hi>Persian</hi> journies, felt the smart thereof, who though he be so potent a Prince, by default of this providence, was constrained to raise the value of his coine, and abase the allay, so farre forth that the <hi>Ianizars</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselves aggrieved thereat, raised commotions, set fire on the City of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and rifled a great part
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:6897:308"/>
thereof. Neither could the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> have sustained the burthen of so many warres, and in so remote Provinces, if he had trusted to no other supplies than those of <hi>Spaine.</hi> But fortune hath given him a Countrey, prodigall in Mines of Gold and Silver, assuredly paying the expence of one yeare, with the income of another. A providence so farre from neglect, in the late reigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that before she had any warres with <hi>Spaine,</hi> or had sent her forces of prevention into the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> she had ready <hi>in deposito</hi> two millions of Crownes. And being engaged, by her poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike government, she raised such an annuall assistance from the love of her subjects, against the malicious and injurious attempts of her enemies, that during her reigne she levied three million<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But these grounds especially hold, when the burthen of the war lieth upon the purse of the Prince &amp; his people: for sometime it hapneth, that the souldier liveth upon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Countrey, as did the <hi>Hunnes, Vandals, Gothes, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> and in our dayes <hi>Tamerlane.</hi> They entred the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces without controll, being unprovided of forces, and made prey and spoile of whatsoever came in their reaches. The ransacked the Cities, and fed upon the Villages. The like good lucke had the <hi>Portugals</hi> in the Fast <hi>Indies,</hi> and the <hi>Castilians</hi> in the West, but the one farre better than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for never any Nation conquered with lesse cost so much as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have done in new <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Peru.</hi> But let not any people thinke to doe so in these dayes, no not in <hi>Asia</hi> or <hi>Africke,</hi> much lesse in <hi>Europe,</hi> where the use of great Ordnance is in perfection, and the art of fortification so ingenuous, that one Castle shall be able to sustaine, yea, well provided, to weary the forces of the greatest Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. The <hi>Turkes</hi> at <hi>Zigeth</hi> (a small fortresse in <hi>Hungarie</hi>) approved this; which in the yeare 1566. <hi>Soliman</hi> beleagred with three hundred thousand men of warre, and at last for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;

When the warre was made in these populous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and neere at hand, every man made one in the medlie, gallantly armed, and well provided with furniture and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall to hold out certaine dayes: but when the warre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued longer than expectation, for want of mony and food every man retired; one to the Plough, another to his Shop, the rest to those imployments, wherby they sustained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their families. The <hi>Scots</hi> for want of wealth never made famous journey out of the Island, but at home they have led mighty armies for a short time, either for revenge of wrongs, or to defend their frontiers: even as did the <hi>Romans</hi>
                     <pb n="610" facs="tcp:6897:309"/>
for certaine ages, warring with their neighbours at their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate charges. They tooke the field, every man provided with victuall for two or three dayes, and in one battell, and few houres, finished those warres. But in the journey against the <hi>Veij,</hi> the warre continuing beyond opinion, the State was enforced to procure provision for the Army.</p>
                  <p>That Armies may farre easier be gathered in the East and <hi>Africke,</hi> than in <hi>Europe,</hi> the reasons are many. Those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions for the most part are more plentifull of all necessaries for humane life: the people of the South are better conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with little than we: their diet is bare and simple, onely to maintaine life, and not excesse: but the <hi>Europeans</hi> must eat and drinke, not to sustaine nature, but to comfort the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, and to expell colds. Wine, which with us is dearer than bread, is not to be found amongst them: their waters are better than our drinkes. Cookery is not in such request with them as with us, nor their tables accustomed to such Cates: their banquets are onely furnished with Rice and Mutton. Neither doe the people of the East spend a quarter of that clothing which we doe: they goe to the warre halfe naked, hiding nothing but their privities: they stand not in need of that number of workmen which we doe, among whom the greatest part of our life is spent in weaving, and devising stuffes and fashions to cloath the carkasse, and adorne the body, with cloth, silke, colours, and embrode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. All their expences are onely upon clothing of Cotton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wooll, and that but from the Navell to the Knee.</p>
                  <p>These are the reasons which I meant to lay, why they may gather forty thousand men with more case, than we ten; and to these may be added this as the last; that, upon Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance &amp; their furnitures; upon provisions and their cariages; upon horses, pioners, and a thousand like necessaries, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite summes are spent; of which the people of the East are uttterly ignorant, especially those which have not to deale with the <hi>Portugals</hi> or <hi>Arabians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They go to War without Armour, without Curaces, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, Launces, or Targets, which with us cannot be conveyed
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:6897:309"/>
from place to place without great expence. <hi>Virgil</hi> calleth this luggage, <hi>Injustam fascem,</hi> because it seemeth to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, therein degenerating much from the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> discipline; wherein for ten dayes journie and more, every souldier carried his proper weapons both offensive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive, yea, and sometimes his victuals. What should we speake of the Armies of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> and <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> of <hi>Belus, Ninus, Semiramis, Cambises, Cyrus, Darius, Sesostris,</hi> and <hi>Sesacus</hi>? were they not as huge and populous, by the report of all histories, as these whereof wee intreat? Or in times lesse ancient, have not we and our ancestors seene the <hi>Arabians, Tartarians,</hi> and <hi>Turkes,</hi> invading Provinces with Armies of three hundred thousand people and upward? By moderne examples, and memory of later accidents, to give credit to the ancient, I will set downe that hapned in <hi>Angola,</hi> a noble and rich Province of the West <hi>Aethiope,</hi> adjoyning to <hi>Congo,</hi> reported by the letters of certaine <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> Captaines. In the yeare 1584. <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Diasius,</hi> by the favour of God and valour of his people, upon the second day of <hi>Februarie</hi> put to flight the King of <hi>Angola,</hi> and defeated his Armie, consisting of one million, and two hundred thousand <hi>Moores:</hi> which may well prove, that these populous Armies are of little service, and small continuance, rather like violent stormes, than dripping showres; and though with ease they are gathered, yet without greater provision than any Province is able to afford them, they are not easily held together. When their provision is spent they beginne to breake, and bid adue to the action; and that most commonly not in the midst of their course, but even in their first removes, for Merchants, Victualiers, Taylors, Shoomakers, and such like, follow not their warres; and if they should, then this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would follow; that for one million of souldiers, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

they needs sinke under their owne weight; which the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne Princes (leading these unaccustomed numbers upon long journeyes) in some fashion forecasting, did alwayes provide incredible masses of money, victuall, and such like warlike provisions, long before they entred into action; as was well seene in <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who to maintaine the great Army, as well at Sea as at Land, which he led for the conquest of <hi>Greece,</hi> spent seven yeares in preparation for the journey.</p>

                  <p>It is undoubtedly beleeved, that this King receiveth yearely twelve millions of ducats, of which he layeth up but two or three, the residue he expendeth upon the troopes of his souldiers, that is to say, forty thousand <hi>Nairs,</hi> and twenty thousand horsemen kept in continuall pay.

hundred Captaines, on condition to keepe in readinesse a proportion of Horsemen, Footmen, and Elephants. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of these Captaines (to some of whom he giveth a million of ducats yearely) may be an argument of his great revenues; for to these projects, this Prince and all the Potentates of the Fast, keepe in their possession all the profits of the lands, woods, mines, yea, and the waters of pooles and rivers, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their whole Dominions. No man may wash himselfe in <hi>Ganges,</hi> (which runneth by <hi>Bengala</hi>) nor in <hi>Ganga,</hi> (which watereth the Land of <hi>Orissa</hi>) before he hath paid toll to the King. The King himselfe is now inforced to buy this water, causing it to be brought unto him by long journies, upon a superstitious custome, either to bathe or to purge himselfe therein. He is absolute Lord of the bodies and goods of his subjects, which he shareth to himselfe and his Captaines, leaving the people nothing but their hands and labour: of lands the King hath three parts, and his Captaines the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due.

But to induce some measure of credit, let us compare the abilities of some Christian Princes with theirs. If the King of <hi>France</hi> were absolute Lord of all the lands and domaines of his whole dominion, (as these men are) it is thought that his yearely revenues would amount to fifteene millions, and yet therein are neither mines of gold nor silver.

Souldiers, as doth the King of <hi>Narsinga?</hi> Surely, whereas now the Kings revenues doe hardly suffice for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of foure thousand men at armes, and six thousand Crosse-bowes; if this allowance were added to the former, he might as easily maintaine an hundred and fifty thousand.</p>

Their continuall delight is
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:6897:313"/>
in their weapon, perswading themselves that no Nation go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth beyond them in skill and dexterity. Every one inureth himselfe to that weapon; whereto he findeth his body most agreeable. Their ancient weapons were the Javelin, the Bow, and the Sword; but after the comming of the <hi>Portugals</hi> they learned so exactly the mixture of metals, the casting of great Ordnance, and the practice thereof, that (some say) their artillery and powder surpasseth ours. They goe to warre all naked save their privities, neither use they head-peeces, which is the reason that in fights and skirmishes they shew exceeding agility, charging and retiring more like Falcons than Souldiers. When a man would take them to be farre off, he shall see them hovering round about him in a trice, so that it is as dangerous to follow them flying, as to deale with them fighting. They are swift as Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pards, and their flight as much to be feared as their charge. If they come to hand-strokes (which they will not doe but upon necessity or advantage) they use altogether to strike with the point. They binde Copper or Silver shingels to the hilts of their swords, the sound whereof instead of Drums and Trumpets, incourageth them to the incounter. They will lie so close under their bucklers, that you shall not see any part of their bodies lie open to the danger. There are one kinde of <hi>Naires</hi> (called <hi>Amochi</hi>) which curse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, their kindred and posterity with most bitter execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if they leave injuries done to their society unrevenged.

They inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit no Townes, but dwell in houses made of earth, invironed with hedges and woods, and their waies as intricate as into a labyrinth. Of what force this Kingdome is, may be gathered by the armie of 60000. souldiers, and 200. vessels of warre, which he levied 1503. against <hi>Edward Pachecho</hi> the King of <hi>Portugals</hi> Captaine, taking part that time with the King of <hi>Cochin:</hi> this war lasted almost five months. In the yeare 1529. with an army of 100000. he beleagred the fortresse which the <hi>Portugals</hi> built in <hi>Calecute,</hi> under the keeping of <hi>Iohn Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi> In this siege he spent a whole Winter, wherein although the <hi>Portugals</hi> behaved themselves valiantly, yet weighing the Kings forces, and their owne possibilities, they thought it best to destroy it with their owne hands. In the yeare 1601. he besieged <hi>Caile</hi> with 90000. men, and tooke it by compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. He hath more than once given an instance of his power at Sea. He is Lord of many havens, whereunto great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of shipping doe resort, and in that regard cannot chuse but be well furnished with a great Navie. But in goodnesse of shipping, and martiall discipline, we must needs confesse the Sea-forces of all the <hi>Indian</hi> Princes, to be farre inferiour to those of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> whose dominion (both at Sea and Land) nothing hath so much augmented as their defensive warfare. To speake truth, it seldome falleth out but the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man feareth the sword, and the armed man is more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged thereby, bearing himselfe bolder upon his skill, than his strength, and prevaileth more by temporizing, than by rash fighting; whereas the <hi>Barbarians</hi> putting more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in their numbers, than their goodnesse, have alwayes wanted that vertue which should make armies dreadfull and fortunate, which is good order and Discipline.</p>

They are in number sixty six, divided into three partialities: The first containeth nine; the second foure; the third fifty three. Amongst these, five are renowmed, but especially one for the famous Citie of <hi>Macao.</hi> And it is most commonly seene, that they who have the soveraigntie of those five, are Lords of all the rest. It is distant from <hi>New Spaine</hi> an hundred and fifty leagues; from <hi>China</hi> sixty. The soile is to be accounted rather barren than fertile. The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are of a very ready wit, and marvellous patient in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie. Their new borne children they immediatly wash in the rivers, and as soone as they are weaned, they take them from their mothers, and bring them up in labours of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and such like exercises. They goe bare-headed men very ambitious and desirous of honour. Povertie is no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to the Gentrie of their bloud. They will not suffer the least wrong to passe unrevenged: they salute one another with many courtesies: they are very staied, and of a setled resolution. They are very jealous to shew themselves feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or base-minded in word or deed: they will make no man privie of their losses or misfortunes; they have the like beasts both tame and wilde as wee have, but they will scarcely eat any thing save Herbs, Fish, Barley, or Rice; and if they doe, it is the flesh of wilde beasts taken by hunting. Of these

graines they make their Wines, and water mixt with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine precious powder, which they use, they account a dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie beverage: they call it <hi>Chia.</hi> Their buildings for the most part are of timber, partly because the upland places are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of quarries, but abounding with Cedars of admirable height and thicknesse fit for building, and partly because the Country is subject to Earth-quakes. In times past all <hi>Iapan</hi> obeyed one Prince, shewing him great obedience and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and this government endured with no lesse state and majestie, at the least sixteene hundred yeares, untill about seventie yeares since, by the rebellion of two of his chiefest Lieutenants, the whole Kingdome was distracted, each of them holding by armes whatsoever he atchieved by usurpation. By their example others becomming as ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, seized on the rest of the kingdome, some on one part, some on another, leaving nothing but the bare name of <hi>Dairi,</hi> which signifieth the Lord of all <hi>Iapan,</hi> with the title of <hi>Iucata, (viz.)</hi> King, to their rightfull Soveraigne.

For

all this, they are never at peace among themselves, by reason that the frontiers of their pettie jurisdictions neighbour so neere one upon another.

<pb n="638" facs="tcp:6897:323"/>
A fruitfull, sound, populous and well inhabited Countrey; wherein, as well for those beatitudes, as for the riches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (being infinite) the Vice-Roy of that Division keepeth his residence.</p>
                  <p>It divideth it selfe into three parts; The Plaines, the <hi>Sierras</hi> (mountaines,) and the <hi>Andes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Plaines lye upon the Sea-coast, and are out-stretched in length by the space of one thousand and five hundred miles, in breadth they are not above threescore, and where they are narrowest thirtie. These Plaines are gravelly, full of desarts, and for the most part barren, especially where freshets and lakes are wanting, being never releeved with raine nor showers. Those grounds that lye nigh the bankes of the Rivers, are very fruitfull, by reason of the discent of water all the Winter, distilling from the mountaines and rockes, which are not past seven or ten miles asunder: the residue further off, the husbandmen doe enforce with great industry by letting in sluces, and digging of channels to their plentifull harvest of Cotton-wooll and Corne. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this tract are a base people, cowardly and poore slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and living under trees and reeds, and feeding upon fish and raw flesh. The Mountaine Countrey is extended from North to South about one thousand miles, being distant not above twentie leagues from the Sea, and in some places lesse. They are very cold, and subject to continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all snow, wanting wood, and incumbred with Lions, Wolves, blacke Beares, Goats, and a certaine beast like a Camell, of whose wooll they worke them garments, and other utensils. These Mountaines are full of inhabitants, fertill and batefull, especially where the aire is indurable, and the Inhabitants more wittie, couragious, and civiller than the residue.</p>

                     <pb n="639" facs="tcp:6897:323"/>
The <hi>Andes</hi> are likewise mountaines: but lying in one continuall ridge without valleys, extending from North to South. Betweene which and the former, lyeth <hi>Callao,</hi> a Province full of Mountaines also, subject to cold, yet very populous. Thus much of the nature (in generall) of these halfe known places, of the soile and people: of their forces lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle can be spoken, by reason of their subjection to the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi> and inforced ignorance in matters of armes and policy.</p>
                  <p>It is rich in gold and silver, more than any Country in all the World, as may appeare by the yearely quantities thereof brought from thence. Yet say the Inhabitants, that in respect of the remainder, it is no more than if a man should take a few graines out of a sacke full of Corne. Which surely may carry some presumption of truth, considering what Authors write of <hi>Atabalipa</hi> his ransome, offered and performed in those daies, when Avarice was not in halfe so much request as now it is.</p>
                  <p>It wanteth no good thing that God hath created for the use of man, either for pleasure or necessity. Onely in this it is dispraisable, that (for the greater part) it bringeth forth Inhabitants of savage, irreligious, and inhumane behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, delighting in devouring of mans flesh, with other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane and undressed viands.</p>
                  <p>Summer and Winter beginneth with them as with us, upon the Hils; but in the plaine land it is cleane contrary. For when it is Summer in the Hils, it is Winter in the plaines: So that there the Summer beginneth in October, and continueth till <hi>April.</hi> Which for the exceeding strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, I have the rather noted, to see a man upon one day in the morning (in one and the same Country) travelling from the Hils to be well wet with raine, and before night to arrive in a pleasant &amp; sun-shining-Country, where from the

beginning of <hi>October</hi> (that is all their Summer long) it seldome or never raineth so much as to lay the dust in the high waies. But then it is sultry hot in the Plaines, and when any small due falleth, then is it faire weather on the Hils.</p>
                  <p>Yea, when the South-west winds blow in the plaine Country, which in other places are commonly moist, and causes of raine, there they are of cleane contrary effects.</p>
