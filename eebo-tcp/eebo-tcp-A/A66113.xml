            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THAT I presume to Prefix your <hi>Graces Name,</hi> to so Rude, and Hasty a Production; it is not because I think the following <hi>Treatise</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves your Acceptance, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I fear, it may need your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage.

               <hi>Author,</hi> who pretends to be the <hi>Champion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to stand up in Defence of the long Neglected <hi>Rights,</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi> of its <hi>Clergy;</hi> has some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it so Improper in Any, but especially so Unbecoming a <hi>Minister,</hi> of <hi>that Church;</hi> that I thought it would be Requisite for me, to take all the Care I could, to Remove those Prejudices, which this might be apt to raise, in some, against the very Design of my <hi>Discourse.</hi> And I knew no Way more effectually to do this, than by begging leave to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe what I had done to your <hi>Grace;</hi> who, as by Providence, you are placed in the <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>Highest Station,</hi> in Our <hi>Church;</hi> so have you, upon all Occasions, no less eminently signalized your self, in the Defence of it.</p>

It would, my <hi>Lord,</hi> look too much like Vanity in me, to say, that I here <hi>publish</hi> nothing, but what has, in some Measure, been before <hi>Approved</hi> of by your <hi>Grace.</hi> It shall suffice me, if I may be allow'd to declare thus much; That the <hi>Principles,</hi> upon which I go, are such, as in your <hi>Graces</hi> Judgment, have nothing in them that is either Contrary to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> or otherwise injurious to the <hi>Rights,</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Who the <hi>Person,</hi> against whom I Write, is; I neither do Know, nor am at all Sollicitous to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. But as his <hi>Principles</hi> seem but too much to look towards a <hi>Party,</hi> against which the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> ever has; and, I am perswaded will always be ready Vigorously to oppose her self:

so the Disaffection which appears, in the whole Process of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, to the <hi>present Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> sufficiently shews; that He had some farther Design in the publishing of it, than barely to assert the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and <hi>Convocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But of this let every One judge, as he sees Cause: My Business is with his <hi>Book,</hi> not with his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> or <hi>Design.</hi> In my <hi>Reply</hi> to which, as I have endeavour'd, according to my Ability, to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> the <hi>Cause</hi> both of the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Church;</hi> so, for the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> sake, if for nothing else, I thought I might presume to commend the Protection of it to your <hi>Grace,</hi> Who have so Great a Zeal for Both; and will therefore, I hope, be the rather disposed, to favour this Honest,

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I <hi>Am so well assured that I have asserted nothing, in the following Discourse, but what is agreeable to the</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>of the</hi> Church of England, <hi>that I shall not make the least Apology for decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my self against an</hi> Author, <hi>whose No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neither our</hi> Own, <hi>nor any other</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Church, <hi>that I know of, has ever approved; nor is there any Reason to expect that any</hi> Christian Prince <hi>should be content to allow of them. How this</hi> Gentleman <hi>came to be Engaged to write in Defence of the supposed</hi> Rights <hi>of our</hi> Convocations, <hi>I cannot tell: But sure I am he has done it in such a manner as is not much for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the</hi> Church; <hi>nor will, I suppose, at all encourage any One to stand up in</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:43857:6"/>
               <hi>That his main</hi> Assertion <hi>is New and Paradoxical; Contrary to the Sense of all the</hi> Learned <hi>in the</hi> Law, <hi>and Repugnant to the</hi> Constant Practice <hi>of our</hi> Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>ever since the time of</hi> Henry VIII, <hi>is certain; nor does He himself deny it.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Let. p. 40</note> 
               <hi>One would therefore have hoped, that his</hi> Arguments <hi>should have born some proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his</hi> Allegations; <hi>and that there should have been, at least, as much</hi> Weight <hi>in the</hi> One, <hi>as there was</hi> Assurance <hi>in the</hi> Other. <hi>But when I came to examine them, I found there was nothing formidable in this</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>but his</hi> Confidence: <hi>and that, like some empty</hi> Spectre, <hi>his power was only to</hi> fright <hi>such, as had not the Resolution to</hi> Speak <hi>to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any one shall ask, how I came to Oppose so large an</hi> Answer <hi>to a</hi> Letter <hi>so little in Bulk, and so much yet less in Weight and Substance; He may please to know, that the much</hi> Greatest, <hi>as well as most</hi> Useful, <hi>part of the following Book, has no concern at all with it, but was only Written upon Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it. I was willing to lay hold on the Opportunity which this</hi> Author <hi>had given Me, to search, as far as my Leisure would permit, into this Subject; and having so done, I was no less willing to communicate what I had met with to the World; not


<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:43857:6"/>
knowing but that some others might receive as much Satisfaction from these</hi> Researches, <hi>as, I was sensible, I my self had done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It has been complain'd of by this</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <note place="margin">Let. p. 28</note> 
               <hi>as no small Neglect in Those of our</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, <hi>that they are, for the most part, but little acquainted with the</hi> Rights <hi>and</hi> Power <hi>of an</hi> English Convocation: <hi>And indeed a</hi> Subject <hi>it is, that has but very little been searcht out by them, or Examined by any O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of our</hi> Antiquaries, <hi>for Them. I may presume to say I have here published more, than I have ever yet met with, in any One Piece, upon this</hi> Argument: <hi>But yet, when that is said, I am not so carried away with an undue Opinion of my own</hi> Performance, <hi>as not to know, that what is here publish'd, is, at most, but an imperfect</hi> Essay; <hi>and, like the</hi> first Lines <hi>of a</hi> Draught, <hi>shews rather what I</hi> design'd, <hi>than what I have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in any tolerable manner, to</hi> finish.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I cannot deny but that, next to the</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Divine things, <hi>there is nothing I should rather desire to Understand, than the</hi> Laws <hi>and</hi> Antiquities <hi>of the</hi> Country <hi>in which I live; but especially of the</hi> Church <hi>in which I minister. And I am not a little pleas'd to see, that there are, at this time, so many Persons, of Excellent Parts, no less addicted to these</hi> Researches, <hi>and much


<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:43857:7"/>
better Able to pursue them, than I am. It may possibly be some provocation to One, or Other of These, to give us a more perfect Account of the</hi> present Subject, <hi>to see how little is here done in it. The</hi> Argument <hi>certainly deserves Consideration; and I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wish it a</hi> better Hand, <hi>and a</hi> better Head <hi>too than any that has yet appear'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the following</hi> Treatise, <hi>having first</hi> stated <hi>the</hi> Subject <hi>I was to go upon, and settled the</hi> Method <hi>I thought most proper to be observed in the prosecution of it; I, in the next place, go on to lay the Foundation of what I had to say with Reference to our</hi> own Laws <hi>and</hi> Constitutions, <hi>upon the</hi> Practice <hi>and</hi> Opinions <hi>of the</hi> Antient Church; <hi>and of all the</hi> Christian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries <hi>round about us, for above 800 years after</hi> Christ. <hi>I consider'd that the</hi> Church of England, <hi>beyond most</hi> Churches <hi>in the World, has a peculiar Veneration for the</hi> Discipline, <hi>as well as</hi> Doctrine <hi>of the</hi> Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church. <hi>And I thought it would be no small Evidence of my good Intentions towards it, upon this Occasion, to shew, that I pretended to nothing in behalf of our</hi> own Kings, <hi>but what the</hi> Bishops <hi>and</hi> Clergy, <hi>from the</hi> fourth Century <hi>downwards, had readily allow'd to their</hi> Emperours; <hi>And

what all Other</hi> Christian Princes <hi>continued to Enjoy, till the</hi> Papal Authority <hi>prevail'd over Them, and deprived them of that</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy <hi>in</hi> Ecclesiastical matters, <hi>which They</hi> originally <hi>had; and to which the</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation <hi>has again so justly restored them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now, having laid so good a Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I thought I might proceed the more freely to Enquire into the</hi> Case <hi>of our own</hi> Country; <hi>and see what</hi> Authority <hi>the</hi> King of England <hi>has over his</hi> Convocations; <hi>and by what</hi> Law <hi>or</hi> Custom <hi>he enjoys that</hi> Authority? <hi>In this, I was forc'd to confine myself within the time of the</hi> Reformation; <hi>because it was about the</hi> Beginning <hi>of</hi> that, <hi>that</hi> Our Kings <hi>were restored to their</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy <hi>in this, as well as in other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; or at least had their</hi> Authority <hi>more solemnly recognized by the</hi> Clergy, <hi>and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished by the</hi> Parliament, <hi>than ever it had been before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But lest such a</hi> Supremacy <hi>as this, should seem to depend rather upon the</hi> Authority <hi>of an</hi> Act of Parliament, <hi>than to be derived from that</hi> Original Power, <hi>in</hi> Ecclesiastical Causes, <hi>which belongs to all</hi> Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>and to Ours as well as to any; and which was Exercised by them many</hi> Ages, <hi>before any</hi> Statute <hi>was made to intitle them thereunto; Having shewn what the</hi> Law, <hi>as to these


<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:43857:8"/>
matters, now is; I thought it might not be amiss to enlarge my Enquiry, and to see how the Case has stood, in this particular, from the first Conversion of the</hi> Saxons, <hi>to the time wherein I began my former Disquisition. And upon search I found, and, I think, have plainly made it appear, that the</hi> Authority <hi>I here assert to the</hi> King, <hi>is no other than what our most antient</hi> Princes, <hi>till about 1100 years after</hi> Christ, <hi>continued to</hi> exercise; <hi>and even then claim'd a</hi> Right <hi>too, when they were not any longer permitted to</hi> excercise <hi>it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If in pursuing of this Enquiry through so many</hi> past Ages, <hi>I have sometimes taken the liberty to fill up those Vacancies, which, (through the want of Materials proper for such an Undertaking,) often fall in my way; with Reflections a little foreign to my proper Business, I hope it will not be taken for any great Offence, in a Work of this Nature: especially considering that my very</hi> Digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>are rather not directly to the purpose of my present Subject, than altogether distant from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the remainder of my discourse, which is spent in</hi> Answering <hi>the</hi> Letter to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation-man; <hi>I shall only say thus much, that I have not designedly either over-look'd any of its</hi> Arguments, <hi>or made an imperfect, much less a false Representation of them. I


<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:43857:8"/>
have</hi> examined <hi>every thing that seem'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable enough to be taken notice of, and I hope, have fully</hi> answered <hi>what I have</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am not aware that, in doing of this, I have given my Adversary any hard Treatment, tho' I cannot but say, He has taken care oftentimes to deserve it. But I thought it unreasonable to be</hi> guilty <hi>of that my self, which I look'd upon to have been a fault in Him. 'Tis true, I have all along spoken my mind with great freedom; and where I sound any thing amiss have not stuck to own it, tho'it seemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon those of my own Order. Till</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men <hi>cease to be</hi> Men, <hi>they will be guilty not only of</hi> Follies <hi>and</hi> Imprudencies, <hi>but of</hi> Sins <hi>too, as well as others: and to what purpose should I dissemble that, which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be confess'd or not, all the World knows to be but too True. Were our</hi> Faults <hi>so</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, <hi>that to</hi> allow <hi>of them were to</hi> publish <hi>them; I am sure no One should be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to hide them than I would be: But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive it to be either for the</hi> Credit <hi>or</hi> Interest <hi>of the</hi> Church, <hi>to</hi> dissemble <hi>those</hi> Vices, <hi>which those who</hi> Commit <hi>them take no Care to</hi> Conceal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any one should be so unreasonable, as to take occasion from hence to think hardly of our</hi> Profession, <hi>or to be scandalized at our</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,


<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:43857:9"/>
               <hi>for the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faults of those who</hi> minister <hi>in It; I would only desire them to consider that we live in an</hi> unhappy Age, <hi>and make up a</hi> large Number <hi>of</hi> Men; <hi>and it can hardly be thought, but that where so many thousands</hi> wait <hi>at the</hi> Altar, <hi>some there should be, who are much fitter to be</hi> cast out <hi>of the</hi> Church, <hi>than to</hi> officiate <hi>in it. In the mean time, God be thanked, Many there are who are as</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent <hi>for their</hi> Piety, <hi>as some others are</hi> Notorious <hi>for their</hi> Irregularities: <hi>and this Advantage they ought to have, to</hi> recommend <hi>our</hi> Religion, <hi>beyond what the others should have to</hi> defame <hi>it; that these live agreeably to the</hi> Rules <hi>of their</hi> Holy Profession, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the others must be confess'd to have scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalously departed from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To conclude; the following</hi> Treatise, <hi>as it was truly intended for the Service of the</hi> Church of England, <hi>so I hope it may be of some</hi> Use <hi>to many in it. At least it will sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Those who have taken Offence at the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here</hi> examined, <hi>that it speaks not the Sense of</hi> All, <hi>if of</hi> any, <hi>of our</hi> Clergy: <hi>And shew, that many there be who no less dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve the</hi> Assertions <hi>of this</hi> Author, <hi>than they are justly offended at his</hi> Bold <hi>and</hi> Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Reflections.</p>

take the liberty to examine what Ground there is for so invidious a Suggestion; and have as much <hi>Right</hi> to transgress in <hi>behalf</hi> of <hi>Authority,</hi> as this <hi>Gentleman</hi> has taken to <hi>offend against</hi> it.</p>
               <p>And the Method that I shall choose, for the clearing of this Subject, shall be this:</p>
               <p>First, I will enquire (as to the matter <note place="margin">Letter. p. 1. 21.</note> of <hi>Right)</hi> whether there be any <hi>Law,</hi> that <hi>Commands,</hi> or <hi>Permits,</hi> the <hi>sitting</hi> and <hi>acting</hi> of the <hi>Convocation;</hi> besides the <hi>absolute,</hi> free <hi>Pleasure</hi> of the <hi>Prince?</hi> And, if there be, What that <hi>Law</hi> is?

               <p>Secondly, Consider, What <hi>Occasion</hi> there is at present for a <hi>Convocation?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ib p. 1. 2.</note> And whether the <hi>Necessity</hi> of its <hi>Meeting</hi> and <hi>Acting</hi> be so <hi>great;</hi> and the <hi>Delay</hi> of it so <hi>dangerous,</hi> as our <hi>Author</hi> pretends it to be.</p>
               <p>As for his <hi>Third Question,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the <hi>Validity</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> of a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> any farther than they are <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd,</hi> and <hi>Approved</hi> of, by <hi>Parliament;</hi> that is not much insisted upon by our <hi>Author:</hi> And what is needful to be said

to it, will incidentally fall in, in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the other <hi>Two.</hi>

                  <hi>first</hi> and <hi>main Thing</hi> to be consider'd is this:</p>

                  <q>Whether there is any <hi>Law</hi> that <hi>commands</hi> or <hi>permits</hi> the <hi>Sitting</hi> and <hi>Acting</hi> of the <hi>Convocation;</hi> besides the <hi>absolute, free Pleasure</hi> of the <hi>Prince?</hi> And, if there be, <hi>What</hi> that <hi>Law</hi> is?

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:43857:32"/>
since the Empire became <hi>Christian;</hi> So neither does it appear, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> have ever made any Complaints against Them, as usurping herein upon the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> or pleaded any <hi>Privilege,</hi> as of <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> for their <hi>Meeting,</hi> and <hi>Acting</hi> against their <hi>Consent.</hi>

               <p>But to the End it may the more Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently Appear how far the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Princes</hi> has been accounted to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, as to this Particular; I shall to that General Deduction, I have now made, of the <hi>Authority</hi> by which the <hi>Church</hi> has been accustomed, from the Beginning, to meet together in <hi>Councils;</hi> subjoin a few more particular Remarks, for the better clearing of this whole matter.</p>
               <p>And <hi>(1st.)</hi> It may be observed, that <note place="margin">§ 14.</note> tho' the <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> has generally <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised</hi> with his <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> upon these Occasions; and ask'd their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether it were fitting, or not, to <hi>call</hi> a <hi>Synod,</hi> before he has given Orders for the meeting of it: Yet was this never look'd upon as any matter of <hi>Right;</hi> but, on the contrary, <hi>Princes</hi> have oftentimes assembled such <hi>Councils,</hi> without ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting Them at All; and, at others, when their <hi>Bishops,</hi> have not only <hi>Advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> but <hi>Desired</hi> them so to do, have yet,


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:43857:32"/>
upon their <hi>Own Judgment,</hi> or by the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of their <hi>Council,</hi> utterly refused to comply with their Requests.</p>
               <p>If we look into the <hi>Acts</hi> of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Synods</hi> I have before mention'd; we shall find indeed, sometimes, that the <hi>Advice</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> was taken for their Meeting; but we shall oftner find them call'd by the <hi>Prince,</hi> with the <hi>Advice</hi> of his <hi>Great Men;</hi> and yet oftner, no notice at all taken of the <hi>Advice</hi> of <hi>Either.</hi>

                  <hi>Bishops,</hi> in vain, petition <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> that a Free, and Orthodox <hi>Council</hi> might be Call'd to judge in the Case of <hi>Athanasius;</hi> but could never Obtain it. And tho' the method taken by that <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi> to manage that Affair in Favour of the <hi>Arians;</hi> and the Refusal of such a <hi>Council,</hi> as was desired, was the Effect of that Enmity he had conceived against Them, and their Doctrine; yet we do not find the <hi>Catholick Bishops</hi> any where complain, that, in this, the <hi>Emperor</hi> did any more than what he had <hi>Authority</hi> to do; or pretend to any <hi>Original, Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Power,</hi> left them by <hi>Christ,</hi> to call such a <hi>Synod</hi> whether He would or no. But, on the contrary, notwithstanding the Urgency of that Affair, and the eager


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43857:33"/>
Desire they had to end it; neither <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> nor Any others, attempted to meet against the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s Command; but quietly submitted to the <hi>Prohibition</hi> he had laid upon Them, not to do so. So little did the greatest <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in those Days, think it lawful, to hold a <hi>Council</hi> against the <hi>Prince's Will;</hi> that being forbidden by an <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Emperor,</hi> and that against all Right and Justice, on purpose that he might Oppress Them, so to Do; They yet submitted to his Commands, and chose rather to suffer by their Obedience, than to Usurp an Authority, which they were sensible did not belong to Them.</p>
               <p>But lest this should be thought to have been only the Perverseness of an <hi>Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prince;</hi> we shall find the same <hi>Power,</hi> both <hi>Claim'd,</hi> and <hi>Exercised,</hi> by the most <hi>Orthodox Emperors;</hi> and such as were, in all Respects, the most zealous for the <hi>Churches</hi> Interest.</p>

               <p>And thus have I shewn what the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <note place="margin">§ 19.</note> of the <hi>Supreme Civil Magistrate</hi> is, as to the Business of <hi>Assembling Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Synods,</hi> or <hi>Convocations.</hi> And the Sum of what I have proved, is, in short, this: * That it is the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Christian Princes</hi> to <hi>call</hi> such <hi>Assemblies;</hi> and that they cannot <hi>lawfully meet,</hi> but as they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>commanded,</hi> or <hi>allow'd</hi> of by <hi>Them.</hi> * That <hi>They,</hi> and not the <hi>Clergy,</hi> are <hi>Judges</hi> when it is proper to <hi>Convene</hi> them: * And ought not to be censured for not assembling of them, when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded it is <hi>Needless,</hi> or would be <hi>Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi> for Them so to do. * That even the <hi>Ordinary Synods, required</hi> by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> and <hi>allow'd</hi> of by <hi>Themselves,</hi> may yet upon <hi>just Grounds</hi> be stop'd by them: (And when there is a <hi>just Reason</hi> for them so to do, they are to judge:) And being so <hi>prohibited,</hi> cannot be <hi>lawfully Assembled.</hi>


                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:43857:38"/>
In short: * That when-ever they do meet, the <hi>Prince</hi> is not only to <hi>appoint,</hi> or at least to <hi>approve,</hi> of the <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> of their <hi>Meeting;</hi> but may give Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the <hi>Choice</hi> of the <hi>Persons</hi> that are to compose them: That so he may be satisfied that they are such, whose <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Temper,</hi> have fitted them to serve the <hi>Church;</hi> and in whose <hi>Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,</hi> himself may safely confide.</p>
               <p>It were an easie matter to argue the Reasonableness of every one of these <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,</hi> from the <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>Civil-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> that is necessary to be placed in the Hands of the <hi>Supreme Magistrate,</hi> in order to those <hi>Ends.</hi> And I need not say that Christianity came not to Usurp upon the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to engage Men to be the more ready to render that Duty, which they owe, to it. 'Tis true, by these means, the busie Tempers of some forward Men may be restrain'd; and to such these <hi>Limitations</hi> may seem very Odious, and Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But they are such Men, and such Tempers, that make these Restrictions necessary: And their Unwillingness to submit to them, shews but the more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how fitting it is that <hi>Princes</hi> should have all that <hi>Power</hi> I have now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:43857:38"/>
to prevent them from doing both <hi>Themselves</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> a Mischief.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Princes</hi> may abuse this Power to the Detriment of the <hi>Church,</hi> is no more an Argument that they ought not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it; than it would be, that they ought not to be entrusted with a <hi>Civil Power,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they may abuse that too, to the ruine of the <hi>State.</hi> But I am apt to believe, that were the Dangers to be weigh'd, it would be much more fatal both to the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> to have some Men intrusted with an <hi>Immoderate Liberty;</hi> than others with a <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> to restrain them. And 'tis enough to answer all Pretences of this nature, to say, that whenever the <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> shall so far abuse his <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> as to render it necessary for the <hi>Clergy,</hi> by some extraordinary <hi>Methods,</hi> to provide for the <hi>Churches Welfare;</hi> that <hi>Necessity</hi> will warrant their taking of them. In the mean time, such an <hi>Authority</hi> as I have now shewn, the <hi>Prince</hi> has in these Matters; and till things come to such an Extremity, we must leave him, as of <hi>Right</hi> he ought, to enjoy it.</p>
               <p>And this may suffice for the First thing proposed in this Enquiry; <hi>viz.</hi> To shew, What <hi>Power</hi> the <hi>Christian Prince</hi> has, in the <hi>calling</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastical Synods</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:43857:39"/>
I go on <hi>(2dly)</hi> To consider, What <hi>Authority</hi> He has over Them, when They are Assembled?</p>
               <p>Now that may, I conceive, be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to these (2) Particulars: <note place="margin">§ 20.</note>

                  <hi>Council,</hi> with which to <hi>consult</hi> of the things pertaining to <hi>Both.</hi> Now as in <hi>Civil Matters</hi> he has his <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and the <hi>Council</hi> of his <hi>Great Men,</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> to advise Him how to manage his <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Concerns:</hi> so in those things which are of a <hi>pure Ecclesiastical Nature,</hi> it has ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally been the Method of <hi>Christian Princes,</hi> to take the Opinion of their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> and <hi>Clergy;</hi> either <hi>single,</hi> or <hi>conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> together; as the <hi>Importance,</hi> or <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi> of <hi>Affairs,</hi> and the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of <hi>Times,</hi> have prompted them to do.</p>
               <p>But then, if this be the main <hi>End</hi> for which <hi>Synods</hi> are call'd, it will follow, that the <hi>Prince</hi> must have a <hi>Right,</hi> not only by Vertue of his <hi>Supreme Authority,</hi> but from the very Nature of the Thing it self, to propose to Them the <hi>Subject</hi> on which they are to proceed. It being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to imagine, that either a <hi>Particular Person</hi> should be <hi>sent</hi> for, or a <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> be <hi>convened,</hi> on purpose to give the <hi>Prince</hi> their <hi>Advice;</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi> not be left to <hi>propose</hi> his <hi>Doubts</hi> to them, and shew them wherein it is that He <hi>needs,</hi> Or <hi>desires,</hi> their <hi>Opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Direction</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> as to the Subject of the <hi>Synods Debates,</hi> may be


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:43857:40"/>
either <hi>General,</hi> or <hi>Particular;</hi> or it may be <hi>partly One,</hi> and partly the <hi>Other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes the <hi>Prince</hi> has only decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">§ 22.</note> to his Clergy, that he call'd them to deliberate, at large, either upon Matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> or Matters of <hi>Discipline;</hi> for the better demonstrating the <hi>Churches Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> and <hi>Consent,</hi> in the <hi>One;</hi> or for the better establishing the <hi>Exercise</hi> of the <hi>Other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes the Occasion of their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, has been to examine some <hi>particular Controversie,</hi> that has risen up, to <hi>corrupt</hi> the <hi>Faith,</hi> or to divide the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> As was especially seen in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>Arius,</hi> and the other <hi>Hereticks,</hi> on whose account the first <hi>General Councils</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> were called.</p>
               <p>And in Both these, sometimes the <hi>Prince</hi> has limited their Business to the particular Consideration of that <hi>Matter alone,</hi> for which they were assembled; At other times, he has added to it such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Incidental Affairs,</hi> as he has thought fit to propose to them; Or, it may be, has given them a <hi>General Liberty,</hi> after having done their main Business, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate on any thing else, that they should

judge necessary, for the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as there is such a Variety in the <hi>Ends,</hi> for which <hi>Christian Princes</hi> have been moved to call such <hi>Synods;</hi> so may there be no less a Difference observed, in the Ways which they have taken, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their <hi>Wills</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>Sometimes both the <hi>Design,</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of their <hi>Meeting,</hi> have been fully set down in the <hi>Precepts,</hi> which have been sent to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> to require their <hi>coming together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes only a Glance has, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, been given, in Those, at their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness; and the rest been reserved to be more fully open'd to them at their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. And that also has been done, sometimes by a <hi>Synodical Epistle,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> sent to them; sometimes by <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>mouth:</hi> And that again, either by the <hi>Prince</hi> himself, if he has thought fit (as oftentimes <hi>Princes</hi> have) to sit with them; or by some <hi>other Person,</hi> whom he has deputed to declare his Will to them.</p>
               <p>But how great a Variety soever there <note place="margin">§ 23.</note> has been, in the Methods that have been taken to lay open their Business to them; this is certain, that as the calling of such


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:43857:41"/>
Assemblies, has always depended upon the <hi>Consent,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Prince;</hi> So, when they were assembled, the <hi>Subject</hi> of their Debates has been prescribed them by the same <hi>Power;</hi> and they have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated on nothing, but what they have been <hi>directed,</hi> or <hi>Allow'd</hi> by the <hi>Prince</hi> to do.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Constantine,</hi> the first Christian Emperor, being desirous to restore that Peace to the Church, which the <hi>Heresie</hi> of <hi>Arius,</hi> and the Difference between the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>Western Churches,</hi> about the time of keeping <hi>Easter,</hi> had so dangerously broken, assembled the <hi>First General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Nice; Eusebius</hi> tells us that, at the <note place="margin">Euseb. de Vit. Const. lib: 3. cap. 12.</note> Opening of it, He earnestly Exhorted the <hi>Bishops,</hi> by their wise Resolutions, to settle all things in Quiet and Unity. And accordingly the <hi>Subject</hi> of their <hi>Debates</hi> turn'd upon those <hi>two Points;</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> himself both assisted at Them, <note place="margin">Ibid. cap. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
                  </note> and consented to what was resolved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Them.</p>
               <p>When this did not prevail, but that the <hi>Arian</hi> Faction was resolved, at any rate, to Ruine <hi>Athanasius;</hi> and since they could not corrupt the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> were determined, at least, to Overwhelm him who had been the main Supporter of it;


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:43857:41"/>
And in Order thereunto another <hi>Synod</hi> was obtain'd of the Emperor to meet at <hi>Tyre:</hi> the same <hi>Constantine</hi> not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed them their <hi>Business; viz.</hi> to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine <note place="margin">Ibid. lib. 4. cap. 42, 43.</note> into the <hi>Dissensions</hi> of the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> but sent <hi>Dionysius,</hi> in his own stead, to be present at their Assemblies, and to take care that his Orders were in all things observed by them.</p>
               <p>And the same was the Method which <hi>Constantius,</hi> his Son, observed, as to these Matters: As is evident from his Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Great <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Arminum,</hi> in <note place="margin">Sozom. Hist. Eccl. lib. 4. cap. 17.</note> which above 400 <hi>Bishops</hi> were, by his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Assembled. He commanded Them, in the first place, to debate the <hi>Matter of Faith;</hi> then to judge the <hi>Causes</hi> of those <hi>Bishops,</hi> who complain'd that they had been unjustly either <hi>deposed,</hi> or <hi>banished:</hi> After that to Examine the <hi>Crimes</hi> laid to the Charge of <hi>certain Others:</hi> And, last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, having done what he had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Them to do, to send a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Body to Him, to account to Him what had been resolved by Them.</p>
               <p>But above all most plain was that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which the Emperors <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi> shew'd in this particular, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Act. Conc. Eph. ap. Labb. To. iii. p. 436.</note> at the <hi>General Council</hi> of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> They not only declared, at large, to the <hi>Fathers</hi>

               <p>As for the Kingdom of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Councils of <hi>Toledo,</hi> as they are the most Eminent of that Countrey, so do they sufficiently shew the same Course to have obtained there, that we see did prevail in all Other Parts.

                  <hi>Manner,</hi> and the <hi>Method,</hi> of their <hi>Proceedings</hi> in Them.</p>
               <p>Now this, as far as concerns the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> both of the <hi>Members</hi> of every <hi>such Assembly,</hi> and of those who meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon the <hi>Occasion,</hi> or <hi>Account,</hi> of it; is not to be doubted.

               <p>But the <hi>Prince</hi> has an <hi>Authority,</hi> as to these Matters, beyond this: <hi>viz.</hi> to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe not only the <hi>Subject,</hi> upon which <hi>Synods</hi> are to <hi>debate;</hi> but withal, after what <hi>Manner,</hi> and in what <hi>Order,</hi> they shall proceed to <hi>debate</hi> upon It. And to this End it was, (as well as for Peace, and Quietness sake,) that when They were not present <hi>Themselves,</hi> they commonly deputed some <hi>Commissioners</hi> in their stead, to hold the <hi>Fathers</hi> to the <hi>Rules</hi> by which they were order'd to proceed: And not suffer them to meddle with any <hi>Other Matters,</hi> than those which belong'd to Them; or with those, in any <hi>Other Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> than the <hi>Prince</hi> had appointed them to do,</p>

               <p>For First, He declared to the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>both Parts,</hi> that but <hi>seven</hi> of a side should speak: Yet so, that <hi>seven</hi> more should be <hi>present,</hi> with whom Those who spake might, at any time, Go aside, and Confer in private, about any thing that should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise to be debated at that Meeting.</p>
               <p>Next, He appointed the <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> of the <hi>Conference;</hi> and forbad any Consluence, either of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi>


                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:43857:46"/>
or of the <hi>Laity</hi> of either Part, to come to it.</p>
               <p>And, lastly, To the End that this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> might finally conclude these kind of <hi>Disputes;</hi> He oblig'd all the <hi>Bishops</hi> of each side to promise, under their hands, that they would Abide by whatever their Delegates did. And that no Exceptions might be taken at the <hi>Report</hi> of the <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> He order'd them to chuse <hi>Four Notaries,</hi> out of their <hi>Clergy,</hi> to transcribe what was spoken; and that <hi>Four Bishops</hi> of a side should be nominated, to Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look those <hi>Notaries;</hi> and see what was transcribed, and digested, by them. And that whatsoever Any one said, should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly be signed, first by <hi>Marcellinus</hi> himself, and then by <hi>Him</hi> who <hi>spake</hi> it: that so there might be no Contradiction made to the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of that <hi>Account</hi> which should afterwards be given of it.</p>
               <p>These were the <hi>Rules,</hi> which <hi>Marcelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> by the <hi>Emperor's</hi> Authority, prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for the proceeding in that <hi>Conference;</hi> and according to these <hi>Measures,</hi> both <hi>Parties</hi> were obliged to proceed in it.</p>
               <p>It would betray a Desire to Cavil, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than assord any solid Exception to this Instance, to dispute, Whether this Meeting might properly be called a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi>


                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:43857:47"/>
seeing it is plain it was a meeting of <hi>Ecclesiastical Persons,</hi> upon an <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Affair:</hi> And there can no reason be given, why, if the <hi>Emperor</hi> has so much Authority over such an <hi>Assembly,</hi> He should not have as great a <hi>Power,</hi> over any other of the like kind. But yet that all possible Exception may be Removed, as to this particular; I will further shew, from the Instances of several <hi>undoubted,</hi> and even <hi>General Synods,</hi> that he has the same <hi>Right</hi> to direct their Proceedings, as those of any Other Convention.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Theodosius</hi> appointed <hi>Candidian,</hi> to take care of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in the <hi>General Council</hi> of <hi>Ephesus:</hi> his Commission was limited, and he was <note place="margin">Act.

that <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Antioeh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hinder'd Fifteen days in coming to <hi>Ephesus;</hi> wrote to <hi>Cyril, Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> not to tarry any longer for him, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in his Business without him. The <hi>Synod</hi> thereupon Summon <hi>Nestorius</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before them. This <hi>Nestorius</hi> refuses; and, in his Excuse, pleads that the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> with his <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> was not yet arriv'd. The <hi>Fathers</hi> not accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Excuse, after several Summons sent to him, proceed to Examine his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> and unanimously agree to his <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</hi> It was but a very little while after this, that <hi>John,</hi> the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Ephesus:</hi> And being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry that the <hi>Council</hi> had ended this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without him, form'd another <hi>Synod,</hi> consisting of about Thirty <hi>Metropolitans</hi> that came with him; and depos'd <hi>Cyril, President</hi> of the <hi>Council,</hi> and <hi>Memnon Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> for what they had done: In requital whereof <hi>Cyril,</hi> and the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> Suspend both <hi>John,</hi> and his <hi>Synod,</hi> for proceeding by themselves; in so Un-cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical, and unjustifiable a Manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Candidian,</hi> who in all this had favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> reports what had been done, on both sides, to <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius:</hi>

And <hi>Theodosius</hi> immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinds all that had pass'd, upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, That they had not proceeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Method</hi> he had <hi>prescribed</hi> to them; and commands them not to proceed to any farther Censures, until they had settled the <hi>doctrine of Faith,</hi> and receiv'd some New Directions from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; which he promis'd to send by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commissioner, whom he design'd to depute together with <hi>Candidian,</hi> to look after them.</p>
               <p>The Answer of the <hi>Council</hi> to this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Emperor</hi> is very remarkable, and clearly settles the <hi>Princes Right</hi> as to this particular. They pretend not that he had no <hi>Power,</hi> thus to Limit their Proceedings; or to <hi>annul</hi> their <hi>Acts,</hi> upon this pretence, that they had not proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to his Directions. No, but they beg leave to inform him, that <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didian</hi> had not made a fair <hi>Report</hi> of their Actions to him: and therefore intreat the <hi>Emperor</hi> that he would order <hi>Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> with Five of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> to come to him; who should satisfie him that all things had been done <hi>Canonically</hi> by the <hi>Council.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Such Authority has the <hi>Christian Prince</hi> to direct the <hi>Acts</hi> of the most <hi>General Councils;</hi> and to require an Observance of their Directions. I proceed,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[2dly]</hi> To shew, That for the better <note place="margin">§ 27.</note> Exercise of this <hi>Authority,</hi> He has also a Right, if he pleases, to <hi>sit</hi> in them, and to <hi>preside</hi> over them.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Constantine,</hi> the first Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, <note place="margin">Euseb. de Vit. Const. l. <hi>iii.</hi> c. 10. 13. 17.

to them; and it was their <hi>Civil Affairs</hi> that prevented them, when they did not.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Marcian</hi> not only removed the Fourth <hi>General Council</hi> to <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> on <note place="margin">Act Conc. Chalced. <hi>par. i.

And when, by Order of the <hi>Council,</hi> their Determination was read <note place="margin">Ibid. Act. <hi>vi.</hi> p. 577. Edit.

               </p>
               <p>And having done this, he deliver'd to the Fathers Three <hi>Ecclesiastical Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ready drawn up, to be approved of by Them; and they all gave their <hi>una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Assent</hi> to them.</p>

But more frequent was the Custom of <note place="margin">§ 28.</note> those Kings, who Govern'd in those <hi>States</hi> which arose out of the Dissolution of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> to <hi>sit,</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> with their <hi>Synods.</hi>

               <p>If we look to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> I <note place="margin">Vid. Act. Concil.

               <p>And how far the Design of this <hi>Canon</hi> was to extend, may at large be seen in the <hi>Injunction</hi> made thereupon by the <hi>Emperour;</hi> which we find in the <hi>Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the same <hi>Capitularies,</hi> according to the Edition of <hi>Benedictus Levita,</hi> pag. 823.

               <p>From what has been said, I may now, I conceive, take it for granted, That the <note place="margin">§ 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Prince</hi> has a Right either to <hi>preside</hi> over his <hi>Synods</hi> in <hi>Person;</hi> Or (if he rather thinks fit,) to appoint his <hi>Commissioner</hi> to do it in his stead.

               <p>And, <hi>1st.</hi> As I have observed, that One great End of his Sitting there is, to keep the <hi>publick Peace,</hi> and to see that all things be <hi>Regularly,</hi> and <hi>Quietly,</hi> transa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, by the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> in them; So it must also be allow'd, that He has all that <hi>Power</hi> over Them, that is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the obtaining of this End.

And, if any shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so disorderly as to need it, He may, as the antient <hi>Emperors</hi> did, not only <hi>commit</hi> such turbulent, seditious Persons, to <hi>safe Custody,</hi> and punish them according to the Nature of their Offence; but, if need be, may annul the <hi>Acts</hi> that were so tumultuously and irregularly done by Them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2dly.</hi> In the <hi>Debates</hi> of every such <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi> of whatever kind they be, the <hi>Prince</hi> may freely join with the <hi>Synod;</hi> and offer any <hi>Objections,</hi> or propose any <hi>Difficulties,</hi> He shall think fit; in order to his being better convinced of the <hi>Truth</hi> of what is to be <hi>believed;</hi> or of the <hi>Expediency</hi> of what is <hi>determined</hi> by it.

               <p>It has, I know, been speciously <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> against this, that <hi>Princes</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

If not, I am sure the Generality of <hi>Christians</hi> will be left under very hard <hi>Circumstances;</hi> who must, at last, <hi>believe</hi> as the <hi>Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves;</hi> and pin their <hi>Faith</hi> upon <hi>the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of their <hi>Clergy;</hi> and <hi>neither</hi> be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow'd to <hi>judge</hi> of the <hi>Grounds</hi> of it, nor, if once in an Error, be capable of ever being <hi>convinced</hi> of it. But if therefore it must be confess'd, that an <hi>Argument</hi> may be <hi>managed</hi> by <hi>Learned Men,</hi> in such wise, as to convince those that are <hi>not Learned,</hi> on which side the <hi>Truth</hi> lies; then certainly the <hi>Prince</hi> may also be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable

of discerning whether his <hi>Synod</hi> has <hi>Reason</hi> for their <hi>Definitions,</hi> or not; tho' He has not perhaps himself Read so much <hi>Divinity,</hi> as to be able to enter into the <hi>Learned Part</hi> of the <hi>Debate</hi> with the <hi>Fathers</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Whether therefore it be a <hi>Matter of Faith,</hi> or a <hi>Matter of Discipline;</hi> I see no Reason why the <hi>Prince,</hi> if he think fit, may not only be present when the <hi>Synod</hi> debates about it; but may not also enter into the <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Cause</hi> with Them: and <hi>propose</hi> his <hi>Doubts,</hi> and <hi>manage</hi> his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi> and do whatsoever is requisite to his full <hi>Information,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> Concerning it.</p>
               <p>And having done this, I add <hi>3dly.</hi> That as <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> did in the Great <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Frankford,</hi> so may Every Other <hi>Christian Prince,</hi> if he please, do still; I mean, may <hi>Vote</hi> with Them in such things as concern the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi> Because in these both the <hi>Rights of the People,</hi> and the <hi>Power of the Prince,</hi> are, for the most part, very near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned.</p>
               <p>Whether the <hi>Prince</hi> may judicially concur with the <hi>Clergy,</hi> in their <hi>Decisions</hi> in <hi>Matters of Faith,</hi> I do not think it worth the while to <hi>dispute.</hi> Thus much

I dare confidently affirm, That if He <hi>may not judge with them;</hi> He not only <hi>may,</hi> but <hi>must, judge after them.</hi> For as much as He is not only concern'd in Common, with his <hi>Subjects,</hi> to <hi>believe aright;</hi> but, as a <hi>Christian Prince,</hi> ought to <hi>assert</hi> the <hi>Right Faith</hi> too: And do what in Him lies, to promote the <hi>belief,</hi> and <hi>profession</hi> of it in his <hi>Dominions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, give me leave thus far to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, what I shall presently have Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion more particularly to Consider: When the <hi>Synod</hi> has <hi>settled</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of Faith,</hi> and framed, as they conceive, a <hi>just</hi> and <hi>Orthodox Confession</hi> of it; Is it the <hi>Duty</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> to Receive and give Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to their <hi>Definition,</hi> or is it <hi>not?</hi> To say that it is not, is to sink the <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> of such Meetings very low indeed, and to make their Assembling of very little Consequence; if, when They have done all they can to fix the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> neither the <hi>Prince</hi> has any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to <hi>support</hi> their <hi>Definition,</hi> nor the <hi>People</hi> to <hi>Receive</hi> it.</p>
               <p>But if, when the <hi>Synod</hi> has done, and their <hi>Sentence</hi> is pass'd, and perhaps their <hi>Anathema's</hi> too have been thunder'd out against all that shall presume to call their <hi>Decisions</hi> in Question: the <hi>Prince</hi>

It is therefore the duty of all <hi>Synods,</hi> as they are <hi>Conven'd</hi> by the <hi>Princes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> so to tarry till they have the same <hi>Authority</hi> for their <hi>Dissolution.</hi> As for the last particular, wherein we are to consider the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, viz.</hi>

But much more <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>


                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:43857:57"/>
as well as <hi>necessary,</hi> is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the <hi>Prince,</hi> to give <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to those <hi>Canons</hi> which regard the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline,</hi> and <hi>politie,</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in these the <hi>interest</hi> of the <hi>State</hi> is Concern'd: And an <hi>Authority</hi> usurp'd; and Mens <hi>civil Interests</hi> either <hi>directly,</hi> or by <hi>consequence,</hi> affected: And to all which as the Consent of the <hi>Prince</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, so the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>ends</hi> of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not permit, that any thing of this kind should be done, within the <hi>State,</hi> without his <hi>Consent</hi> first obtain'd for the doing of it.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that, from the Beginning, <hi>Christian Princes</hi> have not only taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to <hi>confirm</hi> the <hi>Acts</hi> of their <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi> if they have thought fit; but have been <hi>petition'd</hi> to by their <hi>Synods,</hi> that they would do so.

               <p>It were an Easie Matter to shew, that the same Method still continued in all other <hi>Countries,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> after; so that no <hi>Princes</hi> ever suffer'd any <hi>Canons</hi> to be put in Execution, till they had first been <hi>View'd,</hi> and <hi>Approv'd</hi> of by them, as no way prejudicial to their <hi>Royal Power</hi> and <hi>Dignity.</hi> But because this is a Point, that is not, I conceive, at all deny'd among us; and that I look upon the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Christian Prince</hi> to extend much farther, than to the bare <hi>Confirmation</hi> of what the <hi>Synod</hi> has determined; I will proceed more particularly to shew, what his <hi>Authority</hi> in this Respect, is; and how the <hi>final Determinations</hi> of such <hi>Assemblies,</hi> fall at last under the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Prince's Judgment.</hi>

               <p>And <hi>1st;</hi> As it would be absurd to <note place="margin">§ 23.</note> suppose that he should, so it is certain that the Prince is not obliged, at all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, to <hi>confirm</hi> whatsoever the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> shall think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And it were as well plainly to say that <hi>Synods</hi> have a <hi>Supreme Authority;</hi> and are no way accountable to any <hi>Civil Power</hi> in what they do: As to pretend that the <hi>Prince</hi> shall be <hi>obliged,</hi> at all Adventures, to <hi>Ratifie,</hi> and the <hi>People</hi> (by consequence) to <hi>submit</hi> to, whatsoever it shall please them to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
               <p>It were indeed to be wish'd, that such Venerable Assemblies might always be composed of Men so <hi>Wise,</hi> and <hi>Prudent;</hi> and that they would proceed in all things so <hi>calmly</hi> and <hi>impartially;</hi> that the <hi>Prince</hi> might evermore find it to be both Just, and Honourable, for Him, to take upon him the <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Guardian-ship</hi> of their <hi>Definitions.</hi> But because such is the Condition of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> that <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> and <hi>Prejudice, Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Interest, Noise</hi> and <hi>Clamour,</hi> oftentimes break in, and confound the <hi>Proceedings</hi> of these, as well as of all Other Assemblies; and many things are debated hastily, carried on with Faction, and concluded Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably;

'tis very fit and just, that the <hi>Prince</hi> should give Direction to have their <hi>Actions</hi> carefully <hi>Review'd,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd,</hi> before He <hi>assents</hi> to Them: That so he may not be imposed upon, nor do either the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Himself</hi> a <hi>Prejudice,</hi> by a blind complyance with the Dictates of his <hi>Clergy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the same Reason that He ought to have a Power of <hi>Examining</hi> the <hi>Councils Acts;</hi> it follows,</p>
               <p>

               <p>Whether it will be thought to be as Reasonable, <hi>4thly,</hi> That the <hi>Prince</hi> should be allow'd a farther <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>alter,</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,</hi> what the <hi>Synod</hi> has <hi>defined;</hi> to <hi>add</hi> to, or to <hi>take</hi> from it; so as to render it, in his Opinion, more useful to the <hi>End</hi> for which it was design'd, I cannot tell. But sure I am that this <hi>Princes</hi> have done; and so, I think, they have Authority to do. For since the <hi>Legis-lative Power</hi> is lodged in their hands, so that they may make what <hi>Laws,</hi> or <hi>Constitutions,</hi> they think fit, for the <hi>Church,</hi> as well as for the <hi>State:</hi> Since a <hi>Synod,</hi> in matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <hi>Discipline,</hi> is but a kind of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> to them, in <hi>Ecclesiastical Affairs;</hi> whose <hi>Advice</hi> having taken, they may still act as they think fit: Seeing, lastly, a <hi>Canon,</hi> drawn up by a <hi>Synod,</hi> is but as it were Matter prepared for the <hi>Royal

Stamp;</hi> the last <hi>forming</hi> of which, as well <hi>enforcing</hi> whereof, must be left to the <hi>Prince's Judgment:</hi> I cannot see why the <hi>Supreme Magistrate,</hi> who confessedly has a <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>confirm,</hi> or <hi>reject,</hi> their <hi>Decrees,</hi> may not also make such other Use of them as he pleases; and <hi>correct, improve,</hi> or otherwise <hi>alter</hi> their <hi>Resolutions,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own liking, before he gives <hi>Authority</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, in this Case, the <hi>Prince</hi> will not so much <hi>confirm</hi> what the <hi>Synod</hi> has done, as take Occasion from that which the <hi>Synod</hi> has done, to make another <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Law</hi> of his Own. But still this <hi>Power</hi> the <hi>Supreme Civil Magistrate</hi> has: And if this be all the Use he shall think fit to make of his <hi>Synod, viz.</hi> to suggest to him fit matter for the making of some <hi>seasonable</hi> and <hi>good Laws;</hi> I do not see wherein he can be accounted to abuse his Authority: And sure I am, 'tis no small Service done the <hi>Church,</hi> to suggest such <hi>Thoughts</hi> to the <hi>Prince,</hi> as otherwise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might never have entred into his <hi>Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Prince</hi> has this Authority <note place="margin">§ 36.</note> over the <hi>Canonical Resolutions</hi> of his <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi> so has he no less, over their <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Determinations:</hi> Which,</p>

               <p>When <hi>Nestorius</hi> had infected the <hi>Church</hi> with his <hi>Heresie,</hi> he was by two of the Greatest <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of the World, <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Cyril</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in their several <hi>Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi> justly condemn'd; unless he should repent of his Error within <hi>ten days.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inform'd of these Sentences, thus pass'd against him, he applied himself to <hi>Theodosius</hi> the <hi>Emperor;</hi> complain'd of their <hi>Proceedings,</hi> and desired that a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council</hi> might be call'd, to judge of this Matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:43857:60"/>
                  <hi>Theodosius,</hi> who at the same time was moved by Others to the same purpose; Resolves upon a <hi>General Council</hi> to meet at <hi>Ephesus;</hi> and in the mean time, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the Decrees of the <hi>two Provincial Synods,</hi> and orders that nothing should be innovated till that <hi>Council</hi> should meet. And when the <hi>Council</hi> was met, the <hi>Fathers</hi> were so far from complaining of this <hi>Suspension,</hi> as a hard thing; that they appointed the <hi>Emperor</hi>'s <hi>Order</hi> to be inserted into their <hi>Acts,</hi> and thereby gave a kind of <hi>Conciliary Authority</hi> to it. Or if this be not yet plain enough, let it farther be observed, that the <hi>Council</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon treated <hi>Nestorius,</hi> both in <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> as a <hi>Catholick Bishop;</hi> and invited him to <hi>come,</hi> and <hi>sit</hi> among them as such. Which evidently shews, that the <hi>Council</hi> made no doubt, but that the <hi>Emperor</hi> had sufficient Authority to <hi>suspend</hi> those <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi> Decrees; and that by his <hi>Suspension,</hi> their <hi>Sentence</hi> had not yet taken place against him.</p>
               <p>And the same was done in the Case of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> the next great <hi>Heretick</hi> that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested the <hi>Church.</hi> Who being condemn'd by <hi>Flavian,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and his <hi>Council;</hi> obtain'd of <hi>Theodosius</hi> another <hi>General Council</hi> to meet at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>

under the Presidence of <hi>Dioscorus</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> In this <hi>Council,</hi> by the Power and Fury of <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> all was tumultuously transacted; and <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> was condemn'd, as having deposed <hi>Eutyches</hi> contrary to the <hi>Canons.</hi>

               <p>Against this <hi>Sentence, Flavian</hi> appeals; and Pope <hi>Leo</hi> being applied to, calls a <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and therein rejects the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Ephesine Council;</hi> in which all things had been carried in a very <hi>disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and <hi>

               <p>'Tis true, this <hi>Theodosius</hi> would not consent to; tho' <hi>Leo</hi> had interested no less Persons than <hi>Valentinian,</hi> and his <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press,</hi> in the Cause with him.

               <p>Such an <hi>Authority</hi> were the <hi>Emperors</hi> wont to exercise over the <hi>Acts</hi> of the most <hi>General Councils,</hi> in <hi>confirming, suspending,</hi> or <hi>annulling</hi> their <hi>Sentences!</hi> And so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly did the <hi>Bishops</hi> in those times believe that they ought of <hi>Right</hi> to be <hi>allow'd</hi> such an <hi>Authority.</hi>

It was the same Perswasion that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Ervigius</hi> to <hi>confirm</hi> the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Thirteenth <hi>Synod,</hi> held in the same City. <note place="margin">Vid. leg. in Consir Concil.

               <p>The truth is, it seems to have been the usual Method of the <hi>Princes</hi> about this time; not so much to confirm the very <hi>Acts</hi> of their <hi>Synods,</hi> as to form the <hi>Substance</hi> of their <hi>Definitions</hi> into a <hi>Law;</hi> and to take Occasion from their <hi>Decrees,</hi> to determine such things as concern'd the <hi>Church.</hi> Thus the <hi>Spanish Kings,</hi> now mention'd, did: and so <hi>Clotharius</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> did, with Respect to the Fifth <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> An. 615.

               </p>
               <p>And thus have I done with the <hi>First</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Thing</hi> which I proposed to Consider. I have shewn what <hi>Authority</hi> the <hi>Christian Prince</hi> has always been accounted to have over <hi>Ecclesiastical Synods;</hi> with respect to the <hi>Assembling</hi> of them; to their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings whilst</hi> they are <hi>Sitting;</hi> and to the <hi>Confirming,</hi> or <hi>Annulling,</hi> their <hi>Decrees</hi> afterwards. I shall make only an <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> or two upon the whole, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to our present purpose; and so <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi> this <hi>Chapter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, <hi>1st.</hi> I must take notice, that whatever <hi>Privileges</hi> I have here shewn to belong to the <hi>Christian Magistrate;</hi> they belong to Him <hi>as such:</hi> They are not


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:43857:64"/>
derived from any <hi>positive Laws</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions;</hi> but Result from that <hi>Power</hi> which every such <hi>Prince</hi> has <hi>Originally</hi> in <hi>Himself;</hi> and are to be look'd upon as part of those <hi>Rights,</hi> which naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to <hi>Sovereign Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we find, that <hi>All Princes,</hi> in <hi>All wountries,</hi> how different soever they have been in other Respects, have yet ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more claim'd an <hi>Equal Authority</hi> in these <hi>Matters.</hi> And the little <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Suevia,</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> accounted themselves to have as good a <hi>Title</hi> to Them, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperors,</hi> in their most flourishing Estate, had.</p>
               <p>Which being so, it will follow <hi>2dly:</hi> That every <hi>Sovereign Prince,</hi> has a <hi>Right</hi> to Exercise this <hi>Authority,</hi> within his <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions:</hi> And that to prove this <hi>Right,</hi> it is sufficient to shew, That he is a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Prince;</hi> and therefore ought not to be deny'd any of those <hi>Prerogatives,</hi> which belong to such a <hi>Prince;</hi> among which this <hi>Authority</hi> is One.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, such <hi>Princes</hi> may, by their own <hi>Acts, limit</hi> themselves, as they think fitting. And these <hi>Limitations</hi> may give such <hi>Assemblies</hi> a <hi>Privilege</hi> in <hi>One Country,</hi> beyond what they have in <hi>Another.</hi> But then these <hi>Limitations</hi> must be plainly


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43857:65"/>
proved to have been made in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: And till they are so, the <hi>Prince</hi> must be accounted to have a <hi>Right</hi> to that <hi>Power,</hi> which, as a <hi>Prince,</hi> belongs Him; and is not yet proved to have been <hi>given away</hi> by Him.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>3dly:</hi> Whereas it is now to be Enquired, What the <hi>Authority</hi> of our <hi>Kings</hi> is, over our <hi>Convocations;</hi> We have thus far proceded towards the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of it, that we have shewn what <hi>Power</hi> They had <hi>Originally</hi> over Them, and, as <hi>Christian Princes,</hi> ought still to Enjoy. And those who will <hi>Restrain</hi> Them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <hi>narrower Bounds,</hi> must first shew, how they came to <hi>lose</hi> that <hi>Power,</hi> which they would <hi>take</hi> from Them; and which, till This shall be cleared, they must be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed still to have a <hi>Right</hi> to.</p>

                  <p>Of the <hi>Authority</hi> which our <hi>Own Kings</hi> have over their <hi>Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> with Respect both to their <hi>Meeting,</hi> and <hi>Acting</hi> first; and to the <hi>Confirming,</hi> or <hi>Annulling</hi> of their <hi>Acts</hi> after.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE have now seen what <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 22.</note> all Other <hi>Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> have claim'd and Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed over their <hi>Clergy,</hi> from the first <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version</hi> of the <hi>Empire</hi> to <hi>Christianity;</hi> till the Prevalence of the <hi>Papal Power,</hi> began to deprive Them of that Supremacy, which, of Right, belong'd to Them. Let us go on, upon this Foundation, to Enquire.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>II.</hi> Whether our <hi>Own Kings,</hi> have not as Great an <hi>Authority</hi> over their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations;</hi> as any Other <hi>Princes</hi> have ever pretended to, over their <hi>Councils?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this, of Right, they Ought to have, I have before observed: The only Question is, whether our <hi>Own particular Constitution</hi> has interposed, to <hi>deprive</hi>


                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:43857:66"/>
Them of that <hi>Authority,</hi> which, we have already shewn, did originally belong to Them.</p>
               <p>And here I might justly leave it to Those who advance such Pretences, to produce their Proofs, and shew us upon what Grounds they do it: And account the <hi>Right</hi> of our <hi>Kings</hi> to this <hi>Authority,</hi> to have been sufficiently established, in that common Claim, which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved all <hi>Christian Princes,</hi> as such, have ever made to the <hi>Exercise</hi> of of it. But that nothing may be wanting to the clearing of this Matter, beyond all reasonable Exception; I shall, to the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Argument</hi> I have before made use of, add those particular Confirmations, which our own <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> afford us, of this Truth: And shew, that, by our own <hi>Constitution,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has all that <hi>Power,</hi> at this day, over Our <hi>Convocation;</hi> that ever any <hi>Christian Prince</hi> had, over his <hi>Synods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>(1st.)</hi> Then, if we consider His Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as to the first thing before-mention'd, <hi>viz.</hi> of Calling together of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> in <hi>Convocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are told by One of the most Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Professors</hi> of our <hi>Laws,</hi> that it was,


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43857:66"/>
among other Points, Resolved by the Two <hi>Chief Justices,</hi> and other <hi>Judges,</hi> at a Committee of <hi>Lords</hi> in <hi>Parliament; Trin. 8. Jac. 1. That a</hi> Convocation <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Assemble, at their onvocation, without the</hi> Assent <hi>of the</hi> King. And One would think such Persons should not only be very well Qualified to know what our <hi>Law</hi> is; but should also be very Careful, (especially at such a <hi>Time,</hi> and in such a <hi>Place,)</hi> not to deliver any thing for <hi>Law,</hi> which They were not very well assured was so.</p>
               <p>But because some have excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Authority</hi> of this <hi>Report;</hi> as a <hi>Piece</hi> that was published after the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>Author,</hi> and in <hi>Suspected Times;</hi> (Tho' I cannot see what Interest any One should have, to falsifie his Relation in the Instance before Us;) We will take his Opinion from a Book which we are sure is Authentick, and lies open to no Exceptions. 4. <hi>Instit. pag.</hi> 322. Where treating expresly about the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> He affirms, <hi>that the Clergy were never Assembled, or Call'd together, at a Convocation, but by the</hi> King's Writ. And in which, tho' I am sensible He has spoken a little too Generally, as to <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact;</hi> yet in <hi>point of Law,</hi> (and


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43857:67"/>
in which only I make use of his <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,)</hi> I cannot but look upon him to have been absolutely in the Right: It being certain that the <hi>Clergy</hi> not only now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but never could be, <hi>lawfully,</hi> call'd together in <hi>Convocation,</hi> but by the <hi>King's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rit,</hi> or with his <hi>Consent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in assirming this I say no more, than what was the joint Opinion of the whole <hi>Representative Body</hi> of the <hi>Nation;</hi> as well of the <hi>Clergy</hi> in their <hi>Convocation,</hi> as of the rest of the Realm, in <hi>Parliament; 25 Hen.</hi> 8. And from whence, if from any Authority, we may certainly the best take our Measure to judge, Whether a thing does, of <hi>Right,</hi> belong to the <hi>King,</hi> and is a part of his <hi>Royal Prerogative,</hi> or No.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>1st.</hi> As for the <hi>Clergy;</hi> We are told in the Preamble to the Act of the 25 <hi>Hen. 8. chap. 19. That the Clergy of this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>had acknowleged, that the</hi> Convocation <hi>of the same Clergy is, always hath been, and ought to be, Assembled, only by the King's Writ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, <hi>2dly.</hi> As for the <hi>Laity,</hi> the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> in the same <hi>Act</hi> not only concurs in the same opinion with Them, in the <hi>Preamble</hi> before-mention'd; that this


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:43857:67"/>
their Acknowledgment was <hi>according to the Truth:</hi> But in the Body of the <hi>Act</hi> it self, have Provided thereupon, that from thenceforth They never should meet in <hi>Convocation,</hi> without the <hi>King's Leave,</hi> to Empower them so to do: <hi>Be it enacted</hi> (say They) <hi>by the Authority of this present Parliament, according to the said</hi> Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>and</hi> Petition <hi>of the said</hi> Clergy; <hi>That They, ne any of Them, from henceforth, shall presume to Attempt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nor shall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nact,</hi> &amp;c—<hi>in their</hi> Convocations, <hi>in time Coming; Which always shall be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by Authority of the King's Writ.</hi> And from all which it is Evident, that in the Opinion both of that <hi>Parliament,</hi> and of that <hi>Convocation;</hi> the <hi>King</hi> not only <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>have,</hi> and by <hi>Law,</hi> now <hi>has,</hi> the sole Authority of <hi>Calling</hi> the <hi>Clergy</hi> together in <hi>Convocation;</hi> but that this is such a <hi>Power</hi> as did <hi>always</hi> of <hi>Right</hi> belong to Him; and that no <hi>Convocation</hi> ever could be lawfully assembled, <hi>without</hi> his <hi>Permission,</hi> or <hi>against</hi> his.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that not only our Present <hi>Convocations</hi> are all summoned by the <hi>King's Writ,</hi> directed to the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of Each <hi>Province,</hi> for that purpose; but if we look back to the times preceeding this <hi>Statute,</hi> we shall find the same to


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43857:68"/>
have been the antient manner of summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Them. And tho', in a matter of this Nature, it is not to be expected we should be able to produce the very Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the <hi>Writs,</hi> by which our <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> were called, from the beginning; yet I shall hereafter plainly prove, that, from the beginning, they did meet by the <hi>King's Command:</hi> And we have the very <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Summons</hi> as far back as the 9 <hi>Edw.</hi> 2; that is to say, for above 200 years, before this <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> were made.</p>
               <p>Such <hi>Right</hi> have our <hi>Kings</hi> to Call their <hi>Convocations:</hi> Nor is their <hi>Authority</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 4.</note> any less, in all those Circumstances which I have shewed, were wont to Accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny their Calling Them.</p>
               <p>If we consider the <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> of their <hi>Meeting,</hi> they are expresly limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Writ,</hi> by which They are <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd.</hi> And tho' Custom has, of late, so far prevail'd, that the <hi>Convocation</hi> has generally met at the same <hi>Time</hi> that the <hi>Parliament</hi> has done; and at St. <hi>Paul's Church,</hi> or <hi>Chapter House</hi> in <hi>London;</hi> yet have not our <hi>Kings</hi> ever been so far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in either of these Particulars, as not


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:43857:68"/>
to have it still in their Power, to call the <hi>Convocation</hi> at any <hi>other time,</hi> or to any <hi>other place,</hi> which they shall think sit.</p>
               <p>In that <hi>antient Summons</hi> I before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; (perhaps the most <hi>antient</hi> of any we have now remaining;) of the 9th. of <hi>Edw.</hi> II. The <hi>Convocation</hi> was call'd to meet <hi>Febr.</hi> 9. but the <hi>Parliament</hi> sate <hi>October</hi> 16. foregoing. And in the <hi>Writs</hi> of these latter times, though the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> be call'd, and its <hi>Session</hi> confin'd to that of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> yet still, if the King pleases, he may continue the <note place="margin">See the Hist. of A B.

                  <hi>sitting</hi> of the <hi>one,</hi> after the <hi>other</hi> is <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued,</hi> or even <hi>dissolv'd:</hi> And for the <hi>Place,</hi> it is sometimes determin'd to be <note place="margin">See the Writs of Summons, Append.</note> St. <hi>Paul's, London;</hi> but for the most part is left, with a Greater Latitude, to be held at any other <hi>Place,</hi> which the <hi>Archbishop</hi> shall judge to be more convenient for it.</p>
               <p>And the same is the Case as to the <note place="margin">§ 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Persons,</hi> who are to come to the <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and the Choice of whom as it is still determin'd by the <hi>King's Writ,</hi> so must it be allow'd to have Originally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon it.

               <p>I shall not need to enquire, how this came to be the settled number that was to make up our <hi>Provincial Synods,</hi> or <hi>Convocations.</hi> Whether this manner of Choice was deriv'd from the antient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>holding Convocations,</hi> into the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Writs;</hi> or from the <hi>Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Writs</hi> of <hi>King Edward</hi> I. into the <hi>sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> of <hi>Convocations,</hi> which from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth usually met together with the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi> Howsoever this were, thus much is evident; that since the Power of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling the <hi>Clergy</hi> in such <hi>Convocations</hi> is seated <hi>Originally</hi> in the <hi>King;</hi> so that they have no <hi>Authority</hi> to come together. but what he gives them. It must fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that neither can any <hi>other Persons</hi> have a <hi>just Right</hi> to come to these <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies.</hi> than such only as are <hi>commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> by him; or are chosen by such <hi>Rules</hi> as he has <hi>preserib'd,</hi> for the <hi>choise</hi> of <hi>those</hi> whom he allows to be sent to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:43857:69"/>
It remains then, that not only the <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§ 6.</note> of our <hi>Convocations,</hi> but the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Place</hi> of their sitting; of the <hi>Persons</hi> who are <hi>themselves</hi> to come to them, and of the manner of <hi>choosing Representatives</hi> for those who are not; all depend upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> and were <hi>originally</hi> deriv'd from thence. And so, lastly, does their very <hi>sitting</hi> too. For however Custom, (which in time becomes a kind of <hi>Law)</hi> has in this, as well as in some of the foregoing <hi>Circumstances,</hi> so far prevail'd, that when soever a <hi>Parliament</hi> is <hi>held,</hi> a <hi>Convocation</hi> is <hi>call'd</hi> together with it; yet is this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Form,</hi> than any <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Summons:</hi> And the <hi>King</hi> still keeps his <hi>Antient Power,</hi> to all intents and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, in his own hands; and suffers them not either to <hi>sit,</hi> or <hi>act,</hi> but <hi>when,</hi> and as <hi>often,</hi> as he thinks fit so to do.</p>
               <p>Nor is this to be look'd upon as any Encroachment upon the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> but as the Assertion of a <hi>Power,</hi> which always <hi>did;</hi> and, of right, <hi>ought</hi> to belong to the <hi>Prince.</hi> For though it has now, for some Ages, been the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom to <hi>Convene</hi> the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as often as the <hi>Parliament</hi> meets; yet, as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that when this <hi>Custom</hi> first began, they met not so much as an <hi>Ecclesiastical

               <p>The <hi>Convocation</hi> then, tho' it consisted of <hi>Ecclesiastical Persons,</hi> was yet assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for a <hi>Civil End,</hi> and seems rather to have been a <hi>State Convention,</hi> than a <hi>Church Synod.</hi> And however the King usually added a <hi>Conciliary Summons,</hi> to his <hi>Parliamentary Writ,</hi> and thereby not only assembled the <hi>Proctors</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> under another Character; but with them many <hi>Others</hi> of the <hi>Regular Clergy,</hi> who had no place in the <hi>Parliament Writ:</hi> yet still the Design was, in <hi>Both,</hi> the same; <hi>viz.</hi> That they might thereby more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually confirm what had, in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> been granted to the <hi>King;</hi> and the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers,</hi> become engaged, by their own Consent, not to oppose the levying of it.</p>
               <p>Now this being the true Ground of the <hi>Convocation</hi>'s being call'd together with the <hi>Parliament; Custom,</hi> and, if you will, the <hi>Constitution</hi> of our <hi>Government</hi> founded thereupon; does indeed give them a <hi>Right</hi> to be <hi>summon'd,</hi> when the


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43857:70"/>
                  <hi>Parliament</hi> is; and accordingly they are still <hi>summon'd</hi> together with it: But as they have no <hi>Custom</hi> to warrant them to <hi>deliberate,</hi> or <hi>enter</hi> upon <hi>Business,</hi> unless the <hi>King</hi> pleases to allow them so to do; so neither have they any <hi>Right</hi> in that Particular; but the <hi>King</hi> is still as much at Liberty, in that respect, as if there had never been any such <hi>Custom</hi> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished for the <hi>Calling</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>In short; were it still the Method, as formerly it was, for the <hi>Clergy</hi> to <hi>Assess themselves;</hi> but much more, were the Case so now, as antiently it seems to have been, that they were a part of the <hi>Great Council</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and whose <hi>Consent</hi> was requisite to the <hi>passing</hi> of <hi>Parliamentary</hi> Acts; it would then be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evident wherefore they were Called, and what they had to do. But this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altered, and yet the <hi>Antient Summons</hi> still continued; it makes some Men think it an odd Thing, that the <hi>Convocation</hi> should be Called to no purpose: Not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, that but for those <hi>Ends,</hi> which are now <hi>ceased,</hi> they never had been wont either to be <hi>summon'd</hi> to <hi>Parliament,</hi> or at the <hi>same time</hi> with it; and that those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>determined,</hi> they have a <hi>Right</hi> to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a <hi>Summons,</hi> and it were no great Matter, whether they had a <hi>Right</hi> to that, or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:43857:71"/>
And this may suffice to shew what <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> our <hi>King</hi> has, by the particular <hi>Laws</hi> of our Own <hi>Constitution,</hi> to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the <hi>Convocation:</hi> and that without his <hi>Writ,</hi> they neither <hi>now</hi> can, nor ever could, regularly, come together, by any other Way.</p>
               <p>I proceed <hi>(2dly)</hi> To enquire, What Power he has to direct their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, when they are Assembled?</p>
               <p>And here we are again told by the same Person, whose Authority I before alleged; that the <hi>second Point</hi> agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the <hi>Chief Justices,</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> at the <hi>Committee</hi> of the <hi>Lords,</hi> was; <hi>That the</hi> Convocation, <hi>after their Assembly, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not confer, to constitute any Canons, without License de l'Roy.</hi> Nor is this any more than what the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. has directly establish'd: When having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the <hi>Promise</hi> which the <hi>Clergy</hi> had, in their Petition, made to the King; That <hi>they would never, from thenceforth, presume to Attempt, Allege, Claim, or Put in Ure; Enact, Promulge, or Execute, any new Canon, Constitution, Ordinance Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>, or Other; or by whatsoever Name they shall be called, in Convocation; unless the King's most Royal Assent, and Licence, may by them be had, to</hi> MAKE, PROMULGE, <hi>and</hi> EXECUTE <hi>the same, and that his Majesty


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43857:71"/>
do give his most Royal Assent and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in that behalf:</hi> They thereupon Enact, <hi>That ne They, nor any of Them, frow hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth, shall presume, to Attempt, Alledge, Claim, or put in ure, any Constitutions, or Orders Provincial, or Synodal; or any Other Canons: Nor shall Enact, Promulge, or Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, any such Canons, Constitutions, or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances Provincial, by whatsoever Name, or Names, they may be called, in their Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in Time coming;—Unless the same Clergy may have the King's most Royal Assent, and Licence, to</hi> MAKE, PROMULGE, <hi>and</hi> EXECUTE, <hi>such Conons, Constitutions, and Ordinances, Provincial, or Synodal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have transcribed this Paragraph of that <hi>Act</hi> at large, to the End it may the more evidently appear, that the Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it was, as well to Restrain the Clergy from MAKING, as from PROMUL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GING, and EXECUTING any <hi>Canons;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Assent,</hi> and <hi>Licence</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> first had, for their so doing. And which is indeed so plain, that had not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>Practice</hi> of all following <hi>Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and the <hi>Opinions</hi> of the most <hi>Learned</hi> in <hi>Our Laws,</hi> so expounded the Sense of it, yet we could not have been easily mistaken in it. For besides that it was apparently the Design of this <hi>Act,</hi> to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>str<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ain the Clergy from doing somewhat


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43857:72"/>
which they had been wont to do in <hi>their Convocation:</hi> the <hi>Statute</hi> it self interprets its own Expressions; and tells us that by <hi>presuming to Attempt,</hi> &amp;c. was meant as well presuming to MAKE, as to <hi>Promulge,</hi> and <hi>Execute,</hi> any <hi>Canons,</hi> or <hi>Constitutions;</hi> without the <hi>Assent,</hi> and <hi>Licence of the King,</hi> first had by Them, so to do.</p>
               <p>Whether the <hi>Convocation</hi> may not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King's Writ, deliberate of such <note place="margin">§ 8.</note> things, as may be fit to be done by Them, for the Service of the <hi>Church,</hi> I shall not undertake to say. Certain it is, that they may not so deliberate, as to come to any <hi>Authoritative Resolution</hi> upon any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Point; or to frame any <hi>Order,</hi> or <hi>Constitution,</hi> of what kind soever it be, without the <hi>King</hi>'s Leave; which is in Effect to say, that they may not debate, <hi>Synodically,</hi> at all, without it. To delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate of what might usefully be consider'd by Them, and to Petition the <hi>King</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, for Leave so to do; This, as it is no <hi>Attempting</hi> to <hi>make</hi> a <hi>Canon,</hi> &amp;c. so does it not, I conceive, come within the Design of that <hi>Prohibition,</hi> which this <hi>Act</hi> has laid upon them. And if the <hi>King</hi> allows the <hi>Convocation</hi> to <hi>sit,</hi> I do not see wherein they would transgress, in framing such an <hi>Address;</hi> supposing


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43857:72"/>
that his <hi>Commission</hi> had not before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all Occasion for such an <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> But then still this is but asking Leave to <hi>act</hi> as a <hi>Synod;</hi> And it will, after all, remain in the <hi>King's</hi> Breast what Answer to make to such a Request; and whether he will grant them that Leave which They desire, or no?</p>
               <p>As therefore the <hi>Convocation</hi> cannot Meet but by the <hi>King's Writ;</hi> so neither, being Met, can they proceed to any <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Debates,</hi> or <hi>Resolutions,</hi> without it. For by vertue of this <hi>Act,</hi> they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, not only to <hi>Make,</hi> but to <hi>Attempt;</hi> that is, as I understand it, to do any thing that tends towards the <hi>making</hi> of any <hi>Canons,</hi> without his Warrant for their Doing of it. And therefore, when the <hi>King</hi> sends out his <hi>Writs</hi> for the <hi>Convocation</hi> to meet; he therein reserves to himself the <hi>Privilege</hi> of <hi>Naming</hi> the Subject, which they are to <hi>deliberate,</hi> and <hi>resolve</hi> upon. For having mention'd, by way of Form, in the beginning of the <hi>Writ;</hi> That for <hi>certain urgent Affairs, of great Concern both to the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> He had commanded the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> to summon the <hi>Clergy</hi> to come together, to such a certain <hi>Place,</hi> and at such a certain <hi>Time:</hi> He thus declares what they were to do, when they met; <hi>Ad Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctand.</hi>


                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:43857:73"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Namely, That they were <hi>To Treat, Consent, and Conclude upon the Premises; and such other Matters, as should more clearly be declared to them, when they came together, in the Kings behalf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Affairs then which the <hi>Convocation</hi> is, in general, to <hi>debate</hi> about, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> to, are the <hi>Urgent Affairs which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the King, the Church, and the Realm.</hi> And these therefore are the constant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of <hi>every Convocation Writ.</hi> But what those Affairs are, with Reference to <hi>Any,</hi> or <hi>All</hi> of These, which every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Convocation</hi> is call'd to consider; That the <hi>King</hi> reserves to himself to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to Them; and they are, when met, to expect his <hi>special Direction,</hi> and not to ramble, after their own Fancies, on any Matter, within this general Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, without his Warrant.</p>
               <p>It has indeed been questioned by a <hi>Late Author,</hi> Whether this <hi>Clause</hi> was <note place="margin">§ 9. Letter to a Convoc. Man. p. 43.</note> antiently inserted into these <hi>Writs;</hi> and he would fain have it thought, that herein also the <hi>Clergy</hi> have, of late, been encroach'd upon. But the <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Instruments</hi> are not so easily altered: If they were, we might rather have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that some other Expressions, which relate to those Privileges which


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43857:73"/>
the <hi>Clergy</hi> formerly enjoy'd, but which have now, for a long time, been utterly laid aside; should have been omitted, or changed; than this, which is perfectly agreeable both to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Realm,</hi> and to his <hi>Majesty's Royal Prerogative,</hi> in these Matters. But, indeed, this Clause, if not as antient as the <hi>Writ</hi> it self, is yet of very great Antiquity: And we have at this day <hi>Writs</hi> as far back as <note place="margin">Vid. Conv. Wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, 28 Hen. <hi>VI.</hi> and 23 <hi>Fd. IV.</hi>
                  </note> King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth's Time, in which this <hi>Clause</hi> is found in the very same <hi>Words</hi> that it is continued in at this day.</p>
               <p>But were there any doubt to be made <note place="margin">§ 10.</note> concerning the Authority of this <hi>Clause;</hi> yet that Method that has always been taken by the <hi>King</hi> to set the <hi>Convocation</hi> on Work, would be more than enough to shew how intirely their Deliberations depend upon his Direction. When the last <hi>Convocation,</hi> under his present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, was met; the <hi>King,</hi> by his <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Secretary</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> sent his <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> to Them: In which having taken notice of the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth before mentioned, and the Obligation which was, thereby, laid upon Them, not to proceed to any Business, without his <hi>Licence</hi> first had, so to do; he does therefore, in order to their proceeding


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43857:74"/>
with Safety to Themselves, and pursuant to the true Purpose, and Intent of that Law; particularly declare upon what Points he allow'd Them to Consult, and under what Conditions he gave them Authority so to do. <hi>That they should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of any Alterations which they thought proper to be made, in the Form, Rites, or Ceremonies, of our Divine Service: That they should Review the Book of Canons: Should consider, What Defects, or Abuses, might be found in the Ecclesiastical Courts: How the Manners, both of the Ministers and People, might more effectually be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd; And such Provision be made, that None should hereafter be Admitted into Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Orders, but such as were duly qualified both in their Lives, and Learning, to be received into the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the <hi>Heads,</hi> on which the <hi>Clergy</hi> of that <hi>Convocation</hi> were directed to debate: And even upon these they were to deliberate, under these following Restrictions. <hi>1st.</hi> That the <hi>President,</hi> and <hi>Greater Number</hi> of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> were to be always present. And <hi>2dly.</hi> That even upon these General Heads, they should consider only such particular <hi>Points, Matters, Causes, or Things, as his Majesty should propose, or cause to be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, by the President of the Convocation to Them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:43857:74"/>
Such was the <hi>Commission</hi> by which the last <hi>Convocation</hi> was set on work: And to prepare the particular Matters which the King reserved to himself to propose to Them; and upon which alone They were allow'd to debate; His <hi>Majesty,</hi> some time before the <hi>Convocation</hi> was to meet, appointed a <hi>Select Committee</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> to consult about the same Matters; and to draw up such Resolutions, as they should think most fitting for him to lay before the <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> when it should be Assembled.</p>
               <p>Nor was this any <hi>New Invention;</hi> any Unusual <hi>Restraint</hi> laid upon the Clergy, in these days of Doubt and Distrust: but the constant Method which had before been pursued, ever since the 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>It cannot be deny'd but that whatever <note place="margin">§ 11.</note> his present Majesty may, in some Mens Opinions, be said to be; yet, without all Question, King <hi>Charles the First</hi> was a true <hi>Friend</hi> to the <hi>Episcopal Clergy.</hi> Nor can it any more be doubted, whether Archbishop <hi>Laud</hi> had not both Care e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Examine into the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Convocation;</hi> and Interest enough with that <hi>Prince</hi> to assert the Privileges of it. Let us therefore, to avoid all Exceptions in this Case, enquire how things pass'd


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43857:75"/>
in that Famous <hi>Convocation</hi> of 1640; wherein much was done, and great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence given to those who Resolved not to be pleased with any thing that either that <hi>King,</hi> or that <hi>Archbishop</hi> did; but nothing that can justly be found fault with by such, as we are now especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, if it may be, to convince.</p>
               <p>Now that <hi>Convocation</hi> being met, by vertue of the same <hi>Writ</hi> that is still made use of in these Cases; the King sent his <hi>Special Commission</hi> to them, to impower them to Act; bearing date <hi>April</hi> 15. 1640.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>Commission,</hi> he first at large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites <note place="margin">See it in the App<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Having done this, He (in the next place) prefaces the Permission he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to grant to them with these very Words, which ought not to be omitted: <hi>Know ye therefore, that We, for divers ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and weighty Causes and Considerations Us thereunto moving, of our</hi> Especial Grace, <hi>certain Knowledge, and</hi> Meer Motion, <hi>have</hi> by vertue of our Prerogative Royal, and Supreme Authority in Causes Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43857:75"/>
                  <hi>given and granted, and by these Presents do give and grant, full, free, and lawful Liberty, Licence, Power, and Authority, to the most Reverend Father in God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I shall not need to make any Remarks upon this Preamble, which fully answers all the Pretences of those, who fancy not only the <hi>Sitting,</hi> but the <hi>Acting</hi> too, of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> to be a matter of <hi>Right,</hi> naturally belinging to Them; And that either no <hi>Commission</hi> at all is needful to Authorize them so to do; or, that if there be, the <hi>King</hi> is, of Course, <hi>obliged</hi> to Grant it to them.</p>
               <p>For, first, That without the <hi>King's Commission</hi> they cannot proceed to any Business of <hi>Themselves,</hi> (without Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> and encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the <hi>King's Prerogative. Royol, and Supreme Authority in Cases Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,)</hi> is here directly asserted. And that such a <hi>Commission,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> may lawfully Grant, or refuse, as he thinks conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, not only the constant Custom of our <hi>Princes,</hi> in adjourning their <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> (excepting only at such times as they had something for them to do,) as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us; but the very words of the present <hi>Commission,</hi> directly imply. For how came the King to grant this Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to them? Was it because they had


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43857:76"/>
a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>demand</hi> it; Or, that He had no <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>refuse</hi> it? Was it because it had always been <hi>Customary</hi> for them to <hi>Sit,</hi> when the <hi>Parliament met;</hi> and to have such a <hi>Commission</hi> sent to them, as often as they <hi>sat?</hi> Nothing of all this: But for <hi>divers Urgent and Weighty Causes, and Considerations, Him thereunto especially mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving: Out of his especial Grace, and meer Motion:</hi> That he granted it by virtue of his <hi>Royal Prerogative;</hi> and of that <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority in Causes Ecclesiastical,</hi> which gave him the same Power over his <hi>Clergy,</hi> that all other <hi>Christian Princes</hi> were wont to exercise over Theirs: And which how Great it was, as to these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I have before particularly shewn.</p>
               <p>But to go on with this <hi>Commission:</hi> The <hi>King</hi> having thus asserted his Authority; now by virtue thereof gives leave to that Convocation <hi>(Always provided that the President, and greater number of the Bishops were present;) during the Session of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament then Assembled; to Propose, Confer, Treat, Debate, Consider, Consult, or Agree, upon the Exposition, or Alteration of any Canon, or Canons, then in force; and of, and upon any such other New Canons, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Ordinances, and Constitutions, as they should think necessary, fit, and convenient, for the Honour and Service of Almighty


<pb n="109" facs="tcp:43857:76"/>
God; the Good and Quiet of the Church, and the better Government thereof; to be from time to time observed, fulfill'd, and kept,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>And further to Confer, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, Treat, Consider, Consult, and Agree, of and upon such other Points, Matters, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Things, as himself from time to time should deliver or cause to be deliver'd unto the said Lord Bishop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of the said</hi> Convocation, <hi>under his Sign Manual, or Privy Signet, to be Deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Consider'd, Consulted, and Concluded upon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Business for which that <hi>Convocation</hi> sat, and which they were, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, licensed to enter upon. But the Restrictions under which they were allowed to Act, are yet more narrow than Those which his present <hi>Majesty</hi> laid upon our late <hi>Convocation.</hi> For all this They were required to do, not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Conditions that I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreshewn were laid upon the Other; but with these further Limitations: namely, <hi>That the said Canons, Orders, Ordinances, Constitutions, Matters and Things, or Any of Them, so to be Consider'd, Consulted and Agreed upon, as aforesaid, should not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, or repugnant to the</hi> Liturgy <hi>Establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; or to the</hi> Rubricks <hi>in it; or to the</hi> 39 Articles; <hi>or to any</hi> Doctrine, Orders <hi>and</hi> Ceremonies <hi>of the</hi> Church of England, <hi>already Established.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:43857:77"/>
Thus did this Prince give such <hi>Orders</hi> for the Proceedings of this <hi>Convocation,</hi> as he thought expedient to be observed by Them. And when, for the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual suppressing, and preventing of the <hi>Growth</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> He resolved an Oath should be framed for the <hi>Clergy</hi> to take, of their firm adherence to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> And that a <hi>Canon</hi> should be drawn, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the taking of it: He sent a <hi>new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to them, <hi>May</hi> 17, to empower them to enter on that Debate; and to require them to Prepare, and present such an <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Canon,</hi> to Him.</p>
               <p>But other <hi>Princes</hi> have gone yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than this: They have not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed <note place="margin">§. 12.</note> to their <hi>Convocations</hi> what they should go about, but have actually drawn up beforehand, what they thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to have Establish'd; and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them to Approve of it. In the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> which met <hi>May</hi> 18, 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1: The King sent his <hi>Letters</hi> with the <hi>Articles</hi> of 1562, to Them, to be Approved, and Allowed of by Them. And to another <hi>Convocation,</hi> about four Years after, the same Prince signified to both <hi>Houses</hi> his Pleasure, for <hi>Singing</hi> and <hi>Organ Service</hi> to be settled in <hi>Cathedral Churches,</hi> without ever submitting it to their Judgment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they approved of it, or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:43857:77"/>
I shall conclude these Remarks, with the Opinion which the <hi>Lower House</hi> of <hi>Convocation</hi> had, of the Necessity of the <hi>King's Authority,</hi> to Empower Them to enter with Security on their Debates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Matters of Religion, in the first Year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth: At the first Meeting of which, we find this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, among some others, made by them; That <hi>Certain be appointed to know, whether the</hi> Arch-bishop <hi>has obtain'd Indemnity, for the House to intreat of</hi> Matters <hi>of</hi> Religion, <hi>in Cases forbidden by the</hi> Statutes <hi>of this</hi> Realm <hi>to treat in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But there is another Particular, in <note place="margin">§ 13.</note> which I have before shewn, that <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes</hi> had, upon Occasion, exercised an Eminent Authority over their <hi>Synods;</hi> Whilst, for the better <hi>Observance</hi> of the <hi>Orders</hi> which they gave to Them. They asserted a <hi>Right</hi> either in <hi>Person,</hi> or by their <hi>Commissioner,</hi> to sit with, and to <hi>preside</hi> over Them.</p>
               <p>That our <hi>Kings</hi> heretofore, did <hi>meet,</hi> and <hi>sit</hi> together with their <hi>Clergy,</hi> is not to be deny'd. And our Great Oracle of the Law has told us, That <hi>they did often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appoint Commissioners, by Writ, to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4 <hi>Inst.</hi> p. 323.</note> 
                  <hi>sit with them at the</hi> Convocation, <hi>and to have Conusance of such Things as they meant to Establish, that nothing might be done in prejudice of their Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:43857:78"/>
'Tis true, since the Restriction laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">25 Hen. 8. cap. 19.</note> the <hi>Clergy</hi> by the <hi>Statute</hi> of K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8; the King is now become so secure of them, that He has no great need to send any such <hi>Commissioner</hi> to them, to regulate their Proceedings. For being neither at liberty to enter upon any <hi>Synodical Act,</hi> but what he gives them leave to go upon; Nor, when they have concluded upon any Point, being allow'd to <hi>Promulge</hi> or <hi>put it in Execution;</hi> unless it shall be <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of,</hi> and <hi>confirmed</hi> by <hi>Him:</hi> He has nothing left to apprehend from them; but is, by his <hi>Commission,</hi> as effectually <hi>President</hi> over their <hi>Debates,</hi> as if he were present in <hi>Person,</hi> among them.</p>
               <p>And yet tho' this <hi>Act</hi> has, therefore render'd the Exercise of such an <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> less necessary than it was before; it has not depriv'd the <hi>King</hi> of it. For even after the passing of this <hi>Statute,</hi> K. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 8, by his <hi>Vicar General,</hi> not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sided, together with the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> over the <hi>Convocation;</hi> but <hi>Deliberated, Voted,</hi> and, to all intents and purposes, <hi>Acted,</hi> together with his <hi>Clergy,</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>This is manifest from the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Convocation</hi> of the year 1536; and of which it may not be amiss to give a short account, upon this Occasion.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Upon the <hi>9th</hi> day of <hi>June</hi> 1536.


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43857:78"/>
Mr. <hi>William Peter</hi> came into the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> and alleged, That for as much as this <hi>Synod</hi> was called by the Authority of the most illustrious Prince, K. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 8; and that the said <hi>Prince</hi> ought to have the first Place in the said <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and in his Absence, the Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Master <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, being <hi>Vicar General</hi> in <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Causes,</hi> ought to possess his Place: Therefore he desired, that the said Place might be assigned to Him. And at the same time presented his said Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's <hi>Letters, Sealed</hi> with the <hi>Seal</hi> of his <hi>Office,</hi> as <hi>Vicar General:</hi> Which being read, the most Reverend the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> assign'd him a Place besides himself.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>On the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> in the same <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> the Bp of <hi>Hereford</hi> produced a certain <hi>Book,</hi> containing the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Which being read by the said <hi>Bishop,</hi> the said Honourable <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> and other <hi>Prelates,</hi> with the <hi>Prolocutor,</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> of the <hi>Lower House,</hi> by their <hi>Subscriptions</hi> Approved of the said <hi>Book.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>On the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> It was agreed by the Lord <hi>Cromwel,</hi> the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> and <hi>Convocation,</hi> as to certain <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>

                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:43857:79"/>
                  <q>And lastly, On the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi> produced a certain <hi>Book,</hi> containing the <hi>Causes</hi> why the <hi>King</hi> ought not to appear at the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council,</hi> then to be held. Which <hi>Book</hi> the aforesaid Honourable Lord <hi>Thomas Cromwel,</hi> the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> and the Rest of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> by their <hi>Subscriptions</hi> approved of.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus did the <hi>King's Commissioner</hi> not only <hi>sit,</hi> but <hi>act</hi> with the <hi>Bishops</hi> in their <hi>Convocation.</hi> And I am not aware of any <hi>Law</hi> that has debar'd the <hi>King,</hi> if need were, to do that again now, which King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. heretofore did.</p>
               <p>And this may suffice to shew, what <hi>Authority</hi> the <hi>King</hi> has over Our <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> both by the <hi>Statute,</hi> and <hi>Common Law;</hi> by his own <hi>Prerogative,</hi> as a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Prince,</hi> and by the Particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions of our own <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and <hi>Convocations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we are told, that the <hi>Convocation</hi> must be consider'd by Us, not only as an <note place="margin">§ 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Ecclesiastical Synod,</hi> but as an <hi>Ecclesiastical Court</hi> too; and which, as such, has Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction <note place="margin">4 Instit. <hi>p.</hi> 322.</note> to deal with <hi>Heresies, Schisms,</hi> and other meer <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Causes, juxta legem divinam, &amp; Canones S.

                  <hi>Statute,</hi> but still remains whole, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to Them. In this respect therefore the <hi>Convocation</hi> may, at least, <hi>act,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>King's Licence,</hi> and, as of <hi>Right;</hi> against any <hi>Bishop, Priest,</hi> or <hi>Deacon,</hi> for such <hi>Offences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Doctrine of our <hi>Late Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;</hi> but is not so clear to me, as he would make it. That <hi>Provincial Synods,</hi> heretofore, did look upon Themselves as endued with a sufficient <hi>Authority</hi> to proceed against any of their <hi>Own Body,</hi> who, by any of the <hi>Crimes</hi> before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, had deserved their Censure, is not to be deny'd. The <hi>Provincial Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi> of old did so; but especially in the Case of <hi>Heresie,</hi> wherein the <hi>Church</hi> has ever Accounted it self to be particularly Concern'd. But then it must be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd too, that when they had so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded against Any One, the <hi>Prince</hi> still judged whether they had <hi>acted Canonical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> or no: And if he found a just Reason to move Him so to do, he did, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, suspend their <hi>Sentence,</hi> and order a new Enquiry, in some other <hi>Synod,</hi> to be made of such a Matter; and after all, determined it, at last, as He saw Cause. Thus <hi>Theodosius</hi> did in the Case of <hi>Nest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi>

And when <hi>Flavian</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> had in like manner condemned <hi>Eutyches</hi> for his <hi>Heresie,</hi> the <hi>Emperor</hi> not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd the Matter to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> to be re-heard by it; but when, by the indirect Management of <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> that <hi>Synod,</hi> instead of <hi>Confirming</hi> his <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> against <hi>Eutyches,</hi> condemn'd <hi>Flavian</hi> himself, tho' <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Innocent; Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi> not only refused to <hi>suspend</hi> the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences</hi> of <hi>Both,</hi> till another <hi>Free Council</hi> might be call'd to judge of the Matter; but left the <hi>Sentence</hi> of this last <hi>Council</hi> to remain in force, and would not suffer any other <hi>Synod</hi> to be called, about this Affair, as long as He lived.</p>
               <p>As for our <hi>own Convocation,</hi> it is not deny'd but that antiently They were <note place="margin">§ 15.</note> wont to <hi>judge</hi> of <hi>Heresy</hi> in it.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:43857:80"/>
which was this. It had happen'd some time before, that about 30 Persons came over hither out of <hi>Germany,</hi> and held se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Meetings; differing from the <hi>common Opinion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in several Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but chiefly as to the points of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Eucharist.</hi> To prevent the spreading of their Errors, the <hi>King</hi> commanded that <hi>Council</hi> to meet at <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and there to judge of them. Being convened before this <hi>Synod,</hi> and convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their Errors; and, refusing to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure them, they were pronounced <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> by it, and deliver'd back to the <hi>King,</hi> to be punished by the <hi>Civil Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is in a <hi>Provincial Council</hi> held by <hi>Steph. Langton,</hi> that we meet with the next Instance we have, of the like Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. In this we are told of two <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. West. ad An. 1222.</note> upon one of whom were found the <hi>five Wounds</hi> of the <hi>Crucifixion,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed and condemn'd by the Judgments of the <hi>Church.</hi> But <hi>Bracton</hi> adds to these <note place="margin">Bract. l. 3. de Coron. c. 9 n. 2. Conf. Wals. Hyp. Neustr. ad An. 1222. p. 464.</note> another, and a more notable Instance. He tells us of a certain <hi>Deacon,</hi> who, out of <hi>Love</hi> to a <hi>Jewish Woman,</hi> apostatiz'd from the <hi>Faith of Christ;</hi> and was thereupon <hi>sentenc'd</hi> and <hi>degraded</hi> by the <hi>Synod,</hi> and deliver'd over to the <hi>Secular Power,</hi> to be <hi>Burnt</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>And the same was the manner by which


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43857:81"/>
                  <hi>Sautre</hi> was condemn'd; as appears not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Fitzherb. Nat Brev. p. 269.</note> by the <hi>Writ,</hi> still extant, for his Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but from the <hi>Rolls</hi> of the <hi>Parliament 2 Hen.</hi> 4. in which the order was given for issuing out the <hi>Writ,</hi> to the <hi>Sheriffs,</hi> of <hi>London</hi> for it, <hi>Feb.</hi> 26. He was first exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and condemned by the <hi>Clergy</hi> in <hi>Convocation,</hi> and by them deliver'd up to the <hi>Civil Magistrate</hi> to be burned. And tho' the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> was not finally <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced</hi> in <hi>Convocation,</hi> but by the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Wals. Hyp.

               <p>The Truth is, so great is the Scandal, and so severe, in those days, was the Punishment too of <hi>Heresy;</hi> that it has moved some very Learned Men to think, that before the 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. no one could be otherwise convicted of it, than in a <hi>Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi> or <hi>Convocation.</hi> And tho' my Lord <note place="margin">3. Instit. chap. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Coke</hi> maintains this to be a Mistake, and affirms that the <hi>Bishop</hi> always had, as He still has, Power to <hi>convict</hi> of <hi>Heresy,</hi> and to proceed, by the <hi>Censures</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> against such as are guilty of it; yet this is no Argument why the <hi>Convocation</hi> should not still retain its antient Authority, and have the Power of doing that, which any single <hi>Bishop</hi> alone may do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:43857:81"/>
But here then a question may arise <note place="margin">§. 16.</note> that will deserve to be consider'd on this occasion; and that is, When any one is to be convicted of <hi>Heresie,</hi> or of any other the like <hi>Ecclesiastical Crime,</hi> in <hi>Convocation;</hi> who it is that <hi>judges</hi> him? Whether he is to be <hi>judged</hi> by the <hi>Votes</hi> of the two <hi>Houses?</hi> or, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he is to be <hi>judged</hi> by the <hi>upper House</hi> alone, and the <hi>lower</hi> to stand in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Prosecutors</hi> against him? Or lastly, Whether the <hi>Archbishop</hi> alone does properly <hi>judge;</hi> and the rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr, as <hi>Assistants,</hi> to him, and assent to what he does?</p>
               <p>In answer to which Enquiry, if I may be allow'd to offer my own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; I do conceive, that in such cases as these, it is not so much the <hi>Convocation</hi> that judges, as the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi> in <hi>Convocation.</hi> For besides that, it was never known that the inferiour <hi>Clergy</hi> were allow'd a <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> in such cases; nor is there any reason why they should have it here: First, The very words of the <hi>Writ</hi> upon which <hi>Sautrey</hi> was burnt, seem to speak in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Conviction in <hi>Convocation,</hi> as shew the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Judicature</hi> to have


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:43857:82"/>
been eminently in the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> and that the rest were only of <hi>Council</hi> to him, and <hi>consented</hi> to what he did. <hi>Cum venerabilis Pater</hi> Thomas <hi>Archiepisco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Cant. totius Angliae Primas, &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicae sedis legatus, de</hi> Consensu &amp; As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensu, <hi>ac</hi> Consilio <hi>Episcoporum,</hi> &amp; <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fratrum Suffraganeorum suorum, necnon totius Cleri provinciae suae, in Concilio suo Provinciali congregati—per suam sententiam definitivam Haereticum mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festum</hi> pronunciavit &amp; declaravit, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Nor can this be sufficiently accounted for by looking upon the <hi>Archbishop</hi> as <hi>President</hi> of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> and so acting as <hi>Speaker</hi> in it. When the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> in the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> or the <hi>Lord High Steward</hi> in the <hi>Commission</hi> for <hi>Tryal</hi> of a <hi>Peer,</hi> determine, or give Sentence, in any <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>criminal Cause;</hi> we do not find it said, That <hi>they,</hi> with the <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Assent of the Lords, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,</hi> or <hi>award, so or so;</hi> but they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Sentence</hi> of the <hi>Lords,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that this or that is <hi>their Judgment.</hi> And the same ought to have been the case here, supposing that the <hi>Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or even the <hi>upper House,</hi> had equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judged with the <hi>Archbishop.</hi> The <hi>Writ</hi> must have run in the Name of the

Nor can any good reason, I believe, be given, why the <hi>Writ</hi> did not run in this manner, but because the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> even in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> still retain'd the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature,</hi> which I shall presently shew was peculiar to him; and by vertue thereof, <hi>judged</hi> of him.</p>
               <p>And this will yet more clearly appear, Secondly, From the acts of the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> under K. <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Fifth, Anno</hi> 1413: and the Process made against the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>For first, Upon several Provocations <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Wals. Hypod.

               </p>
               <p>

because he was a <hi>Person</hi> in great <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit</hi> with his <hi>Majesty;</hi> and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd upon the account of his <hi>Own Honour</hi> and <hi>Quality.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Having obtain'd <hi>leave</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> to proceed against him; it is said all along, that my <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> summon'd him to <hi>appear before him</hi> in <hi>Convocation.</hi> That when the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons could no otherwise be executed upon him, <hi>he</hi> order<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d it to be fix'd upon the doors of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi> That upon the eleventh of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> (the day appointed for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,) the <hi>Archbishop</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated him; and after a farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, at last came to a final Sentence against him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, tho' this process began in <hi>Convocation,</hi> yet it was carry'd on, and ended out of it: But withal, it is plain, that tho' the <hi>Convocation</hi> was risen, yet still the <hi>Archbishop</hi> continued the same process, that began in it. He sate in the <hi>Chapter House</hi> of St. <hi>Paul's;</hi> he took the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Winchester</hi> first, and then to them added the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Bangor</hi> for his <hi>Assistants.</hi> Besides these, a great number of the <hi>inferiour Clergy</hi> was present: And when at last,


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43857:83"/>
the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> was brought before him; the <hi>Archbishop</hi> took notice to him, how he had been discover'd, and accused in <hi>Convocation;</hi> i. e. had been accused to himself in <hi>Convocation,</hi> when they first desired him to proceed against him. To all which, let me add the Preamble to the <hi>Sentence,</hi> which the <hi>Archbishop</hi> at last pass'd upon him, and which shews, that both <hi>in</hi> and <hi>out</hi> of <hi>Convocation,</hi> the judgment of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lay before him: <hi>We,</hi> Thomas <hi>by Divine Permission,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in a certain Cause or Matter of Heretical Pravity, of and concerning divers Articles, upon which, Sir</hi> John Oldcastle <hi>Knight, Lord</hi> Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, <hi>was accused</hi> before Us <hi>in the last</hi> Convocation <hi>of the Clergy of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of</hi> Cant. &amp;<hi>c.</hi> Nor let any one think, that in asserting such an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> to the <hi>Archbishop</hi> in these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, any injury is done to his <hi>Suffragan Bishops:</hi> but rather, were it otherwise, the <hi>Convocation</hi> must apparently have encroach'd upon that eminent power of judging, which the <hi>Archbishop</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had. For tho' since the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 23 of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth,</hi> the power <note place="margin">23. II. 8. c. 9.</note> of the <hi>Archbishop</hi> is very much restrain'd; and he cannot now call whatever causes


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:43857:84"/>
he pleases to his own judgment; but only under the Limitations provided in that <hi>Act;</hi> and therefore since that time, the right of judging in this case would, in the first instance, have belonged to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rochester;</hi> and to the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,</hi> no otherwise, than either by way of Appeal, or upon some negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or defect in the <hi>Diocesan</hi> to judge of it: yet before that <hi>Statute,</hi> the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi> had a power to call any cause im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before himself; and when therefore, in his <hi>Syned,</hi> he did do so, we ought not to question but that it was he, who, properly speaking, did <hi>judge;</hi> and that the rest of the <hi>Bishops</hi> were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his <hi>Assistants</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>I conclude then, that tho' the person, in such a case were try'd in <hi>Convocation;</hi> yet, precisely speaking, it was the part of the <hi>lower House</hi> to <hi>discover</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse;</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> to <hi>counsel</hi> and <hi>assist;</hi> but of the <hi>Archbishop</hi> to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>judge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But still the main question remains <note place="margin">§. 17.</note> to be consider'd, namely, Whether the <hi>Convocation,</hi> (howsoever it be that it <hi>judges)</hi> may proceed in these cases with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>King's leave;</hi> or whether his <hi>Commission</hi> be necessary to justifie them in it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:43857:84"/>
That they are not restrained by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue <note place="margin">Letter. p. 59.</note> of that <hi>Statute,</hi> which has so much retrench'd their <hi>power</hi> in other respects, is confidently affirm'd: Nor shall I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that the intention of that <hi>Act</hi> seems rather to restrain them from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any <hi>New Canons</hi> or <hi>Constitutions;</hi> than from judging, in <hi>causes Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> according to the <hi>Canons</hi> already made.</p>
               <p>That they had heretofore a power to judge in such Cases, my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers as certain in point of <hi>Law;</hi> and from thence calls it the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Convocation.</hi> Nor can I see what injury it would be to the <hi>Crown,</hi> to allow the same power to the <hi>Convocation</hi> still, that by Law may be exercised in any other <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Court;</hi> and which must needs be inseriour in dignity to this.</p>
               <p>But still the question is, Whether, of Right, the <hi>Convocation</hi> ever had a power to <hi>judge,</hi> any more than to <hi>make Canons,</hi> without the <hi>King's Assent?</hi> And by consequence, whether though the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth should not have deprived them of that power, yet the <hi>King's Prerogative</hi> be not against it? <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Ch. II. Sect. 23. 36.</note> For should this be so, then whatever Laws have restored the <hi>King</hi> to his <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi>


                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:43857:85"/>
                  <hi>Authority</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical Matters,</hi> will lie against this presumed Right of the <hi>Convocation</hi> too: and so, though that Law should not, yet some others may have limited their power in this respect also.</p>
               <p>And here I shall not presume to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> loc. supr. cit.</note> any thing; but only offer these following Observations:</p>
               <p>First, That in <hi>several</hi> of the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> in which the persons before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd were judged; the Process was made either by the express <hi>Command,</hi> or <hi>Leave</hi> of the <hi>King:</hi> And in <hi>all</hi> of them for ought we know, it may have been so. And,</p>
               <p>Secondly, That in the <hi>Commissions,</hi> by which our <hi>Convocations</hi> are now enabled to <hi>act;</hi> the <hi>King</hi> gives them leave to <hi>conferr, debate, treat, consider, consult</hi> and <hi>agree,</hi> of <hi>Matters</hi> and <hi>Causes,</hi> as well as of <hi>Canons, Orders</hi> and <hi>Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions:</hi> and which seems to imply, that they need the <hi>King's License,</hi> as much to <hi>judge</hi> of the <hi>one,</hi> as to <hi>delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> about the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:43857:85"/>
But be this as it will; thus much <note place="margin">§. 18.</note> I take to be out of all doubt, that as by our <hi>Ancient Customs,</hi> recognized by the <hi>Lords Spiritual,</hi> as well as <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> in the <hi>Great Council</hi> at <hi>Clarendon, Anno</hi> 1164; It was among other things resolved, that none of the <hi>Servants</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> or of such as held of him <hi>in capite,</hi> might be <hi>Excommunicated</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave: And again, that in <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Appeals,</hi> any person, who thought himself injured, might appeal, from the <hi>Arch Deacon</hi> to the <hi>Bishop;</hi> from the <hi>Bishop</hi> to the <hi>Archbishop;</hi> and from <hi>him</hi> to the <hi>King;</hi> by whose order the affair was finally to be determined in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Arches,</hi> and not be suffer'd to proceed any farther without leave of the <hi>King:</hi> so, in Conformity both to these <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and to that power which I have <note place="margin">Ch. II. Sect. 36</note> before shewn, has ever been claimed and exercised by <hi>Christian Princes</hi> in this respect, I do presume, that the <hi>King</hi>

               <p>This I am sure the ancient <hi>Emperors</hi> did; and the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Councils</hi> not only submitted to it, but allowed of it.

               <p>And this brings me to the last point <note place="margin">§. 19.</note> now to be consider'd:</p>
               <p>(3dly.) What <hi>Authority</hi> our Kings have over their <hi>Convocations;</hi> after they have done what they were called for?</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Convocation</hi> cannot meet without the <hi>King's Writ,</hi> I have before shewn from the express Authority of an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament:</hi> And that the same <hi>Authority</hi> is required to the <hi>Dismission,</hi> as to the <hi>Calling</hi> of it, has been the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared opinion of our greatest <hi>Lawyers</hi> in this Case.</p>

This His <hi>Majesty</hi> Graciously Approved, and the Question was accordingly put to Them. They answer'd, as followeth, under their Hands: <q>
                     <hi>The</hi> Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>being called by the</hi> King's Writ, <hi>under the Great Seal, doth continue, untill it be</hi> Dissolved <hi>by</hi> Writ, <hi>or</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission <hi>under the Great Seal.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And accordingly we know, that not only, upon their <hi>Dissolution,</hi> but for Every <hi>Prorogation</hi> that is made of it, there is a <hi>Writ</hi> sent by the <hi>King</hi> to the <hi>Arch-Bishop;</hi> and They cannot break up when they please; but must conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to Sit, as long as the <hi>King</hi> shall think fit to Require Them so to do.</p>
               <p>Such Authority has His <hi>Majesty</hi> over <note place="margin">§. 20.</note> their <hi>Assemblies:</hi> nor has He any less over their <hi>Acts.</hi> It is, I think, agreed


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:43857:87"/>
on all hands, that no <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> are of any force, untill they are Confirm'd by the <hi>Royal Authority.</hi> And that is all I am now concern'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. <hi>How far,</hi> or, <hi>What persons,</hi> they will oblige, when Confirm'd by the <hi>King,</hi> without the Concurrence of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> is another Question; in which I am not, at present, concern'd to Engage.</p>
               <p>But tho' of this therefore, in General, there be no doubt; yet I cannot tell whether some Men may be willing to allow the <hi>King all</hi> that <hi>Authority,</hi> which, I have before shew'd, Other <hi>Princes</hi> have claim'd, and which I see no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why our Own <hi>Kings</hi> should not Enjoy.</p>
               <p>It is expressly provided by the 25th. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8th, That the <hi>Convocation</hi> shall not only not presume to <hi>make</hi> any <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> without the <hi>King's permission;</hi> but that having made Them, <q>

               <p>[2dly.] That notwithstanding the <hi>Resolution</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> in their <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> yet still the <hi>King</hi> is to remain the last Judge, not only of the <hi>Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> but of the <hi>Expediency</hi> too, of their <hi>Constitutions:</hi> and has Authority either to <hi>Ratifie,</hi> or <hi>Reject</hi> Them, as He, with the <hi>Advice</hi> of his <hi>Council,</hi> shall think Them either <hi>Usefull,</hi> or <hi>Otherwise,</hi> to the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When His <hi>Majesty</hi> gave Liberty to our <hi>last Convocation,</hi> to consider of the several Points which, in his <hi>Commission,</hi> he proposed to Them; and permitted Them to draw into <hi>Forms, Rules, Orders, Ordinances, Constitutions, and Canons, such Matters as to Them should seem Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Expedient, for the Purposes which He had before proposed to Them; and the same being set down in Writing, from

time to time to Exhibit and Deliver, or to Cause to be Exhibited, and Delivered, to Him:</hi> He thus goes on to declare what was to be done, after such their <hi>Resolutions</hi> should be delivered in by Them;—<hi>To the End that We, as Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion shall Require, may thereupon have the</hi> Advice <hi>of our</hi> Parliament; <hi>and that such, and so many, of the said Canons, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Ordinances and Constitutions, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Causes and Things, as shall be thought Requisite and Convenient, by our said</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>may be presented to us in due Form, for Our</hi> Royal Assent, if upon Mature Consideration thereof <hi>We shall</hi> think sit <hi>to</hi> Enact <hi>the same.</hi> And from whence it appears to have been His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty</hi>'s Intention, had that <hi>Convocation</hi> proceeded to any Resolutions, to have submitted the Examination of their <hi>Acts</hi> not only to his <hi>Parliament;</hi> but, that being done, to have Reserved the final Judgment of Them to his Own Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration: And we cannot doubt but that it was upon the best Advice of his Learned <hi>Council</hi> in the <hi>Law,</hi> that He so Intended.</p>

                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:43857:89"/>
the <hi>First</hi> to the <hi>Convocation</hi> of 1640, before mentioned. Wherein having granted the same Liberty, we here meet with, to his Clergy; <hi>To set down in Writing, and to Exhibit, or Cause to be Exhibited to Him, All and Every the said Canons, Orders, Ordinances, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, Matters, Causes, and Things, to be by Them from time to time, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd, Treated, Debated, Consider'd, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted and Agreed upon:</hi> He adds; <hi>To the end that We, upon</hi> mature Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration by Us to be taken <hi>thereupon, may Allow, Approve, Confirm, and Ratifie; or Otherwise Disallow, Annihilate, and Make Void,</hi> such, <hi>and</hi> so many <hi>of the said Canons, Orders, Ordinances, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, Matters, Causes, and Things, or</hi> Any of Them; <hi>so to be by force of These Presents Consider'd, Consulted, and Agreed upon, as</hi> We <hi>shall think Fit, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, and Convenient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not yet all; In the close of his Commission he again Reserves to Himself the same Power; in these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Words: <hi>Provided always, and our Express Will, Pleasure, and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, That the said Canons, Orders, Ordinances, and Constitutions, Matters, Causes, and Things, or</hi> Any of Them,


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:43857:90"/>
                  <hi>so to be, by force of These Presents, Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, Consulted, or Agreed upon, shall not be of Any Force, Effect, or Validity in the Law, but only</hi> such, <hi>and</hi> so many <hi>of Them, and</hi> after such time, <hi>as</hi> We <hi>by our Letters Patent under our Great Seal of</hi> England <hi>shall Allow, Approve, and Confirm the same.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the Limitations under which that <hi>Convocation</hi> Acted; and from which these (three) Conclusions will Unavoidably follow.</p>
               <p>1st. That the <hi>King,</hi> by granting the <hi>Convocation</hi> license to consider, and draw up any <hi>Canons, Orders,</hi> or <hi>Constitutions;</hi> or to <hi>determine</hi> any <hi>Matters</hi> or <hi>Causes;</hi> do's not give them any <hi>final, decisive Power,</hi> of Concluding those affairs: but Empowers them only to <hi>deliver</hi> their <hi>Judgment</hi> to Him, which He may either <hi>Approve,</hi> or <hi>Reject,</hi> as He shall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards see Cause to do.</p>
               <p>2dly. That in determining concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Resolutions,</hi> He is not obliged either to <hi>Approve,</hi> and <hi>Confirm;</hi> or else to <hi>Reject,</hi> and <hi>Annihilate</hi> ALL that they have done; but may judge di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly of Every <hi>particular Point,</hi> or <hi>Matter,</hi> debated by Them; and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally pass his judgment upon Them:


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:43857:90"/>
May give <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> to <hi>some things,</hi> and at the same time <hi>make Void,</hi> and <hi>disallow</hi> of <hi>Others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this, 3dly. Not only upon his <hi>Own private judgment,</hi> or upon the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of any select persons of his <hi>Clergy,</hi> (tho' it be a matter <hi>Ecclesiastical:)</hi> but with the <hi>advice</hi> of his <hi>Council,</hi> who, by his Command, are also Empowred to judge of what the <hi>Convocation</hi> has done, and whose Opinion, if He approves of it, He may preferr to that of his <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we will go on with the History of this <hi>Convocation;</hi> and see how these several Conclusions may be yet farther clear'd and confirm'd by it.</p>
               <p>When, by Vertue of this <hi>Commission,</hi> the <hi>Convocation</hi> had drawn up such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and agreed upon such Orders, as to them seem'd most proper, to answer the Ends proposed by the <hi>King</hi> to Them; We are told by His <hi>Majesty,</hi> in His <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 30th. following, that, according to His direction, They had Offered, and Presented the same to Him, desiring Him to give His <hi>Royal Assent</hi> to what They had done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:43857:91"/>
Now as hereby they plainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged His <hi>Majesty</hi> to have all that <hi>Authority,</hi> as to this matter, which, in His <hi>Commission,</hi> he had pretended to; so we find the <hi>King</hi> still proceeded, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the same measures he had first laid down, to the <hi>Ratification</hi> of what they presented to Him. For thus the <hi>Declaration</hi> goes on: <q>We, having di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, with great Content and Comfort, Read and Consider'd, <hi>all the said Orders, Ordinances, and Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, agreed upon, as is before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd: And finding the same such, as</hi> We are persuaded <hi>will be very</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, <hi>not only to Our</hi> Clergy, <hi>but to the</hi> whole Church <hi>of this Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and to All the true Members of it (if they be well Observed:)</hi> Have therefore <hi>for Us, our Heirs, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Successors, of our</hi> special Grace, certain Knowledge, <hi>and</hi> meer Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>given, and by these Presents do give Our</hi> Royal Assent, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the</hi> Form <hi>of the said</hi> Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, <hi>or</hi> Act <hi>of</hi> Parliament <hi>afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said; to</hi> All <hi>and</hi> Every <hi>of the said</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">25 H. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Canons,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:43857:91"/>
But because in the Beginning of this <note place="margin">§. 23.</note> Declaration, the <hi>King</hi> alledges the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of His <hi>Royal Father</hi> for what He did, whose Pattern he proposed to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in this Particular; I cannot but observe that He did stick so closely to it, as to use the very <hi>same Form;</hi> (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the very <hi>same Words;)</hi> in confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these <hi>Canons</hi> of 1640; that the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had done, in Ratifying of those of 1603. And from whence we may the more undoubtedly conclude, That as the Consequences before drawn from the Tenour of these publick Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are, in point of <hi>Reason,</hi> plain and unavoidable; so is their Authority, in point of <hi>Law,</hi> Certain, and Indisputable: and that our <hi>Kings</hi> do not only <hi>in fact,</hi> Claim, and Exercise such a <hi>Power,</hi> as we have now seen, over their <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> but have also an apparent <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>Exercise</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Whether our <hi>Kings</hi> may not only <note place="margin">§. 24.</note> Confirm, <hi>such,</hi> and <hi>so many,</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> &amp;c. of their <hi>Convocations,</hi> as they shall judge Expedient; and <hi>Refuse,</hi> and <hi>Reject</hi> the Rest; but may also, by their <hi>supreme Authority</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiastical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:43857:92"/>
Correct,</hi> and <hi>Amend</hi> those which they do allow of, I shall not undertake to say. But so we are told <hi>King Henry</hi> the Eighth did, and that in a Case of the strictest nature; in framing the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note place="margin">Hp. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net:</hi> Hist. Ref. p. 217.</note> publish'd by his Authority, <hi>Anno</hi> 1536. Thus much I believe, may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably be asserted; That as the <hi>King</hi> has Power, without a <hi>Convocation,</hi> to <hi>make,</hi> and <hi>publish</hi> such <hi>Injunctions</hi> as he shall think the <hi>Necessities</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to Require, and to <hi>Command</hi> the <hi>Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> of Them; so may He, with the <hi>Advice</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> of His <hi>Parliament,</hi> much more, not only make what <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Laws</hi> He shall think sitting, for the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> but make such use of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions</hi> agreed to in it, in Order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as He shall think fit: And (as I have shewn the <hi>French King</hi>'s heretofore to have done;) may not only <hi>confirm,</hi> or <hi>disallow;</hi> but may sometimes even <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and <hi>correct,</hi> what is done by Them, according to His Own liking.</p>
               <p>And now that I have mention'd this <hi>Convocation</hi> of <hi>King Henry the Eighth;</hi>

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:43857:92"/>
that <hi>King</hi>'s dealing with that Assembly; and so conclude these Remarks.</p>
               <p>It would be needless for me to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, after the account I have already given of the <hi>Act</hi> which was Pass'd but a few years before, by the same <hi>King,</hi> to that purpose; that this <hi>Convocation</hi> was call'd by his <hi>Writ.</hi> I will rather take notice, that the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> set forth by them, were not only corrected by that <hi>Prince,</hi> after they had been <hi>framed</hi> by the <hi>Convocation;</hi> but were drawn up by Them, according to the <hi>Method,</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> which He gave to them for that purpose. So his <hi>Declaration,</hi> to all his <hi>loving Subjects,</hi> in <hi>Confirmation</hi> of these <hi>Articles,</hi> informs Us. <q>And <hi>for because we would the said</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But that which I would principally observe in this Declaration, is, Upon what <hi>Grounds,</hi> and with what <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> gave his <hi>Assent</hi> to those <hi>Articles.</hi> I have before said, and, from the words now Quoted, it sufficiently appears; that the <hi>Articles</hi> here referr'd to did, at least in one great part of Them, relate to <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> and that in the most necessary Points of it. And yet see what Liberty that <hi>King</hi> took, in <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as well as <hi>correcting,</hi> of what they had done. He was speaking of the design he <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Where after long and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Deliberation, had of and upon the Premises, finally They have Concluded, and Agreed upon, the most</hi> special Points <hi>and</hi> Articles; <hi>as well such as be</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of God, <hi>and are</hi> Necessary to our Salvation; <hi>as also divers</hi> Other matters <hi>touching the</hi> Honest Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>and</hi> Good, <hi>and</hi> Politick Orders, <hi>as is aforesaid.—Which</hi> their Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Debatement, <hi>and</hi> Agreement, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch

as</hi> WE THINK <hi>to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded of a Good, Right, and true Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to be Agreeable to the Laws, and Ordinances of God; and much profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the stablishment of that Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Concord, and Unity, in our</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>which we most desire;</hi> We have caused the same to be Publish'd; <hi>Willing, Requiring, and Commanding you to Accept, Repute, and Take them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Such a Judgment did this <hi>Prince</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to himself, over those <hi>Acts</hi> of his <hi>Clergy,</hi> which the most properly fall under an <hi>Ecclesiastical Determination!</hi> And so little have our <hi>Princes</hi> thought Themselves obliged either to Receive Themselves, or to Impose upon Others, any of their <hi>Orders,</hi> or <hi>Decisions;</hi> but as they were finally persuaded that what they had done proceeded from a <hi>sound Judgment,</hi> and would be for the <hi>Benefit</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom</hi> to be <hi>Observed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now from what I have before as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, <note place="margin">§. 25.</note> and I hope sufficiently proved, to be the <hi>Rights</hi> of all <hi>Christian Princes</hi> in General; and to be not only not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, but rather to be expressly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by our <hi>Own Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs,</hi> to be


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:43857:94"/>
the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of our <hi>Own Kings</hi> in this Particular; It will be no hard matter to give a Clear and Positive Answer to the first <hi>General Question</hi> proposed to be Resolved, in all the Parts of it.</p>
               <p>For, first: Whereas it is demanded, <hi>Whether there be any</hi> Law, <hi>that</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>or</hi> Permits, <hi>the</hi> Sitting, <hi>and</hi> Acting <hi>of the</hi> Convocation, <hi>besides the</hi> Absolute, free Pleasure <hi>of the</hi> Prince? I Reply, That if by <hi>Sitting</hi> be meant their being Summon'd at such times as the <hi>Parliament</hi> is Assembled, there is a Continued, Immemorial <hi>Custom,</hi> which do's determine the <hi>Prince</hi> to Summon a Convocation at such Seasons, and leaves it not any longer to his <hi>free,</hi> and <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Will,</hi> Whether he will Summon it, or no? When this <hi>Custom</hi> first began, or How long it has become the setled, and constant Method with us, to have a <hi>Convocation</hi> Call'd at the same time that the <hi>Parliament</hi> meets, it matters not to our present Purpose to Enquire. Sure we are, that this has been the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> ever since the 25th. of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth: And that is enough to shew that it ought not Easily to be neglected. And therefore, tho I know no <hi>Positive Law</hi> that do's determine the <hi>King's Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi>


                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:43857:94"/>
and <hi>free Will,</hi> as to this matter; yet I humbly conceive that so ancient, and setled a <hi>Custom</hi> ought to be held to; and our <hi>Princes</hi> accordingly still order the <hi>one</hi> to be <hi>summon'd,</hi> as often as the <hi>other</hi> is <hi>called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now, secondly, If by <hi>sitting</hi> be meant (as in the present question I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it is) their <hi>meeting</hi> to <hi>do Business;</hi> and being allow'd to <hi>come together</hi> for <hi>that purpose:</hi> Then I reply, that for <hi>such</hi> their <hi>sitting,</hi> I know no <hi>Law</hi> besides the <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>free power</hi> of the <hi>Prince. Custom,</hi> we are sure is as much <hi>against this,</hi> as it has been <hi>for</hi> the <hi>other;</hi> and any <hi>Statute</hi> or <hi>positive Law</hi> for it, has not, that I know of, been pretended to.</p>
               <p>Indeed whilst the <hi>Clergy</hi> were wont to <hi>assess</hi> themselves, and their <hi>sitting,</hi> upon that account, was necessary for the support of the Government; they were not only <hi>summon'd</hi> to <hi>meet,</hi> but were wont <hi>actually</hi> to <hi>assemble,</hi> and <hi>sit,</hi> so long as it was requisite for them to do for this purpose. But that being done, they were for the most part forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Adjourned,</hi> and met no more, till the <hi>King</hi> had some new occasion for their assistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:43857:95"/>
And that I may not be thought to speak this at all adventures, I will offer an instance or two of it. The <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which met the first of <hi>King James</hi> the First: was by <hi>Prorogations</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from time to time, for seven years together. Yet, except it were in his <hi>first year,</hi> we do not hear of any great business that was done by them, more than that of granting <hi>Subsidies,</hi> which I have mention'd.</p>
               <p>In <hi>King Charles</hi> the First's time, there were but few <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and therefore we are not to look for <hi>Convocations</hi> in that. When his Son, <hi>King Charles</hi> the Second return'd; the famous <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of 1660 met, to remedy those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders which the <hi>Civil Wars</hi> had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd. In order whereunto it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for them at the first to sit, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the Affairs of the <hi>Church:</hi> but that being done, they were by the <hi>King's Writ</hi> prorogued eighteen several times successively; and it does not appear by the <hi>Journal</hi> of it, which I have seen, that any thing material was afterwards done by it.</p>
               <p>And as their <hi>sitting,</hi> so thirdly, I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that their <hi>acting</hi> too does <hi>depend</hi> upon the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Prince.</hi> They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

enter upon any business without his <hi>special Commission</hi> for it: And whether he will grant them such a <hi>Commission</hi> or no, <hi>depends entirely</hi> upon his <hi>own Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when I say, that the <hi>sitting</hi> and <hi>acting</hi> of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> does depend upon the <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>free Will</hi> of the <hi>Prince;</hi> (and which <hi>terms</hi> I make use <note place="margin">Letter. p. 1.</note> of, only because they are prescribed to me by one, whom at present I am obliged to follow.) I must observe, that by his <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>free will,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a <hi>Will</hi> not determined by any <hi>humane Law,</hi> to <hi>act</hi> otherwise than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Dictates</hi> of a Man's <hi>own Reason,</hi> and upon the <hi>last Result</hi> of his <hi>own Judgment,</hi> he would do. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there are <hi>Laws,</hi> which in this, as in all other cases of the like Nature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the most <hi>absolute Sovereigns</hi> in the World: and we do not deny <hi>our King,</hi> as well as all other <hi>Princes,</hi> to be subject to them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> is a <hi>Law</hi> by which every <hi>wise Man does,</hi> and <hi>every Man,</hi> as such, is <hi>obliged</hi> to <hi>act.</hi>

both out of <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their <hi>own Consciences,</hi> are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to attend.</p>
               <p>And lastly, The <hi>publick Good</hi> and <hi>Welfare</hi> of the <hi>Community,</hi> is another <hi>Law,</hi> to which all <hi>Princes,</hi> even those who, in other respects, are the most absolute; are oblig'd to look: and with the observance of which they cannot <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,</hi> tho' no <hi>human Constraint</hi> lies upon them, to force them thereunto, or to <hi>punish</hi> them if they do not.</p>
               <p>By all these <hi>Laws, Princes</hi> are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: And the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by these <hi>Laws,</hi> but not under the direction of any more <hi>particular Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> is that <hi>Will</hi> on which I affirm the <hi>sitting</hi> and <hi>acting</hi> of the <hi>Convocation</hi> to depend. The <hi>Government</hi> has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted him with the <hi>Power</hi> of giving them leave to <hi>sit</hi> and <hi>act</hi> when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and when he pleases, he may deny them to do either. But still it was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, when that <hi>trust</hi> was committed to him, that he should use it with <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Moderation;</hi> and as he should from time to time be perswaded, would be most for the <hi>publick Good,</hi> both of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:43857:96"/>
And therefore, fourthly, Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any thing that has hitherto been said, I shall not doubt to affirm; that whenever the <hi>King</hi> is in his <hi>own Conscience</hi> convinced, that for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> to <hi>sit</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> would be for the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Benefit</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> or otherwise for the <hi>publick Good</hi> and <hi>Welfare</hi> of his <hi>Realm;</hi> he is obliged both by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> as a <hi>Man;</hi> by his <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> as a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi> and by his <hi>duty</hi> to his <hi>People,</hi> as a <hi>Ruler</hi> set over them for their <hi>Good;</hi> to <hi>permit,</hi> or rather to <hi>command</hi> his <hi>Clergy</hi> to <hi>meet</hi> in <hi>Convocation,</hi> and transact what is sit, for any or all these ends, to be done by them.</p>
               <p>As on the other hand, whensoever he is clearly and evidently convinced, that for them thus to come together, would be <hi>needless,</hi> or <hi>hurtfull,</hi> to these <hi>ends;</hi> it is then his <hi>duty</hi> to restrain them from <hi>sitting;</hi> and that tho' he should be never so importunately desired by some, that they may sit; or rail'd at by others, for not allowing them so to do.</p>
               <p>These I take to be the plain <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi> of the foregoing Discourse: And by them, I suppose, a clear and full


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:43857:97"/>
                  <hi>Resolution</hi> is given, to the first <hi>general Question,</hi> viz.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whether there be any <hi>Law</hi> that <hi>commands</hi> or <hi>permits,</hi> the <hi>sitting</hi> and <hi>acting</hi> of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> besides the <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>free Pleasure</hi> of the <hi>Prince?</hi> And if there be, <hi>What</hi> that <hi>Law</hi> is? And <hi>how far</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> is <hi>obliged</hi> by it?</q>
               </p>
               <p>I might now proceed upon this <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> without any more ado, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine what has been offer'd by our late <hi>Author</hi> to the contrary, and so pass on to the other part of my Discourse. But because it may be a matter of some Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, as well as use, to those whose Enquiries have not lain this way, to know what has been the <hi>State</hi> of our <hi>Convocations,</hi> ever since we have any accounts, that we can rely upon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them: I will therefore take leave to digress so far from my present business, as may suffice to shew this, in a <hi>short History</hi> of our <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> from the first <hi>Conversion</hi> of the <hi>Saxons</hi> to <hi>Christianity,</hi> down to our present Times.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>SO great is the <hi>Uncertainty</hi> to which <note place="margin">§. 1.</note> all <hi>humane Constitutions</hi> are exposed, that tho' I have before sufficiently shewn what the <hi>Nature</hi> of our <hi>Convocation</hi> at present is, and what <hi>Authority</hi> our <hi>Kings</hi> have over it; yet we can by no means from thence conclude, that this was always the <hi>case</hi> of it; or that the <hi>Act</hi> of the 25th of <hi>King Henry</hi> the VIII. did only restore our <hi>Kings</hi> to their <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rights</hi> over their <hi>Clergy;</hi> and not rather give them a <hi>greater Power</hi> than ever they before had; or than the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> ought to have put into their hands.</p>
               <p>To clear this matter, and withal to shew how <hi>Ecclesiastical Affairs</hi> have heretofore been transacted in this <hi>Realm;</hi> I shall here take a short View of the <hi>State</hi> of our <hi>Convocation</hi> in times past,


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:43857:98"/>
and of the method that was wont to be observed in making of <hi>Canonical Orders</hi> and <hi>Constitutions;</hi> from the Conversion of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> to the settlement of it in that <hi>Form</hi> under which it continues to this very day.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Method</hi> I shall take for the better clearing of this matter, shall be this:</p>

                  <p>And First: Let us enquire, how the <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Affairs</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> were <hi>transacted,</hi> from the first <hi>Conversion</hi> of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> to the time of the <hi>Norman Conquest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is evident to any one who has ever consider'd, by what <hi>Authority,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what <hi>Manner,</hi> our <hi>Clergy</hi> are called together in <hi>Convocation;</hi> that when those <hi>Writs</hi> were framed which we still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to make use of, they referr'd to a <hi>double end,</hi> and it was intended the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> should meet together under a <hi>double Capacity,</hi> by vertue of them.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>King</hi> issues out his <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Writs,</hi> and summons the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> to come to that <hi>great Council;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Bishop</hi> is thereby, distinctly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, <q>To give notice to the <hi>Dean</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">See the Writ it self in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</note> and <hi>Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Cathedral Church,</hi> and to the <hi>Arch-deacons,</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> of his <hi>Diocess,</hi> of the <hi>King</hi>'s Pleasure; to the end that they the said <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Arch-deacon,</hi> in their <hi>proper persons;</hi>

their <hi>Chapter</hi> by <hi>one;</hi> and the <hi>Clergy</hi> of every <hi>Arch-deaconry,</hi> by <hi>two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> lawfully chosen, and empow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered, may, together with the <hi>Bishop,</hi> attend upon the <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Parliament;</hi> and there consent to such things as shall be agreed upon, for the good of the <hi>Church</hi> or State.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this <hi>Clause,</hi> as it equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the <hi>inferiour Clergy,</hi> as the rest of the <hi>Writ</hi> does the <hi>Bishop</hi> himself to come to <hi>Parliament;</hi> so has the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it been accounted so great, that some have thought this to be the reason, <note place="margin">Elsyng. <hi>Meth. of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> p. 42.

                  <p>It must therefore be allow'd, and accordingly it is indeed confessed by those, who have been the best acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the <hi>Nature</hi> of our <hi>Constitution,</hi> that the <hi>Clergy</hi> were anciently a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that the <hi>Dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and <hi>Proxies</hi> of the <hi>Lower Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> did, together with the <hi>Spiritual

                     <hi>Writ,</hi> sent out to every <hi>Bishop</hi> in particular: There is another <hi>general Order</hi> directed only to the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of each <hi>Province,</hi> to call together the <hi>whole Clergy</hi> of their several <hi>Provinces,</hi> to another <hi>place,</hi> and (usually) upon another <hi>day.</hi> The <hi>Copy</hi> of this <hi>Writ</hi> the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> sends to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>Dean</hi> of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal College;</hi> and requires him to summon the <hi>Clergy</hi> of his <hi>Province,</hi> and to attend himself, with the <hi>Clergy</hi> of his <hi>own Diocess,</hi> according to the <hi>King's Command.</hi> And this is more properly a <hi>Provincial Synod;</hi> tho', at present, it consists of the <hi>same Persons;</hi> and was oftentimes, heretofore, employed to the same <hi>ends,</hi> that the <hi>Clergy</hi> who came to the <hi>Parliament</hi> were: and consulted at once both of the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and how to supply the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Wants.</p>
                  <p>And as this is the case of the <hi>Clergy</hi> at the present; so if we look back to those <hi>first Times,</hi> we are now particularly to consider, we shall find the foundation of this difference laid in them; and clearly see how it came to be derived down from


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:43857:100"/>
thence to the Times that follow'd after.</p>
                  <p>It has ever been the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> as well as <hi>Piety</hi> of <hi>Christian Princes,</hi> to pay a <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> just deference both to the Judgment and Integrity of their <hi>Church-men:</hi> And to think none more proper to <hi>advise</hi> with, even in their <hi>civil Concerns;</hi> and osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, to intrust too with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them; than those whose <hi>Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> at once disposes them both to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>extent</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and to a quicker <hi>sense</hi> of their <hi>duty,</hi> than is ordinarily to be met with in other Men. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is no Nation, where the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> has prevailed, in which <hi>Ecclesiastical Persons</hi> have not been, by a kind of <hi>general Consent,</hi> admitted to the Management of <hi>civil Affairs;</hi> and been advised with as well in matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the <hi>State,</hi> as in those which concern the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as this first brought them into the <hi>Great Councils</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> so was it the same opinion, of their Ability and Integrity, which first gave original to that part they now have, and ever did enjoy, in the <hi>Parliaments</hi> of this <hi>Nation.</hi> For as our <hi>Princes,</hi> from the beginning, were wont to do all things of greater


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:43857:100"/>
Moment with the <hi>Advice</hi> of their <hi>great Councils:</hi> so, in all those <hi>Councils,</hi> the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> still had the chiefest place, as in the progress of these remarks I shall have occasion very plainly to shew.</p>
                  <p>Nor were the <hi>Laity</hi> any losers at all by this: For the <hi>Bishops</hi> and great <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-men,</hi> being, by these means, present at their <hi>Councils;</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> by his very <hi>Office,</hi> having an <hi>original Right</hi> to deliberate concerning the Affairs of the <hi>Church,</hi> as well as of the <hi>State;</hi> it came to pass, that these <hi>great Councils,</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, transacted both: They delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as well of <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> as of <hi>civil Affairs;</hi> and the causes that concerned the <hi>Church</hi> were no less determined by the Judgment and Authority of the <hi>Laity;</hi> than the <hi>civil</hi> ones were, by the <hi>Advice</hi> of the <hi>Clergy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But because it may be of some advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to the right understanding of this whole <hi>subject,</hi> to have a clear know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the method in which <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs</hi> were wont to be transacted, in these most remote times, upon which I am now entring; and that the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of these, will very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon a right apprehension of the nature of those <hi>great Councils,</hi> I shall


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:43857:101"/>
have so much occasion to insist upon, in this <hi>Period:</hi> I will endeavour, in the first place, to give the most distinct ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I can of them; and that from <hi>Foreign Historians,</hi> as well as from those of our <hi>Own Country.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here were the <hi>manner of holding</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Parliaments</hi> as truly ancient, as its <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face pretends,</hi> and as <hi>some affirm</hi> that it is; we should be able to go on the <note place="margin">Coke 4 In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit p. 12.</note> more easily in our Account of these <hi>Councils.</hi> But because there are many things which make me justly suspect the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of that piece; I must be forced to look out for some other Guides, of a <hi>better Note;</hi> and of whose Sincerity there can be no doubt.</p>
                  <p>That there was all along, in these days, a very near Affinity, between the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and that of our own Country, in its <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> as well as in its <hi>civil Establishment;</hi> might from many Instances evidently be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. Those Northern Nations, who about 400 years after <hi>Christ,</hi> began to over-run the greater part of <hi>Europe,</hi> were very much alike in their Manners and Constitutions: And the Government, which, at the beginning, they setled


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:43857:101"/>
in those <hi>Countries</hi> in which they six'd, tho' in some Circumstances it might vary, yet in the main was the same too.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Parliaments of France</hi> (for so in aftertimes the <hi>great Councils</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> were call'd by them, as well as with us) were first brought into a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Order and Method, by <hi>Pepin,</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Carloman,</hi> about the year 744: in the very times we are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing about. And the manner in which he did it was this. He call'd together <note place="margin">Capitul. Tom. I. p. 155, 160.</note> his <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>great Lords,</hi> to a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> at <hi>Soissons:</hi> and there with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>both,</hi> commanded the <hi>ancient Canons</hi> to be observed, and set out se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>new Constitutions,</hi> for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Laity.</hi> And to the end that the State of both might be kept in better order, they farther decreed, that from thenceforth such a <hi>Synod should be held,</hi> for the same purpose, <hi>once every Year.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus this Affair stood for some time; till about eleven years after, being a little at leisure from those Wars which had almost continually exercised him, he began to put his <hi>Kingdom</hi> into a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Posture. To which end, having

again call'd together almost all the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>

                  <p>And here began a manifest difference <note place="margin">§. 6.</note> to appear between the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Synods.</hi> For at the former of <note place="margin">Vid.

                  <p>Such was the <hi>Polity</hi> which that King establish'd for the Ordering both of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>

and <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Affairs. But now this Settlement, begun by <hi>Pepin,</hi> was very much improved by <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great.</hi> And because of this, we have a very exact account given us by <hi>Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus,</hi>

                  <p>In the first place then He appointed <note place="margin">§. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>two Assemblies</hi> to be held every Year; the One a <hi>General Council,</hi> of all the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi>

                     <hi>Abbots,</hi> and <hi>Lords,</hi> of the <hi>Realm:</hi> The Other more <hi>select,</hi> consisting only of a certain number of the more <hi>aged,</hi> and <hi>honourable</hi> of <hi>all these;</hi> such as the <hi>Prince</hi> should think sit to <hi>chuse;</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his <hi>principal Ministers of State,</hi> whom he also call'd to it.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>General Council,</hi> all the <hi>publick Affairs,</hi> for the following Year, were setled: In the <hi>Other,</hi> were handled such incidental Matters, as not being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen, could not, by Consequence, be provided for, in that <hi>Great Assembly;</hi> and yet were of such a Nature, that They ought not to be deferr'd, till that <hi>Council</hi> should meet again. In <hi>Both</hi> these <hi>Councils,</hi> (tho' chiefly in the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>


                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:43857:103"/>
                     <hi>One) Laws</hi> were made both for the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Realm.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to them what He would have them debate upon; and having for three days consulted together, they laid the Result of their Debates before Him; and his <hi>Choice,</hi> and <hi>Approbation,</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the Matter.</p>
                  <p>But that which I would chiefly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <note place="margin">§. 8.</note> in these <hi>Councils,</hi> is this; That as the Causes which sell in to be handled by them were of a <hi>different Kind,</hi> so were they dispatch'd by Them after a <hi>different Manner.</hi> If the Matter to be deliberated upon were <hi>purely Spiritual;</hi> in that Case, the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Abbots,</hi> went apart by Themselves, and deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon it. If it were <hi>wholly Civil,</hi> or <hi>Military,</hi> the <hi>Lords</hi> alone consulted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. If it were of a <hi>mix'd Nature,</hi> as relating to the <hi>Government</hi> or <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> then they <hi>Both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi> treated of it. But which soever it were, still the <hi>King</hi> consider'd of their <hi>Resolutions;</hi> and determined all, as He saw fit.</p>
                  <p>From this difference both of the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> debated in <hi>these Assemblies,</hi> and of the <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>deliberating</hi> upon Them,

                     <hi>Antiquary</hi> of our Own Country has made the same Remark, the famous <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi> of <hi>Aenham:</hi> at which not only the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Abbots;</hi> but the <hi>lay Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> were present. But yet the most part of what was done in it, related to the <hi>Church;</hi> and was concluded by the <hi>Clergy alone,</hi> who went apart from the <hi>Other Lords,</hi> for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>It were an easie matter to shew that <note place="margin">§. 9.</note> the same method of deliberation conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to be observed, not only in our more Ancient <hi>General Councils</hi> of <hi>this period;</hi> but even after the Reduction of our <hi>Parliament</hi> to the <hi>Form</hi> in which it now is. But this would lead me too far away from those <hi>Times</hi> I am now upon; And I shall have a more <hi>proper Occasion</hi> hereafter to take notice of it. In the mean time, from what has been said, it appears, that the Method of trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting publick Affairs in <hi>France,</hi> in those


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:43857:104"/>
days of which I am at present to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, was briefly this:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They had, every Year, a <hi>General Council</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> made up of the chief Men both in <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Employ,</hi> whether <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiastical:</hi> and therein <hi>Laws</hi> were made, with the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> of the <hi>Prince,</hi> both for the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In <hi>Matters, purely Spiritual,</hi> such as the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Christian Faith;</hi> the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> advised alone: and what was, upon their <hi>Advice,</hi> determined by the <hi>Prince,</hi> became a <hi>Law</hi> as to those Matters.</p>
                  <p>In Matters of a <hi>Mix'd Nature,</hi> as in Regulating the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> The <hi>Great Lords</hi> deliberated together with the <hi>Bishops;</hi> And the <hi>Prince</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, what by the <hi>Common Advice,</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> of <hi>Both,</hi> was Recommended to Him.</p>
                  <p>But because it might so fall out, that some Affairs might arise, which neither could be foreseen at those <hi>General Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> nor might be deferr'd till their next <hi>Assembling;</hi> Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To prevent any Inconvenience that might happen by this means, there was another <hi>Great Council</hi> held every Year, made up of a <hi>select Number</hi> of


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:43857:104"/>
those who came to the <hi>General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:</hi> and by them were such Matters determined after the <hi>same Manner,</hi> and with the <hi>Concurrence</hi> of the same <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> by which the Other proceeded.</p>
                  <p>Such was the method of proceeding <note place="margin">§. 10.</note> in these <hi>Publick Affairs</hi> abroad; and the same was, in Effect, the <hi>Polity</hi> of our Own <hi>Country,</hi> under the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of our <hi>Saxon Princes.</hi> They had their <hi>General Councils,</hi> first, in which they Deliberated of all <hi>Publick Matters:</hi> And these <hi>Councils</hi> consisted of the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops, Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Abbots,</hi> of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;</hi> and of the <hi>Wise-men, Great-men, Alder-men, Counts;</hi> that is to say, of the chief of the <hi>Laity,</hi> indifferently call'd in those Times, by any, or all these Names.</p>
                  <p>In these <hi>Councils</hi> they debated, both of <hi>Civil,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastical Affairs;</hi> and made <hi>Laws,</hi> with the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Consent, and <hi>Concurrence,</hi> for the <hi>Ordering</hi> of <hi>Both.</hi> And this they did, as far as I can judge, after the like manner that, we have seen, the <hi>French</hi> were wont to do: The <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> advised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, in Matters <hi>purely Spiritual;</hi> But the <hi>Great-men</hi> debated together with


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:43857:105"/>
them in <hi>Civil,</hi> and <hi>Mix'd Affairs;</hi> and in which the interest of the <hi>State</hi> was concern'd, as well as that of the <hi>Church.</hi> Thus <hi>Athelstan,</hi> when he publish'd his <note place="margin">See his Pref. to them: <hi>Lamb.</hi> p. 45. Cum <hi>Bed.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Ecclesiastical Laws,</hi> tells us, that He did it with the <hi>Counsel</hi> of his <hi>Bishops:</hi> But when he came to his <hi>Other Constitutions,</hi> we find, from their Subscription, that his <hi>Nobles,</hi> as well as <hi>Bishops,</hi> were Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; <note place="margin">Ib pag. 53.</note> and that <hi>Both</hi> assisted at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Them.</p>
                  <p>Whether, besides these <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">§. 11.</note> there were not, in those Times, some more <hi>particular</hi> Ones with Us, as there were in <hi>France,</hi> I shall not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to say. That in process of time there were, we are very sure; and to which such only of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Great-men</hi> were call'd, as the <hi>Prince</hi> thought sit to <hi>Advise</hi> with.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, as to any setled <hi>times</hi> of these <hi>Councils</hi> meeting, it do's not appear, that as yet there were any fix'd: tho' after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a <hi>Custom</hi> began to be introduced, of holding these <hi>Great Councils</hi> Once every Year. But yet, within this <hi>period,</hi> Our <hi>Princes</hi> began very Solemnly to keep the <hi>Three</hi> Great <hi>Festivals</hi> of the <hi>Year,</hi> with their <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Lords;</hi>


                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:43857:105"/>
And by that means, in some sort, held a <hi>Council,</hi> three times every Year, with Them.</p>
                  <p>It is true, our <hi>ancient Laws</hi> make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">§. 12. Vid. leg. Edv. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess. cap. xxxv.</note> of a <hi>solemn Assembly</hi> that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened every Year upon the <hi>first</hi> of <hi>May;</hi> in which the <hi>chief</hi> both of the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity,</hi> met together. And this differ'd but little, from such a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> as We are now speaking of. But yet, it do's not appear, that in these Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <note place="margin">vid. Spelm. Glossar. Voc. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motum.</note> any <hi>great Affairs</hi> of <hi>State</hi> were transacted, much less any <hi>Laws</hi> made: but rather the main business that was done in them, was solemnly to Renew their <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Fidelity</hi> to the <hi>King;</hi> and for the Maintenance of the <hi>Laws</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made.</p>
                  <p>But tho' the Greatest part of what <note place="margin">§. 13.</note> concern'd the <hi>Church,</hi> was therefore trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted with us, as it was abroad, in these <hi>State Councils;</hi> yet it cannot be doubted but that, within this <hi>Period,</hi> there were held several <hi>Ecclesiastical Convocations,</hi> or <hi>Synods,</hi> properly so called. To these not only the <hi>Archbishops,</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> were admitted; but the <hi>Abbots,</hi> and <hi>other Clergy,</hi> were called: Insomuch that


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:43857:106"/>
in some of them we find <hi>Priests, Deacons,</hi> and <hi>Monks;</hi> and even <hi>Abbesses</hi> also, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. And besides these, not only the <hi>Prince</hi> was, for the most part, present; but often-times his <hi>Nobility</hi> together with Him. In these <hi>Synods,</hi> sometimes the <hi>Canonical Discipline</hi> was inforced, and Matters of <hi>Faith</hi> establish'd. But generally they met for Other purposes; and did little more than either confirm the <hi>Estates,</hi> or <hi>Privileges,</hi> of some <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Houses;</hi> or transact the like par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Affairs: And still the General concerns of <hi>Religion</hi> were setled, either by the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Abbots</hi> apart; or else, by them, together with the <hi>Great Men,</hi> in the <hi>Common-Council,</hi> or <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the <hi>Realm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now having said thus much to clear the way for a <hi>Right Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of the <hi>Method</hi> in which <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs</hi> were wont to be transacted, in those Times, in which <hi>Christianity</hi> first began to be setled among Us, by our <hi>Saxon Ancestors;</hi> I shall go on to take a short View of the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Assemblies, whether <hi>Synods,</hi> or <hi>Councils,</hi> that were held in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, before the Time of the <hi>Norman Conquest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:43857:106"/>
It was about the Year of <hi>Christ</hi> 596, <note place="margin">§. 14. <hi>So the</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xon Chron.</note> that <hi>Austin</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> having determined to undertake the Conversion of the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in these Parts, with the Leave of <hi>Pope Gregory,</hi> Arrived here: And having with Good success persuaded <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> to become his Proselyte, He from thenceforth began to have a very <hi>Great Authority</hi> with Him.</p>
                  <p>We are told, by a <hi>Monkish Historian,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Concil. Labb To. V. pag. 1614.</note> that about the Year of our <hi>Lord</hi> 605, that King, being now fully confirm'd in the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> did with <hi>Bertha</hi> his <hi>Queen,</hi> and <hi>Eadbald</hi> his Son, and with <hi>Austin</hi> his <hi>Bishop,</hi> and the <hi>Great Lords</hi> of his Land, solemnly keep his <hi>Christmas</hi> at <hi>Canterbury.</hi> And there, in a <hi>Common Council,</hi> both of his <hi>Clergy,</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> He endow'd the <hi>Monastery,</hi> which <hi>Austin</hi> had Founded in that <hi>City;</hi> and granted several large Privileges and Immunities to it.</p>
                  <p>I have before observed, that it was an Ancient Custom of our <hi>Kings,</hi> to keep the <hi>Three</hi> Great <hi>Festivals</hi> of the Year, with an Extraordinary <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Solemnity.</hi> Their <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Great Men</hi> attended upon Them; and they appear'd in the highest Pomp of <hi>Majesty,</hi> they could put


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:43857:107"/>
on, among Them: and took those Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to transact such affairs, as they thought expedient for the <hi>publick Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</hi> If there be any Credit to be given to this Relation, (for which I dare not answer;) then we must look upon this to have been such a <hi>Civil Council:</hi> Sure we are, that in after-times many were held of the like Kind.</p>
                  <p>But tho' in these days the <hi>affairs</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> were, for the most part, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in such Meetings; yet I have before said, that some <hi>Synods</hi> they had which were properly <hi>Ecclesiastical;</hi> and those I shall therefore think my self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, in the first place, to Consider.</p>
                  <p>Now among these, (not to mention the two <hi>Conferences</hi> of <hi>Austin,</hi> with the <note place="margin">§. 15.</note>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:43857:107"/>
and managed the <hi>debates</hi> of it. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the business for which they met; and, at last, finally Resolved, what was to be held to, with Reference to the <hi>Points</hi> that had been debated. And tho' the Argument that determined him to embrace St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Tradition, rather than St. <hi>John</hi>'s, <hi>(viz.</hi> that He kept the <hi>door</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and therefore He durst not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him, lest when he came thither the <hi>Apostle</hi> should Resuse him Entrance;) was but very mean, and suitable to the <hi>Rudeness</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> of those Times; yet we see what <hi>Authority</hi> our <hi>Princes,</hi> from the beginning, had, as to these matters; and how considerable a part they were allow'd in their <hi>Synods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But more eminent, as well as more <note place="margin">§. 16.</note> exact, were the <hi>Synods</hi> held by <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> in the first of which, at <hi>Herudford,</hi> as the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And as this <hi>Synod</hi> first setled the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in these Parts; so did that of <hi>Heathfield,</hi> which met about <hi>seven years</hi> after, establish the <hi>Faith</hi> of


<pb n="168" facs="tcp:43857:108"/>
it. It admitted of the decisions of the <hi>Five</hi> first <hi>General Councils;</hi> and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Catholick doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> against the several <hi>Heresies</hi> which had been condemn'd in those <hi>Councils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In both these <hi>Synods</hi> it is expressly said that <hi>Theodore</hi> Presided; And so he did, in the next I am to take notice of, which was held at <hi>Atwyford</hi> Anno 685.

                  </p>
                  <p>I might take notice of many things determined in this Decree, in manifest Derogation of the <hi>Emperour's Authority.</hi> But I shall content my self to observe, how by this time the <hi>Pope,</hi> in those parts, had got the power of <hi>Calling Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods</hi> wholly into his Hands; and either himself expresly did it, or else gave Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to some other, to do it in his <hi>Name,</hi> and by vertue of his <hi>Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the <hi>Emperour</hi> consented to what was done in the present case; but that was only to allow that particular Person, (one of his <hi>own Subjects)</hi> to take upon him the <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>Pope's Legat;</hi> not to enable the <hi>Pope</hi> to grant


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:43857:112"/>
such a <hi>power,</hi> which he now assumed to himself a <hi>right</hi> to do.</p>

                  <p>But as Encroachments of this nature <note place="margin">Ib. p. 433.</note> being once begun, run still on to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er excess; so <hi>Pope Formosus</hi> soon car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Usurpation yet farther.

                  <p>Nor did the <hi>Pope</hi> only, by his <hi>Legats, call</hi> such <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>assist</hi> at them; but even when the <hi>King</hi> himself was present, the <hi>Legat</hi> now began to <hi>preside</hi> over them: and to draw even matters of a

                     <hi>civil Nature</hi> before him, and <hi>judge</hi> of them. So the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Engelsheim</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">Ib p 624, 626.</note> 
                     <hi>Agapetus</hi> the second, and <hi>Otho</hi> the <hi>Emperour,</hi> did: It judged of the wrong that had been done to <hi>Lewis</hi> the 4th <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> and excommunicated the Person by whom it was done.</p>
                  <p>To such a Slavery had the <hi>Pope</hi> brought the <hi>Christian World,</hi> about the beginning of the <hi>Period</hi> I am now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon.

                  <p>And the same was the Resolution of his <hi>Sons</hi> after him: And tho' being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated for the sake of their <hi>civil Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,</hi> to yield a little, some of our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Princes</hi> did submit to the <hi>Papal Usurpations;</hi> yet no sooner was their <hi>Government</hi> grown <hi>strong,</hi> and their <hi>Peace setled,</hi> but both our <hi>Kings</hi> and our <hi>great Men,</hi> presently began to assert their Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and to cast off those Chains, which the <hi>Pope</hi> had watch'd his Opportunity to put upon them.</p>

                  <p>I have before observed, how our <note place="margin">§. 26. King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the Conquerour,</note>

                     </note> in which several usefull <hi>Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were establish'd; the Heads of which still remain to us.</p>
                  <p>These are the chief of those <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Synods,</hi> that, we are told, were assembled under K. <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi> And the last of which, however said to have been call'd by <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> who also <hi>presided</hi> in them; yet still we must remember what we have before, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, observed of this <hi>King,</hi> that the <note place="margin">Eadmer. hist. nov. p. 6.</note>

                  <p>For the farther Confirmation of which <note place="margin">§. 27.</note> Remark, let us only cast our Eye upon the Conduct of this <hi>Prince,</hi> as to these matters, in his own <hi>Dutchy</hi> of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> and from thence we shall be able the more certainly to judge, what

                  <p>And here we find that at <hi>Whitsontide, Anno</hi> 1086 he assembled his <hi>Parliament</hi> at <hi>Roan.</hi> The Members who composed it were the same that, in those days, made up ours: There were present, the <hi>Archbishop, Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Abbots</hi> of his Territories; and with them the <hi>great Lords</hi> of the <hi>Laity.</hi> Being met, they <note place="margin">Orderic. vit. anno 1086. p. 552.</note> made several <hi>Laws</hi> for the Government both of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State;</hi> and he was both present at their Debates, and by his Authority confirm'd what had been agreed on by them.

                  </p>
                  <p>Such was the <hi>Authority</hi> which this <hi>Prince</hi> exercised over his <hi>Synods:</hi> As <note place="margin">§. 28. <hi>King</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam II.</note> for his Successor, King <hi>William</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, he was not at all less, but rather was more stiff in asserting his <hi>Rights,</hi>

as to these matters, than ever his <hi>Father</hi> had been. Insomuch that being on a time desired by <hi>Anselm, Archbishop</hi> of <note place="margin">Eadmer. hist. lib. 1. p. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Canterbury,</hi> 
                     <q>To employ his <hi>Authority</hi> to the restoring of <hi>Christianity,</hi> almost utterly defaced in his <hi>Realm:</hi> He ask'd him, What he would have him do?

There let it be enquired what has been done a miss; and let a seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Provision be made for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying of it. There has not been held a <hi>general Council</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> since you came to the <hi>Crown;</hi> nor for some time before. Through this defect many Enormities have broke out; and there being none to suppress them, they have, by an evil Custom, grown to too great a Height.

                     </q> And he kept his word with him: For <note place="margin">Knyghton de event. col. 2373.</note> during his whole <hi>Reign,</hi> there was no <hi>Ecclesiastical Synod</hi> held in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what this <hi>King</hi> deny'd, the next <note place="margin">§. 29. <hi>King</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry I.</note> readily complied with: For in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Year of his <hi>Reign,</hi> he consented to


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:43857:117"/>
the desire of <hi>Anselm</hi> to call a <hi>Synod,</hi> and accordingly at <hi>Michaelmas, Anno</hi> 1102, <note place="margin">Eadmer. hist p. 67, &amp;c. Matt.

                  <p>It was a long time after this, before any other <hi>Ecclesiastical Synod</hi> was held in this <hi>Country;</hi> but then there met one of an extraordinary Nature, and which I must take particular notice of; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that in it was made, the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Invasion, upon the <hi>Princes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> as to this matter, in these parts.</p>

                  <p>That our <hi>Kings,</hi> from the beginning, had their <hi>great Councils,</hi> and which, tho' not yet call'd by that <hi>Name,</hi> were nevertheless instead of a <hi>Parliament</hi> to them; has before been observed, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deny'd, or doubted of by any.

                  <p>How a change was then made, and what occasion was taken for the making <note place="margin">§. 44.</note> of it; it is not needfull for me, in this place, to enquire: But that in the 49th. <note place="margin">

                  <p>Whether they, from thenceforth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to be constantly called to these <hi>Councils;</hi> or whether there was an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption in this <hi>new Establishment,</hi> from that time, till about the 18th. of King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>First;</hi> as it is hard to determine, so is it not very material to my present business to enquire.

The most ancient Authorities that are <note place="margin">Brady, ib. p. 155.</note> alledged for this, are the <hi>Writs</hi> of the 23d. of the same <hi>King;</hi> and from which time, accordingly, some have dated the <hi>full Settlement,</hi> of our present most <hi>wise,</hi> and <hi>admirable Constitution.</hi>

                  <p>And as this is the <hi>Change</hi> which seems <note place="margin">§. 46.</note> to have been made, about this time, in the <hi>secular</hi> part of our <hi>Parliament,</hi> so have we reason to believe, that at the same time, there was no less a change made in the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> part of it. For whereas before, only the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Abbots,</hi> who held of the <hi>King</hi> by their <hi>Baronies,</hi> were wont to be summon'd thither; in the 49th. of <hi>Henry</hi> 3. when the <hi>Commons</hi> began to be call'd, several of the <hi>Inferiour Clergy</hi> were also call'd together with them; and that, for ought appears, in a larger Proportion than <note place="margin">

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:43857:129"/>
of the <hi>Parliament</hi> came to be setled, as now it is; the <hi>Inferiour Clergy</hi> were put upon the very same foot, that the <hi>Commons</hi> were, in it. And as with respect to the one, a <hi>Writ</hi> was issued out to the <hi>Sheriff</hi> of each County, to return such a certain number of <hi>Knights, Citizens,</hi> and <hi>Burgesses;</hi> so with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the other, a <hi>Clause</hi> was inserted into the <hi>Writ</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of every <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocese;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                  <p>'Tis true, we are told, that in some few <hi>Writs,</hi> at the beginning, this <hi>Clause</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">§. 47.</note> was sometimes omitted. By what means, or upon what account, they cannot tell. But then, as we find, that when this <hi>general Clause</hi> was omitted, <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Writs</hi> were sent to several of the <hi>Inferiour Clergy</hi> to come to <hi>Parliament;</hi> so the same <hi>Learned Person,</hi> who fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes us with this Remark, does inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously confess; that after a diligent search of our <hi>Records,</hi> it did appear to him, that these <hi>Defects</hi> were soon over;

                  <p>Now the main thing done in this <hi>Parliament,</hi> and for the effectual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof, they were so solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to have such an <hi>Authority</hi> concurr, as might admit of no exception; was to <hi>annul</hi> the <hi>Proceedings</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester</hi> and his <hi>Adherents,</hi> in the 10th. and 11th. years of this King, and to prevent the like violence for the time to come.

                  <p>From what has been said, it appears, that the <hi>Inferiour Clergy</hi> were not only <note place="margin">§. 49.</note> heretofore a part of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> but did <hi>meet,</hi> and <hi>act</hi> in it.

                  </p>
                  <p>But as those who assert this, are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to confess, that it was, even then, the custom of the several <hi>Estates</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and consult by <hi>themselves,</hi> of any difficult matters that came before them; and so return again, and joyntly deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their <hi>Opinions:</hi> so we are assured, that they had, very early, their several <hi>places</hi> to meet in, and their several <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> too, to manage their Debates.</p>

But from the time that they had a distinct <hi>Prolocutor</hi> of their own, we must conclude, that they met <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly:</hi> And upon all the <hi>Divisions</hi> we meet with, in the most <hi>ancient Rolls</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> the method still was for <hi>each Estate</hi> to consult together; the <hi>Lords Temporal</hi> by <hi>themselves;</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> by themselves; and the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> by themselves. And when we consider the <hi>Method</hi> that has been taken, from the beginning, of


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:43857:134"/>
                     <hi>summoning</hi> each of these to <hi>Parliament;</hi> how the <hi>Temporal Lords</hi> have their <hi>Writs</hi> particularly directed to them; the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> theirs, directed to the <hi>Sheriff</hi> of <hi>each County,</hi> and the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> theirs joyn'd together: It may seem not improbable, that as they were sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd after a distinct manner to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> so they <hi>sate</hi> too; And that the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Proctors</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> not only <hi>occasionally consulted</hi> together, but ordinarily <hi>acted</hi> as <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>three Estates</hi> of the <hi>Realm</hi> there.</p>
                  <p>In what <hi>place</hi> the <hi>Clergy</hi> used to meet, I have not found: But as their other <hi>Convocations</hi> were usually held at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, so it is not improbable but that, upon these occasions, they may have sate there also.</p>
                  <p>It was the <hi>Custom</hi> of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Elsyng.</hi> Method of Parl. <hi>p.</hi> 93.</note> in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. that the <hi>Lords</hi> did not sit upon <hi>Convocation-days;</hi> because then the <hi>Bishops</hi> were absent, and sat with the rest of the <hi>Clergy.</hi> This was in use in the 1st. Year of that <hi>King:</hi> And afterwards we find, that certain days were appointed, every Week, for the <hi>Convocation</hi> to sit; and on those, the <hi>Lords</hi> only met and adjourned, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred not upon any publick Business.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:43857:135"/>
Were we well assured of the Antiquity of this Custom, it would go a great way towards the Confirming of what I before proposed: And being joyn'd with those two Things of which we are Certain; namely, <hi>First,</hi> That upon all Greater <hi>Debates,</hi> it was the Manner of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> to go aside, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult with One Another; and then, by the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> or some Other of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> Report their Opinion to the Other <hi>Estates:</hi> And, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That They separately gave <hi>Subsidies</hi> to the <hi>King;</hi> (as also the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> seem to have anciently done:) would prompt us to conclude the <hi>Constitution</hi> of our <hi>Parliament</hi> to have been, Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, this; That when the <hi>Three Estates</hi> met together, (as at the Opening of every <hi>Session,</hi> they are still wont to do; and are by some supposed to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways done at the first;) the <hi>Proxies</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as well as the <hi>Commons,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came Up to the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> or they all attended the <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>Painted Chamber.</hi> Afterwards, when they sate separately, Each <hi>State</hi> met, and <hi>consulted,</hi> by its self: Only the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> and <hi>Parliamentary-Abbots,</hi> as they appear'd there under a double Capacity,


<pb n="223" facs="tcp:43857:135"/>
so they <hi>sate,</hi> and <hi>Voted</hi> accordingly: With the <hi>Clergy</hi> in <hi>Convocation,</hi> as Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that <hi>Estate,</hi> on <hi>Convocation-days;</hi> At Other times, with the <hi>Lords</hi> in the <hi>Upper House;</hi> as <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> by Vertue of their <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus have I accounted for the <note place="margin">§. 50.</note> first Original of the <hi>Convocation,</hi> as it was anciently a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of this <hi>Realm;</hi> and is still Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd by the same <hi>Writ,</hi> by which the <hi>Bishops</hi> are Called to <hi>Parliament,</hi> at this day. But there is another <hi>Respect,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the <hi>Clergy,</hi> in <hi>Convocation,</hi> may be consider'd; and of which it will, therefore, be necessary for me to give also some Account; before I go on to take any particular View, of what was done by them under this <hi>Capacity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have before said, that when the <hi>King</hi> Orders his <hi>Writs</hi> to be Issued out for Calling a <hi>Parliament,</hi> He do's, at the same time, direct <hi>two</hi> Others to be sent to the <hi>Two Archbishops,</hi> to Summon the <hi>Clergy</hi> of their Respective <hi>Provinces,</hi> to meet together about the same time.

                  <p>It is therefore as plain, as any thing <note place="margin">§. 51.</note> can well be, That the <hi>Convocation</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> consider'd as call'd by the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary-Writs,</hi> and <hi>sitting</hi> by Vertue of <hi>Them;</hi> and the <hi>Convocation</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, as Summon'd by the <hi>Convocation-Writ,</hi> and the <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> consequent thereupon; are, in their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>constitution,</hi> two different <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies;</hi> and which, by no means, ought to be Confounded together. The great <hi>Question</hi> is, What the <hi>nature</hi> of this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> as distinguish'd from the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary-Convention,</hi> is; and what the <hi>design</hi> of their <hi>Meeting</hi> Originally was?</p>
                  <p>Had these <hi>Convocations</hi> been always Assembled by the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,</hi> without any <hi>Writ</hi> from the <hi>King;</hi> as oftentimes heretofore they were: And had they meddled only with <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Matters,</hi> when they met; It would have been no hard matter to give a plain, and certain Answer to this <hi>Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Because, in that Case, it would have been Evident, that these <hi>Convocations</hi>


                     <pb n="227" facs="tcp:43857:137"/>
were no Other than <hi>Provincial Synods;</hi> which the <hi>Archbishop</hi> took occasion to Assemble; for the Ease of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and the Benefit of the <hi>Church;</hi> at the same time that they were otherwise Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to come together, for the <hi>business</hi> of the <hi>State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this Use Our <hi>Kings</hi> were wont sometimes to make of Them. They referr'd <hi>Ecclesiastical Matters</hi> to them; and advised with them in things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to <hi>Religion.</hi> But as the <hi>Form</hi> of their <hi>Summons</hi> entitles them to meet upon some <hi>urgent Affairs,</hi> which <hi>concern</hi> not only the <hi>security and defence of the Church of England,</hi> but of the <hi>King</hi> too; <hi>and the peace and tranquility, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, and defence of the Kingdom:</hi> So the main design Our <hi>Princes</hi> seem to have had in Assembling these <hi>Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> either at the <hi>same time</hi> they did their <hi>Parliament,</hi> or not long after, was to <hi>get Money</hi> from Them: That so, in a much fuller <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> than what usually came to the <hi>State-Council;</hi> and consisting of such Members parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, as were most ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Great was the <hi>Usurpation</hi> which the <hi>Pope,</hi> in all this, made upon the <hi>King's Authority:</hi> And it ought the rather to be taken notice of, because this <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi> was otherwise, a hearty Friend to the <hi>Liberties</hi> of his <hi>Country,</hi> and had a true respect and value for the <hi>King;</hi> whose Follies and Excesses wrought so far upon him, that they are at last thought to have broke his Heart.</p>

to do, was to send a <hi>Prohibition</hi> to him <note place="margin">Concil. Labb. To XII. pag. 2468. Spelm Concil. p. 488.</note> not to attempt, or do any thing to his Prejudice; or to the Prejudice of the <hi>State,</hi> his <hi>Crown,</hi> or <hi>Kingdom.</hi>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:43857:143"/>
brought before the <hi>Parliament,</hi> it was resolved, by the <hi>common Consent</hi> of that <hi>great Council,</hi> to let the <hi>Pope</hi> freely know, that they were grown weary of his <hi>Impositions,</hi> and neither could, nor would bear, any longer, those <hi>Burdens,</hi> which he was continually laying upon the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> For which end, it was also resolved, that whosoever <hi>procur'd</hi> any <hi>Benefice</hi> in this <hi>Realm,</hi> by vertue of the <hi>Pope's Provision,</hi> should be obliged to come and live upon it, and not be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to draw the <hi>Wealth</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> into <hi>other Countries:</hi> And least this should not do, it was also farther esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd, that no one should be <hi>admitted</hi> to any <hi>Benefice,</hi> upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of any <hi>Bull</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi> without the <hi>King's</hi> special <hi>License</hi> and <hi>Consent.</hi> And all the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> declared, that if the <hi>Pope</hi> went on, by his <hi>Provisions,</hi> to dispose of <hi>Benefices,</hi> whether to Foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or others; which their Ancestors had given, by way of Charity, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Persons</hi> to <hi>pray</hi> for them; they would forthwith seize them into their own hands, and dispose of them as they thought good.</p>
                  <p>This was a brisk stand, and some restraint it did put to the <hi>Pope's Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitancies.</hi>

And yet it was but a year <note place="margin">Knyghton Col. 2548, 2585.</note> after, that he sent two <hi>Bishops</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> to prevail with him to revoke these orders: But our <hi>Historians</hi> tell us, that they received a <hi>short Answer,</hi> and presently return'd home again.

                  <p>It would be too long for me to say, how far this great <hi>King,</hi> following here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the steps of his <hi>Royal Grandfather,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> I. proceeded to maintain his own <hi>Authority,</hi> and the <hi>Liberties</hi> of his <hi>Country,</hi> against the <hi>Papal En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments.</hi> I shall only add, that notwithstanding all the endeavours of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to the contrary, he constantly adhered to the <hi>Laws</hi> made <note place="margin">An.

that from this time forward, our <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops</hi> did leave off to <hi>summon Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> by their own <hi>Authority,</hi> and call'd them only at the <hi>King's Command.</hi> But tho' I am not altogether satisfied in this <note place="margin">See before <hi>Sect</hi> 53.</note> particular, yet that they now began to be more moderate in the <hi>Exercise</hi> of their <hi>Power,</hi> I do easily <hi>believe:</hi> And certain it is, that not only after this <hi>Act,</hi> but all along before, when things ran at the highest against the <hi>Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi> yet still our <hi>Kings</hi> often interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their <hi>Authority,</hi> and summon'd <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations</hi> by their own <hi>Writs,</hi> directed to the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> as they still continue to be at this day.</p>
                  <p>And now the <hi>Preaching</hi> of <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> and the <hi>Opinions</hi> by him brought in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be taken notice of: Insomuch, <note place="margin">Spelm.

Whether he did this at the <hi>King's Command,</hi> or by vertue of his own <hi>Legatine Authority,</hi> I shall not enquire: But this we are assured, that the <hi>King</hi> thereupon issued out his orders for the <hi>Arresting</hi> of all such as held any <hi>Heretical Tenets;</hi> and particularly that opposed the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed

                  <p>But tho' by this means therefore a new subject was started, to exercise the debates of our <hi>Convocations;</hi> yet still the <hi>Pope</hi> ceased not to attempt upon the <hi>Crown</hi> with his wonted <hi>Usurpations.</hi> To oppose which, <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d. call'd <note place="margin">Walsyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Hyp.

one thing concerning Them; That, for the most part, the <hi>Great End</hi> our <hi>Kings</hi> had in Summoning of Them, was to get <hi>Money</hi> from Them; as, the main thing they did, when they met, was to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what <hi>Measures</hi> to <hi>take,</hi> and what <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses</hi> to <hi>urge,</hi> to avoid the <hi>Giving</hi> of it.</p>

                  <p>From the 25th. of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, to Our Present Times.</p>
                  <p>We are now come to the last Part of <note place="margin">§. 62.</note> these Reflections; to the Time in which our <hi>Convocation</hi> was finally <hi>setled,</hi> by <hi>Parliamentary Authority,</hi> in the State in which it now stands; and under which <hi>Condition</hi> I have, in the foregoing <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> consider'd the <hi>Rights</hi> of it. I shall here only give a short account, <hi>how</hi> it came to be thus <hi>setled;</hi> and what <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods</hi> our <hi>Princes</hi> have, from thenceforth, taken, for the Management of their <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Affairs,</hi> and the Exercise of their <hi>Ecclesiastical Supremacy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, having been a long time trifled with, by the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the business of his <hi>Divorce;</hi> and being not of a Humour to bear such an


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:43857:147"/>
Opposition, as was thereby made to his <hi>Desires;</hi> Resolved, at last, to break off all Communication with it: And, in pursuance thereof, pass'd an <hi>Act</hi> against <hi>Appeals</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and for <hi>ending Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Suits</hi> within his Own <hi>Realm;</hi> Anno 1533.</p>
                  <p>It was not long after this, that <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> dying, and <hi>Cranmer</hi> being made <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> the business of the Divorce, which had so long been depending, was finally determined by Him. The news of which being got to <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> not only Annull'd the <hi>Archbishop</hi>'s proceeding, but Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>King</hi> to do it likewise: And, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Refusal to hearken to Him, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd against Him a <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi> as He had before Threatned to do.</p>
                  <p>To prevent that Breach, which this must otherwise have necessarily made between Them, the <hi>French King</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed so effectually with the <hi>Pope,</hi> (who, about this time, came as far as <hi>Marseil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> to Treat with Him) that He offer'd new Terms of Accommodation to King <hi>Henry;</hi> and the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> thereupon, undertook to make up the difference betwixt Them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="247" facs="tcp:43857:147"/>
And now all things seem'd to tend to Peace: The <hi>King</hi> was willing to accept of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Offers; and the <hi>Pope</hi> no less desirous to gain the <hi>King.</hi> The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune was, that the <hi>Pope</hi> confined Him to so short a time, that his Messenger could not get to <hi>Rome</hi> so soon as had been required: And the <hi>Imperial Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> wrought so powerfully upon the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he refused to enlarge it but for <hi>six days;</hi> till He might see what the <hi>King</hi> would do, before He proceeded to a <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sentence</hi> against Him.</p>
                  <p>The Quarrel therefore now being <note place="margin">§. 63.</note> come to a heighth, and the <hi>King</hi> resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to maintain his <hi>Authority;</hi> Many <hi>Laws</hi> were pass'd, the next year, for the better Establishment of it. And because he was sufficiently aware, that His chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>opposition</hi> might be likely to arise from the <hi>Clergy;</hi> He resolved to take an effectual Course with Them: And of which, it will be requisite, to give some short Account.</p>
                  <p>I have before Observed, what severe <hi>Laws</hi> were made by <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> in his 25th, 27th, and 28th Years, against the <hi>Usurpations</hi> of the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> These were confirm'd by King <hi>Richard</hi>


                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:43857:148"/>
the <hi>Second,</hi> in his 12th, and 13th Years. And, because the <hi>Pope</hi> still went on, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, in his Practises; in his 16th Year, the famous <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Praemunire</hi> was pass'd, against All <hi>Bulls,</hi> &amp;c. from the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> under Pain of Perpetual <hi>Banishment,</hi> with the forfeiture of the <hi>Lands, Tenements, Goods</hi> and <hi>Chattels</hi> of those who should either <hi>procure,</hi> or <hi>make use</hi> of Them.</p>
                  <p>But, notwithstanding these <hi>Laws,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> still proceeded in his Own way, and the <hi>Clergy</hi> were always ready to assist him in it: And by these means there were but very few, of any Note, among Them; who had not, upon some account or other, incurr'd the <hi>Penalty</hi> before mention'd.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Ground, therefore, the <hi>King</hi> resolved to attacque Them: And They being well Aware of the danger of it, determined by any means to Avoid it. In Order whereunto, They first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to Offer the <hi>King</hi> a <hi>Summ</hi> of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;</hi> And, in the next place, by an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Convocation,</hi> to submit Themselves to Him, and Recognize his <hi>Royal Authority</hi> over Them. This was that <hi>submission,</hi> upon which the <hi>Act</hi> for <hi>Regulating</hi> the <hi>Convocation,</hi> was drawn: and in which,


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:43857:148"/>
among Other things, these (two) <hi>Points</hi> became setled, both by <hi>Parliament,</hi> and <hi>Convocation:</hi> First; That the <hi>Clergy</hi> have no <hi>Right</hi> to meet in any <hi>Synod,</hi> without the <hi>King's License,</hi> testified by his <hi>Writ</hi> to the <hi>Archbishop.</hi> And, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly; That being Met, They cannot proceed to <hi>Act,</hi> but according to his <hi>Direction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus was the <hi>Crown,</hi> after a long <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">§. 64.</note> upon it, Restored to those <hi>Rights</hi> it anciently <hi>enjoy'd;</hi> and which our <hi>Kings,</hi> as we have seen, continued to assert, till the <hi>Papal Power,</hi> or <hi>Interest,</hi> became too strong for Them. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, ever since, the <hi>Convocation</hi> has continued to <hi>assemble,</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these Measures; so that I shall not need to take any more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular View of its <hi>Proceedings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is, I conceive, without all doubt, <note place="margin">§. 65.</note> that since the <hi>passing</hi> of this <hi>Act,</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> has still been summon'd, as often as a <hi>Parliament</hi> has been held. And as long as the <hi>Clergy,</hi> therein, continued to assist the <hi>Government,</hi> by granting of <hi>Subsidies;</hi> it has generally been allow'd to sit too, as often as it was necessary for


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:43857:149"/>
that purpose; tho' it has seldom done any thing besides.</p>
                  <p>But altho' it has t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

An instance of the <hi>former</hi> of these, we have within, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four years after the <hi>Passing</hi> of the <hi>Convocation-Act.</hi> The <hi>Archbishop,</hi> by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the <hi>Vicar-General,</hi> call'd a <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is certain then that the <hi>Convocation,</hi> as we now understand it; that is to say, as it is an <hi>Assembly</hi> of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> call'd by the <hi>King's Writ,</hi> directed to the <hi>Archbishops,</hi> and, by their <hi>Order,</hi> Grounded thereupon; is an <hi>Assembly</hi> altogether different from the <hi>Parliament</hi>


                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:43857:149"/>
of this <hi>Realm;</hi> and evidently no <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> of it. The only Question is, What we are to think of it, when it meets to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Parliament;</hi> and has a <hi>pretension</hi> to its Assembling, as well by the <hi>Bishop</hi>'s <hi>Parliamentary Summons,</hi> as by the <hi>Archbishops Orders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> was examined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">§. 66. <hi>Fox:</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrol. Vol. III. in his VIth.

Anno 1555: concerning the <hi>Heresie</hi> of which he was Accused; One part of His Plea, for himself, was, That they took advantage of certain things that had been spoken by him in <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> And that for this He ought not to be call'd to account; <q>Because that <hi>House</hi> being a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ought to be a place of <hi>free</hi> speech for All Men of the <hi>House,</hi> by the ancient and laudable Custom of this Realm.</q> And indeed, so firmly was this Notion setled in the Minds of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> in those days, that in the <hi>Convocation</hi> held the first year of <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>Sixth,</hi> a Motion was made; <q>That it should be desired, in the Name of the <hi>Lower House</hi> of <hi>Convocation,</hi> that their <hi>House</hi> might be United to the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons.</hi>

                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:43857:150"/>
But the Lords, <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Windsor,</hi> told Mr. <hi>Philpot,</hi> 
                     <q>That the <hi>Convocation</hi> was No <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> tho' by an Old Custom, it was call'd together by <hi>One Writ</hi> of <hi>Summons,</hi> with the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To their Opinion, Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; nor shall I pretend to enter any Plea against it. Thus much is plain, That the <hi>Convocation</hi> was <hi>once</hi> accounted, in this Respect, a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Parliament:</hi> And the Reason why it was accounted so, was; Because, by this <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Summons,</hi> the <hi>lower Clergy</hi> were Called, no less than the <hi>Bishops</hi> themselves, to it. Now thus they continue to be <hi>summon'd</hi> still. The <hi>Writ</hi> is the same it ever was: Is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly Issued out, and as expressly Word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as when they were, from thence, confess'd to be a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>Parliament.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Reason</hi> of the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same, one would think it should still inferr the same <hi>Conclusion.</hi> But <hi>Logick</hi> is one thing; and <hi>Law</hi> is another: And all this notwithstanding, the <hi>Clergy</hi> is now, no Member of the <hi>Parliament.</hi> Nor is there any Reason why it should be: For now, there being so many <hi>learned</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Such then is the Case of our Present <note place="margin">§. 67.</note> 
                     <hi>Convocation:</hi> But now, besides these <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synods,</hi> there is another sort of more <hi>select Conventions,</hi> if not first <hi>intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,</hi> yet more especially made use of, in this last <hi>Period:</hi> And they consist of such Certain <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Clergy-men,</hi> as the <hi>King</hi> thinks sit to Choose, and by his <hi>Commission</hi> to Authorize, to meet together, at such <hi>time,</hi> and in such <hi>place</hi> as he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in prescribes to them.

                  <p>That by such <hi>Synods</hi> as these, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi>

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:43857:151"/>
to be deny'd. They have often deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the greatest Matters: And, upon their <hi>Advice,</hi> the <hi>Government</hi> has accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly proceeded, without ever consult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any larger <hi>Convocation</hi> concerning them. But this was in some measure owing to the <hi>Necessities</hi> of those times, in which a great part of the <hi>Clergy</hi> were yet engaged in the <hi>Romish Errors;</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and therefore not qualified to promote so good a Work. At present their business is chiefly this; Either to Advise the <hi>King</hi> in such Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as He do's not think it necessary to trouble the <hi>Convocation</hi> to meet about: Or else, in Matters of a greater Moment, to prepare what may be sit for the <hi>King</hi> to lay before the <hi>Convocation;</hi> that since they must not debate on any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave, He may thereby be the better enabled to Propose what is Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to Them.</p>
                  <p>So that now then, if we would know, <note place="margin">§. 68.</note> after what manner <hi>Ecclesiastical Affairs</hi> have been transacted, since the time of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> we shall find it to have been, by some or other, of these <hi>Five</hi> following Ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="255" facs="tcp:43857:151"/>
1. Sometimes the <hi>King</hi> has, by his <hi>Own Authority,</hi> set forth such <hi>Orders,</hi> as He has thought fit should be Observed by the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the <hi>Realm;</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected them to his <hi>Archbishops,</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> for that End. Such was the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of his Present <hi>Majesty</hi> to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> (as to <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>practise)</hi> of <hi>Febr.</hi> 13. 1689/90: to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the two <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> and <hi>York.</hi> And such were his <hi>Injunctions</hi> (with respect to <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Faith)</hi> by which He lately determined, with what sobriety They should <hi>Write,</hi> and <hi>Preach,</hi> concerning the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity:</hi> To reduce some of our late Controvertists, to the ancient <hi>Modes</hi> of speaking; and not suffer them to <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect new Terms,</hi> to the <hi>hazard</hi> of the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Faith;</hi> and to the <hi>scandal</hi> of <hi>many</hi> of the same <hi>profession</hi> with Themselves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another Method of determining <hi>Ecclesiastical Matters,</hi> has been, by the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> without the help of any Other <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical deliberation,</hi> than what the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops,</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> in the Upper House, have given to them. Many are the <hi>Acts</hi> of this Nature which have pass'd, I do not say since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> but even


<pb n="256" facs="tcp:43857:152"/>
within our <hi>Own Memories.</hi> Such were, (for example) The <hi>Acts</hi> against <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> in the 16th, and 22d of <hi>King Charles</hi> the <hi>Second.</hi> The two <hi>Test-Acts;</hi> in His 25th and 30th Years: In a word; The <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Toleration,</hi> in the first of his <hi>Present Majesty;</hi> not to mention any <hi>Others</hi> of an <hi>Elder date.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3dly. A third way, now made use of, in transacting <hi>Ecclesiastical Matters,</hi> is, to do it by such Select <hi>Committees,</hi> as those I before mentioned. When the <hi>King,</hi> having first appointed a certain Number of <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy-men,</hi> to consider what may be fit to be Order'd in such Cases, as He thinks fit to Referr to Them; afterwards sets forth, by his <hi>Royal Authority,</hi> what has, by their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, been Recommended to Him. After this manner was the <hi>Reformation,</hi> in great measure, carried on; and the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Affairs of the <hi>Church</hi> dispatch'd: As by the short <hi>Collection,</hi> Here referr'd <note place="margin">See the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix:</hi> Num. VII.</note> to, may more fully be discerned.</p>
                  <p>4thly. A fourth Way there is, which our <hi>Princes</hi> have often taken, in these Cases; and that is, to Referr not to a <hi>Particular Committee,</hi> but to their <hi>Two Convocations,</hi> what they would have done: And having seen, and approved their


<pb n="257" facs="tcp:43857:152"/>
Conclusions, to give their <hi>Royal Assent,</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> thereunto. Upon this foundation stand our <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Canons,</hi> drawn up by the <hi>Convocation</hi> of 1603, and <hi>Ratified,</hi> and <hi>Confirm'd,</hi> by <hi>King James</hi> the First: And after the same manner were those drawn up, which gave so much Offence in our <hi>late times;</hi> and were <hi>Authorized</hi> by <hi>King Charles</hi> the <hi>First:</hi> Anno 1640.</p>
                  <p>But, above all; as the most <hi>solemn,</hi> so the most undoubtedly <hi>authoritative</hi> way, of transacting such Matters as these, is,</p>
                  <p>5thly. When the <hi>King</hi> designing any <hi>Constitution</hi> of a more than <hi>ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Realm;</hi> do's, for the more <hi>prudent</hi> Establishment of it, first, by a <hi>select Committee,</hi> prepare what he thinks needfull to propose to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> concerning it; Then has it <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,</hi> and <hi>Concluded</hi> there: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Re-view'd it with his <hi>Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> and his learned <hi>Council</hi> in the <hi>Law;</hi> finally referrs it to his Two <hi>Houses</hi> of <hi>Parliament:</hi> Where being also consented to, and <hi>approved</hi> of, He finally himself subscribes to it, and makes it a part of the <hi>Statute-Law</hi> of the <hi>Realm.</hi> Thus has our <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> from time to time, been setled: Our <hi>Episcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>


                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:43857:153"/>
and <hi>Ordinals,</hi> been <hi>Confirm'd;</hi> and, finally, our <hi>Nine and Thirty Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> been <hi>Establish'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as the choice of these several <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">§. 69.</note> of carrying on such <hi>Affairs,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires much <hi>Prudence</hi> in the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so has our <hi>Law</hi> intirely submitted it to the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Authority. And we ought not to doubt, but that He will Act in these Matters, with all that Care, and Advice, which both the <hi>Nature</hi> of the things themselves requires, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence which they commonly have on <hi>Civil Affairs,</hi> oblige Him to do.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, the Affection which some Men have for their Own Ways, may <note place="margin">§. 70.</note> prompt them to think that worthy the meeting of a <hi>Convocation,</hi> which the <hi>King</hi> may be perswaded his <hi>Own Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> are abundantly sufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for. But as <hi>All Men</hi> must allow, that it would not only be <hi>grievous,</hi> but <hi>foolish,</hi> to assemble a <hi>Synod,</hi> for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that, which may as effectually be done without it; so all <hi>Reasonable Men</hi> must think it very just, and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that his <hi>Majesty</hi> should be left to that liberty, which both the <hi>Law</hi> has


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:43857:153"/>
intrusted him with, and his own <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> (were there nothing else) vindicates to him; I mean, of <hi>considering</hi> what He thinks, in such Cases, to be most sitting to be done, and to <hi>act</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. If by this means he should chance to be mistaken in his Choice, 'tis a <hi>Humane Infirmity;</hi> and what Good Men will Easily make an Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance for, in a <hi>station</hi> where so much is to be <hi>done,</hi> and it is so <hi>difficult,</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, to judge what is best. And let the <hi>positive, censorious</hi> part of the World, if for nothing else, yet, at least, for their Own sakes, consider this; That a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> is a large Place; and that 'tis not impossible, but that among such <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> as there are in it, some may be as firmly persuaded the <hi>Prince</hi> is in the <hi>Right,</hi> as they can presume that He is in the <hi>Wrong.</hi>

                  <hi>If they are a</hi> Court, <hi>and have their</hi> Jurisdiction; <hi>and are a</hi> Legislature, <hi>and have the Power of making</hi> Ecclesiastical Laws <hi>(both which they certainly</hi> are, <hi>and</hi>

have;) then the liberty <hi>of</hi> Conferring, <hi>and</hi> Discussing, <hi>is necessary to their very Existence,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is the Summ of what this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> has asserted, as to the <hi>point</hi> in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; and, for the most part, is express'd in his Own Words. Let us now see, Wherein we differ from One another; And reduce the matter in debate between Us, to as narrow a Compass, as we can.</p>
               <p>And, 1st. Tho' I will not enter upon a New Subject, yet I must needs say, I am by no means satisfied, that the <hi>Church</hi> has either <hi>Command,</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> to <hi>assemble Synods;</hi> or, by Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, any <hi>inherent,</hi> and <hi>unalterable Right,</hi> to make any such <hi>authoritative Definitions,</hi> as He supposes, in Them. I am not Aware, that either in the <hi>Old,</hi> or <hi>New Testament,</hi> there is so much as One single direction given for its so doing. And, excepting the singular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which we have <hi>Acts</hi> XVth, I know of no <hi>Example,</hi> that can, with any shew of Reason, be offer'd, of such a Meeting: And whether that were such a <hi>Synod,</hi> as we are now speaking of, may very justly be doubted. The foundation of <hi>Synods,</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> is (in my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension) the same, as of <hi>Councils</hi> in


<pb n="266" facs="tcp:43857:157"/>
the <hi>State.</hi> The <hi>necessities</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> when it began to be enlarged, first brought in the <hi>One;</hi> as Those of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> did the <hi>Other.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when Men are Incorporated into <hi>Societies,</hi> as well for the <hi>service</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>salvation</hi> of their <hi>Souls,</hi> as for their <hi>Civil peace,</hi> and <hi>security;</hi> these <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies</hi> are to be as much subject to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Society,</hi> and to be regulated by Them, as any Other <hi>publick Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi> of what kind soever, are. Nor has the <hi>Church</hi> any <hi>Inherent, divine Right,</hi> to set it at liberty, from being Concluded by such <hi>Rules,</hi> as the <hi>Governing part</hi> of every <hi>Society</hi> shall prescribe to it, as to this Matter.</p>
               <p>This is my Notion of these things; and thus, I conceive, <hi>Synods</hi> are to be managed in <hi>Christian States.</hi> As for those <hi>Realms</hi> in which the <hi>Civil Power</hi> is of <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Persuasion;</hi> natural Reason will prompt the Members of every <hi>Church,</hi> to consult together, the best they can, how to manage the affairs of it; and to Agree upon such <hi>Rules,</hi> and <hi>Methods,</hi> as shall seem most proper, to preserve the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and to give the least <hi>offence,</hi> that may be, to the Government under which they live. And


<pb n="267" facs="tcp:43857:157"/>
what <hi>Rules</hi> are by the <hi>Common-consent</hi> of Every such <hi>Church</hi> agreed to; ought to be the measure for the <hi>assembling,</hi> and <hi>acting</hi> of <hi>Synods,</hi> in such a <hi>Country.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this <hi>notion</hi> will please this <hi>Author,</hi> or no, I cannot tell: If it do's not, I hope he will shew me wherein my <hi>Error</hi> lies, and how I may correct it. In the mean time, this security I have, that, if I am mistaken, I err with Men of as great a Judgment, and as comprehensive a Knowledge in these Matters, as Any can be who differ from Me.</p>
               <p>But to come to that which I am now <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> more properly to examine: That the <hi>two Convocations,</hi> consider'd as a <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Synod,</hi> are the <hi>Highest Ecclesiastical Assembly</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> I readily A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: Nor shall I deny, but that a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> may be said to be <hi>Essential</hi> to our <hi>Constitution.</hi> But that the <hi>frequent sitting</hi> of <hi>Convocations,</hi> as understood by this <hi>Author,</hi> and meant of their <hi>sitting</hi> as <hi>often</hi> as the <hi>Parliament</hi> meets; is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore One of the <hi>chief Rights</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> or, indeed, any of its <hi>Rights</hi> at all, unless by Accident, I utterly deny. When the <hi>Exigencies</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> call for a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> and there is a manifest <hi>need</hi> of its <hi>Assembling;</hi> then, I do confess, the


<pb n="268" facs="tcp:43857:158"/>
                  <hi>Church</hi> has a <hi>right</hi> to its sitting. And if its Circumstances be such, as to Require their <hi>frequent sitting;</hi> during those Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, it has a Right to their <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent meeting,</hi> and <hi>sitting.</hi> And, if the <hi>Prince</hi> be sensible of this, and yet will not suffer his <hi>Clergy</hi> to <hi>come together;</hi> in that Case, I do acknowledge, that he would <hi>abuse</hi> the <hi>trust</hi> that is lodg'd in him; and deny the <hi>Church</hi> a benefit, which, of <hi>right,</hi> it ought to enjoy. But as, in a Well-establish'd <hi>Church,</hi> it can hardly be supposed that there should be such a <hi>frequent need</hi> of <hi>Convocations;</hi> so to Oblige the <hi>Clergy frequently</hi> to <hi>come together,</hi> when there is no manner of Reason for their so doing; would be, in truth, to injure the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>oppress</hi> its <hi>Ministers:</hi> In-as much as it would require them to <hi>leave</hi> their <hi>Cures,</hi> and be at the <hi>trouble,</hi> and <hi>charge,</hi> of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Convocation,</hi> without doing any manner of Good, either to the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Realm,</hi> by such their meeting.</p>
               <p>And therefore, to settle this first Point; the summ of it is this: That the <hi>Church</hi> has a Right to have its <hi>Convocation</hi> call'd, as often as the <hi>Parliament</hi> is Assembled, I agree: That the <hi>Convocation,</hi> thus call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, has a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>sit,</hi> and <hi>act;</hi> whenever


<pb n="269" facs="tcp:43857:158"/>
the Circumstances of the <hi>Church,</hi> require it so to do, I allow also. But that the <hi>Convocation</hi> ought of Right, not only to be <hi>summon'd,</hi> but to <hi>meet,</hi> and do <hi>busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> as often as the <hi>Parliament</hi> sits; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any need for such its <hi>meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or no, This I utterly deny: And I am persuaded it would be a <hi>Burden</hi> to the <hi>Clergy,</hi> rather than a <hi>Privilege,</hi> to oblige them to such an Attendance.</p>
               <p>This, then, is the first Thing wherein we differ; <hi>viz.</hi> That He affirms, that the <hi>Convocation</hi> ought, of Right, not only to be <hi>summon'd,</hi> whenever the <hi>Parliament</hi> meets, but <hi>Regularly,</hi> and of <hi>Course,</hi> to <hi>sit,</hi> and <hi>act</hi> too; tho' there should not be any the least Occasion for its so doing.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Question</hi> is, Whether, being <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> met, they may proceed to any <hi>Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Acts,</hi> without the <hi>King</hi>'s special <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,</hi> first had, to Authorize them so to do?</p>
               <p>And here our <hi>Author</hi> tells us, That <hi>if</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Letter: p. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>the Convocation be a Court, and have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Jurisdiction belonging to it: Or if it be a Legislature, and have the Power of making Ecclesiastical Laws, as it certainly both is, and has; then the liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring, and Discussing, is necessary to its very Existence.</hi> Which last <hi>Expression,</hi> tho' it be hard to make any <hi>good sense</hi> of; yet


<pb n="270" facs="tcp:43857:159"/>
I readily Agree to what I take to be his meaning in it. For certainly <hi>Justice</hi> will be but lamely executed, and <hi>Laws</hi> be very unaccountably made; if those who are to <hi>judge,</hi> and <hi>determine,</hi> have not the <hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>conferring,</hi> and <hi>discussing Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> in Order thereunto.</p>
               <p>But tho', when the <hi>Convocation</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to <hi>judge,</hi> or <hi>make Laws,</hi> They must, undoubtedly, be allow'd to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr,</hi> and <hi>Discuss;</hi> yet may not the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> be restrain'd, by certain Limitations, from either <hi>judging,</hi> or <hi>making Laws,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when the <hi>Government</hi> shall think fit to permit them so to do? And if former <hi>Abuses</hi> have made it necessary for the <hi>Government,</hi> to put them under such a <hi>Restriction;</hi> and the <hi>Clergy</hi> have, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, consented to it; and thought that, (all things consider'd,) it would be safer for them to <hi>Act</hi> by the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>direction,</hi> that at the <hi>Motion</hi> of every Warm, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking <hi>Member</hi> of their Own <hi>Body;</hi> who should throw a snare in their way, and run them into such Inconveniences, as they should not be able easily to get out of; As, in such a Case, they would have no <hi>liberty</hi> to <hi>judge,</hi> or <hi>make Laws,</hi> without <hi>License;</hi> so, neither <hi>would they</hi> have any <hi>need</hi> to <hi>conferr,</hi> or <hi>discuss,</hi> where


<pb n="271" facs="tcp:43857:159"/>
They had no <hi>power</hi> to <hi>conclude</hi> any thing.</p>
               <p>Now this I affirm to be Our Case; and, I must freely own, I take it to be our Happiness that it is so. It being more than probable, that had not the <hi>Prince</hi> had this Tie upon Us; we should, before this time, have run our selves into yet worser <hi>divisions</hi> than we now labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and, in all appearance, have expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed both <hi>Our selves,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> for a prey, to the <hi>Common Enemy</hi> of <hi>Both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that now then, to <hi>state</hi> this Other <hi>point</hi> aright, The <hi>Question</hi> between us, is this: Whether the <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Customs,</hi> of this <hi>Realm,</hi> have not Restrain'd the <hi>Clergy</hi> from entring on any <hi>Synodical Debates,</hi> in Order to the making of any <hi>Canons,</hi> or <hi>Constitutions,</hi> without the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial <hi>License</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> first had, to Warrant them so to do?</p>
               <p>That the <hi>King</hi> ought never to require the <hi>Convocation</hi> to meet, (more than out of form, in <hi>Parliament-</hi>time;) but when He has some <hi>Business</hi> for it to do, is on all hands agreed. That when they do meet, They ought to have: <hi>Commission</hi> sent to them, to empower them to go to work, and not sit idly gazing at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is also allow'd. That, lastly, upon those <hi>Points,</hi> which they are empowred


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:43857:160"/>
to handle, they ought to have a full li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of <hi>Conferring, Discussing,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing;</hi> That they ought to be left to speak with all Reasonable <hi>Freedom,</hi> and not be either <hi>check'd</hi> in the <hi>House,</hi> or <hi>call'd</hi> to any <hi>Account out of it,</hi> for any thing that was said in pursuance of these Ends; is readily granted. The only difficulty is, Whether the <hi>Convocation</hi> being Met, the <hi>Clergy</hi> ought not to Confine their Debates to the subject which the <hi>King</hi> proposes to them; and not wander upon any other Matters, which shall chance to be started, by any of their own <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> and proceed to <hi>determine Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> concerning Them?</p>
               <p>Having thus reduced the <hi>subject,</hi> in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,</hi> to its proper bounds; I shall now <note place="margin">§. 6.</note> proceed, with all due exactness, to put together the <hi>Arguments</hi> which He has brought, in proof of those Points, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we differ; and to consider what may be reasonably Replied to Them.</p>
               <p>And, 1st. That the <hi>Convocation</hi> has a <hi>Right,</hi> not only to be <hi>formally sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd,</hi> but to <hi>sit,</hi> and <hi>act</hi> too, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as the <hi>Parliament</hi> meets; He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prove by these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Arguments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:43857:160"/>
(1st.) From the <hi>Parallel,</hi> which there <note place="margin">§. 7.</note> seems to be, between the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the <hi>Convocation. Each consists of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Letter: p. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>two Houses, and these have</hi> (or <hi>should have) their several Prolocutors. The One of these Courts is of the same Power, and Use, with Regard to the Church, that the Other is in Respect of the State. Nay, tho' they have different Names, and the Word</hi> Parliament <hi>be appropriated to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a Temporal Legislature; yet ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the same Appellation belong'd to them both. A</hi> Witena-Gemote, <hi>signified what We call a</hi> Parliament; <hi>and, a</hi> Church Gemote, <hi>what We call a</hi> Convocation. And therefore, One would think, that whenever the <hi>Convocation</hi> is called, <hi>They</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>should not only meet Formally, but sit, and act, as the</hi> Parliament <hi>do; that there should be a</hi> Session <hi>of</hi> Convocation, <hi>as well as a</hi> Session <hi>of</hi> Parliament.—</p>
               <p>Now not to be too curious in exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Parallel,</hi> here offered, betwixt these two; and which were it as exact, as, I am confident, it is not; would yet no more prove their <hi>Privileges</hi> to be <hi>Equal,</hi> than the Likeness of two <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> in having a <hi>Mayor, Aldermen,</hi> and <hi>Common-Council,</hi> would prove, that therefore, in despight of their several


<pb n="274" facs="tcp:43857:161"/>
                  <hi>Charters,</hi> they must have all the same <hi>Privileges</hi> also.</p>
               <p>1st. I am not satisfied, that the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation is of the same Power, with Regard to the Church; that the Parliament is, in Respect of the State:</hi> Because I am told, by very good <hi>Lawyers,</hi> that the <hi>Convocation,</hi> in making <hi>Ecclesiastical Constitutions,</hi> must proceed by certain <hi>Rules;</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, even with the <hi>King</hi>'s consent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any thing contrary to the <hi>Laws,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 19.</note> or <hi>Statutes,</hi> or <hi>Customs</hi> of the <hi>Realm.</hi> But now the <hi>Parliament</hi> is not subject to any such <hi>limitations:</hi> Its <hi>Power</hi> is <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> and <hi>Uncontroulable.</hi> And, being joyn'd with the <hi>Royal Authority,</hi> can <hi>enact</hi> what it will, for the <hi>publick Good;</hi> any <hi>Law, Statute,</hi> or <hi>Custom,</hi> to the contrary, in any wise notwithstanding.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the Word <hi>Parliament,</hi> I shall not much contend with him about it. It is well known, that it was a <hi>name</hi> brought in by the <hi>Normans,</hi> and but late Received among Us, to denote those Meetings of <hi>State,</hi> which were ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called mycel <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; <hi>Colloquium, Concilium, Synodus,</hi> and the like. It is more extraordinary, which He tells us, that as <hi>Wittena-Gemote</hi> was wont to signifie what we call a <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi>


                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:43857:161"/>
so <hi>Church-Gemote</hi> denoted what we call a <hi>Convocation:</hi> And for which, I am confident, He will be hard put to it, <note place="margin">Instit. IV. pag. 322. <hi>Godolph. Abr.</hi> chap XLI. § 4</note> to bring us any <hi>Author</hi> elder than Sir <hi>Edw. Coke;</hi> from whom, as poor <hi>Godolphin</hi> first, so has he now taken it, at all Adventures. Tho', were this true, the Observation would amount, in plain <hi>English,</hi> to no more than this; That as a <hi>Parliament</hi> was anciently call'd <hi>an Assembly</hi> of the <hi>Wise-men,</hi> so was a <hi>Convocation</hi> call'd <hi>an Assembly</hi> of <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> And of which, if He can make any Use, I shall not envy him the Honour of so weighty, and critical, a Remark.</p>
               <p>Were it needfull, in Return to these lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Remarks, to mention the several <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences</hi> that might be assigned between these <hi>two Assemblies;</hi> I might easily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large them into many <hi>more particulars,</hi> and of <hi>much greater Importance,</hi> than Those which He has alledged. To say nothing of the <hi>Convocations,</hi> being multiplied ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number of the <hi>Provinces</hi> into which the <hi>Church</hi> is divided; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting the <hi>Clergy,</hi> not of the <hi>whole Church,</hi> but only of <hi>One part</hi> of it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Parliament</hi> is an <hi>Assembly</hi> for the <hi>whole Realm:</hi> The manner of <hi>Consulting, Resolving,</hi> and <hi>Acting,</hi> is very different, in the <hi>One,</hi> and in the <hi>Other.</hi> The <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> is much <hi>other</hi> in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi>


                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:43857:162"/>
than the <hi>Lord-Keepers</hi> is in the <hi>Parliament.</hi> But especially, the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Parliament</hi> in making <hi>Laws,</hi> free and unbounded; whereas the <hi>Convocation</hi> is, by <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> determined both in its <hi>Principle,</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> of <hi>Acting:</hi> And can neither <hi>Debate</hi> effectually, nor <hi>Resolve,</hi> to any purpose, of any thing, but what is Agreeable to the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Realm;</hi> and, is no wise <hi>prejudicial</hi> to the <hi>Civil interests</hi> of any.</p>
               <p>But, to allow of the supposed <hi>Parallel,</hi> between the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and <hi>Convocation;</hi> What will this <hi>Gentleman</hi> inferr from it? Not, I hope, that the <hi>One</hi> should therefore <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it,</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> whenever the <hi>Other</hi> do's. A <hi>Father,</hi> for example, has two <hi>Sons:</hi> They are both his <hi>Children;</hi> both of the same <hi>Sex;</hi> both Equally <hi>Related</hi> to Him; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, and both Equally <hi>Beloved</hi> by Him. But will this <hi>Author</hi> from thence conclude, That they have an <hi>Equal Right</hi> to his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,</hi> and ought Equally to <hi>succeed</hi> in it? This would be a very Agreeable conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to many, I make no doubt; but, I am afraid, will hardly be allow'd, by the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brothers,</hi> to be a <hi>Just One.</hi> 'Tis true, a <hi>Father,</hi> in this Case, may possibly have left them <hi>Portions</hi> alike; and have made them as <hi>equal</hi> in their <hi>Fortunes,</hi> as they were in their <hi>Relation</hi> to him. And so, perhaps,


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:43857:162"/>
Our <hi>Constitution</hi> may have made the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and the <hi>Convocation.</hi> But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Father</hi> has done this, must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the <hi>settlement</hi> of his <hi>Estate;</hi> and not from any supposed Equality of <hi>Right</hi> in his <hi>Sons</hi> to his <hi>Affection.</hi> And whether Our <hi>Constitution</hi> has given these <hi>Assemblies</hi> an Equal right, <hi>to meet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. As for those <hi>State Maxims,</hi> which he <note place="margin">§. 8.</note> has finally added to support this <hi>Argument;</hi> it will then be proper to give a Reply to them, when this <hi>Author</hi> shall have shewn us that there is any thing in them to be Replied to. In the mean time I must ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that whether we consider the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or <hi>End,</hi> of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities</hi> of the <hi>Civil Affairs;</hi> or the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest which Both the <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> may have, in the <hi>Assembling</hi> of it; there must, in all probability, be always a much greater need of <hi>Frequent Parliaments,</hi> for the benefit of the <hi>State;</hi> than of <hi>Frequent Convocations,</hi> for the Welfare of the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When a <hi>National Church</hi> is once tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly <hi>Establish'd,</hi> and neither needs any farther <hi>Laws</hi> to be made for the enforcing


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:43857:163"/>
of its <hi>Discipline;</hi> or any new <hi>Confessions</hi> to be framed, for the security of its <hi>Doctrine:</hi> When its <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and other <hi>Offices,</hi> are fix'd, and stated; and there is so far from being any need of <hi>altering,</hi> or improving any of these, that it is thought a Crime but even to suppose that it is possible to <hi>improve</hi> them; or to make any <hi>Alterations,</hi> but for the Worse, in them: I cannot imagine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till something arises to unsettle such a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> what a <hi>Convocation</hi> could have to meet about.</p>
               <p>But this is not the Case of the <hi>Civil State;</hi> which is, God knows, subject to many more <hi>changes</hi> than the <hi>Ecclesiastical;</hi> and will oftner want to have <hi>publick Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> applied, for the <hi>redress,</hi> or <hi>prevention,</hi> of its <hi>publick Evils.</hi> Perhaps a <hi>Prince</hi> arises who affects an <hi>Arbitrary sway;</hi> and his <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> joyn in the same <hi>designs</hi> with him; and nothing less than the <hi>Authority</hi> of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> can put a stop to their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. This therefore may make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, in times of Peace, and Quietness, for the <hi>Parliament</hi> to meet at certain times, to prevent such <hi>attempts;</hi> and to keep eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Member, of the <hi>Constitution,</hi> within its due bounds: And such was the Case of the <hi>last Reign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is assaulted by its <hi>Enemies</hi> from abroad; and those <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>

are countenanced by a factious, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Party at home; and it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for the <hi>Parliament</hi> to meet, and to raise Supplies, for the Defence of the <hi>Realm,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>One;</hi> and to make some new <hi>Laws</hi> for the <hi>suppression,</hi> or <hi>discovery,</hi> of the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</hi> And this has been the <hi>Case</hi> of the <hi>present Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now what Effect have all these <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Exigencies</hi> had upon the Affairs of the <hi>Church:</hi> Unless it be, that an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> has been made, which our <hi>Author</hi> professes He envies not to the <hi>Dissenters;</hi> or, if He did, I hope He would not have the <hi>Convocation</hi> pretend to <hi>Repeal</hi> it. In short, all he can alledge are certain <hi>disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> which either there is a sufficient <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision</hi> already made against; Or, if there be not, I doubt the <hi>Convocation</hi> will hardly be able to do any thing farther, for the more effectual Redress of Them.</p>
               <p>But however, this I shall have Occasion more particularly to consider, when I come to examine, what He has said, to prove the <hi>necessity,</hi> which He pretends, there is, for the <hi>sitting</hi> of a <hi>Convocation.</hi> And I must not anticipate here, what will more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, as well as more fully, be handled there. So little is there, in his first <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which he has brought to prove, that the <hi>Convocation</hi> has a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>sit,</hi> as often

               <p>Now that (2dly) is no less than an <hi>Act</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> of <hi>Parliament, 8 Hen.</hi> VI. ch. 1. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of which <hi>Statute</hi> is this: <q>That the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who are called, by the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Writ,</hi> to <hi>Convocation,</hi> shall fully Use, and Enjoy, such <hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Defence,</hi> in Coming, Tarrying, and Returning, as the <hi>Great Men,</hi> and <hi>Commonalty</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> called, or to be called, to the <hi>Kings Parliament,</hi> do Enjoy, and were wont to Enjoy, or in time to come, ought to Enjoy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Well, be this so: But is there any thing in this <hi>Statute</hi> which says, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> shall come to the <hi>Convocation,</hi> when ever the <hi>Great Men,</hi> and <hi>Commonalty</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> do to the <hi>Parliament?</hi> That is not preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But what is there then in this <hi>Act,</hi> to the purpose of our present Enquiry? Why, in the Preamble to it, 'tis said, that <q>The <hi>Clergy</hi> Coming to <hi>Convocation,</hi> were <hi>often-times,</hi> and <hi>commonly,</hi> molested:</q> From whence our <hi>Author,</hi> admirably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, That, therefore, they did <hi>often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,</hi> and <hi>commonly,</hi> in those days, meet in <hi>Convocations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this can reasonably be inferr'd from those <hi>words,</hi> I am, by no means, satisfied;


<pb n="281" facs="tcp:43857:164"/>
which only signifie, that when the <hi>Clergy</hi> went to <hi>Convocation,</hi> they were very often <hi>molested,</hi> by <hi>Arrests,</hi> &amp;c. but do's not at all imply, that the <hi>Convocation</hi> used <hi>often</hi> to <hi>meet.</hi> However, let this be Granted: In <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Sixth</hi>'s time the <hi>Convocation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten met,</hi> therefore it <hi>met</hi> whenever the <hi>Parliament</hi> sate. How do's that appear? Nay, but we must go farther; Therefore, of <hi>right, it ought to meet now,</hi> whenever the <hi>Parliament</hi> do's? Nay, but this will not yet do: Therefore, <hi>it ought not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally</hi> to <hi>meet,</hi> but to <hi>sit,</hi> and <hi>act</hi> too, <hi>as often as the Parliament</hi> assembles. This, our <hi>Author</hi> must mean, or He alledges this <hi>act</hi> to no purpose: And he who can draw this <hi>Consequence,</hi> from that <hi>Act,</hi> must be a mighty Man of <hi>Reason</hi> indeed; and too unequal a Match, for Men of ordinary Skill in <hi>Logick</hi> to deal with.</p>
               <p>And yet, after all, this I confess is true: The <hi>Convocation,</hi> in those days, did <hi>sit,</hi> and <hi>act</hi> too, for the most part, as often as the <hi>Parliament</hi> met. For the <hi>Clergy,</hi> in those days, <hi>assessed</hi> Themselves; and without their <hi>sitting,</hi> either as a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> (which heretofore they were;) Or in a <hi>Provincial Synod,</hi> which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly met with the <hi>Parliament;</hi> the <hi>King</hi> could have no <hi>supply</hi> from the <hi>Church.</hi> But as for <hi>Ecclesiastical business,</hi> for ought


<pb n="282" facs="tcp:43857:165"/>
I can find, they did as little with their Often-meeting then, as they do with their Seldom-meeting now. And were this the Case of the <hi>Convocation</hi> still; were the <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness</hi> of its <hi>assembling, principally,</hi> if not <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> to <hi>give Money</hi> to the <hi>Government;</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, instead of this <hi>Vindication</hi> of its <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it,</hi> we should rather have seen a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint against the charge and trouble of it: At least, I am pretty confident, neither this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> nor his <hi>Convocation-</hi>Friend, would have been much concern'd for their <hi>Meeting;</hi> or have been at all scandalized at those <hi>unwarrantable Adjournmen's,</hi> they have now so tender a sense of.</p>
               <p>But (3dly) <q>The <hi>Convecation,</hi> says this <hi>Author,</hi> is an <hi>Ecclesiastical Court.</hi> To it <note place="margin">§. 10. Letter: p. 36.</note> belongs the <hi>punishment</hi> of <hi>Heresies:</hi> And, <hi>in ancient times, it was frequently, and of necessity, used for that End; for without it there could be no punishment of Heresie.</hi>
                  </q> Since the 25th of <hi>Hen</hi> VIII. this is, in good measure, again the Case: <q>And, <hi>it cannot reasonably be supposed to be in the King's absolute Will, whether it shall exercise this Jurisdiction, or not.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This is his next <hi>Argument;</hi> and should we intirely allow of it, it would only prove that the <hi>King</hi> ought to permit Them to <hi>meet,</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> whenever any <hi>Hereticks</hi> were to be <hi>convicted</hi> by Them: But would


<pb n="283" facs="tcp:43857:165"/>
by no means shew, either that they have a <hi>right,</hi> even in such a Case, to meet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>King</hi>'s leave; Or that the <hi>King</hi> ought, of <hi>Right,</hi> to let them <hi>sit,</hi> when there is <hi>no such need</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>But indeed, if my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> be in the <note place="margin">3 Instit. 8. chap. V. pag. 39.</note> right, there is a manifest mistake in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry foundation of this <hi>Argument.</hi> For the <hi>Bishop</hi> of the <hi>Diocess</hi> had always Power to <hi>convict</hi> of <hi>Heresie;</hi> and to proceed, by <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Censures,</hi> against <hi>Hereticks.</hi> All that he was defective in, was, that He had no power to <hi>Imprison;</hi> and, for want of that, could not proceed, often-times, to any purpose against them. This Power, therefore, was given to the <hi>Bishop</hi> by the 2d of <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. And tho' now the <hi>Civil Penalty,</hi> that was wont to be inflicted upon <hi>Hereticks,</hi> be taken away; yet has it been resolved, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> may still proceed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coke,</hi> ib.</note> by <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures</hi> against Them. Whether this be so or not, I shall leave it to this <hi>Gentleman</hi> to enquire; who, possibly, may be better acquainted with such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters than I am: But, if it be, then 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest there can be no need of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations</hi> meeting to do that, which may be as well done by the <hi>Bishops</hi> without it.</p>
               <p>And these are only some lesser <hi>Arguments</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 11.</note> with which our <hi>Author</hi> design'd to skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, before we came to his main battle.


<pb n="284" facs="tcp:43857:166"/>
But now we are to begin to look to our selves: For (4thly) His next Proof is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from no less a Topick than the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary-Writ;</hi> and, in his Own Opinion, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s an Argument of Invincible Strength, to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Letter. p. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>the Necessity of Convocations meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as often as Parliaments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In answer whereunto, I do readily agree, that when the <hi>Proemonition</hi> to the <hi>Bishop,</hi> to Summon his <hi>Clergy</hi> to <hi>Parliament,</hi> was first put into that <hi>Writ;</hi> the <hi>Clergy</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>summon'd,</hi> had as much right to meet, by Vertue of it, as the <hi>Bishop</hi> himself had. And it is accordingly, by Our best <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries,</hi> acknowledged; that, in Ancient times, the <hi>Inferior Clergy,</hi> were a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Great Council</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> as well as the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Abbots.</hi> But then this is a <hi>Convocation</hi> that, for many years past, has had no Existence. And the <hi>Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> of which we are now disputing, is quite another thing: Is <hi>summon'd</hi> by <hi>another kind</hi> of <hi>Writ;</hi> and <hi>consisted</hi> of <hi>another sort</hi> of <note place="margin">Append. Numb. II, III.</note> 
                  <hi>Persons;</hi> As by comparing the ancient <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>both,</hi> may evidently be discern'd. So that this <hi>invincible Argument,</hi> has one terrible <hi>defect</hi> in it; that, whether it could otherwise be answer'd or not, yet 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently nothing at all to the purpose.</p>
               <p>But here, our <hi>Author</hi> objects against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: That, once upon a time, the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi>

               </p>
               <p>What this is to his purpose, I cannot tell; nor do I see wherefore he brought it in, unless it were to blame <hi>Rolls</hi> for quoting <note place="margin">Lett. ib.</note> 
                  <hi>Speed</hi> for it. And therefore, in behalf of Both, I shall take the liberty to say thus much, That I know not what harm it is for a Man in his Own <hi>private Collections,</hi> (for <note place="margin">See Sir <hi>M. Hale</hi>'s Pres.</note> such <hi>Rolls</hi>'s <hi>Abridgment</hi> was, tho' afterwards thought worthy of a publick View:) to note a memorable passage of <hi>History,</hi> and make a <hi>Remark</hi> of his <hi>Own</hi> upon it; Out of one of the most <hi>faithfull,</hi> and <hi>judicious,</hi> of all our Modern <hi>Historians.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">§. 13. Letter: p. 39.</note> as it stands in our <hi>Law-Dictionaries;</hi> and that too, like all the rest, nothing to the purpose. The <hi>Convocation</hi> is, by them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to be a meeting of the <hi>Clergy</hi> in <hi>Parliament-time:</hi> And some there were in the <hi>Long Parliament</hi> of 1641, who thought it could not lawfully be held, but while the <hi>Parliament</hi> sate. Well, what follows? Why, therefore the <hi>Convocation</hi> has a <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>sit,</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> as often as the <hi>Parliament</hi> meets. For a close <hi>Reasoner,</hi> let this <hi>Author</hi> alone. In the mean time, I have before shewn, that tho' the <hi>Convocation</hi> be Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd <note place="margin">Appendix, numb.

               </p>
               <p>These then are the <hi>Arguments</hi> which this <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Author</hi> has offer'd to establish his <hi>first as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion;</hi>


                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:43857:167"/>
namely, That the <hi>Convocation</hi> has a Right to <hi>sit,</hi> and <hi>act;</hi> not only upon all such Occasions, as the Necessities of the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Realm,</hi> require it should; but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, and without regard to any thing there is for them to do, as <hi>often</hi> as the <hi>Parliament</hi> is <hi>Assembled.</hi> I proceed,</p>
               <p>II<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. To consider, What he has alledged for his Other <hi>Position; Viz.</hi> That, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>met,</hi> they have no need of any <hi>License</hi> from the <hi>King</hi> to empower them to <hi>act:</hi> but may <hi>conferr, debate,</hi> and <hi>make Canons,</hi> and do any other <hi>Synodical business,</hi> which they think fit, by their <hi>Own Authority:</hi> And that either no <hi>Commission</hi> at all is needfull, to enable them to do this; or that if there be, it ought of Course, to be granted to Them.</p>
               <p>In order whereunto, I must, in the first place, observe, that those who affirm that the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>License</hi> is necessary to warrant the <hi>Convocation</hi> to <hi>act,</hi> do not sound their Opinion either upon the <hi>Power</hi> he has to <note place="margin">Letter: p. 41, 42.</note>

Prince,</hi> as such, has, in <hi>Ecclesiastical Matters;</hi> And by vertue whereof, whenever they have admitted their <hi>Clergy</hi> to meet in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,</hi> they have still prescribed to them the <hi>Rules,</hi> by which they were to proceed in Them: Or else, 2dly, In Particular; Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. which has expressly declared this <hi>Power</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>King;</hi> and <hi>forbidden</hi> the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> to presume to <hi>act,</hi> Otherwise, than in subordination thereunto.</p>
               <p>But against this our <hi>Author</hi> excepts: For (first) Is the Case be so; Then is the <note place="margin">§. 15. Letter: p. 40.</note> 
                  <hi>Convocation an Assembly to little or no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose whatsoever.—If their Tongues be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely</hi>

                  <hi>at the King's Will, 'tis improper to give their Resolutions any Title, but the King's Rules, and Ordinances. They are to all intents and purposes His, upon whose Will not only their Meeting, but their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Debating depends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In answer whereunto, I reply, First: That either there is really no Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in all this; Or if there be, it follows not from what I am now asserting. For certain it is, that this was the Case of the <note place="margin">See before ch. II. §. 23, 25.</note> most <hi>General,</hi> and <hi>famous Councils,</hi> that were ever held in the <hi>Church:</hi> And which were not only <hi>call'd</hi> by the <hi>Emperour</hi>'s <hi>Authority;</hi> but, being met, <hi>acted</hi> intirely according to their <hi>prescription.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:43857:168"/>
But indeed, I cannot perceive, that any of those hard things, this <hi>Author</hi> so much complains of, do at all follow from this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. For what tho' the <hi>King</hi> do's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to them the <hi>Subject</hi> of their <hi>Debates;</hi> What they are to <hi>consult</hi> about; and draw up their <hi>Resolutions</hi> upon? Are They not still <hi>free</hi> to <hi>deliberate, conferr, resolve,</hi> for all that? Will not their <hi>Resolutions</hi> be their Own, because the <hi>King</hi> declared to them the <hi>General Matter</hi> upon which they were to <hi>consult?</hi> Is a <hi>Counsellor</hi> at <hi>Law</hi> of no <hi>use;</hi> or has he no <hi>freedom</hi> of <hi>Opinion,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his <hi>Client</hi> puts his <hi>Case</hi> to Him? Or, do's our <hi>Law</hi> unsitly call the Answer of a <hi>Petit-Jury,</hi> its <hi>Verdict,</hi> because the <hi>Judge</hi> Summ'd up the <hi>Evidence</hi> to them, and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected</hi> them not only upon what <hi>points,</hi> but from what <hi>proof,</hi> they were to <hi>Raise</hi> it? What strange <hi>Notions</hi> of things must a Man have, who argues at such a Rate as this: And might, upon as good Grounds, affirm the <hi>Parliament</hi> its self not to be free, as he has deny'd the <hi>Convocation</hi> to be so; because that, in the main parts of their <hi>Debates,</hi> That also is <hi>as much,</hi> tho' not so <hi>necessarily,</hi> directed by the <hi>King,</hi> in what He would have them <hi>consult</hi> about.</p>
               <p>I have insisted the more upon this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, because it is one of the most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular <hi>Arguments</hi> he has offer'd in defence


<pb n="290" facs="tcp:43857:169"/>
of his <hi>Opinion;</hi> tho', alas! 'tis at best but miserable Harangue, to oppose against the Express <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the Common <hi>Prerogative</hi> which All <hi>Christian Princes</hi> have, from the beginning, laid claim to, as to this Matter. But He ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges farther,</p>
               <p>(2dly.) <hi>That supposing a</hi> License <hi>were</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 16. Letter: p. 46.</note> 
                  <hi>necessary, yet for that very Reason it ought to be Granted: And it matters not much whether we say that a</hi> License <hi>ought,</hi> ex de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bito Justitiae, <hi>to be Granted to empower them to deliberate; Or whether they have, of Themselves, a Power of deliberation, without such</hi> License <hi>expressly given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That whenever the <hi>King</hi> requires the <hi>Convocation</hi> to sit, he ought to send them a <hi>License</hi> to <hi>act,</hi> is out of doubt: because otherwise, he would either oblige them to meet to no purpose; or would lay a snare in their way, by bringing them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and putting them upon <hi>acting</hi> without a <hi>License;</hi> which, by <hi>Law,</hi> they ought not to do. But that this is granted <hi>Ex debito Justitiae,</hi> I utterly deny; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">See that of King <hi>Ch</hi> I. Append. Numb. V.</note> in all the <hi>Commissions</hi> I have ever seen, 'tis particularly said to be Granted by the <hi>King,</hi> of his <hi>special Grace,</hi> and <hi>meer Motion;</hi> which cannot with any proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Speech be said, of what in justice belongs to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:43857:169"/>
The truth of the Case is this: The 25 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8th has restored the <hi>Crown</hi> to its <hi>Royal Authority,</hi> as to this matter. It has put the <hi>Power</hi> of directing the <hi>Convocation,</hi> (as of <hi>Right</hi> it ought to be) into the <hi>King</hi>'s hands. They cannot <hi>Act</hi> without his <hi>Licence;</hi> and he is not Obliged, by any <hi>Law,</hi> to grant it to them: but may allow, or not allow them to Do business, as he thinks it will be most expedient for the <hi>Churches</hi> Welfare. That therefore the <hi>King</hi> do's, at any time, Grant them such a <hi>Licence,</hi> is of his <hi>Own Good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;</hi> Nor can it any Otherwise be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a <hi>Debt</hi> of <hi>Justice,</hi> than as he is Obliged in <hi>Justice</hi> to his People, to Do whatsoever he thinks to be for the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good.</hi> But yet, in point of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, it must be confess'd, that the <hi>King</hi> either ought not to Require his <hi>Clergy</hi> to meet together, more than for <hi>Form</hi> sake; Or that if he do's, He ought to <hi>Commission</hi> Them to <hi>act</hi> too: That so they may neither meet to <hi>no purpose;</hi> or which is Worse, do it to their <hi>Own detriment,</hi> by Acting Otherwise than the <hi>Law</hi> allows Them to do</p>
               <p>And therefore, I do Agree, that, in a very large, improper sense of the


<pb n="284" facs="tcp:43857:170"/>
Words, it may be said that when they do <hi>sit,</hi> a <hi>Licence</hi> ought, <hi>ex debito Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> to be Granted to them. Because they ought not to <hi>sit,</hi> but when their <hi>sitting</hi> will be for the <hi>Good</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and when that is so, the <hi>King</hi> is obliged in <hi>Justice</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> to give them <hi>Licence to Act.</hi> But, in this <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s sense, I utterly deny, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the <hi>Convocation</hi> has any <hi>right</hi> to <hi>Meet</hi> whenever the <hi>Parliament</hi> do's: Or that upon every such <hi>Formal Assembling,</hi> they ought to have a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> sent to them, to <hi>Empower</hi> them to <hi>Act;</hi> tho' I still affirm that they are not at Liberty to <hi>Act</hi> without it.</p>
               <p>As for what is here again urged (3ly) from the <hi>Rights</hi> of the <hi>Parliament;</hi> It <note place="margin">§. 17. Letter. <hi>p.</hi> 48.</note> may suffice to say, That neither do's the <hi>Parliament</hi> lie under the same <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions</hi> that the <hi>Convocation</hi> do's, nor can it, with any Consistency to our <hi>Constitution,</hi> be supposed that it should do so. The <hi>Parliament,</hi> Acting in Concurrence with the <hi>King,</hi> have the <hi>Legislative Power</hi> in their Hands. They neither are <hi>Restrain'd</hi> by any <hi>Laws;</hi> nor is it possible they should be. But the <hi>Convocation</hi> is truly, no more than


<pb n="285" facs="tcp:43857:170"/>
an <hi>Ecclesiastical Council.</hi> Its business is to <hi>Advise,</hi> and <hi>Assist</hi> the <hi>King</hi> in things pertaining to the <hi>Church.</hi> And tho' I know it will displease this <hi>Author</hi> to be told so, yet I must again put him in mind, that the <hi>Clergy</hi> have no power to <hi>make laws.</hi> They may draw up <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> and <hi>Constitutions,</hi> within the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits</hi> which the <hi>Parliament</hi> has set to them; and the <hi>King</hi> may confirm them; And that being done, they will have a due force: But still <hi>Laws</hi> they are not, unless in a very <hi>imperfect Sense;</hi> the same in which the <hi>Convocation</hi> is a <hi>Legislature,</hi> and the Master of a <hi>family</hi> a <hi>Monarch</hi> within his <hi>Own House.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But tho' I cannot therefore joyn with this <hi>Author</hi> in his <hi>Argument;</hi> yet I heartily concurr with him in his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi> of it: <hi>That an</hi> English, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <note place="margin">Letter. <hi>p.</hi> 50, 51.</note> King, <hi>is as much Obliged by the</hi> Laws <hi>and</hi> Usages, <hi>had and accustomed in this</hi> Kingdom, <hi>in regard to the</hi> Church; <hi>as the</hi> Sovereign <hi>of</hi> England <hi>is, with relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the</hi> State. This, I say, is unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionably true; and brings us to the true way of deciding the <hi>Point</hi> before us. If by the <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Usages,</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> the <hi>Convocation</hi> has a <hi>Right,</hi> to <hi>sit,</hi> and <hi>act,</hi> as this <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>


                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:43857:171"/>
affirms; let those <hi>Laws</hi> be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and those <hi>Usages</hi> made out, and I submit. But if according both to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Usages</hi> of the <hi>Realm,</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> be wholly in the <hi>King</hi>'s hands; (As I think I have abundantly shew'd that it is) then let our <hi>Author</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by his <hi>Own Rule;</hi> and <hi>Render unto</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesar's; <hi>to God, the things that are God's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our <hi>Author</hi> here again <hi>objects</hi> to himself; what, if he had not, I dare <note place="margin">§. 18.</note> say no man living would ever have <hi>Objected</hi> to him; that the <hi>Convocation</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Letter. <hi>p.</hi> 51.</note> has oftentimes been <hi>prohibited</hi> by the <hi>King,</hi> to deal with any thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd his <hi>Crown,</hi> and <hi>Dignity,</hi> &amp;c. And he thus makes his <hi>Advantage</hi> of it; That since those <hi>Prohibitions</hi> were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to keep the <hi>Convocation</hi> from <hi>Excess,</hi> and within their <hi>just bounds,</hi> it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dnetly <hi>supposed,</hi> that they may <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle</hi> with any <hi>Other Matter,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Express Licence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whether that be <hi>supposed,</hi> or no, I cannot tell; this I am sure is, that the <hi>Clergy,</hi> in those days, were but too apt to meddle with matters, in their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> that did not at all belong to


<pb n="287" facs="tcp:43857:171"/>
them. And I doubt, were some mens Notions allow'd of, we should find but too much need of having these kind of <hi>Prohibitions</hi> brought again into <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi> But, the truth is, when those <hi>Prohibitions</hi> were wont to be sent to the <hi>Convocation;</hi> the <hi>Clergy,</hi> oftentimes, did not only <hi>Meet,</hi> but <hi>Act</hi> too, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Licence:</hi> And by <hi>both</hi> usurp'd upon the <hi>Royal Authority.</hi> And to suppress these abuses, and to vindicate the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Supremacy,</hi> it was, that the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 25 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 19. was pass'd. Since which time we meet with none of these <hi>Prohibitions;</hi> and I hope the <hi>Crown</hi> will never fall any more into such hard Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as to stand, again, in need of them.</p>
               <p>As for what this <hi>Author,</hi> in the next <note place="margin">Letter. <hi>p.</hi> 50, 51.</note> place, excepts against the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Cokes</hi> xiith. <hi>Report;</hi> I am but little concern'd in it. The <hi>fortunes</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> depend not upon the Credit of it. Let those who build their <hi>Opinion,</hi> as to these matters, upon the Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Judges,</hi> there Related, (if Any such there be) undertake the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:43857:172"/>
We are now come to the main Point; and which Our <hi>Author,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">§. 19.</note> Labours, all he can, to Get over: And that is, How we are to understand the <hi>Statute</hi> of the 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Whether as <hi>Prohibiting</hi> the <hi>Clergy</hi> only to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulge</hi> and <hi>Execute</hi> any <hi>Canons,</hi> &amp;c. but what are <hi>Confirm</hi>'d by the <hi>King?</hi> Or, Whether we are to look upon it to have forbidden Them, to <hi>debate,</hi> and <hi>conclude</hi> upon any; without his <hi>Licence,</hi> first had, so to do?</p>
               <p>And here, I shall neither enter into any Controversy with this <hi>New Critick,</hi> about the <hi>propriety</hi> of <hi>Expression,</hi> in which Our <hi>Acts</hi> are too often defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; Nor complain of his very <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> and <hi>Imperfect Recital</hi> of it: Tho' in this, he will find it hard to justifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to those, who will take the pains to compare the <hi>Words</hi> of the <hi>Statute,</hi> with that Account which he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <note place="margin">See the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix.</note> in his <hi>Letter,</hi> of it. But suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>Act</hi> to have been so <hi>obscurely,</hi> or <hi>doubtfully drawn up,</hi> as to be really capable of either of the <hi>Senses</hi> here <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> for; (which yet truly I think it is not:) will only consider whether there be not much more reason to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr Oars,</hi> than to <hi>allow</hi> of <hi>His.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:43857:172"/>
For which end, 1st, I would Ask this <hi>Author:</hi> Whether, supposing One of these <hi>Senses</hi> can evidently be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have been <hi>Always,</hi> and <hi>Universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Received,</hi> as the meaning of this <hi>Act,</hi> ever since it was Made; and the Other be Confessedly a <hi>New,</hi> and <hi>Singular,</hi> (for I must not now say a <hi>Forced) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> of it; that Ought not in all Reason to be Stuck to, which has <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd</hi> from the beginning, rather than That which was never <hi>Allow'd</hi> of; nor, for ought I know, so much as heard of, till this <hi>Gentleman</hi> first enlightned the World with it?</p>
               <p>Again: 2dly: Let me demand far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; Whether this will not be still more Reasonable, if it can be shewn, that that <hi>Sense</hi> of this <hi>Statute,</hi> which we Affirm has hitherto <hi>Universally Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd,</hi> has also been <hi>confirm'd</hi> by the <hi>Constant Practice</hi> of Those who were most concern'd to Enquire into the Meaning of it; And had, withall, the Best Opportunities of knowing what was indeed intended by the <hi>Legislators</hi> in Making of it?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:43857:173"/>
3dly, and lastly: Let me Ask; Whether we ought not, yet more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to acquiesce in this <hi>Sense;</hi> if it has been <hi>Generally,</hi> and <hi>Constantly</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, not only by such as were the most <hi>Concern'd,</hi> and best <hi>Qualified,</hi> to judge of it; but whose <hi>Interest</hi> it was, withall, to have <hi>declared</hi> against <hi>this Sense,</hi> and to have Asserted that <hi>Other,</hi> which this <hi>Author</hi> has here advanced; supposing there had been any Rational Ground for Them so to do?</p>
               <p>These, I conceive, are very plain <hi>Questions;</hi> and either this <hi>Gentleman</hi> must recede from the most <hi>Commonly, Received Rules</hi> of <hi>Interpreting Laws;</hi> or he must Consent to the <hi>Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of them, and be Concluded by Them.</p>
               <p>To apply then these <hi>General Rules</hi> to the Case in hand: I believe no reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <note place="margin">§. 20.</note> Man will doubt but that the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have had as Good <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities</hi> of <hi>Understanding</hi> the <hi>Sense</hi> of their <hi>Own Laws,</hi> as any Other Person whatsoever can pretend to. They have had their <hi>Judges;</hi> their <hi>Council</hi> learned in the <hi>Law;</hi> their Own <hi>Great


<pb n="291" facs="tcp:43857:173"/>
Counsellours,</hi> at all times, to advise with: And these have not only <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> to make an <hi>Authentick declaration</hi> of the <hi>Sense</hi> of any <hi>Statute;</hi> but have been actually consulted by Them, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>meaning</hi> of this very <hi>Act.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we should be so unreasonable as to Suppose, that Our <hi>Princes</hi> have from time to time sent <hi>Commissions</hi> to their <hi>Convocations,</hi> to empower them to <hi>Act;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See that of K.</hi> Ch. I. Append. n. v.</note> And that with peculiar Relation to this <hi>Law;</hi> and yet never <hi>Consulted</hi> with their <hi>Judges,</hi> &amp;c. in drawing of them; Or were ever better <hi>inform'd</hi> by <hi>Them,</hi> when they saw how Grosly they had mistaken the <hi>Sense</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>But it may be our <hi>Kings</hi> were <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> in this <hi>Case,</hi> and had an interest to prefer this <hi>Interpretation</hi> of that <hi>Statute</hi> before the Other; that so they might the better Exalt their Own <hi>Power</hi> by it. Let this also be supposed: But still I hope the <hi>Convocation</hi> its self had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to joyn with them in this design; and to help, by a wrong <hi>interpretation</hi> of this <hi>Act,</hi> to bring themselves into Bondage. That, next to the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Convocation</hi> may be accounted as well Qualified to understand the true Sense of a <hi>Statute,</hi> which it so nearly


<pb n="292" facs="tcp:43857:174"/>
concern'd them to look into, as any <hi>Private Critick,</hi> I believe no Modest Man will deny. Our <hi>Author,</hi> I am sure, has too Great a Veneration for that Learned Body, to doubt of their <hi>Ability;</hi> I had almost said <hi>Authority,</hi> to Expound an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let him therefore tell us; What <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> has there been, ever since this <hi>Act</hi> was made, that has ever refused the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Licence,</hi> sent to them in pursuance of it? Or has <hi>Protested</hi> against it? Or has ventured to proceed to <hi>Conferr, Deliberate,</hi> and <hi>Make Canons,</hi> without the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Licence</hi> first Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, to Warrant them so to do? That our <hi>Kings</hi> have constantly sent their <hi>Commissions</hi> to them, to keep them from falling under the <hi>Censure</hi> of this <hi>Statute,</hi> We are very sure. That Our <hi>Convocations</hi> have evermore thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully received these <hi>Commissions;</hi> and proceeded to <hi>Act</hi> under the <hi>Authority</hi> of Them, cannot be deny'd. That they have refused to <hi>Act</hi> till they Received the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Licence;</hi> and when they have suspected that the <hi>date</hi> of it was <hi>determined,</hi> have insisted upon having a <hi>New One</hi> sent to Them, we can prove, beyond any Reasonable Exception.

But that ever any <hi>Convocation</hi> Rejected such a <hi>Licence;</hi> or presumed to <hi>Act</hi> without it; from the time that this <hi>Law</hi> was made, I have never heard, nor can this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> I believe, give me an <hi>Instance</hi> of Either. I conclude therefore, that supposing there were indeed a just Ground to doubt of the <hi>meaning</hi> of this <hi>Statute;</hi> (which yet I must again prosess, to my Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, there is not) yet still, That <hi>Sense</hi> of it which has Obtain'd ever since it was made; according to which Our <hi>Kings</hi> have for above 150 Years proceeded to Give such <hi>Licences,</hi> as we now contend for, to their <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> And their <hi>Convocations</hi> have continued to <hi>accept</hi> of, and to <hi>Act</hi> by them: Which our Greatest <hi>Lawyers</hi> have <hi>declared</hi> themselves in <hi>favour</hi> of; and which no Man, that, I know of, besides this One <hi>Author,</hi> has ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to call in Question: I say that <hi>Sense,</hi> which has all these <hi>Advantages;</hi> and is, in its self, most agreeable to the <hi>Words</hi> of the <hi>Act,</hi> and the <hi>Occasion</hi> that was given to the making of it; ought, in all Reason, to be preferr'd to any new <hi>Construction</hi> that can be set up against it; tho' such <hi>construction</hi>

               <p>Whether these Considerations will seem sufficient to this <hi>Author,</hi> to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Old, Received <hi>Sense</hi> of this <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi> I cannot tell: nor do's the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Authority</hi> depend so much upon it, that I should need to say any more to it.

And now, I may venture to say, we <note place="margin">§. 21.</note> have seen the utmost of what this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> can do. As for what he next catches at, That my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> affirms <note place="margin">

'Tis true, the <hi>Clergy,</hi> in those days, did take the Liberty to transact many things, in their <hi>Convocations,</hi> without any particular <hi>Licence,</hi> from the <hi>King,</hi> to warrant Them so to do.

                  <hi>Clerks,</hi> who have once been admitted into any <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> whether <hi>Greater</hi> or <hi>Lesser,</hi> were from thenceforth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from all <hi>temporal Punishment,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any <hi>Temporal Judge,</hi> for any <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Cause</hi> whatsoever.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lords Temporal,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> being alarum'd at this, Petition the <hi>King</hi> that he would order this <hi>Point</hi> to be publickly argued, by <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Canonists</hi> on both sides: And thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Certain Day was appointed by the <hi>King</hi> for that purpose, at the <hi>Black-Fryars, London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Council</hi> for the <hi>King</hi> was Doctor <hi>Henry Standish,</hi> a Learned Man, and Guardian of the <hi>Mendicant Fryars,</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> The <hi>Cause</hi> was handled, and many <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>both Houses</hi> were present: And, in the Opinion of all who heard it, Dr. <hi>Standish</hi> had so much the Better of the <hi>Council</hi> that argued for the <hi>Clergy;</hi> that it was moved to the <hi>Bishops,</hi> that they should Oblige the <hi>Abbot</hi> Publickly to <hi>Recant</hi> his <hi>Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Michaelmas</hi> following, the <hi>Clergy</hi> sitting in <hi>Convocation,</hi> cited Dr. <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish</hi> to appear before them, to answer to such Articles as should there be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited


<pb n="300" facs="tcp:43857:178"/>
against Him. He appeared, as he was order'd; and <hi>four Articles</hi> were first proposed by the <hi>Archbishop</hi> to Him: and being afterwards encreased to <hi>six,</hi> were deliver'd to Him in <hi>Writing;</hi> (All tending to the purport of what he had before Asserted, in defence of the <hi>King's Authority;)</hi> And he was Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, upon a <hi>Certain Day,</hi> to <hi>Answer</hi> to Them. It seems, to assert the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Authority</hi> over the <hi>Clergy,</hi> was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in those days to be no less than <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;</hi> and perhaps may still be thought, by some Men, to come near to it.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Standish</hi> easily perceived what the <hi>Convocation</hi> drove at: And being sensible that He should not be Able to withstand their <hi>Malice,</hi> and <hi>Authority;</hi> put Himself under the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Protection,</hi> and referr'd his <hi>Cause</hi> to Him. The <hi>Clergy</hi> being a little surprised at this, protest to the <hi>King</hi> that their Process against Him was not for any thing he either did, or said, when he was of <hi>Council</hi> for his <hi>Majesty;</hi> but for Other <hi>Tenets,</hi> Else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and at Other times advanced by Him: And therefore pray his Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; according to his <hi>Coronation Oath;</hi> and as He desired to avoid the <hi>Censures</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi>


                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:43857:178"/>
The <hi>Clergy</hi> thus proceeding, the <hi>Lords,</hi> and <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Realm,</hi> at the Instance of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> address also to the <hi>King;</hi> and desire him, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> that He would assert his <hi>Temporal Jurisdiction;</hi> and protect <hi>Standish;</hi> (in the Great peril in which He was,) against the <hi>Malice</hi> of the <hi>Clergy:</hi> who evidently Objected to him the same <hi>Tenets</hi> which He had <hi>defended,</hi> in <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being thus applied to, on Both sides; the <hi>King</hi> first consults with Dr. <hi>Veysey, Dean</hi> of his <hi>Chapel;</hi> and (having had his Opinion) orders the <hi>Justices</hi> of his <hi>Courts,</hi> and his Own <hi>Council,</hi> both <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal,</hi> with several Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to meet at the <hi>Black-Fryars;</hi> and there to take Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the Cause between <hi>Standish,</hi> and the <hi>Convocation;</hi> and to hear what <hi>Standish</hi> had to say for himself, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the <hi>Points</hi> objected to Him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cause</hi> is heard; and in conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Standish</hi> is acquitted, and the whole <hi>Convocation</hi> judged to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> by their <hi>Citation,</hi> and <hi>Prosecution</hi> of Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:43857:179"/>
Upon this the <hi>King</hi> comes himself to <hi>Baynards Castle;</hi> all the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and a Great Part of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> with the <hi>Judges,</hi> attending upon Him. Being sate; <hi>Woolsey,</hi> as <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and in high favour with the <hi>King,</hi> first applies to Him in behalf of the <hi>Convocation;</hi> and prays, that the Cause might be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to the Judgment of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> This was seconded by <hi>Warham, Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the name of All the <hi>Clergy;</hi> and much was Argued for, and against This.</p>
               <p>At length the <hi>King</hi> deliver'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to this Effect, to them: <q>
                     <hi>That by the</hi> Order <hi>and</hi> Sufferance <hi>of</hi> God, <hi>He was</hi> King <hi>of</hi> England; <hi>and, as such, would maintain the</hi> Rights <hi>of his</hi> Crown, <hi>and his</hi> Royal Jurisdiction, <hi>in as ample a manner, as any of his</hi> Progenitors <hi>had done before Him.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>Then he commanded the</hi> Convocation <hi>to dismiss</hi> Standish; which accordingly they did: And were content, for that time, to let the <hi>Royal Supremacy,</hi> get the better of the <hi>Spiritual Jurisdiction.</hi>

               <p>HItherto we have been stating the <note place="margin">§. 1.</note> matter of <hi>Right</hi> between the <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Convocation:</hi> And if I do not very much deceive my self, I have plainly made it appear against the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> of the <hi>Late Letter to a Convocation-Man;</hi> that that Venerable Body have neither any <hi>Right</hi> to <hi>Meet,</hi> nor <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Act,</hi> but as the <hi>King</hi> shall Graciously Allow them to do.</p>
               <p>But now, having Asserted this, in Vindication of the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Prerogative; I must not forget what I have before confess'd as to this matter, and see no


<pb n="504" facs="tcp:43857:180"/>
Cause yet to Retract; <hi>viz.</hi> That His <hi>Majesty,</hi> both as a <hi>Christian,</hi> and a <hi>King,</hi> is Obliged to permit his <hi>Clergy</hi> to <hi>Sit,</hi> and <hi>Act,</hi> whensoever he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that the Necessities of the <hi>Church</hi> require it; and it would be for the <hi>Publick Good</hi> of his <hi>People,</hi> that They should do so. And tho', 'tis true, the <hi>Law</hi> has intrusted Him with the Last <hi>Judgment</hi> of this; and, without which, it would be impossible for him to maintain his <hi>Supremacy</hi> in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect; yet certainly He ought to be by so much the more careful to Consider the <hi>Interest</hi> of the <hi>Publick,</hi> by How much the Greater the Trust is, which the <hi>Publick,</hi> in Confidence of such his Care, has Reposed in Him.</p>
               <p>It must be confess'd, indeed, that our present <hi>Author,</hi> has neither taken a very proper Method of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his <hi>Advice</hi> to the <hi>King;</hi> nor done it in such a Manner, as if He design'd to perswade either the <hi>King,</hi> or his <hi>Ministers,</hi> to pay any Great Deference to his <hi>Judgment.</hi> On the contrary it appears, that in all that he has said, he intended rather to Reflect upon the <hi>Administration</hi> of <hi>Affairs,</hi> and to raise <hi>discontents</hi> in Mens Minds against the


<pb n="305" facs="tcp:43857:180"/>
                  <hi>Government,</hi> than to do any Service ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Religion,</hi> or the <hi>Church.</hi> But however I will consider, nevertheless, what he has alledged, to shew, That our <hi>present times</hi> call for a <hi>Convocation;</hi> and that the <hi>King</hi> ought not any longer to prevent their <hi>sitting.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And his Answer to it, is Short, and Vehement; full of Warmth, as being, I suppose, design'd to Enflame: <q>That <hi>if Ever there were need of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>There is scarce any thing in <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that either more Exposed our <hi>Christian Profession</hi> heretofore, or may more deserve our serious Consideration at this day; than the <hi>Violence,</hi> the <hi>Passion,</hi> the <hi>Malice,</hi> the <hi>Falseness,</hi> and the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,</hi> which Reigned in most of those <hi>Synods</hi> that were held by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> first, and, after, him by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Emperours,</hi> upon the Occasion of the <hi>Arian</hi> Controversy. Bitter are the Complaints, which, we are told, that Great <hi>Emperour</hi> made of Them. The <hi>Barbarians,</hi> says he, in his <hi>Letter</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sozom. lib. ii.

And what little Success other <hi>Synods</hi> have oftentimes had, might easily be made appear; were it needful to enlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so Known, and Melancholy a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>Now this as it has obliged not only the Best Men, but the Wisest Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, to be very careful, how they ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called, or encouraged such <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,</hi>

unless they had some Reason to hope for a <hi>Good Effect</hi> of Them; so may it suffice to convince Us still, that neither are All <hi>Times,</hi> nor All <hi>Causes,</hi> either Proper for, or Worthy of, such Meetings: and that the <hi>Expediency</hi> of Them ought to be very Clearly made out, before it can, with any Reason, be expected, that the <hi>Prince</hi> should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to their <hi>Assembling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It has, I think been generally agreed, <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> that the main <hi>End</hi> for which <hi>Synods</hi> are necessary to be Assembled, is either to <hi>establish</hi> the <hi>Faith,</hi> and to declare the <hi>Unity,</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:</hi> Or to <hi>advise,</hi> and <hi>assist</hi> the <hi>Civil Magistrate,</hi> in things pertaining to the <hi>Discipline</hi> of it. As for the Exercise of <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction,</hi> that, in every well settled <hi>Church,</hi> is commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by some more <hi>Ordinary</hi> Means: So that, except in a few <hi>Cases</hi> of an <hi>Extraordinary Nature,</hi> there is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom any Occasion for a <hi>Synod</hi> to meet, upon any such account.</p>
                  <p>Now as these are the <hi>Ends</hi> for which <hi>Synods</hi> ought to be <hi>Assembled;</hi> so, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> it will be allow'd, by all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering

Persons, that the <hi>Prince</hi> ought never to Call them, when Either, 1st. It is needless; Or, 2dly, It would be hurtful so to do. When there is no Appearance of any <hi>Good</hi> to come from their <hi>Meeting;</hi> but rather it may justly be fear'd, that their <hi>Meeting</hi> will turn to the <hi>Prejudice</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> In short; That the <hi>Prince</hi> ought never to call his <hi>Clergy</hi> together, but for some <hi>Rational,</hi> and <hi>Good End:</hi> When there is something <hi>Proper</hi> for such an <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> to <hi>do;</hi> and They may be likely to <hi>Do</hi> it <hi>so,</hi> as to advance the <hi>Welfare</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> by it.</p>
                  <p>This, I conceive, must be allow'd, in point of <hi>Prudence,</hi> to be the <hi>General Measure,</hi> by which the <hi>Prince</hi> ought, upon all Occasions, to judge, whether it be <hi>Necessary,</hi> or even <hi>Expedient</hi> for him, to suffer a <hi>Convocation</hi> to Meet, or no. And from these <hi>General Measures,</hi> we will proceed to draw some farther, and more particular <hi>Directions,</hi> for our better <hi>judging</hi> in the <hi>Point</hi> before Us.</p>
                  <p>And (1st.) Because in <hi>Clear,</hi> and <note place="margin">§. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Evident Cases,</hi> where both the <hi>Truth</hi> is <hi>Manifest;</hi> and the <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>Church,

Constant</hi> and <hi>Out of doubt;</hi> there is no need of any <hi>Definitions,</hi> either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare its Sense, or to testifie its Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: therefore neither can there be any Need to Assemble a <hi>Convocation,</hi> to <hi>Judge</hi> or <hi>Determine,</hi> in such <hi>Cases.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If, in a <hi>Christian Country,</hi> where the <hi>Gospel</hi> is profess'd, and its Truth esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd; and Men have, for many Ages, been Bred up to the Knowledge, and Belief of it; A sort of <hi>Libertines</hi> should arise, to deny not only the truth of <hi>Christianity,</hi> but the very <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>God;</hi> the <hi>Certainty</hi> of <hi>Revelation;</hi> the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> and the like <hi>Common,</hi> and <hi>Avow'd Principles</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi> It would be not only <hi>Need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi> but <hi>Absurd,</hi> for a <hi>Synod</hi> to be call'd to debate over again the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Piety;</hi> and solemnly to define against these <hi>Sceptical, Profane</hi> Disputers, That there is a <hi>God;</hi> That He has <hi>Revealed</hi> his <hi>Will</hi> to <hi>Mankind;</hi> and that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> were written by <hi>divine Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> And all that they would Gain by doing of it, would be only this, that they would see their <hi>Authority,</hi> and their <hi>Definitions, despised</hi> by Them: And might probably give Offence to Good Men; as if they had so much


<pb n="311" facs="tcp:43857:183"/>
                     <hi>Reason</hi> on their side, or there were so much <hi>Difficulty</hi> in this <hi>Case;</hi> as to need the Solemnity of a <hi>Convocation</hi> to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in it.</p>
                  <p>In such <hi>Cases</hi> as this, the <hi>Christian Magistrate</hi> ought to take upon him the <hi>Protection</hi> of <hi>Religion;</hi> of the <hi>Faith</hi> which he professes, and of that <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> by whom He hopes to be Saved: And so to Order Matters; that such Persons shall either Cease to <hi>blaspheme;</hi> Or they shall find out some Other Place than a <hi>Christian Country</hi> to do it in. <hi>Civil Authority</hi> may Restrain such bold Men; but 'tis Ridiculous to think that all the <hi>Synods</hi> in the World, should ever be able to <hi>Perswade</hi> Them.</p>
                  <p>Again (2dly.) Upon the same <note place="margin">§. 7.</note> Grounds I affirm, that neither is there any need of a <hi>New Synod,</hi> to declare the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> in such <hi>Points,</hi> in which it has, by as <hi>Great,</hi> Or even <hi>Greater Authority,</hi> been before Declared.</p>
                  <p>Thus supposing any <hi>Church</hi> should not only have solemnly Received the <hi>Four</hi> first <hi>General Councils;</hi> but in farther testimony of its <hi>Agreement</hi> in <hi>Faith</hi> with Them, should have given their <hi>Creeds</hi> a


<pb n="312" facs="tcp:43857:184"/>
Place in its <hi>Publick Liturgy:</hi> And to strengthen all this, should have drawn up a Clear, and Full <hi>Confession</hi> of its Own, upon the Principles by them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined; and have Required that <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> to be <hi>Received,</hi> and <hi>Subscribed</hi> to, by All who are Admitted, to any <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Office,</hi> or <hi>Function</hi> in it: How ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous would it be, for such a <hi>Church,</hi> to Assemble a <hi>Convocation,</hi> to declare to all the World that it <hi>believes</hi> our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Divinity;</hi> and holds a <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Persons,</hi> in the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>God-head?</hi> What tho' there be some, in such a <hi>Church,</hi> who <hi>deny</hi> this; and take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the <hi>Liberty,</hi> or rather <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness,</hi> of evil Times, to dare even to <hi>Write,</hi> and <hi>Argue</hi> against it? The <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> are still the same: And it may as well be said that in Our <hi>Protestant, Reform'd Church,</hi> it is needful to call a <hi>Convocation,</hi> to protest again against the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> because some not only <hi>Write</hi> in defence of Them, but are buisie also to make <hi>Converts</hi> to them; As for such a <hi>Church</hi> to call a <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi> to declare, that it has no part with those who <hi>Write,</hi> and Argue, against its own Avow'd <hi>Sense,</hi> in the Points of the


<pb n="313" facs="tcp:43857:184"/>
                     <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> and of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Convocation</hi> may <hi>sit,</hi> and draw up what <hi>Creeds,</hi> and <hi>Confessions</hi> it will. But if They expect that Those who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Ancient, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Councils</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> should be Concluded by <hi>their Definitions;</hi> It will, I doubt, appear that They have but flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd themselves with Vain Hopes: And they will find, too late, that those who are not to be Restrain'd by what has been <hi>already Determin'd,</hi> will much less regard any New <hi>Decisions</hi> that can be made Against Them.</p>
                  <p>In this Case, again, 'tis the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> or nothing, that must Restrain their Presumption. A <hi>Good Law</hi> may Oblige them to be <hi>silent;</hi> but I doubt neither that, nor any Thing else, will be Able to cure them of their <hi>Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But. (3dly.) If a <hi>Convocation</hi> ought <note place="margin">§. 8.</note> not to be called without need, then neither can it be <hi>Necessary,</hi> or even <hi>sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> to Assemble it for such <hi>Matters,</hi> as not only may be Equally provided for, by <hi>Ordinary Means;</hi> but which fall, more properly, under the Cognizance of some Other <hi>Authority.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:43857:185"/>
Such are, first, all <hi>Private Cases,</hi> which are determinable in Other <hi>Courts,</hi> and before some Other <hi>Judges,</hi> which the <hi>Law</hi> has provided for Them: And the <hi>King</hi> might as well Assemble his <hi>Parliament,</hi> to try a <hi>Thief,</hi> or a <hi>Felon;</hi> as his <hi>Convocation</hi> to convict a Man of <hi>Heresie,</hi> or <hi>Schism</hi> There are <hi>Civil Courts</hi> appointed for the <hi>One;</hi> and <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Courts</hi> provided for the Other. And if these Neglect, or <hi>Refuse</hi> to do their <hi>Duty,</hi> there are Shorter Ways of <hi>Applying</hi> a <hi>Remedy</hi> to it, than by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling either a <hi>Parliament,</hi> or <hi>Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> for such a Purpose.</p>
                  <p>And such are, secondly, such <hi>Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> as either the <hi>Bishop</hi> in his <hi>Diocess;</hi> the <hi>Arch-bishop</hi> in his <hi>Province;</hi> Or the <hi>King</hi> in the whole <hi>Church,</hi> have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power, by their Own immediate <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> or <hi>Injunctions,</hi> to redress: Whether they be Occasion'd by Mens <hi>departing</hi> from the <hi>Rules,</hi> and <hi>Measures</hi> already <hi>prescribed</hi> to Them; Or for want of a <hi>Vigorous</hi> Execution of those <hi>Laws,</hi> by which they ought to be <hi>punish'd</hi> for their so doing.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, where the <hi>Discipline,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> its self is <hi>defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive;</hi> and Irregularities both in the


<pb n="315" facs="tcp:43857:185"/>
                     <hi>Clergy,</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi> abound, for want of a Power sufficient to suppress them; a <hi>Convocation</hi> may be needful, to consider, How a <hi>Remedy</hi> may be <hi>provided</hi> for this <hi>Defect;</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> be enabled, more successfully, both to <hi>Guard</hi> the <hi>Faith,</hi> and to <hi>Reform</hi> the <hi>Manners,</hi> of its <hi>Members.</hi> And I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wish our Circumstances were such, that a <hi>Convocation</hi> might meet, for this Purpose. But I am afraid our <hi>Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> is become too Great to be <hi>healed:</hi> And that we are Uncapable of such a <hi>Discipline,</hi> as, above all things, We the most Want. And therefore</p>
                  <p>(4thly.) And to go on with these <note place="margin">§. 9.</note> Remarks: As in such <hi>Cases,</hi> as I have hitherto mentioned, it is <hi>needless</hi> to Call a <hi>Convocation;</hi> so would it be in Vain to Assemble it for such purposes, in which there were no probable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of Success; or <hi>hope,</hi> that any <hi>Good</hi> should be done by it. This, as for ought I know, it may be One Great Reason why a <hi>Convocation</hi> is not called, to <hi>Review</hi> some of our <hi>Publick Offices;</hi> to <hi>Improve</hi> our <hi>Discipline;</hi> And to <hi>Reform</hi> many <hi>Disorders</hi> in the Exercise of the <hi>Ecclesiastical Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>


                     <pb n="316" facs="tcp:43857:186"/>
so am I the rather Confirm'd in my Opinion, of the little <hi>Probability</hi> there is, of any <hi>Good</hi> to be yet done, by a <hi>Convocation,</hi> in this respect; that amidst all the <hi>Reasons</hi> Offer'd by this <hi>Author,</hi> to prove the necessity of hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Convocation,</hi> He has never Once given any <hi>Intimation</hi> of these <hi>matters:</hi> tho he could not but know that they <note place="margin">See the <hi>King's Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to the last <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</hi>
                     </note> were look'd upon by the <hi>Government,</hi> as the principal things for which a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> might be wanting.</p>
                  <p>But (5thly.) And to have done: As <note place="margin">§. 10.</note> there are many <hi>Cases</hi> for which it would be improper to call a <hi>Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> so may there be some <hi>Times</hi> too, in which it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ould be altogether <hi>Unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visable</hi> to <hi>Assemble</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>When Mens <hi>Passions</hi> are let loose, and their <hi>Minds</hi> disorder'd: When their <hi>Interests,</hi> and <hi>Designs;</hi> their <hi>Friends</hi> and their <hi>Parties;</hi> nay, their very <hi>Judgments,</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> lead them <hi>different Ways;</hi> and they Agree in nothing so much, as in being very <hi>Pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish,</hi> and <hi>Angry,</hi> with One Another: When their very <hi>Reason</hi> is depraved; and they judge not according to <hi>Truth,</hi> or <hi>Evidence,</hi> but with <hi>Respect</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now this He pretends to make out by these [2] Ways.</p>
                  <p>[1st.] By Proving that there is, upon many Accounts, an Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>necessity,</hi> that something should be done for the <hi>Defence</hi> of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi> And</p>
                  <p>[2dly.] By shewing, That what is thus <hi>necessary</hi> to be done, can be done no Other Way, but by a <hi>Convocation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>[1st.] That something is necessary <note place="margin">§. 12. <hi>latter.</hi> p. 2.</note> to be done; He proves, from the <q>
                        <hi>Open Looseness</hi> of Mens <hi>Principles,</hi> and <hi>Practises:</hi> and that setled <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> which


<pb n="319" facs="tcp:43857:187"/>
(He says) has prevail'd every where.</q> And upon this <hi>General Ground,</hi> he go's on to dilate, in several <hi>Particulars;</hi> which must therefore he Consider'd by Us.</p>
                  <p>But before I proceed any farther in this Debate, I must here, once for all, profess, that I should be far from Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing any thing that could reasonably be proposed to be done, in Order to so Good an <hi>End,</hi> as the <hi>Reforming the Open Loosness of Mens Principles,</hi> and <hi>Practises,</hi> would certainly be. I am by no means Unsensible that a Great Part of what this <hi>Author</hi> here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, is but too true: Tho' whether the <hi>Loosness</hi> of Mens <hi>Principles,</hi> has <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi> their <hi>Manners;</hi> or the <hi>Depravity</hi> of their <hi>Manners,</hi> may not rather have been, at the bottom, one great <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>Corruption</hi> of their <hi>Principles,</hi> I am not able to determine. And were a <hi>Convocation</hi> necessary to Vindicate the <hi>Church</hi> from being, in any degree, acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to these <hi>Crimes;</hi> or had it <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> sufficient to <hi>Reform</hi> this <hi>Licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> I would much rather joyn with this <hi>Author</hi> in <hi>Petitioning</hi> for their <hi>Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> than Contend with Him about the <hi>Expediency</hi> of it. But being fully


<pb n="320" facs="tcp:43857:188"/>
Satisfied that the <hi>Convocation</hi> has <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Strength sufficient to Grapple with these Enormities; nor is in any respect necessary, to assert the <hi>Churches</hi> Innocence; But especially, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, that should it meet, for any such purpose, under our present Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, it would only expose its Own <hi>Authority,</hi> and our <hi>Religion,</hi> to the Greater Contempt of <hi>Profane,</hi> and <hi>Wicked Men:</hi> I shall proceed with all freedom to Examine the <hi>Reasons</hi> here alledged; and to Vindicate not only the <hi>King</hi>'s Honour, but the <hi>Churches</hi> too; and shew, that if the <hi>Other Ways,</hi> which this <hi>Author</hi> here Rejects, be not sufficient to <hi>Reclaim</hi> Mens <hi>Vices,</hi> neither can it be hoped that the <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> should be able, by any Orders it can make, to <hi>Reclaim</hi> Them.</p>
                  <p>First then: Let us suppose that (as he alledges) <hi>Scepticism, Deism,</hi> and <note place="margin">§. 13.</note> even <hi>Atheism</hi> its self, is pouring in upon Us, Would this <hi>Gentleman</hi> have a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> called to declare, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> not only <hi>Believes</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> but in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> too? Has <hi>Christ</hi> been thus long <hi>preach'd</hi> among Us, to leave it still in


<pb n="321" facs="tcp:43857:188"/>
doubt, whether, after all, our <hi>Church,</hi> be a <hi>Christian Church,</hi> or No? If neither our Constant <hi>Confession</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Christ,</hi> nor our <hi>publick Worship</hi> of <hi>Him,</hi> and of the <hi>Father</hi> by <hi>Him;</hi> If neither our <hi>publick Preaching,</hi> nor our <hi>publick Writing,</hi> in Vindication of this <hi>Faith;</hi> neither what our <hi>Convocations</hi> have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declared, and we all continue to support, and defend; be sufficient to satisfie Mankind, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> condemns all <hi>Atheism,</hi> and <hi>Deism;</hi> and that However such Persons may Live among Us, yet they are by no means Countenanced or Approved by Her; I cannot imagine, What this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> thinks a new <hi>Convocation</hi> could do more, to Assert her Innocence.</p>
                  <p>And the same, I must answer, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> to the Plea next offer'd, from the Open Appearance of <hi>Socinianism</hi> among Us, and the <hi>Opposition</hi> that is made, by some Men, to the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> For let it be confess'd to be some Scandal to our <hi>Country,</hi> as indeed it seems to be; that such <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness</hi> should be suffer'd to Go on, without controul, in a <hi>Christian King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> where the <hi>Gospel</hi> is, perhaps, the


<pb n="322" facs="tcp:43857:189"/>
best <hi>understood,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> the most carefully <hi>Reform'd,</hi> of any in the World. Yet what has our <hi>Church</hi> to answer for in this Case? Complain she may, that she is suffered to be thus Torn in pieces, between presumptuous <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> on the one hand, and profane <hi>Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers</hi> on the other. But sure this ought not to be added to the Rest of her Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, to have her Own Faith, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, call'd in Question.</p>
                  <p>Nay, the very <hi>Socinians</hi> themselves, whilst they abuse her in Other respects, by their so doing, justifie her in This. They know, and confess her <hi>Faith,</hi> to be Against them: And for this cause it is that they Rail so despightfully at her. And sure We ought not, our selves, to lay that to Her Charge, from which her Greatest Enemies acquit her.</p>
                  <p>In short; Our <hi>Articles,</hi> our <hi>Creeds,</hi> Our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> our <hi>Homilies;</hi> All bear witness to the <hi>Catholick Faith,</hi> in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to these <hi>Hereticks.</hi> Our <hi>Sermons,</hi> and our <hi>Writings,</hi> declare against Them. And what can any, <hi>Abroad,</hi> or at <hi>Home,</hi> desire, either the <hi>Church,</hi> or Her <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> should do more? Or what more could a <hi>Convocation,</hi> were it to meet to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow, Do?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:43857:189"/>
As for the next Particular, which he <note place="margin">§. 15. <hi>Letter.</hi> p. 3.</note> insists upon, Thirdly; concerning the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> and of the <hi>Church,</hi> which (he tells us) is struck at; and that <hi>Indifference of All Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which (he says) is endeavour'd to be Establish'd, by Pleas for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and Necessity, of an <hi>universal, unlimited Toleration;</hi> even against the Sense of the Whole <hi>Legislature;</hi> I shall say but very little. If such a <hi>Toleration</hi> be so dangerous, as this <hi>Author</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends, and as, for ought I know, it may be; And the <hi>Magistrate</hi> has the same Opinion of it; It is to be hoped the <hi>Government</hi> will take care to secure its self, by a constant Denyal of it. And establish'd I am sure it cannot be, <hi>against</hi> the <hi>consent</hi> of the <hi>Whole Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> nor indeed without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>every Part</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>But however, what can a <hi>Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> do in this Case? Whether the <hi>Civil Power</hi> shall think fit to <hi>Grant,</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse,</hi> such a <hi>Toleration;</hi> is a <hi>Political,</hi> as well as an <hi>Ecclesiastical Question:</hi> And the <hi>Government</hi> will <hi>Act,</hi> as it thinks fit, in it; and a <hi>Convocation</hi> can neither <hi>help,</hi> nor <hi>hinder</hi> their Proceedings. What


<pb n="324" facs="tcp:43857:190"/>
the Opinion of our <hi>Clergy</hi> is, as to this matter, is well known: And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there is no need of a <hi>Synod</hi> to meet, to shew that their <hi>Sense</hi> is the same in <hi>Convocation,</hi> that it is out of it. And those very <hi>Pleas,</hi> which he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to, have had their <hi>Answers;</hi> which if they do nothing else, yet certainly thus much must be allow'd to Them, that they shew the Opinion of the <hi>Churches</hi> Friends, to be the same, that it ever was, in this Particular.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto therefore I do not see what <note place="margin">§. 16.</note> need there is of a <hi>Convocation,</hi> or what it could do to make things better than They are. But now we come to the killing Consideration; and by which, we are to be for ever silenced: For, Fourthly, All these things have been countenanced by <hi>Members</hi> of our <hi>Own Church;</hi> nay by some of the <hi>Clearical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> And this has given great <hi>Scandal</hi> to the <hi>Churches</hi> abroad; and to Remove this <hi>Scandal,</hi> and to Animadvert upon these <hi>Men,</hi> a <hi>Convocation</hi> ought to be suffer'd to <hi>Meet,</hi> and <hi>Act.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The truth is, it is a Tragical Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which our <hi>Author</hi> gives us of this Matter; and of which I shall only say,


<pb n="325" facs="tcp:43857:190"/>
that I hope it is not true. I will set it down in his Own Words. <q>
                        <hi>Indeed, to</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Letter</hi> p. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>be plain, there seems to be an Universal</hi> Conspiracy <hi>amongst a Sort of Men, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Stile of</hi> Deists, Socinians, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinarians, Denyers <hi>of</hi> Mysteries, <hi>and</hi> Pretending Explainers <hi>of them; to undermine, and overthrow the</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith. <hi>There seems too much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to fear, there is no</hi> Order, Degree, <hi>nor</hi> Place <hi>among us, wholly free from the</hi> Infection. <hi>And a</hi> Convocation, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly Meeting, and Acting freely,</hi>
                     </q> (that is, according to this <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s Notion, Meeting with every <hi>Session</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and left to its <hi>Liberty</hi> to do whatever it pleases without Check, <q>or <hi>Controul) is the Greatest Fence against these Mischiefs, and the most proper Instrument to Apply a Remedy.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether a <hi>Convocation</hi> be the most <hi>proper Instrument</hi> to <hi>Apply a Remedy to these Mischiefs,</hi> we shall enquire by and by: But I must needs say, That should a <hi>Convocation</hi> be allow'd to <hi>Meet</hi> so <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly,</hi> and to <hi>Act</hi> so <hi>'freely,</hi> as some Men desire; I fear it would soon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the <hi>Remedy</hi> was <hi>worse</hi> than the <hi>Disease.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="326" facs="tcp:43857:191"/>
But what Proof do's he bring of this Odious <hi>Conspiracy,</hi> as far as the <hi>Church</hi> is concern'd in it? For as for <hi>Deists, Atheists,</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> openly acting, and professing themselves such; I hope he would not have the <hi>Church</hi> to answer for their <hi>Profaneness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why first, he tells us, there is one ingenious <hi>Author,</hi> who <hi>has cunningly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Letter, p. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>and exposed, under pretence of Explaining, the Mosaic History.</hi> There is another, in great <hi>Dignity,</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment,</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> who has <hi>Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stically opposed the</hi> Unity <hi>of the</hi> Godhead, <hi>under pretence of Writing in Vindication of the</hi> Holy, <hi>and</hi> Ever-blessed Trinity. And a third, has set out a <hi>Discourse, concerning the Divinity, and Death of Christ, which he is not satisfied with.</hi> Two <hi>Tracts</hi> more there are, which, to encrease the <hi>Churches</hi> Guilt, he brings into this Number; The One concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the Reasonableness of Christianity;</hi> the Other against the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of it. I wonder he did not add, the <hi>Notes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Athanasius;</hi> and the three <hi>Collections</hi> of <hi>Socinian Tracts;</hi> and for All which, he might as well have call'd the <hi>Church</hi> to answer, as for <hi>These.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="327" facs="tcp:43857:191"/>
And is this, at last, all the Ground he has, upon which so tragically to lay about him; as if the Greater Part of our <hi>Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> were become downright <hi>Atheists, Deists, Socinians,</hi> and I know not what Monsters of <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism</hi> and <hi>Infidelity?</hi> Will such a scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Induction</hi> suffice, to vindicate him either to <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>World,</hi> for those barbarous <hi>Suggestions,</hi> by which He has appeal'd to Both, against Us?</p>
                  <p>What he has to object against the last of those <hi>Books,</hi> we are conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n'd with, I cannot tell; and therefore must be excused, if I make no <hi>Apology</hi> for it. As for the second, the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blessed Trinity,</hi> let us suppose that the Learned <hi>Author</hi> of it, has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced such an <hi>Explication</hi> of that <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> as being Critically examined, may fall under the Inconveniencies so warmly Alledged against it: Nay from whence <hi>Tritheism</hi> not only may <hi>possibly</hi> be <hi>Inferr'd,</hi> but <hi>necessarily must follow.</hi> And that is as much as his most Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Adversary can desire.</p>
                  <p>Is Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> convinced that this can <hi>justly</hi> be <hi>inferr'd;</hi> much more, do's he believe, that this must <hi>necessarily</hi> be the <hi>Consequence</hi> of his <hi>Hypothesis?</hi> This


<pb n="328" facs="tcp:43857:192"/>
                     <hi>Gentleman,</hi> in his own Conscience, knows the contrary: And that that Learned Man as much abhors the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Tritheism,</hi> as the <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> himself can do; And would as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily joyn in an <hi>Anathema</hi> against those who Assert it.</p>
                  <p>But what is there then, in this case, for a <hi>Convocation</hi> to do? Why, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he would have that Learned Body joyn hands with the <hi>Animadverter;</hi> and pronounce his <hi>Explication</hi> of the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> to be <hi>Heretical.</hi> And then, either <hi>Dr. Sherlock</hi> must recant it; or he may be try'd by them for <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</hi> I find 'tis very happy for the <hi>Dean,</hi> that the <hi>Old Writ, de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Well, but what if in the <hi>Convocation</hi> some such dull Men should be found; as 'tis plain there still are out of it; who after all that either the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter</hi> has <hi>written,</hi> or the <hi>University de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed;</hi> do not believe the Doctrine of <hi>Tritheism</hi> to be so necessarily consequent upon his <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> as to warrant them to Judge it to be <hi>Heretical?</hi> What if


<pb n="329" facs="tcp:43857:192"/>
there should be some Others, who tho' no Friends to the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> should yet have so much Charity for the <hi>Dean;</hi> as to be unwilling to fall so severely upon him, as some warm Men would have them do? In short; What if a yet Greater Number of Others should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, who tho' they neither favour the <hi>Dean,</hi> nor are Friends to his <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> may yet look upon him to have meant well: and to deserve some consideration for his former Services: Who may think it unsafe for the <hi>Church</hi> to declare it self in favour of One Man's <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> or against anothers: Who may cry out as loudly against some, for being <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellians,</hi> as an Opposite Sort have done against Others, as <hi>Tritheists?</hi> Or lastly; who may conceive the best way to be, to take the <hi>King</hi>'s Example; and to be content to Reduce all Parties to the Old, Received <hi>Terms:</hi> And thereby, at once, both secure the <hi>Church</hi> against any farther Mischief; and softly Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure those who have departed from Them?</p>
                  <p>In all these Cases, it is evident that the <hi>Convocation</hi> may be very likely to fly into <hi>Heats,</hi> and <hi>Parties;</hi> and after much Contention, nothing to be done:


<pb n="330" facs="tcp:43857:193"/>
And then the <hi>Enemies</hi> without will smile, and tell the World, that when it came to the tryal, the <hi>Convocation</hi> it self could not Agree about this Matter; and from thence draw an untoward <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,</hi> against the very <hi>Doctrine</hi> it self.</p>
                  <p>For my Own Part, I am neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by my Opinion to support <hi>Dr. Sherlock</hi>'s Explication; nor will I ever become an Advocate for any Man, to the publick Detriment of the <hi>Church,</hi> or its <hi>Doctrine.</hi> But as I am perswaded he had no <hi>Heretical Design,</hi> nor is, knowingly, involved in any <hi>Tritheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Opinion;</hi> so I cannot but think it very hard that He should be forced to <hi>believe</hi> a <hi>Plurality</hi> of <hi>Gods,</hi> whether he do's believe any such <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or no. And if to Err in such a matter as this, or not to see all the possible <hi>Consequences</hi> of an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> in so abstruse a Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, be a Crime; I am afraid it will be hard for any of Us, to be Altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Innocent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Other, <hi>Remaining Author,</hi> I shall say but very little: Let his Crime be what it will, yet it must be allow'd, that there are Other Ways of calling him to an account for it, than by a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation;</hi>


                     <pb n="331" facs="tcp:43857:193"/>
and therefore that this can be no Ground to Prove the necessity of their <hi>Meeting.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>And thus have I consider'd those <hi>Evils,</hi> from whence this <hi>Author</hi> has endeavour'd to shew, that it is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>necessary,</hi> a <hi>Convocation</hi> should be call'd for the <hi>Redress</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>I go on</p>
                  <p>[2dly.] To Examine, what He has Offer'd to prove, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a <hi>Convocation</hi> can do it.</p>
                  <p>And: 1st. The <hi>Bishops,</hi> He says, <note place="margin">§. 18. <hi>Letter</hi> p. 9.</note> cannot safely proceed in Matters of <hi>Heresie,</hi> because of the <hi>Danger</hi> they may Incurr thereby. But this is an <hi>Argument,</hi> that either really proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; or, if it do's, will prove more than He desires it should: It being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the <hi>Convocation</hi> can no more <hi>declare Heresie,</hi> or proceed any farther in the <hi>Punishment</hi> of it, than any Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle <hi>Bishop,</hi> by Law, may do. What


<pb n="335" facs="tcp:43857:195"/>
is, by our <hi>Law,</hi> to be accounted <hi>Heresie,</hi> the Stat. of 1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. has declared. And tho' that <hi>Statute</hi> particularly Referrs to the <hi>High Commissioners;</hi> yet is it, by Construction, a Safe <hi>Rule</hi> for all Others to proceed by. As for the <hi>Punishment</hi> of it, I do not find it, in the least, doubted, but that a <hi>Bishop</hi> may proceed by <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures,</hi> against <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:</hi> And certain it is, that now they can Go no farther. So that here then there is no such mighty Danger; unless for those who would make more to be <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,</hi> than the <hi>Law</hi> has <hi>declared</hi> so to be. And if that be the <hi>Danger</hi> this <hi>Author</hi> speaks of, I believe all Wise, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Men, will desire, that they may be always lyable to it. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as I before observed; be the Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard what it will, the <hi>Convocation</hi> is subject to the same Limitations, that every single <hi>Bishop</hi> lies under: And the <hi>One,</hi> if they are too busie, may as easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run into a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> as the <hi>Other.</hi>

But here our <hi>Author</hi> opens himself, and gives us a broad Hint, what it is He wants. He would have the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,</hi> or rather, the <hi>Convocation,</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd to determine what they please, to be <hi>Heretical:</hi> And when they have done so, to proceed against their <hi>Own Members,</hi> it not against Others, accordingly. By Vertue of this <hi>Power,</hi> whatsoever <hi>Books</hi> were publish'd by Men, whom they did not like, should be <hi>censured;</hi> and <hi>executed</hi> as <hi>Heretical;</hi> and the <hi>Authors</hi> be obliged to a <hi>Retracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Them. And I am sometimes afraid, this <hi>Gentleman</hi> do's really fancy the <hi>Convocation</hi> to have a certain Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, Inherent Right, in it, so to do.</p>
                  <p>Should this be so, and should there chance to be any considerable Number of his <hi>Convocation Friends</hi> of the same Opinion; I shall onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> say, 'tis Happy for Them that they are not permitted to come together: For certainly they would quickly undo themselves, if they were. It can hardly be doubted, but that, upon this Supposition, one of the first things these Members would do, would be to fall soul upon <hi>Dr. Sherlock</hi> as an <hi>Heretick.</hi> Now let us only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose


<pb n="338" facs="tcp:43857:197"/>
the <hi>Dean</hi> to have as much <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> for <hi>himself,</hi> and <hi>Regard</hi> to his Own <hi>Reputation,</hi> as we see the Men of the last Age had: And that he should thereupon take the same Course, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himself, that <hi>Dr. Standish</hi> before did. Who can tell what the Opinion of the <hi>Temporal</hi> Judges in such a <hi>Case</hi> might be? Or what they might make of their proceeding? And tho' <hi>King Henry</hi> the 8th let the Matter fall, and took no farther notice of it, yet should they now be deem'd to have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len under a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> by such an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; who will ensure them that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Prince</hi> shall not take the <hi>Advantage</hi> of it?</p>
                  <p>But, indeed, tho' when Men are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to maintain an <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> 'tis no great matter what they affirm; and, in such a Case, his <hi>Majesty's Authority</hi> may seem nothing to them: yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine, what a <hi>Convocation</hi> can do, that the <hi>King</hi> may not as well, and much more safely, do, in these Matters. He can <hi>Forbid</hi> some Men to affect <hi>new Terms;</hi> Can <hi>discourage</hi> Others, who advance new <hi>Theories,</hi> to the detriment of the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> He can publish <hi>Rules</hi>

for the <hi>Preaching</hi> of Some; and <hi>Orders</hi> to <hi>Reform</hi> the <hi>Vices</hi> of Others. But, indeed, he cannot by <hi>all</hi> this, or by any thing else that He can do, <hi>Oblige</hi> some Men: And therefore ought the less to be blamed, if he do's not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himself to Go out of his Way, to gratifie their <hi>peevish,</hi> and <hi>unreasonable Desires.</hi>

                  <p>But why may not the <hi>Parliament</hi> be as well Qualified to put a Stop to the <hi>Loosness,</hi> or rather the <hi>Licentiousness,</hi> of our present Times, as the <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> That hitherto they have not <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 14.</note> done it, is no Argument that they are either <hi>Unfit</hi> for, or <hi>Uncapable</hi> of doing it.

                     <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 15</note> may be a Good <hi>Argument</hi> to prove, that they are not so well provided to <hi>dispute</hi> with <hi>Hereticks,</hi> as a <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

may be; but do's by no means hinder, but that they may be Able to take a much more <hi>Effectaul Way</hi> of deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Them. And I have before shewn, that to enable them to know what is <hi>Heretical,</hi> it is by no means <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Letter</hi> p. 15.</note> necessary, that they should be <hi>nicely Skill'd</hi> in the <hi>Languages</hi> of the <hi>Bible;</hi> much less that they should be <hi>Masters</hi> of all the <hi>Learned Fathers,</hi> or of the <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi> Let them stick to the <hi>Rule</hi> already Estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd by <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Parliament;</hi> 1 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1.

for their Purpose.

Execution; I say, supposing such an <hi>Act</hi> were <hi>pass'd,</hi> let this <hi>Author</hi> judge, whether it would not be much more likely to put a Stop to the Presumption of such Persons, than ten thousand <hi>Canons</hi> made by the <hi>Convocation;</hi> tho' an <hi>Anathema</hi> were added to every one of them.</p>
                  <p>And now our <hi>Author</hi> has but one thing more to do, and then He thinks <note place="margin">§. 22.</note> he has clear'd his <hi>Point</hi> beyond all Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; and that is, to Obviate an <hi>Objection,</hi> which I perceive gives him some little Disturbance: And that is, <note place="margin">

and must be left to Time to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, when this <hi>Great Assembly</hi> shall be met, and these <hi>Persons</hi> be call'd to an account by them.

                  <p>To conclude then; It is confess'd <note place="margin">§. 23.</note> that the <hi>Evils</hi> which this <hi>Gentleman</hi> here complains of, are certainly very <hi>Great;</hi> and it were much to be wish'd, that some <hi>Remedy</hi> might be thought of, that would effectually deliver us from them.

                  <hi>Reasoning</hi> of this <hi>Author;</hi> and, I hope, given a sufficient Answer, to Every Thing that can pretend to such a Character in his <hi>Letter.</hi> It may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be expected, that I should now take some Notice of those <hi>Reflections</hi> which he has made, with a more than Ordinary Freedom, upon <hi>all sorts</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi> and upon none more than upon Those, who might have expected to have the least fallen under the <hi>Levities,</hi> and <hi>Scurrilities</hi> of such a Piece.</p>
               <p>But this is a Work of too ungrateful a Nature to be particularly pursu'd: And I am sensible, that in doing of it, I must either say very much less, than He has taken care to deserve; Or very much more, than I am willing to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my self to do.</p>
               <p>It is, indeed, very sad to consider, what an Immoderate <hi>Liberty</hi> some Men indulge Themselves, on these Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. With what Readiness, nay with what Satisfaction, they catch at any


<pb n="346" facs="tcp:43857:201"/>
thing that is scandalous; and may help to blacken Those, whom they do not Love. And if they can but give it a <hi>Witty Turn;</hi> or pass it off with a <hi>Little Grace,</hi> as if they were <hi>sorry</hi> to <hi>speak</hi> it; or <hi>unwilling</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> it; (tho' all the while it is apparent, that, by that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Insinuation,</hi> they hope to make it stick the more) they think they have done their Business: They have Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves against being called to account for it by <hi>Men;</hi> and, I am Afraid, they never once think, what <hi>Account</hi> they must give for it to <hi>God.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It would be endless for me to insist <note place="margin">§. 26.</note> upon these and the like Reflections, which He seems industriously to have catcht at, in every Part of his <hi>Letter.</hi> I shall instead of all, examine the <hi>Story</hi> with which he concludes it, and so take my Leave of Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There was,</hi> says He, <hi>a Time, when the</hi>

                     <hi>Letter</hi> p. 67,</note> Clergy <hi>was deem'd</hi> Publick Enemies, <hi>and</hi> us'd as such; <hi>(viz. in the Reign of</hi> Edw. 1.) <hi>but it was upon a very Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Account; because they Asserted the</hi> Laws <hi>of the</hi> Realm. <hi>The</hi> King, <hi>at that


<pb n="348" facs="tcp:43857:202"/>
Time, did by Commission, against the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Laws and Customs of the Kingdom, pretend to collect Money, without the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of Parliament; not from the Clergy only, but from the Earls, Barons and Commonalty of the Realm. The</hi> Latter <hi>did, too many of them, submit; the</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy <hi>stoutly Resisted it: So that Sir</hi> Robert Brabazon, <hi>the</hi> King'<hi>s</hi> Chief Justice, <hi>pronounced openly in the</hi> King'<hi>s</hi> Bench, <hi>(in terrorem) that from thenceforth no Justice should be done at their Suit; and that Justice should be done against Them in the King's Courts, at any Man's Suit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This Passage I mark'd, when I first read the</hi> Institutes, <hi>as a very extraordinary one:</hi> ('tis pag. 529. 2 Inst) <hi>I suppose you will think it so too, and that</hi> England <hi>was then bless'd with a</hi> Righteous Chief Justice.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Fable;</hi> and the <hi>Moral</hi> of <note place="margin">§. 27.</note> it is not difficult. King <hi>William,</hi> is the <hi>Edward</hi> here meant: The present <hi>Clergy,</hi> are, like those here mention'd, <hi>deem'd Publick Enemies;</hi> but upon a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Honourable Account,</hi> because they <hi>Assert</hi> the <hi>Laws of the Realm;</hi> that is, stand up for <hi>Another Interest,</hi> and are <hi>Enemies</hi> to the <hi>Present Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:43857:202"/>
For this, they are not only <hi>Deem'd Publick Enemies,</hi> but are <hi>Used as such.</hi> Some of them have been turn'd out of their Preferments; Others have been Discountenanced, and not Preferr'd, according to their Deserts: because they also have <hi>Honourably</hi> stood up for the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Realm,</hi> that is, for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Interest; tho' they have again and again <hi>sworn</hi> Obedience to the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Government;</hi> and some of them (tho' sore against their Wills) even <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed</hi> the <hi>Association,</hi> in <hi>Defence</hi> of it: To say nothing of Others, who were the most <hi>forward</hi> and <hi>busie,</hi> of any in the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to help on the <hi>Revolution:</hi> and to establish that <hi>Government</hi> they now dislike.</p>
               <p>And this they have done at the same time that the <hi>Laity</hi> have, too many of them, <hi>submitted:</hi> And will, I hope, shew that they are Able to <hi>defend</hi> the <hi>Government</hi> which they have establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, against all the <hi>Enemies</hi> of it; tho' they are never so much <hi>censured</hi> and <hi>reviled,</hi> by these new <hi>Patriots,</hi> for their so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>
               <p>

Having thus accounted for this <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>

               <p>Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the VIIIth. being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to advance the <hi>Liberties</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> had, the Year before, publish'd a <hi>Constitution,</hi> by which he sorbad the <hi>Clergy</hi> to <hi>pay</hi> any <hi>Taxes</hi> to their <hi>Prince,</hi>

               <p>The <hi>King,</hi> tho' he were sufficiently sensible of their jugling, and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at it; nevertheless gave them time, till the next <hi>Parliament,</hi> to consider what they had to do; and how to make some <hi>better,</hi> and more <hi>satisfactory An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer</hi> to Him.

               <p>The next <hi>Parliament</hi> being met at <hi>London,</hi> the Day after <hi>Hilary;</hi> the <hi>King</hi> again demands a Supply of them. They persist in their Denyal; and the <hi>King</hi> thereupon puts them out of his <note place="margin">

In this State the <hi>Clergy</hi> were, when the Lord <hi>Chief Justice</hi> (as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> says, Sir <hi>Robert Brabazon,</hi> who was then <hi>Chief Justice,</hi> not of the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> but of the <hi>Common-pleas:)</hi> declared to the <hi>Attorneys</hi> of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> what the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Henr. Knyght. <hi>Col.</hi> 2491.</note> had done. He bade them acquaint their Masters, That from thenceforth no <hi>Justice</hi> could be done for them in the <hi>King's Court,</hi> tho' they should be never so much <hi>injured;</hi> but that <hi>Justice</hi> might be had against Them, by any who had need, and would move it to the <hi>Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this was no more than decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to them how the <hi>Law</hi> then stood, and still is, in the like <hi>Cases:</hi> And in which it is Agreed, that <hi>Men</hi> Attaint, <note place="margin">Novs Rep. Hastings and Blakes <hi>Case.</hi>

                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:43857:204"/>
which is not wont to be accounted a <hi>Crime</hi> in such <hi>Persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, there is hardly a Man of those Times, upon whom this <hi>Author</hi> could more unluckily have Reflected, than this <hi>Sir Robert Brabazon.</hi> He was made <hi>Second Justice</hi> of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas,</hi> by <hi>King Edward</hi> 1st. about the 18th Year of his <hi>Reign.</hi> Seven Years he served his <hi>Prince</hi> in that <hi>Station,</hi> and was then, for his Merits, created <hi>Lord Chief Justice</hi> of that <hi>Court: Anno 24. Edw.</hi> 1. In the first Year of his Son King <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. He was sworn anew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Place: And about Seven Years after, had the Care of the <hi>Treasury</hi> committed to him, till a <hi>Lord Treasurer</hi> should be chosen, which was done about a Year after. And being thus Grown Old in the Service of his two <hi>Masters,</hi> and disabled to attend any Longer at his <hi>Court;</hi> that he might sit down with Honour, He was, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of his Great Fidelity, chosen into the <hi>King's Council,</hi> and in that Quality, ended his Life.</p>
               <p>This is the Man, whom this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet <hi>Author</hi> has endeavour'd to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatter; and this was the Crime, for which he so tragically exclaims against Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:43857:205"/>
And now, upon the whole matter, let this <hi>Gentleman</hi> freely say, What he has to except against, in the Conduct of this Great <hi>Prince?</hi> Or whether, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a true State of this Matter, He will espouse the Cause of the <hi>Archbishop</hi> and <hi>Clergy?</hi> Here is a brave, and war-like <hi>Prince,</hi> engaged in a War of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Consequence, to his <hi>Country</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> He carrys it on, himself, with Vigor, and ends it with Glory. He forces his Enemy, not only to yield to Him; but to <hi>Own</hi> his <hi>Authority,</hi> and do him <hi>Homage.</hi> Being Return'd with Victory, He calls his <hi>Parliament;</hi> and is Readily assisted by his <hi>Lay</hi> Subjects to <hi>pay</hi> his <hi>Debts,</hi> and prepare himself against his Other <hi>Enemies.</hi> Only his <hi>Clergy,</hi> not only Refuse to <hi>contribute</hi> to the <hi>Defence</hi> of their <hi>Country,</hi> but put an Indignity, of the basest Nature, upon their <hi>King.</hi> Like the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> with their <hi>Vow</hi> of <hi>Corban;</hi> they first procure the <hi>Pope</hi> to pass an <hi>Order</hi> against their <hi>assisting</hi> of Him, and then, (with a <hi>Jewish Hypocrisie)</hi> look demure, and pretend: That truly they would <hi>Assist</hi> him, with all their Hearts, but the <hi>Pope</hi> has forbidden it, And they dare not do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:43857:205"/>
In return to this Usage, the <hi>King</hi> determines no longer to afford his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi> to those, who had deliver'd themselves up to <hi>Another Interest;</hi> and thereupon refused to contribute any thing to the Support of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> by which they were secured in the peaceable Enjoyment of their Own <hi>Rights,</hi> and <hi>Estates.</hi> And the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thought his Resolution so just, that they closed in with it; and readily confirm'd it with their <hi>Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Case of the whole <hi>Clergy</hi> then; and it is but too like the Case of some of them Now. And the Effect was, that being, by this means, brought to a Sense of their <hi>Duty;</hi> the greatest Part of them presently <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> to the <hi>King;</hi> and All, the next Year, granted a <hi>Supply</hi> to Him: And have thereby left us this Observation, That <hi>the only way to deal with some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, is to treat them as they deserve: And to let them know, that those are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the Protection of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who are Embark'd in an Interest different from it; and Refuse to Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Necessities of it.</hi>
