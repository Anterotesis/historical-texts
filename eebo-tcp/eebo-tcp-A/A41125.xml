            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

doth plainely ſhew what miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and diſtreſſes ſinne is the
cauſe of. Now this people of
the Jewes, becauſe of their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries,
their contempt of Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
their ſlighting and miſuſing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
&amp;c. Their Cities were taken, the

they were rebellious: but now they ſought
God a long time; they prayed, but God
would not heare, In ſo much that many
poore ſoules amongſt them were diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt the unſatiableneſſe of it; All the
praiers of this people though they had beene
of many yeares, yet they counted them as
the prayers of one day; in the day that I
called upon thee: They account all their
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62504:11"/>
thouſands of ſupplications and prayers as
one ſuite; never had they done their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
till God did heare them.</p>
            <p>Secondly the ſenſibleneſſe of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
it is able to know whether God doe

            <p>Thirdly, the ſupplyes it hath againſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
dangers and diſcouragements; God ſlings
in comfort into their hearts, giving them
incklings of hope to ſupport them agaynſt
their diſcouragements, thou ſaidſt feare not:
from the firſt of theſe, obſerve</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That an effectuall prayer is an unſatiable
prayer,</hi> A man that prayes effectually, ſets
down this in himſelf as his firſt concluſion
never to ceaſe, nor to give over praying till
he ſpeed: This is the firſt and prime thing
that a godly heart lookes at, as <hi>David</hi> in his
prayers: He begins in this manner, <hi>Heare
my crie O God, attend unto my prayer. Pſal.</hi>
61. 1. So, <hi>Give eare unto my prayer O God,
and hide not thy ſelfe from my ſupplications,</hi>
Pſal. 55. 1. <hi>Hear my voyce O God in my prayer,</hi>
Pſal. 64. 1. As if he ſhould ſay, Lord, now
I come to call upon thee: now that I
come to thee, to begge theſe and theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
that my ſoule wants, I beſeech thee to
heare me: for I am reſolved never to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62504:12"/>
my ſuit, never to give thee reſt, but for
to continue my prayers and ſupplications,
till thou give a gratious anſwer to my ſoul
and heare me.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt and prime thing that the
ſoule looks after, it being the very end of
prayer to be heard; it is not with prayer as
with Oratory; the end of oratory is not to
perſwade, but to ſpeake perſwaſively; for a
man may uſe all the perſwaſions that may
be, and uſe all the perſwaſive arguments
that the wit of man can invent, and ſpeake
as cuttingly, as perſwaſively as may be, and
yet the heart may be ſo intractable as not to
be perſwaded; it is not ſo with prayer.</p>
            <p>The end of prayer is to prevaile with
God. Beloved, there is difference between
the end and office of prayer; the office of
prayer is to pray, the end of prayer is to
prevaile. There is many a man that doth
the office of prayer, and yet never gets the
end of prayer. A man hath never gotten
the end of his prayers, till he hath gotten
that he prayed for. It is not with prayer as
with a Phyſician, that may give the beſt
phyſick under heaven, and yet the Patient
may die under his hands; and therefore one
gives counſell that a Phyſician never med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with a deſperate man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62504:12"/>
But if the ſoule be an effectuall ſuitor with
God, it can never faile of its ſuite, becauſe
it is an unſatiable Suitor, that never leaves
his prayer till it terminates the end of it. I
cried unto the Lord with my voice, and he
heard me out of his holy hill. <hi>Selah. Jerom</hi>
tranſlates it for ever. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3. 4. never doth
a child of God pray, but he prayeth ſo as
that his praier and Gods eare may be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together; I cried unto the Lord, and the
Lord heard me: This alſo ſheweth how the
Prophet cried and praied, namely ſo as his
crying and Gods hearing were coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
But ſome may object,<note place="margin">Object.</note> How can a
man be unſatiable in his praiers til he ſpeed?
muſt a man be alwaies a praying? God calls
men to other duties of his worſhippe, and of
his owne particular calling; after morning I
muſt have done till noone, after noone I
muſt have done till night: whether God
heare me or no, muſt I be alwaies a praying
till I ſpeed? then I ſhould doe nothing elſe
but pray; how then are we to continue our
praiers till God heare us, and give the grace
that we pray for? to this I anſwer.</p>
            <p>A man muſt give over the words and<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
times of prayer for other duties, but a man
muſt not give over the ſuite of prayer. A
poore begger comes to a houſekeepers gate
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62504:13"/>
and begs, but none heares him; now he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a poore man, hath ſomething elſe to doe,
and therefore he ſits downe or ſtands and
knits or patches, and then he begs or knocks,
and then to his work again; though he do not
alwaies continue knocking or begging, yet he
alwaies continues his ſuite: O that my ſuite
might be granted me, or that I might have
an almes here; ſo when the ſoul is begging
of any grace, though it doth not alwaies
continue the words of praier, yet it alwaies
continues the ſuite of praier. <hi>David he would
dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever. Pſal.</hi>
23. 6. A wicked man it may be will turne
into Gods houſe and ſay a prayer, &amp;c. but
the Prophet would (and ſo all godly men
muſt) dwell there for ever; his ſoule lyeth
alwaies at the throne of grace begging for
grace. A wicked man he prayeth as the cock
croweth; the cocke crowes and ceaſeth, and
crowes again and ceaſeth again; and thinkes
not of crowing til he crowes again: ſo a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
man praies and ceaſeth, prayes and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
againe; his minde is never buſied to
thinke whether his prayers ſpeede or no;
he thinkes it is good Religion for him to
pray, and therefore he takes that for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that his praiers ſpeede, though in very
deed God never heares his praiers, nor no
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62504:13"/>
more reſpects it, then he reſpects the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Oxen, or the gruntling of hoggs: he
is found in his prayers as the wilde Aſſe in
her months: <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. The wilde Aſſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of her ſwiftneſſe cannot be taken but in
her months, ſhe hath a ſleepy month, and all
that while ſhe is ſo ſleepy and dumpiſh that
any man may take her; in her months you
ſhall finde her; ſo a wicked man hath his
prayer monthes, his praier fits: it may be in
the morning, or in the evening, or day of
his affliction and miſery you ſhall have him
at his prayers, at his prayer fits then you
ſhall finde him at it, but otherwiſe his mind
is about other matters. But the childe of
God what ever he ailes, he goes with his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
preſently to the throne of grace, and
there he never removes till he hath it grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, as here we ſee the prayers of the
Church conſiſting of many yeares, yet are
counted but one ſuite; try therefore and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin
whether thy praiers be unſatiable prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
yea or no; and for helpe herein take theſe
markes; firſt if thy prayers be unſatiable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
praiers, then it is a begging praier; thou prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
as if thou hadſt never praied before, as
if thou hadſt never begun to pray, and thou
never thinkeſt that thou haſt done any thing
till thou haſt done the deede. As a hungrie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62504:14"/>
man eates as if he had never eate before, ſo
the unſatiable ſoule praies as if he had never
prayed before, till he hath obtained that he
hath praied for; but a wicked man he praies
not thus. <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaking of carnal profeſſors, <hi>Iob
27. 10. Will he call upon God at all times?</hi> ſeeſt
thou a wicked man go to a good duty, go to
praier, do you think that he wil hold out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies?
he will never do it; for a wicked man
he reaſons with himſelf, I have called upon
God thus &amp; thus long, I hope I need not pray
any more for this thing, &amp; ſo he gives over.</p>
            <p>But a godly man he will be alwaies cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon God. Beloved, there is a beginning
<hi>to</hi> an action, and a beginning <hi>of</hi> an action;
thou never beginneſt to lift up a weight till
thou ſtirreſt it from ground; indeede thou
mayſt begin towards the action by pulling
at it, by reaching at it; but thou never begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
the lifting up of the weight til thou ſtir
it from its place: thou mayſt give a pull at
prayer, and tugge at a grace, but thou haſt
not ſo much as begun that duty, till thou
ſeeſt God begin to hear thee, till thou ſeeſt
the grace a coming; therefore the Prophet
<hi>David</hi> when he prayed and had not that he
prayed for, his prayers returned into his
owne boſome, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 13. there to lie to
be a continuall ſuiTe unto God. A wicked
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62504:14"/>
man praies, and he leaves his praier behind
him in his pew, or in his hal, or chamber; but
a godly man praies and his prayer is in his
heart, his praier is not out til the grace be in.</p>
            <p>Secondly an unſatiable prayer, it is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
a proceeding prayer; you would think
that theſe are two contraries and one oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the other, but they are not, only they
are two ſeverall things: as it is ever a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
praier, becauſe in his own thoughts he
reckons or thinkes that he hath nothing till
he ſpeedes; ſo the ſoule that is unſatiable in
praier, he proceedes, he gets neere to God,
he gaines ſomthing, he windes up his heart
higher, or ſomthing or other he gets: As a
child that ſeeth the mother have an apple in
her hand, and it would faine have it, it will
come and pull at the mothers hand for it:
now ſhe lets go one finger and yet ſhe holds
it, and then he pulls againe, and then ſhe lets
goe another finger and yet ſhe keepes it, and
then the child pulls againe, and will never
leave pulling and crying till it hath got it
from his mother: So a child of God ſeeing
all graces to be in God, he drawes neere to
the throne of grace begging for it, &amp; by his
earneſt &amp; faithful praiers, he opens the hands
of God to him: God dealing as parents to
their children, holds them off for a while, not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62504:15"/>
that he is unwilling to give, but to make
them more earneſt with God: to draw them
the neerer to himſelfe; a wicked man praies
and his praiers tumble downe upon
him againe; and his heart is as dead
as ever it was before, as ſenſuall as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as carnall and earthly as ever, as hard,
as impenitent and ſecure as ever.</p>
            <p>A godly man when he praies, though he
have not gotten the thing totall that he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
yet he is neerer God then he was before;
his heart growes every day better then
other by his praiers; he obtaines ſtill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
as the Prophet <hi>Hoſeah</hi> ſpeakes of
knowledge <hi>Hoſ. 6. 3. Then ſhall we know,
if we follow on to know the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſo I may
ſay of praier, &amp; of al other good duties, then
we pray if we proceed on wards in praier.</p>
            <p>A man may know and know, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
know the Lord, till he goe on in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
ſo a man may pray and pray, yet if
he goe not on-wards in his praiers, his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are nothing. A godly man praies as a
builder builds; now a builder he firſt layeth
a foundation, and becauſe he cannot finiſh
in one day, he comes the ſecond day, and
findes the frame ſtanding that he made the
firſt day, and then he adds a ſecond dayes
worke, and then he comes a third day and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62504:15"/>
findes his two former dayes worke
ſtanding; then he proceeds to a third
dayes worke, and makes walls to it, and ſo
he goes on till his building be finiſhed. So
prayer it is the building of the ſoule till it
reach up to heaven; therefore a godly heart
praies and reacheth higher &amp; higher in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
till at laſt his prayers reach up to God.</p>
            <p>It is a ſigne of a wicked man to pray
and to let his prayers fall downe againe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him. And here I appeale to the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of wicked men, if it be not ſo with
them; they pray and pray, but their hearts
are as dead and deceitfull, as proud and
vaine, as ignorant, blockiſh and rebellious,
as if they had never praied.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is more and more a fervent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
praier; if a little praier will not ſerve the
turne, if he ſpeeds not to day, then he will
pray more earneſtly to morrow; and if that
will not ſerve the turne, he will adde more.</p>
            <p>As a man in winding up of a bucket, if
two or three windings will not fetch it up,
he will winde it up higher and higher, till
it comes up; for if he ſhould onely winde
up once or twiſe and no more, but hold it
juſt at the ſame pin, the bucket would never
come up; So if a man praies and praies,
and windes not up his heart higher, but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62504:16"/>
holds it juſt at the ſame pegge it was, praies
in the ſame faſhion he did, grace will never
come up. Marke then how thou prayeſt,
examine thy heart; doſt thou pray to day as
yeſterday, with no more zeal, nor feeling
affection, nor ſencible deſire? thou praieſt
not unſatiably.</p>
            <p>No, thou reſtraineſt thy praying from
growing, an excellent diſcription of an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
<hi>Iob</hi> 14. 4. though falſly applied
to <hi>Job. Thou reſtraineſt prayer before God;</hi> in
ſome tranſlations it is <hi>Thou keepeſt thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
from growing,</hi> thou reſtraineſt thy praiers
as a dwarffe is reſtrained from growing, ſo
thou reſtraineſt thy praiers from being more
and more earneſt and effectuall and fervent,
unſatiable praier is growing in zeale and
affection.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly it is a more and more frequent
praier, ſo that if twice a day will not ſerve
the turne, <hi>he will pray three times a day. Pſal.</hi>
55. 17. and if that will not prevaile,
<hi>he will pray ſeven times a day. Pſal.</hi> 119. 164.
and when that is not enough, he will be
even ever a praying, hardly broken off day
or night. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. 1. he cares not how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
he praies; it may be that thou haſt been a
ſuitor for ſtrength and grace againſt corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and haſt put up many praiers to the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62504:16"/>
ſame purpoſe. If now thou ſtickeſt at any
praiers, thy praiers are not unſatiable; an
unſatiable ſoul never reſteth, though it have
made ten thouſand praiers, till it have gotten
the grace; it is ſo with other things, and
therefore we neede not wonder at it; when
a man doth his worke one day, he will do it
another, and ſo on as long as he lives till his
worke be done; ſo muſt we doe for heaven
and for grace.</p>
            <p>Fifthly it is ever more and more a backt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
praier: if ordinary praiers will not ſerve the
turne: a godly heart will cut off time from
his recreations and pleaſures, though in
themſelves lawfull. Beloved, it may be with
thy ſoule in its wraſtlings and ſtrivings for
grace and power againſt corruptions, that
ordinary praiers will not ſatisfie it, but it
will be neceſſary to give over even lawfull
delights, and give that time to praier; ſo a
man will doe for the world, if he have a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
of importance, that will bring him in
gaine, he will be content to part with his
delights, and recreations, and pleaſures, to
follow after it; ſo a man muſt doe for his
ſoule, and if that be not enough, then lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
the duties of thy calling, to take time
from that. If a man have two houſes on fire
both together, the one his manſion dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62504:17"/>
houſe, the other ſome backe roome or
ſtable, if he can, he will ſave both; but if he
ſee that by ſpending his time on quenching
the fire on the ſtable, that his great manſion
houſe will burne downe, he will then neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the other and let it burne if it will, and
imploy himſelfe about his houſe; So when
the ſoule is in miſery under the want of
grace, that it cannot live under, but muſt
periſh eternally if it have it not, then the
ſoule being better then the body, rather then
that the ſoule miſcarry, we will neglect the
body ſometime. And if this will not ſerve,
abſtaine from meate and drinke, faſt it out;
thus the people of God are faine to doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times; their luſt and corruptions being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as the devill himſelfe, which cannot be
caſt out but by praier and faſting; there is
an excellent place: <hi>Joel: 2. 12. Therefore
now turne unto the Lord with faſting, weeping
and mourning, rent your hearts, &amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now, now your ſinnes are ſo diveliſh,
now your ſinnes are ſo deepely rooted in
your ſoules, now your corruptions are come
to be ſuch plague ſoares within you,
doe you not thinke that your ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and ordinary praiers and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations
will ſerve the turne, but now backe
them with faſting and mourning. Here now
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62504:17"/>
thou mayſt examine thy ſoule whether it
have praied effectually, unſatiably yea or
no; hath it ever a begging praier, that thou
praieſt as if thou hadſt never praied before?
is it evermore a proceeding praier, that thou
doeſt every day draw neerer to God then
other? is it more and more a backt praier,
a fervent and frequent praier? haſt thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from thy recreations, from thy calling

men in the world, they pray and pray for
grace, and their praiers come to an end, and
ceaſe before they have it; the angrie fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
praies for patience and meekneſſe and
yet ſets downe without it; the covetous
worldling praies to be weaned from the
world, and his praiers are done before he is

Firſt they are endleſſe: The Philoſopher
ſaid that that for which a thing is, that is
the end of the thing: now praier is for the
ſpeeding with God: and therefore he whoſe
praiers ſpeed not with God, his praiers are
endleſſe: thou haſt praied againſt thy pride,
but art as proude ſtill: thou haſt praied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thy choler and art as teachy ſtill:
thou haſt praied againſt earthlines and
worldlines, and art earthly and worldly
ſtill: thou haſt praied againſt ſecurity and
deadnes of heart, and lukewarmeneſſe in
Gods ſervice, and art lukewarm, dead hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and ſecure ſtill: to what end are all thy
praiers, when thou enjoyeſt not the end of
thy praiers? to what end is plowing of thy
ground if it be not fallow? when thy plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is done, to what end is the worke of thy
ſervant, if thy buſineſſe be not done, and
diſpatched when all is done? As good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
pray as pray to no end, as good that
thou never hadſt begun to pray, as to ceaſe,
and to give over thy praiers before thou
haſt obtained the grace thou prayeſt for:
<hi>The prayers of the wicked are an abomination
unto the Lord, but the prayer of the upright
is his delight: Prov.</hi> 15. 8. that is, the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of a wicked man that continues in his
wickedneſſe, when his praiers are done,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62504:18"/>
praiers are an abomination to the Lord:
but the praiers of the upright though he were
before he praied never ſo wicked, yet if it be
the praier of an upright and godly man,
when his praiers are done, that his praiers
rid him of his ſin, and make him an upright
man, his praiers are Gods delight.</p>
            <p>Beloved, many pray againſt diſtruſt in
Gods providence, Infidelity in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
Impatiency under Gods corrections,
&amp;c. and yet have never the more truſt and
affiance in God, never the more patience
under the hand of God, all theſe praiers are
<hi>endleſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, thy praiers are <hi>fruitleſſe:</hi> to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
what purpoſe is a beggers begging of an
almes? if he be gone before the almes be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed,
his begging is fruitleſſe; ſo all thy
praiers are loſt, if thou art gone from the
Throne of grace, before grace is given
thee: for if ſuch a praier be endleſſe, then is
it alſo fruitleſſe: it will never do thee any
good. what is a fruitleſſe tree good for, but
to be cut down? what is a fruitleſſe Vine
good for, but to be burned? So all thy
praiers are loſt, all thy beginnings of
grace are loſt. we know ſaith the man that

            <p>A drunkard prayeth to God to cure him
of his drunkennes, &amp; yet he doth not leave
his ill company; all the world may ſee that
God hears not the drunkards praier becauſe
he cures him not, but lets him go on in his
ſin; and ſo for all other ſins: ſeeſt thou a man
goe, on in his ſinnes? thou mayeſt ſee that
God heareth not his praiers. if a man
ſhould be ſicke on his death bed, and ſend
for the Phyſicians and Apothecaries in the
Country, and ſend for his Father, Mother,
and for all his friends to come to him to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter

them ſo long as I ſee his deadly diſeaſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines

hypocriſie, ſecurity, deadneſſe of heart, his
luſt, anger, &amp;c. lie upon him: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all his praiers, I know God heares not
his praiers; he prayes to be cleanſed from
his ſinnes, and to be purged from his luſt,
and to be redeemed from his vaine conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation:
if now God let his ſinnes continue
in him, and lets him goe on in them, we
ſee plainely God heares not him. O what
a pittifull and miſerable caſe are ſuch men

that man in a pittifull caſe, that all phyſick,
all coſt and charges is loſt upon him; when
his cating and drinking, his ſleeping, and

            <p>Now we come to the ſecond part of the
Text, <hi>the ſenſibleneſſe of the godly ſoule.</hi>
whether it ſpeed or no, the ſoule that praies
aright, <hi>that</hi> praies unſatiably: it is able to
ſay the Lord doth heare me, the Lord doth
grant me the thing that I praied to him for;
Thus ſaith <hi>Jonah, I cried unto the Lord and
he heard me; out of the belly of Hell cryed I,
and thou heardſt my voice,</hi> Jonah 2. 2. How
could <hi>Jonah</hi> ſay God heard his voice, if he
had not known it? therefore he knew it.
But againſt this ſome may object,</p>
            <p>How can this be? how can the ſoule<note place="margin">Object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
know that God heares it? we have no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
nor voices from Heaven <hi>now</hi> to tell
men, as the Angel told <hi>Cornelius</hi> that his
praiers were accepted, and come up before
God; or to ſay as Chriſt to the woman in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62504:20"/>
the Goſpell, <hi>Be of good comfort, thy ſins are
forgiven thee;</hi> I know God heares me with
his All-hearing eare, and therefore I have a
good beliefe in God: but how ſhall I know
that God heares my praiers in mercy, ſo as
to grant that I pray for?</p>
            <p>There be <hi>ſixe</hi> wayes to know whether
the ſoule ſhall ſpeed in prayer, yea or no.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is, <hi>the having of a Spirit of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and further praying.</hi> When God gives
the ſoule a further and further ability to
pray, when God opens a way for the ſoule
to the Throne of grace, and gives him a free
acceſſe to the gate of mercy, and a ſpirit to
hold out in prayer: It is a ſigne that God
meanes to hear it. When a Petitioner hath
acceſſe to the King, and preſents his Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
If the King imbolden him in his ſpeech,
and let him ſpeak all that he would ſpeak,
it is a ſigne that the King meanes to grant
that man his petition, becauſe otherwiſe the
King would never have endured to have
heard him ſo long, but would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
him to be gone. So it is with the
ſoule at the Throne of grace; if it come
with a petition and prayer to God; if God
diſpatch the ſoule out of his preſence, ſo
that the ſoul hath no heart to pray, nor to
continue its ſuite; but praies deadly and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62504:20"/>
dully, and is glad when he hath ſaid his
prayers, and hath done: it is a fearefull
ſigne that God never means to heare that
mans prayers: but if thou praieſt and
praieſt, and haſt not done in thy praiers, but
God by caſting in a ſpirit of prayer and
zeale, and fervency in prayer, imboldens
thy heart in its petitions, it is a ſigne that
God will heare thee, and grant thee thy
prayers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed be God</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>that hath
not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy
from me;</hi> How could the Prophet ſay that
the Lord did not turne away his mercy
from him? How! becauſe he turned not
away his prayer from him. Many Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
expound it <hi>of</hi> not turning away his
prayer from his heart; as if he ſhould ſay,
Lord, thou continueſt my heart to pray,
thou haſt not taken away my prayer from
my heart; therefore I know that thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueſt
thy mercy unto me.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>the preparedneſſe of the heart to</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>pray,</hi> is a ſigne that God means to heare.
When the Merchant ſtretcheth his bagge
wider and wider, it is a ſigne that he means
to put ſomething in it: ſo when God <hi>opens
the heart</hi> of a poore ſoule, it is a ſigne that
he means to <hi>fill it;</hi> when God prepares the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62504:21"/>
ſoule with more hunger and thirſt after
grace, with more longings and breathings:
it is a ſigne that God hath already <hi>prepared
his eare</hi> to heare that prayer; it is a ſigne
<hi>that</hi> heart ſhall ſpeed with God in prayer:
Pſal. 10. 17. <hi>Lord thou haſt heard the deſire
of the humble, thou wilt prepare their heart,
thou wilt cauſe thine eare to heare.</hi> Firſt, God
prepares the heart to pray, and then he
bows his eare to heare.</p>
            <p>Examine thy ſoule then; art thou more
and more prepared to pray? hath God ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with a powerfull voice to thy ſoule to
open it ſelfe wide? it is a ſigne that God
meanes to fill thy ſoul with his graces. But
if thou canſt ruſh into Gods preſence, and
leave thy preparedneſſe behind thee; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
thy ſoule and thy thoughts, and thy
affections behinde thee; and comeſt with a
ſtraightned heart in thy deadneſſe and luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmeneſſe;
<hi>this</hi> is a fearefull ſigne that
God will not heare thee.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>Gods gracious looke, is a ſigne
that he will heare thee:</hi> for ſometimes (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved)
God anſwers his people by a caſt of
his countenance, with a gratious ſmile of
his face. Pſal. 22. 24. he hath not deſpiſed
nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted,
neither hath he hid his face from him, but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62504:21"/>
when he cryed unto him he heard. Hereby
was the Prophet able to know that God did
heare his prayer, becauſe he did not hide
his face from him; when his poore ſoule
ſaw God ſmile on him, and ſet a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
eye upon him, this made him ſay that
God heard his cry.</p>
            <p>This is a riddle to the world.</p>
            <p>If you ſhould aske the men of the world
what the meaning of <hi>Gods gracious counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi>
is, or what they ſee of it? alas, they
can ſay nothing of it; they know not what
it meanes; onely the godly man underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
Pſal. 34. 15. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are
upon the righteous, and his eares are open unto
their cry,</hi> Theſe two goe together, <hi>their
prayers</hi> enter into <hi>Gods eares,</hi> and they know
it; why? becauſe they ſee it in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
upon them, as a Petitioner may
read his ſpeeding with the King by his
countenance towards him; ſo a poore ſoul
may ſee how prayers prevaile by Gods
countenance and look upon him.</p>
            <p>If thou then art a ſtranger to Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
if God never admitted thee into
his preſence to ſee his face and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
it is a ſigne that God little regards
thy prayers, and hath no minde to heare
thee. A wicked man is like a varlet that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62504:22"/>
ſtands without dores and begges an almes,
but is not ſuffered to goe into the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
preſence, and therefore knowes not
how he ſpeeds, whether the Gentleman
will give him an almes, or whether he be
providing a cudgell to beat him away: ſo
a wicked man prayes and puts up his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to God, but he is not able to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God: he cannot ſee whether God
looke as if he meant to heare his prayers,
yea or no; he knows not but that God may
be providing a curſe and plague for him in
ſtead of a bleſſing. But a child of God
comes within the liſt of Gods countenance;
he can tell when God ſmiles on him: and
when he takes another looke: he is able to
come into Gods preſence, Job 13. 16. <hi>He
alſo</hi> (ſaith Job) <hi>ſhall be my ſalvation: for an
hypocrite ſhall not come before him.</hi> A ſtrange
verſe. <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>God is his ſalvation:</hi> and
he gives this reaſon why he was able to ſay
ſo: <hi>for an hypocrite ſhall not come before him.</hi>
One would think that this were no reaſon:
but yer it is an undeniable reaſon, as if <hi>Job</hi>
had ſaid, I come into his preſence, and he
lookes like a Saviour, a Redeemer upon
me; but an hypocrite ſhall not come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him: he ſtands like a rogue and begs
without the gate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:62504:22"/>
Indeed a wicked man comes into Gods
preſence, in regard of Gods <hi>Omnipreſence:</hi>
but this is not enough: thy Oxe, and thine
Aſſe ſtands in Gods preſence: yea <hi>ſo,</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Devils themſelves are in Gods preſence.
But if thou come not into Gods preſence of
grace, if God doe not admit thy ſoule into
the liſt of his Throne: it is a ſigne that God
heares thee not. Men ſhould therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
their conſciences, what face or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God they come into or ſee: when
they pray in their prayers, whether they
come before God, yea or no.</p>
            <p>Beloved, no wicked man under heaven
can come before God: this is made the
marke of a godly man onely, Pſal. 140. 13.
<hi>The upright ſhall dwell in thy preſence,</hi> (marke
here) <hi>dwelling in Gods preſence</hi> is onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to the righteous: the upright ſhall
dwell in thy preſence: And here I appeale
againe to the hearts and conſciences of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men, what preſence of God doe they
finde in their prayers? they ſee their Pews,
and the walls or hangings, &amp;c. before
them: they ſee the heavens and the clouds
above them: they are like rogues that know
nothing within dores. Doe they ſee Gods
preſence and countenance? no: it is the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
man onely that dwels in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62504:23"/>
He ſees how God lookes on him,
how his face ſmiles on him: and therefore,
it is not a wicked mans coming to Church,
and falling on his knees, and uttering the
words of prayer that is a coming into Gods
preſence: then, this would be a falſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Prophet. For a wicked man may
go to Church and fall upon his knees, &amp;c.
but never <hi>come before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This preſence, is, <hi>to ſee the face of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly <hi>the conſcience of a man doth anſwere
him whether God heare him yea or no.</hi> As it
was with the high Preiſt, whenſoever the
high Preiſt came into Gods preſence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of him, though God did not appeare
viſibly unto him, yet he might reade Gods
anſwer in his <hi>Vrim and Thummim;</hi> he might
there know Gods minde: ſo <hi>a mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
is his Urim and Thummim. When he
comes before God, his own conſcience gives
him an inckling whether he ſpeede or no:
1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 20, 21. If our hearts condemne us, God
is greater then our hearts &amp; knoweth al things.
Belived, if our hearts condemne us not, then
have we confidence towards God.</hi> If a mans
conſcience tell a man that his praiers are
rotten, that his humiliation is rotten, that
his heart is not upright, that yet he is not
purged from his ſinnes, that his ſeeking of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62504:23"/>
God is fained and hypocritical; it is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
voice of God in his ſoule: and <hi>if our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
condemne us,</hi> God (ſaith the Apoſtle)
<hi>is greater then our conſciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There no is condemnation to them which
are in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. as if he ſhould
ſay, thoſe that are in Chriſt, God doth not
condemne them; they have not that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
nay their owne conſcience doth
not condemn them: ſo that, that man whom
any condemnation either from God, or
from his owne conſcience, condemnes, that
man is not in Chriſt; being not in Chriſt,
he can never be heard.</p>
            <p>Indeede, a mans conſcience may be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informed
by Satan under a temptation; as
you may ſee in the verſe before my text:
<hi>Thou haſt heard my voyce: ſtop not thine eare
from my cry.</hi> Here the Church being exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
their conſciences told them they were
heard in their praiers: but being under a
temptation, their conſciences were afraide
that God heard not. So many a poore ſoule:
examine it, and it cannot deny but that
theſe and theſe tokens of grace and fruites
of Gods Spirit are in it; yet their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are afraide that the Lord will not give
them theſe and theſe other graces that they
want: that the Lord will not heare them for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62504:24"/>
ſuch and ſuch bleſſings.</p>
            <p>I meane not neither a truce of conſcience:
for there may be a truce of conſcience in
wicked men. A truce may be betweene
mortall enemies: but no peace but amongſt
freinds. Wicked mans conſciences are like
the Lion, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 13. who when he had
killed the Prophet, ſtood by the Corps, and
by the Aſſe, and did not eate the body, nor
teare the Aſſe; ſo a wicked mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
it is as the divells band-dogge or roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Lion: till it hath ſlaine the ſinner, it
ſtands ſtone-ſtill, and ſeemes neither to
meddle or make with him, but lies as ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or dead in him. I meane not this conſcience.
But when God hath ſprinkled the
conſcience with the bloud of Chriſt, and
made the conſcience pure: this is a ſigne
that God heares his praier.</p>
            <p>I meane not the ſtammering of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
when it is dazelled, or overwhelmed:
but when it ſpeaks down right as it meanes.
A godly mans conſcience ſometimes may
judge otherwiſe then the thing is. But, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
what thy conſcience tells thee in ſober
ſadneſſe, deliberatey, convincingly,: and
<hi>then,</hi> know that the Lord tels thee. If thy
conſcience ſaies peremptorily that thy
heart and waies are rotten, and unſound;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62504:24"/>
               <hi>then</hi> know that the Lord tells thee ſo, and
that the Lord ſayeth ſo to thy ſoule.</p>
            <p>Fifthly <hi>the getting of that grace that a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
prayes for,</hi> is a ſigne that God heares his
praiers. But this is not a true ſigne alwaies
but with diſtinction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When the grace given, and the good will of
God the giver, cannot be ſevered: then</hi> it is a
true ſigne. But when the gift and the good
will of the giver may be ſevered, then it is
not a true ſigne.</p>
            <p>Thou maieſt pray unto God, and God
may give thee many temporall bleſſings,
and <hi>many common</hi> graces of his Spirit;
God may give thee good parts, a good me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory:
he may give thee a good meaſure of
knowledge and underſtanding, even in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
things; he may give thee ſome kinde
of humility, chaſtity, civility: thou maieſt
be of a loving and flexible diſpoſition: ſo
he may give thee a good eſtate in the world,
houſes, lands, wife and children &amp;c. God
may give thee <hi>all theſe,</hi> and yet hate thee,
and never heare one praier thou makeſt;
thou maiſt pray for a thouſand bleſſings,
and have them: and yet never be heard, ſo
long as the good will of the giver is ſevered
from them; all outward bleſſings and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
graces may be ſevered from Gods
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62504:25"/>
good pleaſure to a man.</p>
            <p>Therefore in temporall bleſſings, or in

God heare thee or no: know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God hath given thee a <hi>ſanctified uſe</hi>

many common graces, or temporall
bleſſings, and <hi>a heart</hi> to uſe them to his
Glory; then every bleſſing thou haſt (there
is not a droppe of drinke, nor a bit of bread
that thou haſt, but) it is a ſigne of Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting
love to thee. Why? becauſe
this, and the good will of the giver can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be ſevered. But on the contrary, if a

frownes againſt me; I have no ſigne that
God will heare me.</p>
            <p>Wouldſt thou have a ſigne?<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
               <hi>An evill and an adulterous generation ſeeketh a ſigne:</hi> this
is <hi>a tempting faith,</hi> to ſeeke for ſignes to
believe. <hi>Thomas,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, Joh. 20. 29.
<hi>becauſe thou haſt ſeen me, thou haſt belived:

That man that believes becauſe he
feels griefe in his heart, teares in his eyes,
groans in his ſpirit, becauſe he prayes long
and earneſtly, and ſweats in his praier, or
mourns in his humiliation, I ſuſpect his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
his teares, his griefe, his praiers,
and all that he hath. Why? theſe are good
ſignes of faith: but <hi>rotten grounds</hi> of faith?
the Word and promiſe of God muſt be thy
ground. But againſt this the ſoul may object<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>That every <hi>Promiſe</hi> runnes with a <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Object.</note>
and therefore if I have not the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
how can I beleeve the promiſe God
hath promiſed? <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger
and thirſt after righteouſneſſe, for they ſhall be
ſatisfied:</hi> There is a <hi>Promiſe</hi> of filling, but
it is with a condition of hungering. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the
earth. Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62504:26"/>
ſhall ſee God, &amp;c.</hi> if I have not the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
annexed to the Promiſe, how dare or
how can I believe the Promiſe?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Condition</hi> is not the way to get the
<hi>Promiſe;</hi> the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is the ground of faith,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
and the way to get the condition; becauſe
the promiſe is the <hi>Motive</hi> cauſe that moves
the ſoule to get the condition. Now, the
<hi>Mover</hi> muſt be before the <hi>Moved;</hi> then if
<hi>beliefe</hi> of the <hi>Promiſe</hi> move thy ſoule to get
the condition of the promiſe, then beliefe
of the promiſe muſt be before that the
ſoule can keepe the condition of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saul</hi> made a promiſe to <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam.
18. that he ſhould be his ſonne in law in
one of his two daughters, upon condition
that he ſhould give him an hundred fore-skins
of the Philiſtims. Now, <hi>David</hi> did
firſt believe the promiſe; and thereby he
was allured to fight valiantly, to keepe the
condition, to get a hundred fore-skins of the
Philiſtims. So Pſal. 116. <hi>I believed and
therefore did I ſpeake.</hi> He beleeved Gods
promiſe, and then he ſpake with condition.
So, <hi>we believe</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doe we ſpeake.</hi> Firſt, the ſoule beleeves;
and then every action of a Chriſtian wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it moves to the keeping of the condition,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62504:26"/>
ſprings from this root; nay beloved, a
man cannot keep any condition in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
without faith; <hi>he muſt believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>faith is the inabling cauſe to</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>keep the condition.</hi> Doſt thou thinke to get
weeping, mourning, and humiliation for thy
ſinnes, and then thereby to get the promiſe
to thy ſelfe? then thou goeſt in thy owne
ſtrength; and then, in Gods account, thou
doſt juſt nothing, John 15. 5. <hi>Without me
ye can doe nothing,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
firſt <hi>lay hold</hi> on me, <hi>beleeve</hi> in me, <hi>abide</hi>
in me.</p>
            <p>What! doe you firſt think to pray, to
mourne, to lament and bewaile your ſinnes,
to do this and that in turning your ſelves,
and ſanctifying of your ſelves? Indeed
you may fumble about theſe things: but
you can never do any of them in deed and
to the purpoſe: <hi>without me ye can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
I had fainted</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
I had beleeved to ſee the goodneſſe of the
Lord in the land of the living,</hi> Pſal. 27. 13.
where we may ſee three things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>the Promiſe</hi> that he ſhould ſee the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
goodneſſe of the Lord: otherwiſe he could
not have beleeved.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>the Condition:</hi> if he doe not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
faint.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:62504:27"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>the method the Prophet went by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, he beleeved to ſee the goodneſſe of
the Lord. As if he had ſaid, if he had not
firſt laid hold on the Promiſe, if <hi>I</hi> had not
beleeved to have ſeen the goodneſſe of the
Lord in the Land of the living, I had fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Beloved, it is true that the keeping of the
Condition, is before the <hi>fruition of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe:</hi>
but not before <hi>beleeving the Promiſe:</hi>
becauſe the <hi>doing of the Condition</hi> is effected
by <hi>beleeving the Promiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the cauſe that many fumble about
grace, but never get it: they are ever repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but never repent: ever learning, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
learne the knowledge of the truth ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting:
ever ſtriving, but never get
power over their corruptions, &amp;c. becauſe
they fumble about it <hi>in their own ſtrength,</hi>
and take it not in the right method.</p>
            <p>Let the ſoule come with faith in Chriſt,
and believe it ſhall ſpeed and have grace,
and power from Chriſt his grace, and from
Chriſts power: and <hi>then</hi> it ſhall ſpeed;
Chriſt hath promiſed (<hi>John</hi> 16.) that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
we aske the Father in his name, he
will give it us. Chriſt (beloved) is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Surety.</hi> Indeed, our credit is crackt
in Heaven: we may thinke to goe and fetch
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62504:27"/>
this and that grace in our owne names, and
miſſe of it: as the <hi>ſervant</hi> may goe to the
<hi>Merchant</hi> for wares in his owne name, but
the Merchant will not deliver them to him
in his own name, unleſſe he come in his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
name and bring a ticket from him: and
<hi>then</hi> when the ſervant ſheweth his Maſters
ticket, the Merchant will deliver him what
wares he asketh for in his Maſters name.
So when a ſoule goeth to the <hi>Throne of
grace</hi> with a ticket from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> if he can
ſay Lord, it is for the honour of Chriſt: I
come for grace and holineſſe, and ſtrength
againſt my corruptions: Lord, here is a tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
from Chriſt: moſt <hi>certainly,</hi> he ſhall
ſpeed.</p>
            <p>But, men muſt take heed that they foyſt
not the name of Chriſt: that they foyſt not
a ticket to ſay that Chriſt ſent them, when
it is their own <hi>ſelfe-love,</hi> and their owne
luſt that ſends them; it is not enough to
pray and at the end to ſay <hi>through Chriſt our
Lord, Amen.</hi> No: for this may be a meere
foyſting of the Name of Chriſt. But, canſt
thou pray and ſhew that Chriſt ſent thee,
and ſay as the ſervant, I come from my
Maſter, and he ſent me? Lord, it is for
Chriſt that I come: it is not to ſatisfie my
owne luſt, nor to eaſe and deliver me from
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62504:28"/>
the galls of my conſcience, nor to
free me from hell; but for Chriſt; Lord,
I begge grace and holineſſe, that I may have
power to glorifie Chriſt. It is for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of my Lord Chriſt that I come.
When the ſoul comes thus in Chriſts name,
beleeving it ſhall ſpeed, then his prayer ſhall
prevaile. <hi>Wbatſoever</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ye ſhall
aske the Father in my Name, he will give it
you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We come now to the third and laſt part
of our Text: to wit, the ſupplies they had
againſt danger and diſcouragements. The
Lord upheld their hearts from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed
in prayer; <hi>thou ſaidſt feare not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be two things that do much hurt
in prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>groundleſſe incouragements.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, I ſay, <hi>greundleſſe incouragements;</hi>
and theſe the wicked are moſt ſubject to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially,
who becauſe they <hi>pray, heare the

therefore they incourage themſelves in

            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:62504:28"/>
We have abundance of <hi>ſayings</hi> amongſt
us, that if they were examined would prove

<hi>that</hi> beares ſhape all their <hi>young</hi> by

            <p>So, beloved, there are abundance of <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
that goe up and down amongſt men
concerning <hi>Divinity,</hi> which if they were
examined, will prove to be rotten ſayings;
as, he that made them, will ſave them. It
is not ſo, ſaith the Prophet, Eſai. 27. 11. <hi>He
that made them, will not have mercy on them,
and he that formed them, will not pitty them.</hi>
It is commonly beleeved, if men come to
Church, heare the <hi>Word,</hi> and call upon
God, that then preſently they are good
Chriſtians. Beloved, it is not ſo, Matth.
7. 21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord,

            </p>
            <p>Men are ready when they can but call
<hi>Lord have mercy on me; O ſweet Saviour,
pitty me, moſt mercifull Lord Jeſus, have
compaſsion on me:</hi> if they can <hi>pray in their

families,</hi> and pray at Church, &amp;c. to think,
now, all is well with them, and Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but ſave them, and give them the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven: but our Saviour puts a
<hi>not</hi> upon it, and ſaith, <hi>not every one</hi> that ſaith
Lord, Lord: it is not a <hi>Lord,</hi> a Lording of
Chriſt with the tongne onely: it is not a
taking up of an outward profeſſion of
Chriſt only, that is ſufficient for a man that
ſhall inherit the Kingdome of Heaven: no
ſaith Chriſt: but he that doth the will of
my Father which is in Heaven. But, of this
by the <hi>by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, there are <hi>needleſſe diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
which doe much hurt in prayer.
Needleſſe diſcouragements doe much hurt
to many a poore ſoule, that hath forcible
<hi>wouldings,</hi> and wracked deſires after grace
and holineſſe, and yet is held by diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements:
yea, many a Chriſtian heart
lieth a long time under it wraſtling and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
under its wants, and yet, kept out
from grace, and from growing in grace,
becauſe of diſcouragements: yea the beſt
and ſtrongeſt of Gods Saints, have been
kept off, and have hung much on diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feare not,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Geneſ.
15. 1. So, feare not <hi>Joſhua,</hi> ſaith God to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62504:29"/>
               <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Joſh. 1. 9. Intimating that both <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
and <hi>Joſhua</hi> were afraid of diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements:
they were afraid that many
evils would befall them, that they ſhould
meet with many rubs and difficulties that
would be too hard for them: therefore the
Lord calls to them, <hi>feare not,</hi> be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed
nor diſcouraged. Thou ſaidſt feare
not. Hence obſerve,</p>
            <p>That God would not have any Chriſtian<note place="margin">Doct.</note>
ſoule to be diſcouraged in praier. <hi>Thou
ſaidſt, feare not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For our clearer proceeding herein, firſt,
let me ſhew you what <hi>diſcouragement</hi> is:
and ſecondly, how it comes to be dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and hurtfull in praier.</p>
            <p>What is diſcouragement?<note place="margin">Queſt. Anſw.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is a <hi>baſe diſmayment</hi> of ſpirit below or
beneath the ſtrength that is in a man, vnder
the apprehenſion of ſome evill, as if it were
too hard for him to grapple with it.</p>
            <p>There be foure things in this diffinition.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſay it is a <hi>baſe diſmayment</hi> of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and ſo I call it to diſtinguiſh it: for there
is an humble diſmayment which a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
is commanded. A man is bound to be
diſmayed for his ſinnes. <hi>Iſay. 32. 11. Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ye careleſſe women that are at eaſe, be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
ye careleſſe ones:</hi> theſe careleſſe ones
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62504:30"/>
went on in their ſinnes, and feared not.
God calls to them and bids them to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed.
But the diſmayment and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
I ſpeake of, it is a baſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayment
of ſpirit; which is either when
<hi>he</hi> is diſmayed <hi>that ought not:</hi> or he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed
<hi>at that whereat he ought not to feare:</hi>
where no cauſe of feare is.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Vitello</hi> his man thought his Maſter
had got skill in Optickes: he riding along
upon the high way, ſpying a mans ſhape,
thought it was ſome Spirit: and thereupon
he ſickened and died. So many a poor ſoul
looking in the perfect Law of God, and
ſeeing his owne uglineſſe and filthyneſſe,
he is diſcouraged, and thinkes himſelfe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done;
his heart waxeth cold within him,
and he begins to feare that he is but a dead
and damned man.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>it is downe beneath the ſtrength
that is in a man:</hi> that man is properly ſaid
to be diſcouraged: not that he hath no
ſtrength at all in him, nor no courage at all
(for ſuch a one is an <hi>infeebled</hi> man, not a
man diſcouraged) but a diſcouraged man is
a man put beſides the courage that is in
him; when a man hath ſtrength enough to
grapple with the evill before him, but
through diſmayment of ſpirit he cannot put
it forth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:62504:30"/>
Have not I commanded thee? ſaith God
to <hi>Joſhua; Be ſtrong and of a good courage,</hi> be
not afraid, neither be thou diſmaied, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.
God had given <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſtrength enough,
whereby he was inabled to obſerve and do
according to all that Law which <hi>Moſes</hi> the
ſervant of the Lord commanded him; God
had now doubled his Spirit upon him: yet
he commands him, <hi>be not afraid, neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed:</hi>
as if he had ſaid, <hi>Joſhua,</hi> if thou
beeſt diſmayed and diſcouraged, though
thou haſt ſtrength and power to go through
the buſineſſe that I have called thee unto,
yet thou wilt not be able to uſe it, nor to
put it forth if thou beeſt diſcouraged.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>it is at the apprehenſion of ſome</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>evill.</hi> I ſay not at the ſight of ſome evill:
for a man may be diſmayed at the appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of good, as <hi>Mary</hi> when ſhe ſaw nothing
but a good Angell, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 29. ſhe ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a glorious Angel: nevertheleſſe
ſhe was afraid, and diſcouraged. Why?
becauſe ſhe had a ſecret apprehenſion of
ſome evill, either of ſome evill proceeded
in the ſalutation, or ſome unworthineſſe in
her elfe to receive ſuch a gracious ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
it cannot be the apprehenſion of any
good that diſcourageth a man, but the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of ſome evill.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:62504:31"/>
Fourthly, <hi>not of every evill</hi> neither; for if
the evill be but ſmall, courage will ſtand it
out; but <hi>it is of ſuch an evill as he feares he is
not able to grapple withall.</hi> If the evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, be inferiour to him, he ſcornes it
as the barking of a toothleſſe Dog. If it be
but an evill equall to his ſtrength, then he
makes a tuſh at it, becauſe he knowes or
thinkes himſelfe able to encounter with it.</p>
            <p>But if it be an evill above his ſtrength,
then his ſpirit melts and droops before him.
See this in <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Sam. 17. 11. and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
When they ſaw the Champion of the
Philiſtims comming againſt them, when
they ſaw him ſo hugely and mervelouſly
armed, and heard him ſpeake ſuch biggs
words, they thought they were not able to
ſtand and to encounter with him; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaith the Text, when <hi>Saul</hi> and all <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
heard theſe words of the Philiſtim, they
were diſmayed and greatly afraid.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſee what diſcouragement is;
ſuch diſcouragements the Lord would not
have our hearts to be in when we pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For firſt, <hi>God cannot give eare to that man
that is out of heart in his prayers.</hi> Thou canſt
never pray if thou beeſt diſmaied in prayer.
When the ſoul begins to feare and reaſon,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62504:31"/>
               <hi>O, I am ſo unworthy that God will not looke at
me; I am ſo ſinfull, ſo blockiſh, ſo dead, and
dull to all good, that God will never regard
me;</hi> thou canſt never pray, Rom. 10. 14.
<hi>How ſhall they call on him in whom they have
not beleeved?</hi> If thou doſt not believe that
God will heare thee, if thou doſt not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
that thou ſhalt prevaile, that God
will deliver thee out of theſe corruptions
and that luſt that thou praieſt againſt; that
God will give thee this grace or that grace:
if thou doſt not beleeve that God will
owne thee: if thou haſt theſe doubtfull
diſcouragements, <hi>O, he will not grant me, I
ſhall never get this or that:</hi> how canſt thou
call on him? thou mayeſt call ſo and ſo:
but never canſt thou call to any purpoſe, if
thou doſt not beleeve in him.</p>
            <p>A begger though he be never ſo well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to begge, yet if when he comes to the
Houſe-keepers dore, he be perſwaded that
he ſhall not ſpeed, that let him beg as long
as he will, he ſhall get nothing: this blunts
his begging, and makes him give over his
ſuite without any great importunity: So, it
is impoſſible that ever a ſoule ſhould hold
out and pray that is diſcouraged in
prayer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>thou canſt not pray unleſſe thou
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62504:32"/>
uſe all thy ſtrength in prayer;</hi> If thou be
diſcouraged, thou canſt not uſe thy
ſtrength.</p>
            <p>A diſcouraged man, his ſtrength melts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
feare; and whatſoever ſtrength he hath,
he cannot put it forth. How came <hi>Jacob</hi>
to prevaile and to have power with God?
Why, he uſed all his ſtrength with God,
and ſo prevailed, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12. 3. Thou canſt
never prevaile with God by thy prayers,
unleſſe thou putteſt forth all thy ſtrength in
praier.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Jacob</hi> had reaſoned <hi>I am but duſt and
aſhes; how can I ſtrive with God? I am ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and evill, how can I contend with my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker?</hi>
and ſo have beene diſcouraged in his
wraſtling, he could not have uſed all his
ſtrength with God, and ſo had never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with God. No, <hi>Jacob</hi> he gathers
all the arguments that he could make; he
gathers together all the promiſes he could
finde in Gods Book, or that he could heare
off; he diſplaies all the wants that he could
ſhew; he petitions all the graces that he
could name; he uſed all his ſtrength, and by
his ſtrength he had power with God.</p>
            <p>If thy confeſſion of thy ſins be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe;
if thy petitions, and thankeſgiving
for grace, be ſtrengthleſſe; if thou uſe not
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62504:32"/>
all thy ſtrength in prayer, thou canſt never
prevaile, nor have any power with God.
For how can that man prevaile and have
power with God that hath no power with
himſelfe?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>thou canſt never pray, and have a</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <hi>fearefull apprehenſion of evill in prayer;</hi> thou
canſt not. It is good to have a deepe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of thy ſinnes: apprehend them
to be as many hells as thou canſt, thou
canſt never apprehend them deeply enough:
but if thou haſt a fearefull apprehenſion of
them, thou canſt never pray.</p>
            <p>When the Apoſtle would exhort the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipians</hi>
to continue in one Spirit, and in one
minde, fighting together through the faith
of the Goſpell, he exhorts them <hi>that, in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
they feare,</hi> Phil. 1. 27, 28. For if a man
be terrified with his adverſary, with the
power of his adverſary, and feares he ſhall
never be able to withſtand him but muſt
fall before him through his ſubtilty, that he
can never be wary enough for him: Alas,
he can never ſtrive with hope and courage
againſt him. So, beloved, if we have a
fearefull and diſcouraged kinde of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of evill, we can never pray ſo as to
prevaile.</p>
            <p>Apprehend thy ſinnes to be as helliſh,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62504:33"/>
and as damnable as thou canſt: Feele even
the fire of hell in every one of them: but
take heed of a <hi>fearefull</hi> apprehenſion of
them, <hi>ſo</hi> to apprehend the evill of them,
as to thinke with thy ſelfe that becauſe thou
art guilty of <hi>theſe and theſe</hi> ſinnes, that thou
ſhalt never get in with God again, God will
never be reconciled to thee: <hi>theſe</hi> will eate
out thine heart in prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> we can never pray if we have any
ſecret diſpaire <hi>that there is any difficulty
too hard for us to grapple withall, or to get
through in our prayers. Howſoever a man
prayes, yet if he have</hi> any ſpice <hi>of theſe
feares in him, to thinke</hi> now I have taken a
great deale of paines, but am never the better;
I have prayed and prayed, but have got no good:
I may goe on and doe thus and thus, but ſhall
never prevaile or ſpeed; all my labours, all
my prayers and indeavours will be loſt; <hi>this
takes away the very ſpirit and life of a mans
prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Judas</hi> after he had betrayed the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
he was diſcouraged from ever praying
for mercy. Why? becauſe he thought it
was <hi>impoſsible</hi> for him to get it; <hi>I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
innocent blood,</hi> ſaith he. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. as
if he ſhould ſay, <hi>I ſhall never out-wraſtle this
ſinne; this ſinne is my death: I have brought
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62504:33"/>
the blood of the Sonne of God on me, I ſhall
never claw off this ſinne:</hi> now <hi>Judas</hi> thus
deſpayring, we never read one letter of any
prayer that he made to God to get out of it;
no, he thought it too hard for him to get
mercy. Deſpaire drives a man from that he
did hope for; becauſe now he thinkes there
is an impoſſibility in getting of it.</p>
            <p>Beloved, miſtake me not; there is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
deſperation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there is a deſperation of <hi>infidelity;</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and that deads and drawes the ſoule from
God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a deſperation of <hi>extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity;</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
And, if ever you meane to come to
God, and to get any grace from God, you
<hi>muſt</hi> come with deſperation of extremity.
deſperation puts <hi>life</hi> into a mans prayers
and indeavours.</p>
            <p>As, a Souldier when he ſeeth nothing
but to <hi>kill or be killed,</hi> that he ſees his ſtate
deſperate; why, this will compell a very
coward to fight; this will make a coward
fight (<hi>as if he would kill the Devill,</hi> ſaith the
Proverb) it will make him fight like a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
he will be afraid of nothing. Take a
Souldier that fights deſperately for his life,
with a <hi>kill or be killed;</hi> he feares nothing;
neither Pike, nor Sword, nor Gun? why.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62504:34"/>
he fights ſor his life. Therefore one notes
that ſometimes it is the neareſt way to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
to be deſperate in attempts and in
fight. Therefore when <hi>William the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour</hi>
came firſt into <hi>England,</hi> at <hi>Haſting,</hi> he
ſent back his Ships againe, that ſo the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
might have no hope of ſaving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by flying back. And ſo at <hi>Battle,</hi> at
<hi>one</hi> encounter, a <hi>little</hi> Army of the Engliſh
ſlew a <hi>great</hi> Army of the French. Why?
they grew deſperate.</p>
            <p>So, could men pray deſperately, could
they pray with a <hi>pray or be damned:</hi> beg with
a <hi>begge or be damned;</hi> ſeeke to God for
grace that you want with a <hi>ſpeed or be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;</hi>
then would their prayers be more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and powerfull to get grace. O, did
men pray thus, they would pray otherwiſe
then they doe.</p>
            <p>Men pray, but they pray deadly, coldly,
and lazily, as if they had no need of prayer,
or as if they had no need of the grace they
pray for; they pray for grace, but get it
not; they pray for zeale, but have it not;
for repentance and holineſſe, but obtaine it
not.</p>
            <p>Beloved, either get zeale and holineſſe,
or elſe there is no mercy: either get grace
and repentance, or elſe there is no mercy
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62504:34"/>
for thee. Pray then when thou prayeſt for
grace, with <hi>a ſpeede or be damned:</hi> ſay unto
thy ſoule, <hi>either we muſt ſpeede and get grace</hi>
Soule, <hi>or elſe we muſt goe to hell.</hi> If men
would pray thus, with <hi>a ſpeede or be damned,</hi>
we ſhould never ſee, nor God ſhould never
heare ſo many cold and dead praiers as now
we pray.</p>
            <p>Deſpaire makes a man a Munke ſaith the
Papiſt: but <hi>this deſpayre</hi> makes a man a
good Chriſtian I ſay: never doth a man
pray indeede till he feels himſelfe in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
hopeles and deſperate in regard of
himſelfe; ſo that he ſeeth no remedie at all
but <hi>get Chriſt: get grace or be damned for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Get power and ſtrength over theſe corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi>
otherwiſe they <hi>will deſtroy and damne
thee;</hi> this would make a man pray for life.
Men pray coldly and faintly: why? becauſe
though they ſee they have no grace, no
zeale, no holines, no repentance, no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Chriſt: yet they hope to be ſaved
notwithſtanding. O beloved, the divell
hath blinded theſe men to the intent they
may be damned.</p>
            <p>But, if men would pray deſperate praiers
with a <hi>pray or be damned, ſeeke with a finde or
be damned:</hi> men would then pray other
praiers then they doe. Such praiers did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:62504:35"/>
pray <hi>Pſal. 130. 1. Out of the deepe places
have I called unto thee O Lord, Lord heare
my prayer:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Lord, I am
even in the depth of miſerie, plunged over
head and eares, ſo that now I ſinke and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
if thou helpe not: Lord, hear my prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<hi>This deſperation</hi> a Chriſtian muſt have,
this quickens up his Spirits, and puts life in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him: but, take heede of the <hi>deſperation of
Infidelity:</hi> Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> ſaith it is the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer
of the ſoule: the ſpice of it will eate
out the heart of a man, and kill the ſtrength
of all his endeavours.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now come to apply this doctrine;
but I feare me there be many amongſt us,
that never come ſo farre towards heaven,
as to know what theſe diſcouragements
meane. This is lamentable.</p>
            <p>It is true, <hi>diſcouragements</hi> are hideous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in praier, and a man may periſh and goe
to hell that hath them: but yet, they are
<hi>ſome-what profitable ſignes</hi> that a man doth
at the leaſt looke a little towards God, or
elſe he could not know what they are. But
there are abundance that never have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo farre in religion, as to underſtand what
they meane: but goe on in drinking, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
carding and dicing, hating and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
fretting and chafing, mocking &amp; cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62504:35"/>
ſwearing and blaſpheming, in ſecurity,
in hardnes of heart and impenitencie: they
are more carefull for their doggs, for their
potts, and for their tables, and for their
ſhops, then they are of their ſoules: And
which is enough to aſtoniſh any that is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
theſe men ſcarce finde any diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in praier: O, they have a good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to pray at all times: O, ſay they, God
forbid that any man ſhould be diſcouraged
in praier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I thanke God I have a good hope
in God; God hath given me a good heart
of grace to call upon him, and I make no
queſtion but that God heares me: God
would never bid us to pray if he did not
meane to heare us.</p>
            <p>Beloved, theſe men that are ſo bold in the
goodnes of their hearts to call upon God,
they never as yet praied in all their lives:
all the praiers of the wicked are indeede no
praiers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Daniel</hi> confeſſing the ſinnes of wicked
<hi>Judah,</hi> ſaith, <hi>though all this evill be come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, yet made we not our prayer to turne from
our wicked wayes. Dan.</hi> 9. 13. all the time of
thoſe ſeventy yeares, <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
made praier to God; yet they faſted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
yeare, and praied every day, twiſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day at the leaſt, which would amount
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62504:36"/>
in that time to 50000 and 100 prayers:
how then could <hi>Daniel</hi> ſay they never made
<hi>one</hi> praier? I anſwer, (and pray marke it)
<hi>becauſe</hi> they never did quite turne from their
evill waies. Though thou makeſt never ſo
many praiers, though thou boaſteſt of the
goodneſſe of thy condition, and ſnatcheſt at
the Promiſes of God: yet if thou turneſt not
from thine iniquities, thou never as yet
mad'ſt any praier by the Judgement of God
himſelfe. <hi>Paul</hi> made many thouſand praiers
before his converſion, he could not have
beene a Phariſe elſe; but they were never
accounted praiers to him: therefore as ſoon
as ever he was converted, behold ſaith God
<hi>he prayeth Acts</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>A wicked man, a carnall Chriſtian,
though he have the righteouſneſſe of Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion, of living blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
unreproveable in reſpect of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
righteouſneſſe of the Law: yet he can
never make an <hi>acceptable prayer</hi> till he be
truely converted; his praiers are no better
then howling of dogs, or lowing of Oxen,
yea the Lord abhorrs them. O what <hi>poore</hi>
incouragements canſt thou have, ſeeing the
Lord never tallies downe any of thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers?
wicked men are like <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> who wept
more for the death of his dogge, then of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62504:36"/>
his wife; ſo wicked men weepe and mourne
for the loſſe of their corne and their cattle,
hawkes and houndes, cardes and dice: but
never for the loſſe of their praiers. So long
as thou continueſt in thy prophaneſſe and
impenitency, thou loſeſt all thy praiers:
there is not one of them that God tallies
downe, or reckons for a praier. Here we
might have a great deale of matter, if time
would ſuffer me. But it will not, onely let
me tell you, I ſpeake onely to thoſe whoſe
hearts God hath awakened out of their
ſinnes, but who are oft diſcouraged: take
heede of theſe diſcouragements.</p>
            <p>For, firſt, <hi>they will drive thee to melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Beloved, there are a great many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
men in the world, and this is the
cauſe of it; men are contented to be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by halves: becauſe they are diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the worke. If thou ſuffer thy ſelfe to
be diſcouraged, it will care up thy ſpirit and
thou wilt be like a <hi>ſilly dove without a heart,
Prov.</hi> 7. 11. A dove is a melancholy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that hath no heart to any thing; ſo <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi>
hath no heart to call upon God, no
heart to returne unto God: and this is
the cauſe that men and women goe whine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and mourning under the burden of ſin,
and are not able to come out, becauſe of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62504:37"/>
diſcouragements: all the policie of hell is
leſſe then this policy of the divell, in dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
men to deſpair or diſcouragements: <hi>this</hi>
doth more hurt then al the reſt of hel beſides</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if you doe not take heede of
them, they will bring you to ſpeake againſt
God, <hi>I have prayed, but the Lord will not
heare me: I have called, and the Lord will not
anſwer, but hath turned away his eares from
me.</hi> Now, thou ſpeakeſt againſt God. <hi>Num.</hi>
21. 4, 5. The ſoule of the people was much
diſcouraged, and the people ſpake againſt
God, and againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have you brought us out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> to
die in the wilderneſſe? for here is neither
bread, nor water, and our ſoule loatheth
this light bread. So, beloved, <hi>if we ſuffer
our ſoules to be diſcouraged, we ſhall ſoone come
to murmure againſt God:</hi> wherefore hath he
brought me up to this ſtrictnes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſenſſe?
when I was a drunkard, a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
when I followed the luſt of my fleſh
and liberry, then I enjoed onnions, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke,
and the fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt:</hi> pleaures
and delights for my ſoule: then I had a
good hope in God, and a good perſwaſion
that my ſoul ſhould goe to heaven: and
then Preachers told me that if I would give
over ſuch and ſuch ſinnes, and looke after
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62504:37"/>
Heaven a little more, and doe ſuch and
ſuch things, O <hi>then</hi> I ſhould come to a
Land flowing with milke and honey, then
I ſhould not miſſe of glory and ſalvation;
But alas, I ſee nothing but Gyants and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nakims;
I am in a wilderneſſe; now, <hi>now</hi>
I ſee a man have a great deal of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and yet be a caſt-away; A man may
have a great deal of faith &amp; yet be but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate;
A man may give over a great <hi>many</hi>
ſins, and yet periſh in hell; now I ſee a man
may live civilly and well, and have &amp; do a
great many good things, and yet be damned
when he hath done all: A man may even
goe to Heaven Gates, and yet the gates be
ſhut againſt him, and he turned into hell. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!
my poore ſoule is in a wilderneſſe;
<hi>now</hi> I know not which way to goe; I am
ready to loſe my ſelfe, I ſee nothing here
<hi>now</hi> but huge Gyants, the ſonnes of <hi>Anack,
ſtrong corruptions,</hi> inclining and forcing
me to evill: moſt fearefull and violent ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions
and temptations of the Devill, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to thruſt me into the gulfe of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and deſpaire.</p>
            <p>And now, the ſoule begins to thinke that
it is good for it to returne again into Egypt,
to fall to its old courſes againe: for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God lookes for no ſuch matter, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62504:38"/>
no ſuch ſtrictneſſe and preciſeneſſe:
And ſo it falls a whining and repining at
the Word and Miniſters of God that have
call'd men to it, and laid it upon them: and
hath no heart now to do thus and thus any
longer. And <hi>thus</hi> it falls into diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
becauſe of the way, and into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>quandaries</hi> whether it may not goe
back againe or no. And all theſe murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
and repinings, are becauſe men ſuffer
themſelves to be diſcouraged.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>diſcouragements will cauſe thee
to thinke that God hates thee.</hi> When the
ſoule like <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, hath been crying
from morning to noone; ten, twenty, thirty
yeeres, it may be, and yet hath no anſwer:
<hi>now,</hi> it will begin to thinke <hi>if God did love
me, then he would grant me my petitions.</hi>
Then hereupon comes into a mans ſecret
thoughts and feares <hi>that God hardly loves his
ſoule.</hi> So was it with <hi>Iſrael;</hi> when they
were diſcouraged, they ſaid, <hi>becauſe the
Lord hated us, therefore he brought us out of
the Land of Egypt,</hi> Deut. 1. 27. Becauſe that
they were diſcouraged, and becauſe that
their Brethren that went for ſpies, had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartned
them; therefore they were apt to
ſay the Lord hated them.</p>
            <p>Beloved, it is a miſerable thing when
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62504:38"/>
the ſoule calls the love of God into queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Conſider that as thou canſt not have
a friend if thou beeſt ſuſpitious and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of his love to thee: So, thou canſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have the love of God ſettled on thy
heart ſo long as thou art jealous of his
love to thee.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>If thou root them not out, it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
to be feared that they will bring thee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire.</hi>
Melancholy thoughts and feares,
and diſcouragements, drive the ſoule to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire.
For when the ſoule ſees it ſelfe ſtill
diſappointed of its hopes, at the laſt it
grows hopeleſſe: If it have waited one day
and the next day too: if it have praied this
weeke, this month, this yeare, and yet ſtill
it ſeeth it ſelfe held off and diſappointed:
it will at laſt grow hopeleſſe. Take heed
therefore, I beſeech you, of all needleſſe
diſcouragements; to fear be auſe that thou
findeſt not that that thou wiſhedſt or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt
for, to day or to morrow, in thine own
time, that therefore thou ſhalt <hi>never</hi> get it,
that now thou ſhouldeſt for ever deſpaire
of the grace and love of God, and thinke
that now God will never heare thee, that
thou ſhalt never get grace and power over
thy corruptions.</p>
            <p>Men thinke that the preaching of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62504:39"/>
Word of God brings men to deſpaire, the
preaching of ſuch <hi>ſtrict</hi> points, and the urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch <hi>preciſe</hi> doctrines makes men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire:
men are loth to be at the paines to
root out their diſcouragements: It is rather
a cold or dead preaching of the Word that
is the cauſe of this: for when the ſoule is
<hi>inſtructed by holineſſe,</hi> humbled by holineſſe,
converted by holineſſe, at the laſt when it
comes to be thorowly awakened, when it
ſees that <hi>this</hi> and <hi>this</hi> is required in a true
converſion of the ſoule to God, that <hi>herein</hi>
true repentance muſt declare and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
it ſelfe by <hi>theſe</hi> and <hi>theſe</hi> fruits, or
elſe it is but falſe and rotten: Why now,
the ſoul muſt needs be brought to deſpaire,
becauſe it ſeeth that though it have been
thus and thus humbled, though it have
praied, faſted and mourned in this and this
manner: yet it ſees it hath not a <hi>ſoundneſſe</hi>
of grace.</p>
            <p>There is ſuch a grace in it, ſuch a worke
and ſuch a fruit of Gods Spirit in it, that
yet he could never finde in himſelfe: this
makes the ſoule to deſpaire. Indeed Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
may be too blame if they ſpeake and
preach <hi>onely</hi> the terrours and condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Law without the promiſes of the
Goſpel: for <hi>theſe</hi> ſhould be ſo tempered
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62504:39"/>
that every poore broken ſoule may ſee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and redemption for him upon his ſound
and unfeined repentance and humiliation.
But if men doe deſpaire, they may thanke
themſelves for it, their owne ſinnes for it,
their owne diſcouragements for it, becauſe
they ſuffer theſe to continue in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cain</hi> his heart grew ſad, his countenance
fell, he was wroth and diſquieted in his

<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. Sin lay at the dore, (what dore?) the
dore of his conſcience rapping and beating
upon his heart.</p>
            <p>Beloved, when the ſoule lets ſinne lie at
the dore: drunkeneſſe, pride and worldli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſecurity, hardnes and deadnes of heart
lie at the dore: when a man lets his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent

at the dore, when a man lets his vaine and
dead praying, his temporizing and faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

to tell him that all his hearing of
the word of God profits him nothing, that
his praiers are dead and vaine, that his
mourning, faſting, and all his humiliation

no ſoundneſſe of grace in him, but that for
all this he may fall into hell: <hi>when ſinne ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

            <p>
               <hi>Cain</hi> let his ſinne lie at the dore, there it
lay rapping and beating, and told him that
his careleſeneſſe and negligent ſacrificing
to God was not accepted: and therefore no
marvell if <hi>Cain</hi> be ſo caſt down in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
and that he fall to deſpaire.</p>
            <p>O beloved, when ſinne lieth bouncing
and beating at the dore of thy heart, when
thy ſinne (whatſoever it is, ſearch thy heart
and finde it out) lies knocking and rapping
at the dore of thy conſcience <hi>day by day,</hi> and
month by month, and thou art content to
let it lie, and art unwilling to uſe meanes to
remove it, and art loth to take the paines to
get the bloud of Chriſt to waſh thy ſoule
from it, or the Spirit of Chriſt to cleanſe
thee from it; then thy ſoule will deſpaire,
either in this world, or in the world to
come. But let us take heede then, that our
conſcience condemne us not in any thing or
courſe that we allow in our ſelves: for if
<hi>that doe,</hi> then much more will God who is
greater then our conſciences, and knowes
all things.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle hath an excellent Phraſe:
<hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is no condemnation to them
that are in Chriſt Jeſus &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62504:40"/>
ſay, there is not <hi>one</hi> condemnation; there is
none in <hi>Heaven,</hi> God doth not condemne
them; there is none in <hi>earth,</hi> their owne
heart and conſcience doth not condemne
them; he that is in Chriſt Jeſus, that walks
not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit, there
is none, no <hi>not one</hi> condemnation to him;
<hi>none,</hi> neither in Heaven nor in earth: no
word, no commandement, no threatning
condemnes him. But if thy conſcience
condemne thee, and tell thee thou letteſt ſin
lie at the dore, rapping at thy conſcience
day after day, and month after month,
telling thee that yet thou art <hi>without Chriſt,</hi>
that yet thou never hadſt any true faith in
the Lord Jeſus, that yet thou haſt not <hi>truely</hi>
repented, and turned from thy ſinnes: this
will at laſt drive thy ſoule into <hi>heavie</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
if not into <hi>finall</hi> deſpaire.</p>
            <p>O beloved, religion and piety, and the
power of godlineſſe, goe downe the winde
every where. What is the reaſon of it, but
becauſe of theſe diſcouragements that men
live and go in? Men pray and pray, and
their prayers profit them not: men run up
and downe and come to the Church and
heare the Word, and receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and uſe the meanes of grace, but to
no <hi>end: they</hi> are unprofitable to them: they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62504:41"/>
remaine in their ſinnes ſtill: the ordinances
of God bring them not out of their luſts
and corruptions: hereby they diſgrace and
diſcredit the ordinances of God in the eyes
and account of the men of the world, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them thinke as if there were no more
power nor force in the Ordinances of God
then theſe men manifeſt.</p>
            <p>There is no life in many Chriſtians, mens
ſpirits are diſcouraged; theſe ſecret diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
in their hearts take away their
ſpirits in the uſe of the meanes, that though
they uſe the meanes, yet it drives them to
deſpaire of reaping good or profit by
them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Beloved, I could here tell you enough to
make your hearts ake to heare it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>all your complaints they are but winde,</hi>
Job 6. 26. doe you imagine to reprove
words, and the ſpeeches of one that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
which are as winde? <hi>Jobs</hi> friends
taking <hi>Job</hi> to be a man of deſpaire, they
accounted all his words but as winde.</p>
            <p>Doeſt thou neſtle any diſcouragement in
thy heart? thou maiſt complaine of ſinne
as much as thou canſt: yet all thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainings
are but as winde: thou maiſt cry
out againſt thy corruptions, with weeping
and teares, and pray and fight againſt them:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62504:41"/>
and yet all thy weeping, mourning and
praying is but as the winde: thou maieſt
beg grace, thou maiſt ſeeke after God, thou
maiſt heare the Word, receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and yet all will be to thee as wind:
all will vaniſh, be unprofitable, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>diſcouragements drive us from</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
               <hi>the uſe of the meanes.</hi> If ever we meane to
come out of our ſinnes, if ever we meane
to get grace and faith, and aſſurance, and
zeale: we <hi>muſt conſtantly</hi> uſe the meanes,
1 Sam. 27. 1. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, there is nothing
better for me then that I ſhould ſpeedily
eſcape into the Land of the Philiſtims, and
<hi>Saul</hi> ſhall deſpaire of me to ſeeke me any
more. <hi>David</hi> thought in himſelfe, if I can
make him out of hope of finding me, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
he will give over ſeeking of me. So
when the ſoule hath any ſecret deſpaire of
finding the Lord, that ſoule will quickly be
drawne from ſeeking of the Lord in the uſe
of the meanes.</p>
            <p>What ever you doe then, O be not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged,
leſt you be driven from the uſe
of the meanes: if you be driven from the
uſe of the <hi>meanes,</hi> woe is to you, you will
never finde God then. Be not driven from
praier, nor driven from holy conference,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62504:42"/>
nor driven from the Word, nor driven from
the Sacrament, nor from meditation, nor
from the diligent and ſtrict examination of
thy ſelfe, of thy heart and of all thy waies:
for theſe are the waies of finding the Lord.
If you nouriſh any thoughts and feares of
deſpaire in you, if you be diſcouraged, you
will be driven from the uſe of the meanes,
which is a lamentable thing; therefore be
not diſcouraged.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, diſcouragements will make you
ſtand poaring on your former courſes, <hi>thus
I ſhould have done, and that I ſhould have
done, woe is me that I did it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> it will make
a man ſtand poaring on his ſinnes, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
able to get out of them. So it was like
to be with them in the Ship with <hi>Paul, Acts</hi>
27. 20. In the tempeſt at Sea, they were
utterly diſcouraged from any hope of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
now indeed <hi>Paul</hi> told them what they
ſhould have done if they had been wiſe:
Sirs, <hi>you ſhould have hearkned to me, and not
have looſed,</hi> ver. 21. as if he had ſaid, you
ſhould have done thus and thus: but <hi>now</hi>
doe not ſtand poaring too much on that,
you ſhould have hearkned to me, and not
have launched forth, &amp;c. but that cannot
be holpen, <hi>now:</hi> therefore I exhort you to
be of good cheare, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:62504:42"/>
So beloved, when the ſoule is diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
upon theſe thoughts, <hi>I ſhould have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
better, I ſhould have heard the Word of God
better, and with more profit; I ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
better, I ſhould have performed this and
that religious and good dutie better; but ah
wretch that I am, I have ſinned thus and thus;</hi>
it is alwaies looking on this ſinne and that
ſinne, this imperfection and that failing:
when now I ſay the ſoule is diſcouraged, it
will be alwaies poaring upon ſinne, but it
will never come out of its ſinne; alwaies
poaring upon its deadneſſe, and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe,
but never able to come out of it.
O beloved, be of good cheare, and be not
diſcouraged; it is true you ſhould have
prayed better; you ſhould have heard the
Word of God better heretofore, you ſhould
have been more carefull and circumſpect of
your wayes then you were; but now you
cannot helpe it; theſe things and times are
gone and cannot be recalled: ſuch a one
hath been a drunkard, a ſwearer, a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
&amp;c. but he cannot helpe it now. True,
he might have helped it, and becauſe he did
not, his heart ſhall bleed for it, if he belong
to God: but doe not ſtand poaring too
much upon it, but conſider <hi>now</hi> what you
have to doe, <hi>now</hi> you are to humble your
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62504:43"/>
ſelfe, now you are to ſtrive with God in all
manner of prayer for more grace, and more
power of obedience and aſſurance, and be
not diſcouraged.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>if the ſoule be diſcouraged, it
will breed nothing but ſorrow.</hi> What is the
reaſon that many Chriſtians are alwaies
weeping, and mourning, and ſighing, and
ſobbing, from day to day, all their life
time, and will not be comforted? becauſe
of theſe diſcouragements, 1 Theſ. 4. 13.
<hi>Sorrow not</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as thoſe that
have no hope,</hi> as if he had ſaid, ſorrow if
you will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but do not ſorrow as they that
have no hope.</p>
            <p>How is that? it is a ſorrow with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſorrow, from which they have
no hope of inlargement or freedome.</p>
            <p>O then my brethren, ſuppoſe you have
dead hearts, ſuppoſe you want zeale, you
want aſſurance; ſuppoſe it be ſo, yet labour
to attaine theſe graces; ſorrow and ſpare
not; weepe and mourne, and powre out
whole buckets of teares for your ſinnes, if
you can: but, <hi>ſorrow not with nothing but
ſorrow:</hi> be not diſcouraged: ſuppoſe that
thou haſt a dead heart, that thou art an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
that thou haſt a rotten heart; it is a
heavie thing, and a fearefull caſe indeed,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62504:43"/>
for which thou haſt great cauſe of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and ſorrow; but yet <hi>ſorrow not deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately</hi>
as men without hope: be not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcouraged, but as you ſorrow for
your ſins, ſo alſo labour with incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to get out and be rid of your ſins.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>diſcouragements breed and procure</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
               <hi>a totall perplexity.</hi> They leave the ſoule in
a maze, that it knowes not whether to turne
it ſelfe. When men come to be diſcouraged,
<hi>Oh what ſhall I doe</hi> ſaith one, <hi>I am utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done</hi>
ſaith another: <hi>I know not what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of me,</hi> ſaith a third: <hi>Oh I am utterly loſt,
I ſhall periſh one day, one day God will diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
me, and be avenged on me for this and that
ſin: I were as good go to hell at the firſt as at the
laſt, for that will be the end of me: I have gon
to prayer, but that doth not helpe me: I have
gone to Sacraments, but I finde no helpe: ſtill
my ſoule lies under the power of ſinne, ſtill
my ſinnes are as ſtrong in me as ever:</hi> Thus
the ſoule is diſcouraged and cryes out, <hi>Oh,
what ſhall I doe? I know not what to doe. What
ſhall I doe</hi> ſayeſt thou?</p>
            <p>Alas, thou haſt things enough to doe, if
thou wert not diſcouraged. <hi>Utterly undone!</hi>
No, man, thou mighteſt ſee that thou art
not utterly undone, but that thou art diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.
Doſt thou not know what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62504:44"/>
of thee? yea, poore ſoule, there is
mercy, grace and peace <hi>for thee,</hi> if thou
wilt not be diſcouraged.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, <hi>diſcouragements whiſper within a
man a ſentence of death, and an impoſsibility
of eſcaping.</hi> As far as the diſcouragement
of life goeth, ſo farre goeth the ſentence of
death. <hi>We deſpaired of life, and had the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death in our ſelves,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8. 9. he deſpaired of life in himſelf,
and therefore had the ſentence of death in
himſelfe; this was good, but he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire
of life in God; for <hi>then</hi> he ſhould
have had likewiſe the ſentence of death
from God in his conſcience.</p>
            <p>If you deſpaire in the Lord, you have
the ſentence of death and damnation from
God in your conſcience; take heed of this
my beloved; be not diſcouraged in God:
do not deſpaire in the Lord: <hi>that</hi> will
worke a <hi>miſerable</hi> effect in your ſoules: it
will ſecretly whiſper a ſentence of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in your ſoules.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange to conſider how many poore
ſoules rub on with theſe whiſpering ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in their boſomes, ſuffering their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
day by day to tell them that they are
rotten, to tell them that they were never yet
converted, to tell them that they are yet in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62504:44"/>
the ſtate of damnation, and yet they will
not root out theſe diſcouragements.</p>
            <p>O goe to the <hi>Throne of grace,</hi> beg for
grace and for mercy, and for power againſt
ſinne, and be not diſcouraged. What?
wilt thou carry thy owne ſentence of death
in thy breſt? if thou wilt not rouze up thy
ſoule, and pray with more affection and
confidence, and ſhake off diſcouragements,
take heed leſt thou carry the ſentence of
thy own death and damnation in thy bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.
O therefore <hi>once more</hi> let me beſeech
you to take heed of theſe diſcouragements,
and now hearken to the voice of God
which calleth upon you, <hi>feare not. Thou
dreweſt nigh in the day that I called upon thee,
thou ſaidſt feare not.</hi>
