            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Gentlemen, You of theſe ſeveral Juries,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>VVHen I look upon you, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the perſons, 1. To whom I am to ſpeak: Some of you Men grown Gray in this imployment, and that know as much what belongs to it, as I can tell you: Or when I look upon others, 2. Before whom I am to ſpeak, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen much better able to doe it than my ſelf, I cannot but think ſome ſuch thing may befall Me, as did that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who moſt preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly undertook to inſtruct <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the Diſcipline of War: A Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited man, bred up another way, and in ſtudies of another Nature; yet out of 1. Arrogancy, and 2. Ignorance, would give <hi>Hannibal</hi> a Diſcipline in his own Art, wherein he was ſo famouſly eminent (I would ſpare it, without 1. Envy, and 2. Offence, To the 1. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43184:3"/>
and the 2. Dead) That for Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Wiſdom, he was to be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed One, even amongſt the Greateſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals that ever appeared in the Head of an Army: And what I have to ſpeak to you here, may prove as that he did there, not only Needleſs, but Abſurd and ridiculous.</p>
            <p>However, yet (under Favour of thoſe that hear it) Give me leave, though not in a way, To 1. Inſtruct you in your Duty, as if I thought you Ignorant: No, nor yet To 2. Direct you, as if I thought you Unskilful, or Unexperienced; But only To 3. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind, or Remember you of it.</p>
            <p>You are here three ſeveral Juries, of 1. Surveigh, and 2. Inquiry: And for order and method I ſhall reduce all that I have to ſay to you, to Three general heads. Firſt, I ſhall declare to you What you are to View, in order to your Surveigh. Secondly, What you are to Preſent in order to your Inquiry: And Thirdly, How you are to Preſent, ſo as to perfect both. Theſe three, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive comprehend your whole Duty. The Firſt tells you what you are to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43184:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ride about, when you are gone from hence. The Second tells you what you are to do, when you come hither again. The Third tells you in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner you are to do it; of theſe with as much clearneſs and ſhortneſs as I may.</p>

                  </gap> to View</note> For the Firſt, what you are to View. I do take it, they are all ſuch things as are properly within the defence of the Laws of Sewers, and do concern, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 1. Navigation, or 2. Drayning, or 3. common Land-paſſage in ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime Countries as this is.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</note> Firſt then, One great end of your View and Enquiry, is to preſerve Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation; that is, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe of the Word in matters of Sew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, all manner of paſſage by water; and this doth not only 1. employ the Merchant, and many more under him, and make him to abound; but it alſo 2. enriches the Common Treaſury by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, and 3. upholds the general Trade and Traffique of the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and is in a ſpecial manner advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious to ſuch Countries as this, that are adjacent to the Sea: for hereby, as you may Export many of your home-grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43184:4"/>
Commodities, and ſell them abroad at the deareſt Rates, So ſuch as are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and brought in 1. from forein Countries, or 2. from other Countries within your own, you buy them with the 1. firſt, and at the 2. cheapeſt; and other Upland-places cannot have them, but 1. from you, or 2. after you.</p>
            <p>Now the Commiſſion of Sewers, in a matter of ſuch great import as this of Navigation, is very exact and careful, 1. Firſt, In reſpect of all kinds of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, 1. Whether it be with Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels <note place="margin">Of Ships, Boats, Ballin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note>of the greateſt bulk, as Ships. 2. Or with Veſſels of the ſmalleſt kind, as Boats. 3. Or with Veſſels of a middle nature, as Ballingers; which many take to ſignifie certain kinds of Veſſels, immediately employed about the lading or unloading of Ships; in ſome of the greateſt Rivers of this Nation (as I am informed) there be ſome of the greater ſort of Veſſels, of this very name, and for this very uſe; and are freſh-water Veſſels, of the greateſt bulk, framed with Oares, and without Sails: I ſhall neither trouble my ſelf, nor you, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Original of the Word: There

               <hi>Minſius</hi> in this his Opinion, I ſhould have a farther trouble to tell you who brought it hither; therefore I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and plainly tell you, in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, I take it to ſignifie the ſame with your <hi>Naviculae Actuariae</hi> amongſt the <hi>Latines,</hi> ſuch as be the Ballingers, or Balaſters, properly ſo called, we have already ſpoken of: As alſo your Barges, and your Keels, and all other kinds of your greater freſh-water Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, carrying Anchors in them; by the one they are diſtinguiſhed from Ships, by the other from Boats.</p>

               <note place="margin">In Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Streams, and other Floods.</note> 2. Secondly, In this Point of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation the Commiſſion is very exact, in reſpect of all Waters that be in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Navigable; I mean in caſe they be ſo 1. of common right, (which being once ſpoken, I would have it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in every part of my Diſcourſe; for the Commiſſion defends not any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, nor any water-courſe, but the common water-courſe, and the common Navigation only) and then, whether it be in greater or in leſſer Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43184:5"/>
in ſmoother or in rougher Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; that is, in 1. Rivers, 2. Streams, or 3. other Floods, doubtleſs it is to be preſerved; and the Commiſſion doth in ſpecie, and in particular, nominate eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Drayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> The ſecond ſort of things you are to view, are ſuch as concern Drayning, and theſe be ſuch as directly preſerve your Country, and do immediately concern the very Being, both 1. of the Country, and 2. of you in it. Now theſe are of two ſorts, Firſt, ſuch as preſerve the Country from being Drowned, by keeping out the Waters. Secondly, ſuch as make the Country dry, by iſſuing out the Waters.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Defences that preſerve the Country from being Drowned, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Waters, the principal of them; and ſuch as are expreſly named <note place="margin">Walls, and Banks.</note>in the Commiſſion, are 1. your Walls, and 2. your Banks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curious in the diſtinguiſhing of them: ſuch as diſtinguiſh them in regard of the Materialls whereof they conſiſt, and will have a Bank to be only of Earth, and a Wall only of Stone, will hardly

               </gap>erive our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Wall, from the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Vallum;</hi> for, that that was uſually of Earth, is out of all queſtion. For my part, I conceive the difference to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ather in the manner of the Defence: So that if they be main Defences, both for height, and ſtrength, and ſecurity; if they do, <hi>Vallo munire,</hi> be of the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Country, that an Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to an Army; I doe take them to be Walls, though made of Earth; ſuch as your Sea-walls are, both in Fact, and in Name. 2. And all ſmaller, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Defences, I take to be Banks.</p>
            <p>Now your Walls, or your Banks, (it matters not much by which of theſe Names you uſually call them, for they are both expreſly in the Commiſſion) are of three ſeveral ſorts, or kinds. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Rivers</hi> 2. <hi>Banks.</hi>
               </note>Firſt, ſuch as defend againſt the Rivers, and your other greater Sewers, and the freſh-waters therein Deſcending; and theſe have a two-fold benefit. 1. The one, in that they make a ſtream, and inchanel the waters, which makes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much to Navigation. 2. The other, in that they ſecure the Country, and preſerve the ſame from Inundation,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43184:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which certainly makes as much to drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and <hi>Gent.</hi> ſuch may be the violence of ſome of theſe Rivers, and that I may ſpeak with relation to our own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar concernments, that of <hi>Welland</hi> is known to be ſuch, that if it be not kept within Banks, and the Banks thereof ſtrongly defended, ſome parts of this Country will be in yearly danger of being drowned, either Northernly, as far as <hi>Boſton,</hi> or Southernly, as far as <hi>Sutton,</hi> or Eaſternly, upon the Towns that ſuffered under it this laſt VVinter; even as the VVinds ſhall chance to drive the VVaters, and the Fens. And therefore I would have you take ſo far notice of your danger, as now, while you may, to prevent it; and, by ſecuring of theſe River-Banks, to ſecure your Country.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">Fen-Banks.</note> 2.

               <note place="margin">Sewars.</note> 4. Fourthly, Sewars; and they are to be accounted amongſt your grand Iſſuers of water; from whence I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they carry their name <hi>(Sewars, quaſi Iſſuers.)</hi> I ſhall take his opinion, who delivers them to be Currents of water, kept in on both ſides with banks; and in ſome ſenſe, they may be called, a certain kind of a little or ſmall River. But as for the derivation of the word Sewar, from two of our Engliſh words, Sea and Were, or as others will have it, Sea and Ward, give me leave, now I have mentioned
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43184:9"/>
it, to leave it to your judgements. However this word, Sewar, is very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous amongſt us, both for giving the Title to the Commiſſion of Sewars it ſelf, and for being the ordinary name of moſt of your common Water-courſes, for Drayning in the Country; and therefore I preſume, there are none of you, of theſe Juries, but both know 1. what your Sewars ſignifie, and alſo in particular 2. what they are; and of a thing ſo generally known, and of ſuch general uſe, I ſhall uſe no more words to you, but that you have a ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and care of them.</p>
            <p>And thus much of your Water-cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which relate only to Drayning, and have no living Fountains from whence they are fed, but are only Drains, and ſerve to diſcharge and carry off the ſurpluſage of other waters; ſuch other waters I mean, as either 1. have their immediate downfall from the Heavens amongſt us, 2. or deſcend from Upland Countries to us, 3. or are the Over-ſtowings of Rivers and greater Streams upon us. Four kinds there are of them, as you have heard; two of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43184:9"/>
them of private and particular charge and benefit only, as your 1. Gutters, and 2. your Ditches: other two of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and general charge and uſe, as 3. your Trenches, and 4. your Sewers. Now will you ſee, how they ſtand in order, and relate one to another? Take it briefly thus. Your 1. Gulters, they bring the waters from off your Grounds to your Ditches. 2. Your Ditches, they bring the waters down to your Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. 3. Your Trenches, they carry them out to your Sewers. And 4. your Sewers, they carry them away to the Sea. And of them thus much.</p>
            <p>The remaining Water-Courſes, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Commiſſion, are ſuch as relate both to Drayning, and alſo to Navigation, and that in an Eminent Manner: And they are your Streams, and your Rivers.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <note place="margin">Streams.</note> 5. Fifthly, Streams, I do take for ſuch Currents of water, as have both a 1 Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and a 2 Conſtant Source from whence they Flow. You may make two ſorts of them. Firſt, ſuch as do conveigh the water from the Fountain to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: ſome of theſe, which do deſcend
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43184:10"/>

                  </gap>i</hi> is ſuch a Stream, and though this, as all other Streams of this nature, be Navigable but with Boats, that is with Veſſels of the ſmalleſt ſize only, yet as I formerly told you, ſuch Navigation is to be preſerved. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe Streams are a great advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all Navigation; whereupon, the Author of the Readings upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Sewars, no leſs truly than elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, calls the Springs from whence they Flow, the very Vital Spirits of all the Rivers in the Land. Secondly, other Streams there be, which have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to make a Navigable paſſage from one great River to another, call them Leams or Streams, it matters not much, as long as you ſignifie the ſame thing with me; and theſe very prudently have been deviſed, as helps to inlarge Navigation, and ſo farr only to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, as they inlarge it, and better it: For where, 1. they either make Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

And thus much concerning Streams, which I take to be ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed from all the former Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Courſes, in that they have a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ain, and a conſtant Fountain or Source, from whence they Flow, which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her want.</p>

Other Drayns you have, I confeſs; But your Rivers, 1. They are the grand conveyers of the water from the Fountain to the Sea, which they ought to bear down, 1. in their own Chanels, 2. and other adjacent receptacles, till they diſcharge it there: And ſo they carry away the miſchief, 1. of Springs wholly, and 2. of Land-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alſo, as to the greateſt part of it.</p>
            <p>Again, 2. The Rivers they keep o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a Chanel or vent into the Sea, and ſo give an Outfall, both, 1. to their own waters, and 2. to all your other Drains too; without which, your Drains all of them would be uſeleſs; For you had as good have no Drain, as they to have no Outfall: So that I may well ſay, without Rivers, there would be neither 1. Navigation, nor 2. Draining to any purpoſe. Therefore, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> It concerns you, to take ſpecial notice of your Rivers. There are ſome, four as

That for the Perſons you would Preſent, not ſo much as their Names are to be found in them, they being no otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed than by ſuppoſition, as Owner of ſuch Lands, or Heir, or Aſſignee to one deceaſed, and theſe ſignifie juſt

no-body the Court can take notice of, without another Jury to enquire who they be. 2. In others of them, if you have Preſented the Perſons fully, yet they, upon peruſal of your Verdict, could not certainly know for what: ſo that having 1. many Works of the ſame condition in ſeveral parcels, or 2. much Work contigiouſly adjacent in one, they could not certainly know what thereof to amend, ſo as to amend what was Preſented; and all this, becauſe you have not aſcertained the 1. Default, or if that, not 2. the juſt and proper Place of it. Theſe are the common Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Uncertainties of moſt of your Preſentments, and I tell you plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of them, that no more ſuch may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Court.</p>

Neither could this Power, in ſuch manner as it was granted to <hi>Lovell,</hi> be any wayes 1. unreaſonable, or 2. injurious. 1. Not unreaſonable, becauſe theſe Works were to be made at his only charge, and as for the ſucceſs of them, that was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be wholly upon his ſole adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and hazard. 2. Nor injurious, for none could ever have had juſt cauſe of complaint,—in caſe 1. the work of Drayning had, according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of his undertaking. been perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the Fens:—and 2. the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar

And give me leave, ſeeing it falls directly to my purpoſe, to obſerve to you the preſent condition of <hi>Deeping</hi> Fen.</p>
            <p>On the one ſide of it, Firſt, All the VVaters of <hi>Thurlby,</hi> and <hi>Burne</hi> Fen, and of that part of the Country deſcending into that Fen, are wholly iſſued into it. Secondly, The Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of the River of <hi>Glean,</hi> and the whole miſchief thereof, upon all Floods, and increaſe of VVaters, is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:43184:40"/>
wholly avoided upon it; and all this miſchief falls directly upon the ſaid Fen ſince <hi>Lovells</hi> time, and by new Works of his deviſing: ſuch as is, 1. the Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell aforeſaid, and 2. the Slakers on <hi>Baſſon</hi> Bank, and 3. the exalting the Banks for Defence on <hi>Thurlby</hi> and <hi>Burne</hi> ſide, much above their antient heighths: Works contrived on purpoſe for the 1. turning the Waters in hither, and the 2. taking them off from <hi>Thurlby</hi> and <hi>Burne</hi> Fen, which was formerly their antient Receptacle: and, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſcore only, heretofore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed one of the beſt Pike-Fens in the Country.—On the other ſide of it, beſides the ſurrounder thereof by its own proper Waters; ſuch 1. as fall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther immediately upon it, or 2. have their courſe into it, 3. to look upon the River of <hi>Welland,</hi> that great River, and well to conſider the great violence thereof: one half of whoſe ſtreams, not long ſince, had their paſſage to the Sea another way, through <hi>Croyland;</hi> and yet even then, a great part of its Over-flowings upon all Floods, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by <hi>South-Ea</hi> Lake, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where into the great Levell: Now I
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:43184:41"/>
ſay, to conſider the ſaid great River, 1. banked out on all hands ſecurely from thence: 2. loſt below in its Out-fall to the Sea: and the violent ſtreams and rage thereof, 3. thruſt and ſtraitned into one Chanel above: and 4. turned wholly upon this one poor Fen: This I ſay, being well conſidered; and this being the preſent condition of this Fen, it concerns us all nearly, to look care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to it, and to keep out all ſuch of theſe Waters, as legally may 1. either be kept out of it, 2. or kept off from it: otherwiſe the truth is, this Fen will not be long able to contain them, but muſt of neceſſity diſcharge them, to the unavoidable deſtruction of ſuch Towns as are ſeated below it towards the Sea.</p>
            <p>And although I know many of an Opinion, that by the Commiſſion, ſuch Works of <hi>Lovells</hi> as theſe may be totally removed, and deſtroyed, <hi>a Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damento:</hi> yet it is unqueſtionably cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the miſchief of them may, and ought to be totally removed: And to that purpoſe, 1. ſome of them may be abated, 2. others of them are to be ſtopt up, and made uſeleſs: if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,

Or Thirdly, in the laſt place, To uſe the Authority of the preſent Commiſſion of Sewers, and to lay the Charge of them, 1. upon the whole Fens, and the Commoners therein, that receive the benefit of them,

2. or to aſſign and decree ſome reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble 1. part of the Fens, or the 2. profits of it, as to that purpoſe—And here give me leave to obſerve to you, that no new Charge is to be impoſed upon the Fens, or the Commoners, by virtue of the Commiſſion, (without the Owners and Commoners conſent thereto) but 1. where the antient Charge is 1. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, or 2. extinguiſhed: 2. and where <hi>Lovell,</hi> his Heirs, and Aſſignes, are 1. acquitted, or 2. are not in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or capacity, by the power of the Commiſſion, to be compelled. This way of Charge I mentioned to you in the laſt place, and it is only to be made uſe of in the laſt place, when all other wayes fail: and for 1. neceſſity, or 2. conveniency to ſupply their defects. And having obſerved this to you, I now proceed to declare unto you, with as much warineſs and cautiouſneſs as I can, where the Works, formerly in Charge of <hi>Lovell,</hi> according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions I obſerved amongſt them, are now to be charged.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And in the firſt place, we have already told you, that amongſt the Works of <hi>Lovells</hi> own deviſing, ſome

               </note> of them are not to be continued, b reaſon of their miſchief; and therefore, as to theſe, you need not enquire who is chargeable: And of them I ſhall need ſay no more, but, that if any Perſons of their own accord, would offer to bear the Charge of them, they are not to be admitted, becauſe the Works them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not to be ſuffered.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, As to the reſt of the Draynes and Works deviſed by <hi>Lovell,</hi> or his Aſſignes, that are of uſe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, you are to conſider well where to Charge them; for, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent miſchief and danger to the Country, they can neither be 1. left, nor 2. loſt.—And as to theſe, I take <note place="margin">But not by way of antient Charge: but upon</note>it to be clear, that no antient Charge can be put upon them, becauſe they themſelves are not antient Works. They are Works, <hi>de Novo,</hi> of <hi>Lovells</hi> own deviſing, and could not be in Charge before they were in Being: 'Tis true, that ſome of them, if not all of them, do ſupply the uſe of ſuch antient Works as by <hi>Lovell</hi> were deſerted, and are now irrecoverably decayed and loſt: But, as I take it, though <hi>Lovell</hi> might at his pleaſure transfer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:43184:44"/>
the Work; yet becauſe that was not the ſame Work, <hi>in Individuo,</hi> with the antient one, but another, and a new Work in lieu of it, he could not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr the antient Charge, and affix that to a new Work of his own deviſing: but the antient Work being extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and loſt, the antient Charge is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed and loſt with it, and no Law I know of can remove it hither to theſe new ones. So then, the Charge of theſe VVorks muſt be put 1. either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lovell:</hi> Or, The Fens.</note>

Thirdly, As to thoſe other Draynes and VVorks that <hi>Lovell</hi> made not, but only made uſe of; VVorks of antient Charge, and continued on, but with great Alterations and Enlargements. As to theſe, I conceive, 1. If they ſhould be reduced to their antient Charge, that would be to little purpoſe, for that would not maintain them in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Enlargements. 2. Or if the Draynes and VVorks themſelves ſhould be reduced to their antient Proportions, that would be of worſe conſequence;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:43184:45"/>
for as to moſt of them, they are in that manner contrived, and fitted to their preſent Chanels and Currents, that to reduce them now to what formerly they were, would be little leſs than to ſpoyl <note place="margin">Not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the antient Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers: but upon</note>and deſtroy them. And I take it to be clear, 3. That the antient Charge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be enlarged in a proportion to the Enlargement of the VVorks; for the antient Charge, was a Charge fixed by the common Law, upon certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by reaſon of their Tenure of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lands or Mannours, or for other certain conſideration: A known fixed Charge, and aſcertained, and not to be ſtretched no more than the Law it ſelf <note place="margin">Lovell: <hi>Or,</hi>
               </note>that fixed it.—Now that <hi>Lovell</hi> might well charge himſelf, and his Heirs, and Aſſignes, as to theſe Enlargements, I hold it agreeable both to Law and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe they were VVorks done 1. by his own will, 2. and upon his own adventure: but that <hi>Lovell</hi> thereby, ſhould at his own pleaſure, and for his own advantage, increaſe the Charge of another, and lay a new Incumbrance upon another mans Lands and Eſtate, I, for my part, hold unreaſonable, and altogether improbable.—So theſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:43184:45"/>
VVorks likewiſe, have none to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, in the proportion they are now in, unleſs they, as to their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Enlargements, may be charged 1. upon <hi>Lovell,</hi> his Heirs, and Aſſignes, <note place="margin">The Fens.</note>that enlarged them: 2. or upon the Fens that ſhall receive profit thereby.</p>

Equitable difference amongſt them at leaſt, even as they ſtand in relation to <hi>Lovell,</hi> and his Aſſignes: and a 2.

Firſt then, Some of theſe are ſuch as <hi>Lovell</hi> charged himſelf withall, without any reaſon or conſideration, more than his bare will and pleaſure: And thus the River of <hi>Glean,</hi> ſo far as the Town of <hi>Surfleet</hi> was antiently charged with the ſame, became <hi>Lovells</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:43184:46"/>
Charge and VVork: 'Tis true, they of <hi>Surfleet</hi> have <hi>Lovells</hi> Covenant for their diſcharge, but that is no abſolute Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, but only a bare Covenant, ſuch as it is, without Conſideration too, to diſcharge, or ſave harmleſs; which if he do, it is well, and no more can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired; <note place="margin">Return to their antient Charge.</note>but if he do not, they of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi> as I take it, may be compelled by the Commiſſioners of Sewers, to do their work in their antient manner and charge: and they have their remedy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at Law againſt <hi>Lovell,</hi> for not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his Covenant, where they <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lovell</hi> could not Charge the Fen-Lands with them longer than they were in his own hands.</note>may take it.—However, this I think I may ſpeak clearly to you, that although <hi>Lovell</hi> might charge the third part of theſe Fens, wherein they of <hi>Surfleet</hi> never had any intereſt, for the doing of this particular VVork of theirs, whilſt the ſaid third part was in his own poſſeſſion and diſpoſal: Yet, I take it, ſuch Charge is now become void, or ſuſpended at leaſt, upon the Re-entry of the Commoners, and during their holding of it: <hi>Lovell</hi> could create a Charge therein no further than 1. as for his own Eſtate, and 2. whilſt it was in his own hands: the Owners, and the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:43184:46"/>
Commoners, he could not, by any act of his, damnifie.—So <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> You are to make ſpecial Preſentment of the River of <hi>Glean,</hi> and to expreſs how far they of <hi>Surfleet</hi> have been antiently, and of right chargeable with the ſame. And you are alſo to make Enquiry 1. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the antient Charge of ſo much of the ſaid River, and 2. into the preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof; and to make particular Preſentment of them, upon ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in particular, 1. inhabiting, or 2. holding any Lands or Manours in the ſaid Town, as of right ought to amend them.</p>

            <p>And to avoid all difficulties, as to the defraying of the Charge of theſe Works wherein the Commoners in theſe Fens ſhall be any wayes concerned, I ſhall propound this to you, as a way of the greateſt eaſe, and of the greateſt equity: That the third part of theſe Fens, formerly held by <hi>Lovell,</hi> may
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:43184:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                  <hi>Lovells</hi> third part ſtill to be held in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veralty; and with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners conſent, that way employed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed.</note>with the conſent of the Owners and Commoners, the profits of it may be diſpoſed of, for the diſcharge of them. And if they ſhall think good to deſire it, a Decree of Sewers may be drawn up to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And thus far we have purſued <hi>Lovell,</hi> and his Works: But what if other Works, 1. that were never in the Charge of <hi>Lovell:</hi> 2. nor in the Charge of any other Perſon, appear to be of <note place="margin">The Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of <hi>VVel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </note>neceſſity, and of ſuch great neceſſity, as that without them, the maintaining or perfecting theſe VVorks in the Charge of <hi>Lovell</hi> would be to little uſe or purpoſe: Such as I conceive, may be the opening of the Sands, and the making of a new Current or Chanell in the River of <hi>Welland,</hi> for ſome Miles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether further towards the Sea than ever heretofore the ſaid River was in charge. I ſhall leave the 1. Neceſſity of this VVork wholly to your conſiderations; and withall to conſider well, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Court, 2. what is the true cauſe of the preſent decay or loſs of the River of <hi>Welland</hi> in its antient Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall; that in caſe of a new Charge, it

            <p>
               <note place="margin">All other Defaults and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences.</note> And thus I have altogether done with the grand Buſineſs of your Charge and Enquiry. But beſides this, 1. what other Works of Sewers you ſhall find in Default, or 2. what Offences you ſhall find committed, contrary to the Laws of Sewers, 1. either upon your own View and Knowledge, 2. or upon ſufficient Information from others, in your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, you are to take ſpecial notice of them; And ſuch Works in Default, you are to Preſent 1. upon the Perſons that ought to repair them: and ſuch Offences you are to Preſent 2. upon the Perſons that committed them.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I have ſpoken my mind to you 1. freely, and 2. plainly; And in any thing I have ſpoken wherein 1. you are not ſatisfied, you may conſult the Court: and in any thing wherein 2. the Court is not ſatisfied, I do humbly deſire it, they would be pleaſed better to inform you.</p>

            <p>YOU have heard a Petition, and the Order of the Court thereupon, read here; and they give you a ſhort account upon what Buſineſs you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hither: 'Tis to ſet out ſome 1. ſpeedy, and 2. effectual Courſe, for the Ditching of the River of <hi>Glean,</hi> from a place called <hi>Newbury,</hi> through
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:43184:51"/>
the Town of <hi>Surfleet,</hi> to its Outfall. This is the preſent work, both of us here, that be of the Court; and of you, that be of the Jury: And upon the whole matter, I ſhall propound three things to your Conſiderations: 1. The firſt ſhall be concerning the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the Work. 2. The ſecond concerning the Perſons upon whom the Work at preſent is to be Charged. 3. And the third concerning the Manner of that Charge.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Firſt, 'Tis for the Preſervation of Navigation: The loſs of this 1. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives many particular Men (that way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> You are to Enquire, <hi>1.</hi> Whether Boats, Barges, and other

Deterioration, much leſs to the 2. Deſtruction of it. And the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation thereof is one of the main Ends the Commiſſion of Sewers it ſelf was made for.</p>

               <note place="margin">

Secondly, 'Tis for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a very great and conſiderable part of the Country. This River is the only Outfall (that can lawfully be claimed) for the Drayning of the whole Townſhip of <hi>Pinchbeck,</hi> and for the Drayning of a great part of the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Spalding;</hi> and upon the loſs of this River, would unavoidably follow the loſs and deſtruction of one of theſe Townſhips at the leaſt. But beſides theſe two, many other Towns, Fields, Meadows, and Fens, in the adjacent parts of <hi>Keſteven,</hi> have, of antient Right and Cuſtom, iſſued their Waters
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:43184:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by this River to the Sea; and they all, of neceſſity, muſt ſuſtain great and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable Dammages in the loſs of it: A loſs too great, not only to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons having Intereſt; but alſo to the Body of the Common-wealth, in loſing ſuch a part of it ſelf; and no wayes by the Commiſsioners of Sewers to be ſuffered or endured. For, <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi> I would have you take notice of it, that the Preſervation of Towns and Grounds, heretofore through po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique wiſdom won, and made profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the benefit of the Common-wealth, is the chief thing within the charge and care of this Commiſsion.</p>
            <p>The Sea-coaſts upon this Country (you all very well know) is a flat, and a looſe Sand; and would ſoon ſilt, and ſtop up the Outfalls of the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, was it not for the Rivers, and the conſtant Streams of Water iſſuing down their Chanells. And I obſerve, that it hath been the prudence and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Predeceſſors, and ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as have been employed for the Preſervation of this Country, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Out-falls of the Rivers in their full deepneſs; and to lay what force of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:43184:52"/>
Water they could upon them, either by Fynnes, or ſuch other Devices, for the ſcouring out of the Sand.—Now this River of <hi>Glean,</hi> as to this very part of it from <hi>Newbury,</hi> that you now have in charge, 1. it being the Out-fall to the whole River, and 2. it being at preſent ſo greatly obſtructed, that by reaſon thereof, this River cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge its own Waters into the Sea: Look a little back upon the miſchief of it: Firſt, Thoſe Waters rebound upon the Fens, and cauſe a great ſurrounder there; From whence, Secondly, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all winds and ſtorms, they rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Defenſive Banks of the Towns, and cauſe a daily danger and fear there. And Thirdly, They ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Out-falls of all your other Draynes:—So that for the preſent, what violence of Waters ſoever ſhall come upon the ſaid Townſhips, either by downfall, or otherwiſe, (ſuch is their ſad condition) they muſt receive all of it in, and can iſſue little or none of it out.—And thus this River of <hi>Glean,</hi> and that other of <hi>Welland,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore the two principal Ornaments of this Country, and the chief riches and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:43184:53"/>
delights of the Towns through which they had their Currents, are now, 1. for want of maintainting, and 2. by reaſon of other abuſings, become the greateſt Miſchiefs: And thoſe Towns, heretofore the principal in the Country, are now become little better than meer Ponds and Pools, nay very Seas, as in truth, whoever at preſent will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, ſhall find them ſuch.</p>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The Charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Lovell,</hi> his Heirs, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, by Lawes of Sewers <hi>41.</hi> and <hi>42. Eliz.</hi> by Act of Parliament <hi>1. Jacobi.</hi>
               </note> Clear it is, that the Charge thereof for many years laſt paſt, ever ſince the 41<hi>ſt.</hi> and 42<hi>d.</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by certain Lawes of Sewers then made: or at leaſt ever ſince the Firſt of King <hi>James,</hi> by Act of Parliament, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of thoſe Lawes, hath been upon <hi>Lovell,</hi> his Heirs, and Aſſignes;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:43184:54"/>
The words are, That <hi>Lovell,</hi> his Heirs, and Aſſignes, at his and their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per coſts and Charges, (amongſt many other things) ſhall alſo for ever main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and keep the Rivers of <hi>Glean</hi> and <hi>Welland</hi> with ſufficient<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Diking, Road<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Scouring: to wit, (the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Welland,</hi> as is therein expreſſed) and this of <hi>Glean,</hi> from a place called <hi>Baſſon</hi> Spout, unto its Out-fall into the Sea. (So that this part of <hi>Glean,</hi> from <hi>Newbury,</hi> through <hi>Surfleet,</hi> to its Out-fall, was undoubtedly included in <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells</hi> Charge, and was a part of his VVork.) And alſo ſhall thereof diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, exonerate, acquit, or ſave harmleſs, as well the Queens Majeſty (that then was) her Heirs, and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, as all other perſon and perſons, their Heirs, and Aſſignes, of and for the repairing and amending of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Parts and Allotments in either of the ſaid Rivers.</p>

the Charge upon <hi>Lovell,</hi> his Heirs, and Aſſignes. And Seconly, As to the diſcharge of ſuch other Perſons as were formerly lyable thereto.</p>

                  <hi>1.</hi> How far the Charge impoſed extends upon <hi>1. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell.</hi>
               </note> 1. For the Firſt: As to the Charge impoſed upon 1. <hi>Lovell,</hi> his 2. Heirs, and 3. Aſſignes, how far it ſhall extend upon them; that I may proceed therein with the greater clearneſs, I ſhall take them ſeverally. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, As to <hi>Lovell,</hi> the Perſon that bound himſelf to the doing of theſe Works, I take it to be a full Charge upon him, both as to his 1. Perſon, and 2. as to his Eſtate.—But he many years ſince is dead and gone, and ſo 1. no help from him for the preſent at all, 2. much leſs any preſent and ſpeedy help, ſuch as the Neceſſity of this VVork re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> His Heirs.</note> 2. Secondly, As to his Heirs, they being herein expreſly mentioned, I take it to be a Charge to them likewiſe, ſo far as Heirs by the Law are charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; that is, 1. ſo long, and 2. ſo far as they have Aſſetts deſcended. The Lawes of this Nation (give me leave to ſpeak it) are not ſo hard in this Point, as thoſe ſometimes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:43184:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> where the Children might be made Bond-ſlaves to ſatisfie the Fathers Creditor: No, they bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not the Heir, where the Heir hath no benefit. And as to any Eſtate 1. of his own induſtrious Acqueſt, 2. or of Gift, 3. or Right from others; they burden not that neither: And 1. no farther, nor 2. no longer is the Heir lyable, than ſo far, and ſo long as he hath Aſſetts in deſcent. Now in caſe you make Enquiry after <hi>Lovells</hi> Heirs as to this particular, I doubt it will be to little purpoſe: <hi>Lovell</hi> confeſſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have ſpent his whole Eſtate in theſe Works, and very unlikely are his Heirs to hold Lands from him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, who never enjoyed from him one Foot of theſe in the Fens. So then, Enquire you 1. may, and 2. ought after them; but if no Aſſetts be in their hands, no Relief will be had from them in this buſineſs.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>3.</hi> His Aſſignes</note> 3. Thirdly, As to his Aſſignes, they are Perſons, I confeſs, of great Eſtates, and Honour too; but I conceive, can <hi>de Facto,</hi> no longer be forced to the Charge of theſe Works, than <hi>de Facto,</hi> they are Terre-Tenants, and hold the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:43184:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lands whereupon the Charge of them is fixed: So that for the preſent, they being Outed from the Benefit of the One, (the Commoners having lately made their Re-entry there) they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, during ſuch Re-entry, and the Commoners holding, be compelled to the Charge of the Other. No Aſſignee is further chargeable by the Law, than he is Terre-Tenant: The Aſſignee of himſelf is no privy, but an extraneous Perſon: And preſent Poſſeſſion, and an actual Eſtate, 1. in theſe particular Lands, is it muſt make him lyable, as Aſſetts 2. in general do the Heir.—But I would not herein be miſtaken, for I take it, that <hi>Lovells</hi> Aſſignes have at preſent a Right in theſe Lands, though they have no Poſſeſſion, and that in caſe they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hereafter make uſe of this Right, they are the rightful Perſons, that <hi>de Jure,</hi> ought to bear the Charge of theſe Works: And I could heartily wiſh it, that they would either undertake the One, or elſe wholly diſclaim the Other. But this I ſay, that during their Outer from the Poſſeſsion of theſe Lands, they are no wayes under the Power of the Commiſſion, ſo as to be enforced to this
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:43184:56"/>
Charge:—For their Right to theſe Lands, is no other, than what they may 1. waive, and 2. diſclaim. And it is only a conditional Right, depending upon the performance of ſuch Works as are altogether in their choice, either 1. to do, or 2. to deſert<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If they do Recover, they may Re-enter; and then all that can be ſaid of them, is, that if they do Re-enter upon their former Eſtate, they muſt alſo Re-imburſe, and Recompence what hath been done, and laid out by others in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault.</p>
            <p>But becauſe ſome may imagine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, that the Fen-Lands formerly in <note place="margin">
                  <hi>4.</hi> The Fen-Lands.</note>
               <hi>Lovells</hi> Poſſeſsion, may be as yet lyable to the Charge of theſe Works. 4. I will therefore in the Fourth place, ſay ſomething as to them.—And I ſhall confeſs, that theſe Lands whilſt they were in the Poſſeſsion of 1. <hi>Lovell,</hi> 2. his Heirs, or 3. Aſsignes, were charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and that by expreſs words in the Act of Parliament, he and they did hold the ſame ſubject to this Charge.</p>
            <p>But theſe Lands being before <hi>Lovells</hi> intermedling, 1. clear, and un-lyable, and 2. ſuch as wherein the Perſons
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:43184:56"/>
chargeable to this particular Work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Enquiry never had any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; <hi>Lovell</hi> neither 1. did, nor 2. could create a Charge thereupon, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than 1. as to his own Eſtate, and 2. whilſt it was in his own Poſſeſsion: His own Eſtate therein make ſubject he 1. might, and 2. did; but the Owners, and the Commoners, and their Rights therein, (as I have formerly ſpoken it upon another occaſion from hence) he neither 1. did, nor 2. could, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Act of his, damnifie.—And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you may obſerve it, the words in the Act of Parliament are, That <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,</hi> his Heirs, and Aſsignes, ſhall hold the ſaid Lands ſubject to the Charge of theſe Works. Expreſly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying, that the ſaid Lands were made ſubject to this Charge, whilſt they were in 1. his, or 2. their holding, and no longer.</p>
            <p>And to clear this above all exception: Upon ſuch neglect and default of <hi>Lovell,</hi> his Heirs, and Aſſignes, as in the ſaid Lawes is expreſſed, and accordingly certified, the Owners and Commoners may Re-enter upon theſe Lands, and them have and hold: Now I ask, How?
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:43184:57"/>
The very words of the Law in this Point are clear and full; namely, as in their former Right, and as in their former Eſtate: But they, in their former Eſtate, were never chargeable to this Work; 'twas only <hi>Lovell</hi> undertook it: Nor now ſhall be upon their Re-entry, in caſe <hi>Lovell</hi> deſert or neglect it: 'Twas <hi>Lovells</hi> Charge 1. originally, and 2. on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; none of theirs.</p>
            <p>But to put this Point a little higher: Firſt, Suppoſe that <hi>Lovells</hi> Aſſignes 1. ſhould wholly 1. waive their Right, and 2. deſert theſe Works; and ſhould never hereafter 1. Recover, or 2. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter: certainly in this caſe the Lords and Commoners of theſe Lands ſhall not be charged with other Works than of their own proper maintenance, and ſhall not at all be charged with foreign Works, that belong to other Towns, only becauſe <hi>Lovell</hi> (who had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an Eſtate under limitation in theſe Lands, and that ſubject to Forfeiture too) of his own accord undertook them. Or Secondly, Suppoſe <hi>Lovells</hi> Aſſignes, during this their Outer, 1. ſhould wholly diſclaim their Right, or 2. that their Right ſhould other-wayes

be diſ-annulled; and a new Compoſition ſhould by the Lords, Owners, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners of theſe Lands, be made with a new Undertaker; doubtleſs they might do it with reſpect to their own Intereſt only, and are no wayes bound to treat Covenants therein, for the benefit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe <hi>Lovell</hi> admitted them.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> To make ſome ſhort Recapitulation of what I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſpoken to this Point: Clear it is, Firſt, That the Fen-Lands ſometimes <hi>Lovells,</hi> while they are in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners Poſſeſsion, are not lyable to this Charge. Clear it is, Secondly, That <hi>Lovell</hi> is dead and gone, and ſo nore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from him. Clear it is, Thirdly, That <hi>Lovells</hi> Heirs for want of Aſſetts are not in Law reſponſable. Clear it is, Fourthly, That <hi>Lovells</hi> Aſſignes are, during their Outer from the Poſſeſſion of theſe Lands, not compellable. Now this Work being of ſuch preſent and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Neceſsity, what further is to be done in it? and where is it for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be charged?</p>
            <p>Doubtleſs ſuch Perſons as were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly charged with this work before <hi>Lovells</hi> time, are now, during his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43184:58"/>
and failer, to perform it: And there is the more Equity as to this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Work; for that <hi>Lovell</hi> did free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of his own accord undertake this Work, without any Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoever for it; and they upon whom this Work is chargeable, may in this reſpect only, well give <hi>Lovell,</hi> and his Aſsignes thanks, for freeing them ſo long from it for nothing. And for the better clearing of this, I ſhall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Method I formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> How far other Perſons, formerly lyable, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. Not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely:</note> 2. In the ſecond place, declare unto you, How far this Charge upon <hi>Lovell,</hi> his Heirs, and Aſsignes, ſhall operate, as to the Diſcharge of the Perſons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly lyable: And I take it to be clear,</p>
            <p>That, as to the Perſons formerly ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, there is 1. no abſolute Diſcharge, 2. nor other Diſcharge at all, further <note place="margin">But, <hi>ex re Facta,</hi> if <hi>Lovell</hi> do the Works.</note>than <hi>Lovell,</hi> his Heirs, and Aſsignes, <hi>ex re Factâ,</hi> by doing of the Work on their behalfs, ſhall make the Diſcharge; that is, (to ſpeak plainly) there is to them no Diſcharge at all, only a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant to them there is, on <hi>Lovells</hi> part, that he will diſcharge them: There are
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:43184:58"/>
no ſuch words, either in the Laws of Sewers, or in the Act of Parliament; nor no ſuch ſenſe can be put upon them, as that the Perſons formerly lyable, ſhall be diſcharged the Works: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Lovell,</hi> his Heirs, and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, ſhall do the Works; and that <hi>Lovell,</hi> his Heirs, and Aſſignes ſhall them thereof diſcharge, acquit, exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, and ſave harmleſs: 1. which if he do, it is well; and it is his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that he ſhall do it: 2. but if he do not, the Perſons formerly lyable, may and ought, by the Court, upon his <note place="margin">Upon <hi>Lovells</hi> neglect and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be charged with them.</note>neglect and failer, be charged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; and they have their remedy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-where againſt <hi>Lovell,</hi> for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he undertook to do.—And I take this to be very clear, if ever the caſe be as now it is; that is, 1. if the Work be a Work of 1. antient, and 2. known Charge, as this is: and 2. if that <hi>Lovell,</hi> his Heirs, and Aſſignes, be none of them in a condition to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled thereunto; as we have formerly proved, that for the preſent they are not.—For certain it is, the Commiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners muſt not neglect theſe Works, becauſe <hi>Lovell</hi> neglects them; neither
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:43184:59"/>
muſt they ſuffer the Country to be loſt and ruined for want of them, becauſe <hi>Lovell,</hi> and his Heirs, are loſt, and gone, and ruined in their Eſtates, and cannot do them; nor his Aſsignes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to do them.</p>
            <p>So <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> Out of my Diſcourſe hitherto, I hope I have ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated three things to you: The firſt is, that this Work is of preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity, and muſt be done. The ſecond is, that <hi>Lovell,</hi> his Heirs, and Aſſignes, are none of them in a condition; ſo as <hi>de Facto,</hi> to be compelled to do it. The third is, that during this their Failer, the Work is to be done, and for the preſent is to be done by ſuch Perſons as were formerly chargeable thereto. <note place="margin">Who the Perſons formerly lyable to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Work are.</note>Now that I may cloſe up this ſecond part of my Diſcourſe: 4. A fourth thing remains for you to Enquire of, that is, Who theſe Perſons are that were formerly chargeable? This indeed is properly your work, but I ſhall crave leave, out of the antient Records of this Court, to inform you ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it.</p>
            <p>I do find, by three antient Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, remaining here amongſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:43184:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of this Court: 1. the one without date, 2. the other <hi>Nono Edwardi Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundi,</hi> 3. the third <hi>Quarto Henrici Quinti,</hi> that the Charge of this River, from the beginning of <hi>Surfleet,</hi> (which hath been always accounted from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury)</hi> and ſo downwards to the Sea, 1. <note place="margin">The Town of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet.</hi>
               </note>hath, and 2. ought to be born by the Town of <hi>Surfleet.</hi> Theſe three antient Inquiſitions, in expreſs words, ſpeak this Charge full and directly. 4. And the ſame Charge I find partly intimated likewiſe in a parcell of an old Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, taken 17. <hi>Edwardi</hi> 2<hi>di.</hi> here alſo preſerved. 5. The ſame Charge I find again full and direct, in an Inquiſition, taken 6<hi>to. Edwardi</hi> 6<hi>ti.</hi> 6. And Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, By Lawes and Orders of Sewers, <hi>Octavo Elizabethae,</hi> (the very Age <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell</hi> begun his Work in) I do find, that conſentient and purſuant to all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Inquiſitions, the ſame in like manner was again charged and ordered upon the Lords, Owners, Free-holders, &amp; Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Surfleet,</hi> as hath been accuſtomed. And leſt there ſhould be any quarrel or queſtion about the antient bound of the Sea, I do therein find the ſaid River in expreſs words (and I would have you
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43184:60"/>
take ſpecial notice of them) charged upon them of <hi>Surfleet,</hi> from <hi>Newbury,</hi> through <hi>Surfleet:</hi> to the Out-fall of the Water of <hi>Glean</hi> into the River of <hi>Welland;</hi> nothing can be more full or plain.—But becauſe I would clear my ſelf, ſo as to deal truly with you in this Point, and would not be ſuſpected of partiality, or intereſt, I ſhall deſire, that the Clerk of Sewers may read the Records them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to you, here in open Court; and you, upon his reading, may examine theſe Copies of them, for your uſe and direction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here the Clerk of Sewers read the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and the Foreman of the Jury examined the Copies of them then delivered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I hope you are all fully ſatisfied, as to the antient Charge of this River, both 1. before, and 2. to <hi>Lovells</hi> time: You have had all the antient Records that I know preſerved in this Court, as concerning this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, produced in the caſe; and they all ſufficiently atteſt it, and they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in their teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Let not the ſeveral and different Names of this River trouble you.—Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:43184:60"/>
ſuch Names 1. as it borroweth from the Towns through which it runs, as being ſometimes called <hi>Pinchbeck</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſometimes <hi>Surfleet</hi> River, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Baſſon</hi> River, or <hi>Baſſon-Ea,</hi> two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther famous names it hath, and as I have been informed, from two great Springs from whence it ariſeth; the one of <hi>Burne,</hi> from whence it is called <hi>Burne-Ea,</hi> and <hi>Burne-old-Ea:</hi> the other (which I ſhall no wayes affirm, but as I have been by ſome told ſo only) of <hi>Glean,</hi> from whence it is called the River of <hi>Glean.</hi>—You ſee antient Inquiſitions have often the name of 1. <hi>Baſſon-Ea,</hi> a Town not far diſtant from us, nigh which it runneth; and of 2. <hi>Burne-old-Ea,</hi> as being the Spring nigheſt us in theſe parts, from whence a great branch of it ariſeth, and ſo to us beſt known: But in <hi>Lovells</hi> Law, it hath only the name of the 3. River of <hi>Glean,</hi> under which name accordingly we give it to you in Charge; and which Name, for that very cauſe, I would deſire you to uſe in your Verdict and Preſentment. But certain it is, call it the River of <hi>Glean, Baſſon-Ea, Burne-Ea,</hi> or what other Name you pleaſe, that from the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:43184:61"/>
In-fall of <hi>Burne</hi> Water, (nigh the place where St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> his Croſs, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Lovells</hi> own Houſe heretofore ſtood) and ſo downwards to the Sea, 'tis all but one and the ſame Chanell; ſo that this difference of Names need not trouble you; for as to this part of the River under your Enquiry, they are all of them but ſeveral Names of the ſame River, impoſed in reſpect 1. of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Fountains from whence it ariſeth, or 2. in reſpect of the ſeveral Towns through which it paſſeth; and in ſome Records one Name is uſed, in ſome another.—And having ſpoken this for the better underſtanding of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, I have altogether done with the ſecond part of my Diſcourſe, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perſons upon whom this Work is to be charged.</p>

            <p>In the fore-going part of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I have told you, that this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, from <hi>Newbury,</hi> to its Out-fall, is to be charged for the preſent upon the antient Charge-bearers: But ſo,</p>
            <p n="1">

out of my precedent Diſcourſe, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently appear to have been the antient Charge-bearers, and upon whom the Work at preſent is to be charged: But the Records expreſs no more, than in <note place="margin">

And ſo much concerning the grand Buſineſs of your Charge and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
            <p>Now if any of you ask, why no more <note place="margin">Why no more of this Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but this part of it only put upon Enquiry,</note>of this River is put upon your Enquiry, than this part of it from <hi>Newbury</hi> to the Sea? I ſhall anſwer: Firſt, That this

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That this part being in Decay, is of the greateſt Miſchief, and is the ſole cauſe of moſt of the Miſchiefs afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. And Thirdly, That this part of it muſt firſt be repaired, as being the Out-fall to the reſt; here the Work muſt of neceſſity be begun: And when this ſhall be effected, I doubt not, but, as ſome recompence of your labours, you ſhall ſee <hi>Glean,</hi> with very ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs above, 1. an uſeful, 2. a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, 3. and a pleaſant River a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>And as it is your main Buſineſs to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this River, and to Enquire into 1. the Defects of it, and 2. the Charge of it; ſo that 1. the Waters, 2. and Boats, may have a clear, and a free, and an interrupted Current and Paſſage in it again: So I would have you alſo take ſome notice of the great Bridge <note place="margin">Surfleet <hi>Bridge.</hi>
               </note>that is over it at <hi>Surfleet;</hi> to two ends would I have you obſerve this Bridge: Firſt, To cauſe the Water to paſs under it again, as antiently it hath done, and as of right it ought. And Secondly, To cauſe ſafe Land-Paſſage over it again; and to that end to take notice of the 1.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:43184:63"/>

               </note> I have obſerved, that in all great Works and Undertakings, both 1. the Contrivance of the Works themſelves, and 2. the Miſchiefs upon the Failer, have alwayes fallen heavy upon this Country of <hi>Holland;</hi> and in a ſpecial manner upon the two Towns of <hi>Pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck</hi> and <hi>Spalding.</hi> I may truly ſay, we have alwayes been, <hi>In Parte Deteriori.</hi> 1. Whoſe Paſtures have been cut aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, mangled and ſpoyled, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of their Draynes, but ours? 2. Whoſe Grounds have been ſocked, by the running of their Draynes, but ours? 3. Whoſe Towns have been, yea at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are, over-flowed and drawned, by the breaking of their Banks, or by the miſcarriage of their other Works, but ours? And upon Failer, 1. they of <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteven</hi> can ſuffer no more than in the loſs of their Commons; 2. 'tis we in <hi>Holland</hi> that do ſuffer in the loſs of our Towns: They may ſuffer in their Fens, 'tis we that ſuffer in our Eſtates and Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.—So that both 1. the Work of Drayning, 2. and the Neglect of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:43184:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Drayning, though in different degrees, yet if in any thing, or any where miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, 'tis ſo to us here in <hi>Holland:</hi> And if any where in <hi>Holland,</hi> 'tis ſo to theſe two Towns of <hi>Spalding</hi> and <hi>Pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck:</hi> For beſides 1. the particular miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, which alwayes falls 1. firſt, and 2. heavieſt upon theſe two Towns; and is now fallen upon them, to the utter ruine and undoing of many particular Perſons and Families; and it may be, to the very deſertion and deſolation of the Towns themſelves; three Parts of one of them is at this very inſtant depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulate and forſaken; both 1. Man, and 2. Beaſt, are fled and gone. 2. They muſt, I ſay, beſides their ſuffering under it. be at all the Charge too for the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of it, or elſe it muſt reſt upon them. Other Towns as rightfully concerned in Works of Sewers, for the removing of it as they, without a compelling Power, will do juſt nothing.—And doubtleſs, had other Towns (as rightfully concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Charge as theſe) 1. born their equall ſhare to ſuch Works as have been done, 2. and had done ſuch other Works as they ought to have done, theſe Towns had not been ſuch a ſad ſpectacle

as now they are; nor in a ſuch a ſad, wofull, drowned condition, as now they are in.</p>
            <p>To conclude: 1. The great Miſchief that now at preſent is upon theſe two Towns, and a great part of it 1. cauſed, or 2. continued at leaſt, by reaſon of this Obſtruction of the River of <hi>Glean</hi> in its Out-fall: 2. And the Perſons at whoſe Charge it ought for the preſent to be removed, you have heard declared unto you at large; 'tis now put upon your Enquiry, what you will find. I doubt not, but you will well conſider, 1. both the miſerable and calamitous Condition of theſe Towns, 2. and the urgent Neceſſity of the Work; and that you will Preſent it upon ſuch Perſons, 1. as may be compelled to do it, and 2. during the failer and neglect of <hi>Lovell,</hi> of right ought to do it: No more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of you, and I hope you will do no leſs.</p>
