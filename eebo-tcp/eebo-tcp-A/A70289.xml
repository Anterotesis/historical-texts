            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Another false Slander is charged upon the Quakers, that in <hi>September</hi> 1659. there was a discoverie of divers Witches in and near <hi>Shirebourn</hi> in <hi>Dorset</hi> shire, there being near two hundred of them at one meeting, most of them Quakers and Anabaptists, and that five of them was committed to <hi>Dorset</hi> shire Gaol, and have confessed, &amp;c. and saith likewise that they did torment, bewitch and destroy Mr. <hi>Leyford</hi> Minister of <hi>Shirebourn,</hi> tormenting him with a sharp painfull Disease that he dyed, and that Mr. <hi>Bamfield</hi> his Successor they forced by their Witchcraft to desert the Town.</p>
            <p>Answer here thou hast proved the Ministers to be under the power of Witchcraft, and not in the power of God, and so no Ministers of Christ; for they could not be bewitched but had power over that unclean Spirit, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> they would have, if they were in the power of God.</p>
            <p>But there was no discoverie of any Witches amongst the Quakers,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64605:8"/>
neither was there ever any of the Quakers that ever did confess or wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> proved to be Witches, for the Quakers is in that life and spirit, which the Devil and Witches have no power over, and therefore it is that the Devil, Witches, False Prophets, Hirelings, and Deceivers is so inraged against us, and so these being but all forged lies, which may be manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known to all people which desire to know the Truth, doth prove nothing against us, but doth fulfill the Scripture, which saith, that all manner of evil shall be spoken against us falsly for his names sake, who suffered the like contradiction of Sinners, as we do now, for they said, that he had a devil and did deceive the people; and unto us the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his reproches is as great Riches, although it be so be called Devils, Witches and Deceivers for his sake: for we have his witness in our selves that we are of God, and that of God in all mens consciences shall bear witnesse unto us.</p>
            <p>And as for thy saying, That some Quakers killed their mother, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the light within them. It is Answered, That there was such a thing done in <hi>Yorkeshire,</hi> but that they ever bore the name of Q<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

As concerning the Physician in <hi>Lincoln</hi> which thou tellest of, and the Maid in <hi>London</hi> which thou tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest of, and divers other particulars, which are falshoods, grounded upon the enmity of him, who was <hi>a Lyer</hi> from the beginning, and are not worth the mentioning after thee, neither can any moderate spirit who have any taste of Truth in their own hearts, be easily drawn to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve such things, which have so little face of truth with them, but is apparent fruit of enmitie: And as thou tells of some Quakers dancing, some cursing and swearing, some killing and murthering, and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate familiarity with women, and many such things, against which our God hath set us living witnesses both in life and doctrine, as all that knowes us can testifie, so, much need not to be said in our defence as to those accusations, being that our lives preaches the contrary where we come in all parts of the Nation, as it is well known, none dwells with us in the light of Jesus, who act any of these thing, and live in them and

               </gap> as for thy saying a Quaker at <hi>Dover</hi> when he came to die, said he expected Salvation by his own works, and not by Christ; and thy bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>John Davis</hi> a Priest for a witnesse hereto] To which we say, that <hi>John Davis</hi> having been asked hereof, seems to deny it: however this we testifie to be our Faith in Christ Jesus, that by him only and through obedience to his works we are justified, and not in our own.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou accusest some of us for saying to a Priest, Now is our day, and we will have you down.] To this we say, the day is come in which you are seen, and the fall of Antichrist, but for any such words or intention in us of violence towards you, our hearts are cleer before God, and he that shall either threaten or act so towards you, we deny.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou accusest <hi>E. B.</hi> for saying, Give the Priests blood to drink, for they are worthy. Its well known to many, that through the Priests, yea, by their own hands, have several of our bloods been shed, yet did never we attempt to shed any of yours or theirs, nor ever shall do, for it is the whore, and her worship that hath in her the blood of the Saints and Prophets, and all that are slain upon the Earth for the Testimony of Jesus, of whom the Spirit of God hath said, Give her blood to drink, for she is worthy. And we have this testimony in our Conscience towards the most blood-thirsty of you, That we had rather see your repentance, than that Scripture fulfilled upon you; though these words <hi>E.

            <p>And for any Quaker, way-laying the Minister of <hi>Cowwould</hi> (as thou calls him) justling him by the way, and drawing his sword half way.</p>
            <p>We say, This is as false as the rest, and the Minister himself thou men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionest, denies it, and said, If it was spoken concerning him, he would give his hand against it, before <hi>Humph: Killingbeck,</hi> and <hi>Rob.

            <p>When as <hi>Iames Naylor</hi> had never a brother, that ever came in <hi>London,</hi> nor within above fifty miles of it.

            <p>To this we say, she neither was nor is any Quaker, but a Ranter, who came thither to oppose the Quakers, as many unclean spirits have done, nor was this action done in our Meeting, our Meeting not being that day in that place. So this is like the rest.</p>
            <p>Again, thou mentionest things which thou callest our Opinions, and thy charge in general is, That let our tenents be never so dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically opposite to the written verity, yet we will father it upon the Spirit of truth, and will make him the Inspirer of these falsities: and that we make Christ the light within us, to hold out palpable darkness.</p>
            <p>To which we say, As thy charge is general and signifies little, so it is false, for by the Spirit of Truth and Christ the light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, do we witnesse the verity fulfilled, and not contradicted, and by the same are we made opposite to the Spirit of darknesse, and all its false worships.</p>
            <p>And though we may say that the Spirit of Christ is the same that it was, and so not unequal to it self, in whom, or at what time soever it appears, according to the Measure of his appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet is he ever the Spirit of Truth, and not against verity, whether written or spoken, but is the same that leads into a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And for thy seeking to make us as the Papists; First, in that the Pope to them is an Infallible Judge; Secondly, Written traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons equal to the written word.</p>
            <p>We answer, What is that to us, who deny both the Pope, his infallibility and his traditions, they are none of them binding unto us, look you to that, who have the remainder of that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry yet upon you in several things, which might be instanced: But, blind man, what a Comparison is this of thine? Is it become an offence to say the Spirit of Christ is infallible, and to confesse him come, who leads into all truth? Are we Papists in thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for this?

            <p>And we can say no lesse of the Spirit of Truth and his word at this day, than the holy Men of God have ever done in whom he hath appeared: to wit, that he is the same, and his power the same, and his word the same, which liveth for ever, and by which we now are armed and strengthned to withstand as great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and enlightened to see as great deceit in Teachers and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at this day (we have cause to believe) as ever appeared in the World, from which we could not be delivered by our own wisdom, reading or hearing of the letter, till God sent the Spirit of Truth in the name of Jesus into us, to enlighten our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the Scriptures, and against all spiritual wickednesse, and deceitfull worships, to quicken us with his power: so to us he is the power, and to him is the glory and the confession, who liveth for ever, and his dayes waxeth not old, nor his voice fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor his arm short, because many generations passe away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and this is he that was before the letter, who can work without the letter, or with it, and this is he whom men that know not have often opposed at his coming, and have been broken for it, though they professed the letter; and this may answer thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of <hi>George Fox,</hi> or any other who have spoken any thing in the honor of his Appearance, the power of his world, or the danger of them that oppose it, in this his day, as well as formerly, though

               <p>To which we say, thy Accusation is false, for we own no other Redeemer but that Person the Son of God, that dyed at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> who is the light within us, and the light of the world, as he said of himself, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.12. though this be a mystery to thee, and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To which we say, Christ is the way, the light, and the life, and no man comes to the knowledge of him, but by the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. nor to the knowledge of the Father but by him, though men without both may read the Letter, as the Jews did, whom thou tells on, and their searching of the Scripture who for all that, never came to the knowledge of Christ, nor would they come to him that they might have life. So ignorant is flesh and blood of his way, and knowledge, from the Letter; and therefore we do say, that without first turning to the light and Spirit of Christ, there is no comming to him, nor his knowledge, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.22.</p>
               <p>And for the Blasphemies thou chargest against us; as first, that we say we are equal with God, as holy, just, and good as God himself; and this thou sayes was affirmed by <hi>George Fox</hi> and <hi>James Naylor</hi> before Witnesses.</p>

And against the Rulers of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his world; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.12. which hath appeared under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Forms and Governments since the breakings forth of truth in this Nation. Yea many Heads or Governments hath been raised up and cast down again by one Hand and Power: and have all from the Lord (through his Servants) had a word of Wisedom and Councel ministred unto them, what they should do that they
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64605:13"/>
might be established: which if they did not, the Lord would break them to pieces: which word of the Lord was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled upon them all. And every divers Head had a Horn in it, to push at the Lambs of Christ withall, and at every appearance of his Spirit and Power in his People, but for his Elect sake was their daies shortned, and his breakings and destruction came upon them according to his word spoken to them by his Servants at divers times.</p>
            <p>And it is to be observed as the Lords doing and ordering by his mighty Power, that with in these eight years, since we have been persecuted and cruelly used for the name and Testimony of Jesus, and the Answer of a pure Conscience, there hath been twelve Changes of Government in this Nation which have all of them more or lesse been guiltie of our Sufferings, either in acting against us, or in suffering others to act cruelly, and not endeavouring to restrain them, when they had power in their hands to do it, and the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings laid before them, who suffered for Righteousnesse sake; so that they could not plead Ignorance, but was left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuse, which now in the day of their misery and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation some of them do consider it when their time is no more.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As first in the time of the Long-Parliament, in the year (1652.) although many pretended, some prayed, and some fought for Liberty of Conscience in matters of Religion, and yet at that time were we imprisoned, beat, and persecuted for obeying and worshipping our God in Spirit and Truth, according to his teaching; and at that time the Priests Rage begun to burn like fire: and they run one unto another, and kindled the wrath in one another against the Truth, even to petition against the spreading of it (and those that walked in it) as a dangerous thing; and they generally with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent called the Truth, Heresie, Delusion and Blasphemy: and those that ministered it abroad they called Ring-leaders of Sects, as in the Apostles daies there was the like example.</p>
            <p>But these was warned in their day, not to persecute the Innocent, nor to uphold those that preached for filthy lucre,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64605:14"/>
who served not the Lord Jesus Christ but their own Bellies; But they hearkned not to the Council of the Lord, but shut their ears against his Instructions: therefore was their day taken from them, and their Power given to another, that they also might be tryed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the year (1653.) a Council of State was called, by <hi>(O.C.)</hi> but they did nothing to take off the weight of oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the Nation, neither in Spiritual nor Civil things, for Pride and the deceiptfulnesse of Riches entred into their hearts, that they did not regard nor set themselves wholly to do that which the Lord did require of them, although they were warned of God in their time, yet the Yoke of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressor was not taken away, but under it the Nation groaned, and they wrought no deliverance in the earth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Then the Little Parliament sat in the same year, and there was a plant of Righteousnesse (tending towards some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and freedom) springing up in them, but the strength of deceipt and subtilty in others, did Quench it before it brought forth any thing to perfection, and in that time the Priests fierce persecuting Zeal, was so inflamed, that many Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions from several parts of the Nation was presented (against the Quakers) to the Parliament, and their continual clamor, Petitions and Addresses (and they being regarded and hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto) was one cause of the continuance of the Nations bondage and oppression, and God never prospered such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them into their Councils: or gave heed to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, but a Curse and Destruction alwaies followed them in their undertakings, whose ear was open unto such things. And in the time of this Power and Government, was persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continued about Religion, though much was pretended to the contrary; they also were warned, and wisely counselled in their day, and so was left without excuse.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Again in the same year was <hi>(O.C.)</hi> made Protector who had his day, and power in his hand to have done good, and to have done that which he and others pretended, but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64605:14"/>
he joyning with the covetous Priests and their Interests, to make his arm strong, thereby betrayed the Lord and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, into the hands of sinners. And insteed of removing Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he caused new Acts to be made to Persecute by, and so brought a Curse upon himself, and Family, and Tribulation upon those that trusted in him: And the Lord did often visit him with reproofs and instructions, untill he hardened his heart against all reproof, and then was he given up of the Lord, and of his People, to his appointed end, as an Example to all Hypoc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ites and Treacherous ones.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Again his second Parliament was called, and sat in the year 1654. in their daies was not the Land eased, nor freed from its bondage, and when they had let in the Priests Spirit, and was insensed against the Truth, and intending to make Laws to Persecute, then were they broken, and their power taken from them, who in their day was warned, but did not the thing which the Lord required of them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Oliver</hi>'s 3d. Parliament, which consisted of two Houses, sat in the year 1657. they more than any of the rest, did draw back into that which they had declared against, and they let in the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iests Persecuting Spirit, and made Laws for Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and many were Imprisoned in the time of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because for Conscience sake they could not pay Tithes to the Hireling Priests, and because they could not Swear, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Christs command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. And they had many warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and admonitions from the Lord, which they rejected, and so the Lord rejected them, as from doing his work.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Then <hi>Richard Cromwell</hi> in the year 1658. was made Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, whom the Priests flockt to, as their Rock of defence, that he as their <hi>Joshua</hi> might lead them into their promised Land, which was but a Benefice of Tithes or Augmentations, their prayed for Inheritance; and they told him that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel was bound up in him, and so did cleave unto him by Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, as they did unto all the rest before him for their own ends, but the suffering seed of God, which could not Flatter
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64605:15"/>
him was not set free: who freely declared unto him the word of the Lord, and instructions from the Almighty before his day was over.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And again his Parliament sate in the year (1659.) they continued and did not free the Sufferers, and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones, who suffered only for the worship of their God, and for the exercise of a good Conscience; but they went on swiftly in the way of their destruction, to impose Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships upon People, and to decree unrighteous Decrees: and upon that Rock of Religion, they were broken as others had been before them, though they were exhorted to righteousness, and told of the evil that did come upon them.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The 9th. Government was again the Long-Parliament, who came in with great Pretences, and Resolutions, and Protestations to make this Nation a Free-Commonwealth, not only in name but in nature; And they begun well, and to call the Prisoners up to <hi>London</hi> who suffered for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake, and freed some of them: and many of them intended to take away that great Oppression of Tithes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by much deceipt, and many Deceivers are held up in the Nation: and then the Priests rage was kindled against them, and they cursed them in their Pulpits, and preached up war against them, and themselves get Horses, Pistols and Swords to fight for their Tithes and Maintenance: and when they were routed, then they again petitioned the Parliament, some begging pardon, and some pleading not guilty: and the Parliament was so blind, that upon their Dissimulation they let in the Priests again; and begun to gratifie the Priests, and establish Tithes; and then the wrath of God broke forth against them, and their Destruction was prophecyed of, and told them that it should shortly come upon them, as it came to passe: because they would not receive the Lords Counsel in their day.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Then the Armie and Committee of Safety (so called)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64605:15"/>
had the Power and Government in their hands, which they did not improve as they might have done for the liberty of the Subjects: neither did they receive that counsel from the Lord which would have opened their understandings how to have ruled for him, but with corrupt reasonings among themselves perverted one another, and confounded their own work, reasoning out the good and honest intentions of some that was amongst them, untill they all became as a heap of Confusion, and their work broken to pieces. A just reward of their own devices, and following the counsels of their own hearts; neglecting the Advice of that Spirit of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which should have led and also established them in the work of the Lord in the Nation: so as unworthy and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient were they cast out.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Then again the Long-Parliament had another day of Tryal given them into their hands, but a mad Zeal and Fury attended them, against the honest and upright-hearted people; and the Fury of the Oppressor was highly exalted amongst them, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning like Fire, in which they could not contain themselves, nor possess their own Spirits in quietness; in which Fury was Folly: the effects of which did betray and destroy both themselves and others. They being diverted from their first intentions, and desire after righteousness: a just recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward for their Disobedience came upon them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to many true Testimonies from the Lords Servants unto them; which if in time their Ears had been open to the Lords instructions, and their Hearts inclined to righteousness, that swift and sudden destruction had not so soon come upon them: but they being blinded with Fury in their anger, would neither hear nor see, that which was the effect of their own work, nor the Lords hand of Justice near come upon them; as now they may consider it.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The Secluded Members then came in as a rod of Gods anger, and of Justice, or a prey upon them; and it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to the seeing Eye that God had tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ned his hand against all those which had abused his Power, and neglected his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64605:16"/>
work, who had sought and set up themselves, instead of the Lord and his righteousness: and now when the Lords hand is justly stretched for to wound those that by him would not be healed, who shall forbid it, untill the Cause be removed, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ey purged through judgement and suffering?</p>
            <p>And now unto you the present Power, King and Parliament: be not high minded, but fear; be not lifted up, as though by your Arm, Power, and Policie you had got a Victory; For it is Righteousness yet which the Lord doth require, and if by his immediate Power, (without your Sword) he have cut off all those that you might be grafted in Consider therefore Gods end in so doing, for it is by that immediate Power of God (which hath broken them) that you must stand, (if you do stand) for God is the same; and will be to you, as he hath been to others, as you answer or not answer his requirings: For it is not Persons that God accepts, but he that fears God and works righteousness is accepted of him: therefore as you look to be established by the Lord, do Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, Equity and Justice to every man, without respect of persons: and those that according to the Equal and Royal Law of God walk, doing unto others, as they would that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should do unto them: Take heed of imposing any thing relating to the matter of Worship upon the Consciences, least you kindle Gods wrath against you, (as others have done) which will not easily be quenched; for upon this Rock have many been broken, and others wounded so, that they could not again be healed.</p>
            <p>And two things we would mind you of especially,</p>
            <p>First, That you are not come in by your own Sword or Power, but by a remarkable hand of God in such a way as neither your selves, nor many other could have expected.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. Consider what a flood of unrighteousness, licentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and fleshly liberty hath of a sudden overspread the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon your comming in; which although it received some little seasonable curb by a Proclamation from King <hi>Charles</hi> (till which scarce a man fearing God, and that could not joyn with them in their riotings and drunken healths, could

pass the Streets in most places of the Nation) yet the Body of that Iniquity still stands in many places, as in May games, Fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, Danceings, Stage-playes, and divers other ungodly vain Sports, by which Gods righteous Soul is still grieved, the Spirits of all people that truely fears God sadned, the weight of that wickedness which already lay upon the Nations mightily encreased; quite contrary to what such a work as your comming in after such a manner required; All which speaks dreadfull things against these Nations in the sight of many, who are most acquainted with Gods fear, and have that Eye in them which foresee Evil to come, in whose Hearts and Mouths it is now to warn you, in love to your own Souls, (who are in Power to scatter such Wickednesse) and the Nation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
