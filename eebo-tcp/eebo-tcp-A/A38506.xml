         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our beloved EPICVRVS, having
lately learn'd English, on purpose
to converse more familiarly with
you; comes now at length to waite
upon you, and at your vacant houres to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
you with grave discourses, touching
the Happinesse of Man's life, and the right
meanes of attaining it, Wisdome, I have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to doubt of his welcome &amp; kind reception
<pb facs="tcp:58804:3"/>
by you, considering that he comes not, but upon
your frequent, and (I am confident) hearty
invitations of him; your owne ingenious
and commendable desire to be intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his Principles, and Doctrine
of Morality, and to heare him speake his owne
Thoughts purely and sincerely, having beene
the only occasion and motive to my assistance
of him in his Travells from Greece into this
Country, and my accommodation of him with
such an equipage, as might be exactly sutable
as well to your wishes, as to his owne minde.
Nay more, I have reason to presume, that a
few dayes conversation will create in you a
very great dearenesse towards him, as well
because I am assur'd you will soone finde him
what you expect, a sublime Witt, a profound
Iudgement, and a great Master of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Sobriety, Continence, Fortitude and
all other Vertues, not a Patron of Impiety,
Gluttony, Drunkennesse, Luxury and all
kinds of Intemperance, as the common people
(being mis-informed by such learned men as
either did not rightly understand, or would
not rightly represent his opinions) generally
<pb facs="tcp:58804:3"/>
conceive him to be; as because I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him not only to give strong and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hints to sundry of those sublime speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wherewith your thoughts are sometimes
delightfully imployed; but also solidly to
assert many of those Tenents, which I have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
heard you defend, with the like Reasons,
and which indeed nothing but the voluntary
and affected Ignorance of Superstition will
deny. So that, if the Rule hold, that Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Opinions, is an argument of Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in Affectons, and Similitude of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the ground of Love and friendship, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely
I am not altogether destitute of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
for my conjecture, and consequently that
you will soone admitt him into your bosome,
and treat him withall the demonstrations of
respect due to so excellent a Companion.</p>
            <p>But, as there is no Beauty without some
moles, no Chrystall without some specks; so
is not our EPICVRVS without his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
and you will discover in him some
things which cannot escape your reprehension;
and yet I expect, that your censure of him
should be much more moderate and charitable,
<pb facs="tcp:58804:4"/>
then that of the ignorant and scarce humane
Multitude hath been for many ages together.
And therefore I aske leave to state the Nature
of his guilt unto you, and afterwards to give
you my Iudgement thereupon; in the meane
time humbly leaving you to the Liberty of
your owne more judicious sentiments of both
the one and the other. For, my designe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
is not to possesse your brest with my
thoughts concerning the crimes usually char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
upon this Philosopher, but to dispossesse
it of an opinion that I might have the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
against him in respect of some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable
positions of his, as not only the
common people, but even the greatest number
of Schollers, have for many hundred of years,
entertain'd. And what I shall say to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
I humbly desire you will be pleas'd to
understand to be intended as an <hi>Exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
to take off from his memory the greatest
part of that unjust Odium, and Infamy which
envy and Malice on one hand, and Ignorance
and Inhumanity on the other, have cast upon
it, to the eclipsing even of all his excellent
meritts from the Commonwealth of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
<pb facs="tcp:58804:4"/>
and not as a defence of any unreasonable
or dangerous Errour, whereof he is found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
guilty. Which was more perhaps then
was needfull for me to advertise you of, who
wel understand the difference betwixt a <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>
and an <hi>Excusation;</hi> that it is one
thing to mitigate a too severe and rash sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
and another to justifie the Offendour.
And therefore without any further Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizing
for my short Apologie for EPICV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RVS,
I directly addresse to my Province.</p>
            <p>The Opinions, which, being asserted by
him in this Treatise concerning <hi>Ethicks,</hi>
have so much incens'd the world against him,
are principally these three. <hi>(1) That the
Souls of Men are mortall, &amp; so uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all either happiness or misery after
death. (2) That Man is not obliged to
honour, revere, and worship God, in
respect of his beneficence, or out of the
hope of any Good or feare of any evill
at his hands, but meerely in respect of
the transcendent Excellencies of his
Nature, Immortality, and Beatitude.
(3) That Selfe-homicide is an Act of
<pb facs="tcp:58804:5"/>
Heroick Fortitude in case of intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
or otherwise inevitable Calamity.</hi>
These, I confesse, are Positions to be rather
wholly condemned and abominated, then in
the least measure patroniz'd by us Christians,
whose understandings (thanks be to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the fountaine of Wisdome) are il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated
by a brighter light then that of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and yet notwithstanding when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that our Philosopher was a meere
naturalist, borne and educated in times of
no small Pagan darkenesse, and consider that
neither of these Tenents will be found
upon due Examination so destitute of all
support of Reason, as rash and unexami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
heads have apprehended, I professe I
cannot but thinke it an argument of much
more inhumanity then judicious zeale in any
man, upon this accompt alone, to invade him
with the crimination of superlative <hi>Impiety,
Blasphemy,</hi> and absolute <hi>Atheisme.</hi> For.</p>
            <p>As to the FIRST, viz. That the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
soule doth not survive the funerals of
the body, but absolutely perish in the instant
of death, as I need not tell you, how uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb facs="tcp:58804:5"/>
an Opinion it is to all Vertuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and how manifestly repugnant to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianisme,
and indeed to the fundamentall
Reason of all Religions beside (if I may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to use that improper phrase of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
while I well know that there can be but
one Religion truely so called, and that all the
rest are more properly called Superstitions)
so I neede not advertise you how highly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
it is to refute it, by satisfactory and
convincing Arguments defumable from
meer reason. For, to suspect the light of
Nature, is scarce strong enough by its own
single force, to dispell all those thick mists
of difficulties, that hinder our discernment
of the full nature of the human soul, and
scarce bright enough clearly to demonstrate
the immortality of that noble Essence, so, as
to leave no room for diffidence or contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
I hope it can be no Heresie in any
man, because no disparagement to either his
Faith or Reason. You have, Sir, I presume,
attentively perused that so worthily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
discourse of <hi>Plato,</hi> touching the
immortality of mans soul, and acquainted
<pb facs="tcp:58804:6"/>
your selfe moreover with all those mighty
Arguments, alledged by Saint <hi>Thomas,
Pomponatius</hi> (who will hardly be out-done
in subtlety, touching the same Theam, by
any that comes after him, and yet he was
forc'd to conclude himselfe a Sceptick, and
leave the Question to the decision of some
other bolder Pen) <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> our noble
friend Sir <hi>Kenelme Digby,</hi> and divers
other great Clerks, to prove the Soul of
Man to be a substance distinct from, and
independent upon that of the body, and to have
eternall existence <hi>√† parte post;</hi> and yet if I
were not assured, that your perswasion of its
immortality is founded upon a much more
firm basis, then that of the most seemingly
apodicticall of all their Reasons, I might
well doubt of the impregnability thereof<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
And this I may say somewhat the more freely
and boldly, both because I my selfe, having
with all possible attention, and equity of
minde, examined the validity of most of those
Arguments, for the immortality of mens
souls, which their Authors have presented
as perfect Demonstrations thereof, cannot
<pb facs="tcp:58804:6"/>
finde any of them to make good that glorious
Title, or satisfie expectation to the full; and
because I have observed many learned men,
Divines, and others, who have long labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their thoughts in the same Disquisition,
to concurre with me in opinion, <hi>That to
believe the soul of Man to be immortall,
upon Principles supernaturall, is much
more easie, then to demonstrate the
same by Reasons purely Naturall.</hi> Now,
if for the most sublime witts, even of our
times (wherein the Metaphysicks have,
doubtlesse, received a very great encrease of
clearnesse, and mens speculations seem to be
highly refined, in regard of sundry lively
and fruitfull hints, that are inspersed upon
the leaves of sacred writt, concerning as
well the Originall and Nature of the Soul,
as the state of it after death) it be so hard
a task to erect a firme perswasion of the
immortality of the human soul, upon a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Naturall Reason alone; I appeal
to every imprejudicate man, with what
justice our <hi>EPICVRVS</hi> is so highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
for being ignorant of that unattaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:58804:7"/>
Truth, when he could steer the course of
his judgment and beliefe by no other
Starre, but that remote and pale one of
the Light of Nature; that bright North-Starre
of Holy Scripture appearing not at
all to the Horizon of <hi>Greece,</hi> till many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
after his death.</p>
            <p>Again, EPICVRVS is not the only man
amongst the Antients that is to be accused,
for entertaining and divulging erroneous
conceptions of the nature and condition of
the reasonable soul after death, it being well
known, that most of the Grecian Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
did indubitate the incorruptibility
thereof, either implicitely and upon conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
or immediately, and in direct terms.
This perhaps may seem a Parodox to you,
and therefore I ask leave to make it good.
The Grecian Scholiarchs may all be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into two Classes, in reference to this
subject; the <hi>first</hi> consisting of those who
<hi>asserted,</hi> the other of such as expresly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied</hi>
the Immortality of Man's Soule, the
former containing the greater, the latter the
lesser number. And among all those that are
<pb facs="tcp:58804:7"/>
on the affirmative part, you shall not finde
one that is not (more or lesse) tainted with
that so common Errour, of the <hi>Refusion of
all mens souls after death, into the</hi> Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Mundi, <hi>or generall Soul of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,</hi>
which is upon consequence, That,
<hi>they cease to exist, per se, or to be what
they were before, so soon as they are
separated from the body.</hi> For your fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
satisfaction of this unfrequent Truth,
be pleased to observe, that, as they general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceived the soul of every individuall
man, to be a certain particle of the Mundan,
or universall soul, immitted into the body at
its conception, and therein contained, during
life, as a drop of water is contained in a
glasse Phiall; so did they also conceive, that
the same soul, upon the breaking of the
glasse, or dissolution of the body, doth flow
forth, and again return and unite it selfe to
the universall soul, front whence it was at
first desumed. Thus <hi>Plutarch (4 Placit.
9.)</hi> expresly tells us, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and
<hi>Plato</hi> maintained, that Mans soul having
taken its farewell of the body [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>„Äà in non-Latin alphabet „Äâ</desc>
               </gap>]
<pb facs="tcp:58804:8"/>
               <hi>in congeniam
sibi animam Mundi concedere,</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the soul of the world, which is of the
same substance and nature with it. Now by
this common soul of the world, it is manifest,
that they sometimes meant <hi>God,</hi> in respect
they acknowledged him to be the supream In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
or Minde, which disposeth and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
all parts of the body; and sometimes
the <hi>Heavens,</hi> because as Heaven is the most
pure and noble part of the Vniverse, so is
the soul the most pure and noble part of
Man.</p>
            <p>This considered, you have here an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
(at least, if a short and pertinent digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
may be opportune) of taking notice in
what sence we are to understand some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
passages in their writings, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the buman soul, which are often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
but seldome rightly interpreted.</p>
            <p>First, we may hence collect what their
true meaning was, when they said, <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam
esse divinae aurae Particulam,</hi> that
the Soul is a particle of Divine breath, or
as <hi>Cicero</hi> speaks (in <hi>Cato Major) Ex
<pb facs="tcp:58804:8"/>
Divina mente universa delibutos animos
habemus:</hi> We have our soules derived from
the universall divine minde; And again,
when they affirmed, that our Soules were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from Heaven, and to return thither again
after their emancipation from the body: All
which the Prince of Poets elegantly insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth
in these Verses</p>

            </q>
            <p>Secondly, we may hence learn the sence of
<hi>Empedocles,</hi> as well in that saying quoted
by <hi>Plutarch (de exilio) Praesentem vitam
esse exilium, √® quo tandem animus sit
in pristinam sedem demigraturus,</hi> That
this present li<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>e is a banishment of the soul,
<pb facs="tcp:58804:9"/>
from which it is at length to be recall'd to
its primitive place; as in that mentioned by
<hi>Clem. Alexandrinus (Lib. 4. Stromat. 2.
hypotypos. 24.) Animos sapientum De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os
fieri,</hi> That the soules of Wise-men become
Gods.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we may hence know how to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the true sence of <hi>Plato's</hi> opinion,
<hi>that all learning is only Reminiscence.</hi>
For supposing the Soul of the Vniverse to be
omniscient, and each particle thereof to be
of the same nature and faculties with the
whole; he thereupon inferrs, that the soul of
each man being a particle of that universall
and omniscient soul, must be likewise omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient,
though in the moment, when it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd
into the body, it becomes dim and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded,
so that as if it had been made drunk
with <hi>Lethe,</hi> or the Waters of Oblivion, it
forgets all its Originall knowledge, and must
recollect and call to minde the notions of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
things, by the help and mediation of
the senses.</p>
            <p>Lastly, why <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> to
this opinion of the soules <hi>Remigration</hi> to
<pb facs="tcp:58804:9"/>
the Vniversall Soul, connected that their
other so famous one of the <hi>Transmigration</hi>
of soules from body to body successively.
For, having imbibed this latter errour of
the souls transmigration, in their conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with some Egyptian Priests, as <hi>Stobaeus</hi>
informs us <hi>(in Eccl. Physic.)</hi> they stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to accomodate the same to their own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
opinion, of the souls being a particle of
the <hi>Anima mundi;</hi> insomuch as it might
thence follow, that the soul being exhal'd
from its first body, and wandring up and
down in quest of its fountain, the universall
soul, might probably enough light upon some
other body then in the act of Conception, and
being united thereunto, animate it; or, being
by inspiration attracted into some living
creature, unite it selfe to the soul praeexistent
therein, and so become one with it, especially
if the body it meet with be of the same, or like
conditions and affections with the former,
which it hath so lately forsaken. True it is,
neverthelesse, that they delivered this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctriue
of the Transmigration of soules, very
obscurely, and wrapt up in Fables and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories,
<pb facs="tcp:58804:10"/>
but their design herein was to make
men more mansuete and milde in their dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
by bringing them to put a greater
value upon the lives of Animals (for, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this Doctrine, who would kill a
Beast, when for ought he knew, his Fathers
Soul might animate that Beast) and a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
degree of horrour against shedding of
Blood, that so having devested them of all
savagenesse and cruelty, they might have a
greater detestation against Homicide, and
preserving the peace and safety of Societies.</p>
            <p>Nor can the <hi>Stoicks</hi> be exempted from
the same Errour, of the <hi>Refusion</hi> of all
soules into the universall one; insomuch as
it was their constant tenent, that the world
was animated by a certain fire, which they
call'd <hi>Jupiter;</hi> that mens soules were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
derived from that fire, and should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
be reunited thereunto, some sooner, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
latter, but all in that generall Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration
of the Vniverse, when all things
shall be (as they dreamt) sublimed into <hi>Jove</hi>
again.</p>
            <p>Now if we look narrowly into the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb facs="tcp:58804:10"/>
we shall discover even <hi>Aristotle</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to be in some measure guilty of the very
same delusion, as well in respect of his
<hi>Animall Heat,</hi> which, discoursing of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
of Animals <hi>(Lib. 2 Cap. 3.)</hi> he
affirms to be respondent in some proportion
to the Element of Celestiall bodies, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
all things in the world are impraegna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
as of his <hi>Intellectus Agens,</hi> which he
teacheth to be diffused through the whole
world, after the same manner as the light of
the Sun is diffus'd through the Aire, and so
apply'd and conjoyned to the <hi>Intellectus
Patiens,</hi> or proper soule of every man, as
the externall light is applyed and conjoyned
to the eye, and as the eye by the conjunction
of externall light comes to see visible objects,
so doth the proper passive Intellect of every
man, by the illustration of the generall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Intellect, come to understand intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Objects. Adding thereunto, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect
passive is separable, corruptible, and
capable of utter dissolution; but the Active,
inseparable, incorruptible, immortall. For,
thus much may be collected from severall
<pb facs="tcp:58804:11"/>
places of his Books <hi>de Anima,</hi> and thus
are those places explained by the best of his
Greek interpreters, <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the best
of the Arabians, <hi>Averrhoes,</hi> whose opinion
of the <hi>Unity of the Intellect</hi> in all the
world, is sufficiently known.</p>
            <p>And thus much of the Philosophers of the
<hi>former</hi> Classis, who though they seem to
affirm, do yet in reality, upon naturall conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
deny the Immortality of the Humane
Soul, in that they all concur in that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory
Errour of the Refusion thereof into
the <hi>Anima mundi.</hi> For, the proper Notion
of Immortality, is, <hi>the eternall existence
of a thing in the selfe same nature, and
perse;</hi> and therefore, if a thing be devested
of its own proper nature, so, as to become
invested with that of another, and to have
no existence or subsistence, but what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
upon its union with that other, to
which it is assimilated and indentified; for my
part, truly, I cannot understand how it can
be said to be immortall without manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
And whether it be not as grosse
an absurdity to say, that the soul of a man
<pb facs="tcp:58804:11"/>
shall be for ever the same <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the soul of
a man, and yet that it shall be identified, or
made the same with the soul of the world; as
to say, that such a thing shall before ever the
same, and not the same, is no hard matter to
determine.</p>
            <p>As for those of the <hi>latter,</hi> who in down
right termes <hi>denyed</hi> the Immortality of the
soul, they subdivide themselves into two
different Sects, some having contended for
the totall <hi>destruction,</hi> or <hi>absolute Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation,</hi>
and others for only the <hi>exsoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and <hi>dispersion</hi> of it into the <hi>matter</hi> or
<hi>principles</hi> of which it was composed.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>former</hi> of these Sects we may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
annumerate all such, who conceived the
soule of man to be only a certain harmony, not
of Musicall sounds, but a contemperation of
parts, humours, and qualities, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that as of Musicall Harmony, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can remain after the sounds are vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
so of the soul nothing can remain, after
death hath once destroyed that harmonious
Contemperation of parts, hunours, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
from whence it did result. And this
<pb facs="tcp:58804:12"/>
purely was the opinion of not only those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tienter
Greeks, <hi>Dicaearchus, Aristoxenus,
Andraeas,</hi> and <hi>Asclepiades,</hi> all which are
thereof strongly accused by <hi>Plato (in
Phaed)</hi> and <hi>Aristotle (Lib. 1. de Anima
Cap. 5.)</hi> but also our Master <hi>Galen,</hi> who
was positive and plain in his definition of
the soul, to be a certain Temperament of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary
Qualities. In the same list may we
also inscribe the names of all those, who
imagining the soul to be nothing else but a
certain <hi>Act,</hi> or <hi>Form,</hi> or <hi>Quality</hi> insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>(i. e.)</hi> a certain speciall <hi>Modification</hi>
of <hi>Matter,</hi> have accordingly concluded, that
as the <hi>Figure,</hi> or speciall <hi>Mode</hi> of a thing
must inevitably vanish, immediately upon the
immutation or change of the thing figurate,
so must the soul, being only a speciall Mode
of the Matter, necessarily vanish immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
upon the immutation of that Mode by
death. Which <hi>Origen, Iustine, Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi>
and some other <hi>Fathers,</hi> understanding
to have been the Tenent of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> have
written sharp invectives against him, as an
assertor of the soules mortality, and this so
<pb facs="tcp:58804:12"/>
justly, that if his Zealous Disciple, honest
Mr. <hi>Alexander Rosse,</hi> were alive again, he
would never be able to discredit that their
charge.</p>
            <p>To the <hi>latter</hi> we are to refer all such, as
held the soul to be <hi>Corporeall.</hi> For, as they
would have it to be composed of <hi>materiall</hi>
principles, so would they also have it to be,
by death, again resolved into the same mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
principles; so that in their sence, the
extinction of the soul is no other, but the
dissipation thereof into those very corporeall
particles, of which it was composed. And
this seemes to be the true meaning of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monax</hi>
in <hi>Lucian,</hi> when being interrogated
whether he thought the soul to be immortall,
he answered, <hi>mihi videtur, sed ut omnia;</hi>
it seemes to me to be immortall, but no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than all things are immortall, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> as
to the matter only, or component Principles
of it, which are incapable of Annihilation.
In this Catalogue we may worthily place
<hi>Marcus Antoninus,</hi> in regard of his saying
<hi>(Lib. 4.) Animas hominm dispergi in
auras,</hi> that mens souls are dispersed into
<pb facs="tcp:58804:13"/>
Aer: and <hi>Seneca,</hi> for his <hi>Animam homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
magno pondere extriti permeare non
posse, et statim dispergi, quia non fuerit
illi exitus liber;</hi> as also <hi>Democritus</hi> and
<hi>Epicurus,</hi> who equally contested, that the
soul was nothing but very <hi>Atoms,</hi> in such
a speciall order, in such a speciall position,
&amp;c. contemperated, and Death nothing but
a discomposure of that determinate Contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and a Resolution of the soul into sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Atoms again; and therefore are they
alwaies conjoyned by the good <hi>Lactantius
(Lib. 3. cap. 7. &amp; lib. 9. cap. 8. &amp; 13.)</hi>
as confederates in the Doctrine of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of soules.</p>
            <p>And thus, Sir, you may at once plainly
perceive the <hi>justice</hi> of my Attainder of the
most, and most eniment of the antient Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Philosophers, with the guilt of having
been (either obliquely or directly) Impugners
of the Soules Immortality; and the great <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi>
of their Sentence, who more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
condemne <hi>Epicurus</hi> for the same
Error, when so many others were equally
culpable with him therein.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:58804:13"/>
As to the SECOND, viz. <hi>That man is
not obliged to honour, revere, and
worship God upon the motive of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence,
or upon the accompt of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Good of Evill expected from him;
but only out of a sentiment of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
Excellencies of his Nature, and
chiefly of his Immortality and Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi>
I might well plead for him, that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in a time, when there was scarce any
Religion, but sottish Idolatry, when there
were more Gods then Nations, yea, then
Temples; and when all Devotion was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and ridiculous Superstition: He seems
rather to be honour'd, for that he came so
neer to the knowledge of the true God, then
condemned for comming no neerer; rather to
be admir'd for having so clear and genuine
an apprehension of some of the Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
then reproached for not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
them all. Especially, when I should
not infringe the Law of charity, to doubt,
that among us Christians, and even such as
think themselves not a little vers'd in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie,
there may be some, who, if they were
<pb facs="tcp:58804:14"/>
put to give but an Adumbration of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious
piece, the Divine Nature, would
discover themselves to have as imperfect an
Idaea thereof, as EPICVRVS had. But
this excuse would be too generall for his
particular vindication, from the imputed
crime of perfect <hi>Atheisme,</hi> and therefore
we shall fix only on such Reasons as are
more properly accomodate to that purpose.</p>
            <p>First, I dare say, his <hi>Piety,</hi> in deriding
the incompetency of those Conceptions, that
men in his time commonly entertained of the
supream Essence (for they ascribed generally
unto it, all the selfe same passions and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which they perceived to be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and so copied out an imperfect Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
by the infinitely disproportionate
Originall of Humanity) was much greater
then his <hi>Impiety</hi> could be, in teaching, that
the Deity was of so transcendently excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a nature, as to be wholly unconcern'd in
any thing but it selfe, and far above all sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
whatever, besides those of its own
eternall and compleat Felicity; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
that it was to be reverenc'd and
<pb facs="tcp:58804:14"/>
worshiped solely and purely for its own
sake, without the least mixture of selfe-Reflections.
For, as by the one, he judiciously
attempted to subvert the false and unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Religion, or (rather) Superstition, in
the worship of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and other the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Deities, wherewith his Country swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in his daies (there being no better way
to alienate mens minds from the Veneration
of False Gods, then to acquaint them with
notions comprehending the Essentiall and
Incommunicable attributes of the true God)
so by the other, he seems to have laid a very
firm foundation for the true Religion, in that
he would have the Right or Iustice of all
Divine worship to be founded wholly and
entirely upon the Excellency of the Divine
Nature. How far therefore he was from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Professor and Seminary of down-right
Atheisme, as some (whose zeal may well be
thought to have been much greater then
their knowledge, as to that particular) have
represented him to the World; every man,
who hath but so much reason, as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that <hi>Polytheisme</hi> is the greatest
<pb facs="tcp:58804:15"/>
               <hi>Atheisme,</hi> may easily judge.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I can hardly allow him
to deserve the odious Epithete of, <hi>most
highly Impious,</hi> which most men brand him
withall, upon the account of this latter Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
only, because I meet with not a few, nor
contemptible Reasons, that encline my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to more moderation. In particular,
you well know, Sir, how highly unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
it is, for any man to expect, from EPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CVRVS,
the knowledge of the true and legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
worship of God, when that was by
God himselfe praescribed only to the antient
Hebrewes, and professed only by their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
and no other Nation in the World;
if so, why should more be expected from
<hi>Him,</hi> then from <hi>Plato, Zeno, Socrates,
Aristotle,</hi> or any other of the elder Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Philosophers, they being all equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nighted
with Paganisme? Why should he be
so severely sentenc'd, and all the rest passe
unquestioned, one and the same charge of
invincible Ignorance of the true Religion
lying against each of them? Besides, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Iustice will hardly permit, that any
<pb facs="tcp:58804:15"/>
man should suffer meerly for wanting that,
which, without supernaturall means, was
impossible for him to obtain; and he that will
adventure to determine, whether or no, at
the Tribunall of Divine Iustice, any one
shall be condemned simply upon that score,
must have dived very deep into that fathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
gulfe of Praedestination.</p>
            <p>You likewise know, that our Christian
Doctors assigne only <hi>Two causes,</hi> or <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
Consideration,</hi> why men
should worship God: The <hi>one</hi> they teach to
be the transcendent Excellency of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, which singly, and without any
respect to our own Vtility or Advantage,
doth justly claim the highest veneration of
our minds. The <hi>other,</hi> they admit to be the
benefits, we either have received, or (which
is the stronger motive of the two) hope to
receive at his hands. Hereupon, if any man be
induced to revere and worship the Divine
Majesty solely and simply upon the <hi>former</hi>
motive, they say that he bears a <hi>Filiall</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
and affection to God; and if only by
the <hi>latter,</hi> a meer <hi>servile</hi> or mercenary.
<pb facs="tcp:58804:16"/>
Now though the servile or mercenary love
of God, be not altogether to be disliked, in
regard it is a kind of gratitude due to him as
a Benefactor; yet I conceive no man will
gainsay, but the filiall and free love is much
the nobler and more acceptable, insomuch
as it hath no other then the noblest of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
God Himselfe. And sure I am (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever)
that the most Learned, most Pious, and
most Religious of our School Divines,
have been earnest in their advisoes to us, to
extract all selfenesse from our love of God,
and (as much as our frailties will admit of)
to fix all our affections entirely upon Him,
as he is infinitely Good, and Amiable in
Himselfe.</p>
            <p>Moreover, you may remember, Sir, that
<hi>Cicero</hi> in his Book touching the nature of
the Gods, hath these very words, <hi>Quid est
cur Deos ab hominibus colendos dicas,
cum dii ipsi non modo homines non co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant,
sed omnino nihil curent? Et quae
porr√≤ Pietas ei debetur,
√† quo nihil acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris?
Aut quid omnino, cujus nullum
meritum fit, ei deberi potest?</hi> By which
<pb facs="tcp:58804:16"/>
it is evident, that he would exclude all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inducements to Religion, besides a meer
mercenary and servile respect: And yet I
dare say, that you do not remember, that
ever you heard him accounted Impious for
that opinion. Why therefore should EPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CVRVS
have such hard measure, as to
be stigmatiz'd with the name of <hi>Atheist,
Impious wretch, Secretary of Hell, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to all Religion,</hi> &amp;c? and all for
asserting, that man ought to be induc'd to
a reverence and veneration of the Divine
Majesty, only by the Sentiments of a <hi>Filiall</hi>
Piety (not supernaturall Piety, arising from
Grace justifying, and by which we are made
the Sons of God, but a pure Naturall one)
such as <hi>Right Reason</hi> had suggested
unto him? Certainly, of the two opinions,
<hi>Epicurus</hi>'s will appear much more veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
to an Equitable Arbiter. Sundry other
arguments there are, which might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagiously-alledged
on our Authors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
in this case. But, considering that
these few already urged, are of importance
enough, to evince the temerity of his Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
<pb facs="tcp:58804:17"/>
judgment, and that the prolixity of
this discourse, hath long since, given you
just occasion to question, by what right I
call it a Letter; I perceive my selfe obliged
in good manners, no longer to exercise your
patience, then, while I briefly expresse my
sentiments of the LAST Article of his
Charge.</p>
            <p>Which is, His asserting of <hi>Selfe-Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,
in case of intolerable, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
inevitable Calamity.</hi> This, as a
<hi>Christian,</hi> I hold to be a bloody and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
opinion, because expresly repugnant
to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and yet in the person
of a meer <hi>Philosopher,</hi> I might, without
being unreasonably Paradoxicall, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to dispute, whether it be so highly
repugnant to the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> as men
have generally conceived. For</p>
            <p>First, if all the praecepts of the Law of
Nature concenter in this one point; <hi>Flie
Evill, pursue Good;</hi> as those who have
most labour'd to conduct our understanding
out of that intricate Labyrinth, the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous
Sence of the word, <hi>Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58804:17"/>
have unanimously determined; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
that man assumes no very easie
task, who undertakes to prove, that in case
of insupportable distresse, and where all
other hopes of evading, or ending that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
(then which there can be no greater
<hi>Evill)</hi> for a man to free himselfe from that
extremity of <hi>Evill,</hi> and seek the <hi>Good</hi> of
ease and quiet, by taking away his own
life, which chiefly makes him subject to, and
only sensible of that misery, is an infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Law of <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, if we understand <hi>Selfe-praeserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
(which all men allow to be the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Naturall Law in Generall) to be no
other, but an innate Love, or Naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to Life, as a <hi>Good,</hi> when life ceaseth
to be a <hi>Good,</hi> &amp; degenerates into an <hi>Evill,</hi>
as commonly it doth to men, in cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the body, or high discontent of
minde, (the more desperate affliction of the
two by much) &amp; when all the Stars of hope
and comfort are set in the West of black de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration,
why should not the force or obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of that Law also, cease at the same
<pb facs="tcp:58804:18"/>
time? Or rather, why should not self-homicid,
in such cases, be an absolute accomplishment
of the Law of Self-praeservation, it being
manifest, that we are by the tenour of that
Law, obliged to use such means, as conduce
to our praeservation from the greatest
<hi>Evill;</hi> and as manifest, that to free ones<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from misery, which cannot otherwise
be avoided, but by breaking as under the
Ligaments of Life, is a pursuance of the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
means we can discover, to beconducible
to our end: that is, to preservation from
more sufferings, and to <hi>Indolency,</hi> which
in Death we propose to our selves as a
<hi>Good?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But lest we seem to give any encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to that, which <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi>
and the <hi>Civill</hi> Power so highly condemn;
let us grant, that Selfe-murther, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
case, is a violation of the Law of
Nature, and yet we shall have one consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
left, that seemes strong enought to
refract the violence of their malice, who
exclaim against EPICVRVS, as the
grand abettor of selfe-assasination; and that
<pb facs="tcp:58804:18"/>
is, that he was not single, nor most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the justification of it. For, if we
look upon the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
we shall soon perceive, that the
<hi>Stoicks</hi> generally, not only approved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
but strictly enjoyned men to embrace
death voluntarily, and from their own
hands; That <hi>Cicero</hi> doth <hi>(Lib. de Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus)</hi>
implicitely allow of it in these words,

<hi>(in 2 Tusculan.)</hi> in these, <hi>Eam in vita

quoniam ut oportet aliquis fruatur
pariter cum aliis voluptate potandi,
aut ne sobrius in violentiam vinolento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

Fortunae quas ferre nequeas, defugien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
relinquas.</hi> And if their <hi>Practise,</hi> we
<pb facs="tcp:58804:19"/>
shall assoon finde many of them to have laid
violent hands upon themselves, and that
in cases offar lesse moment, then that of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable
and inevitable Calamity, to
which only <hi>Epicurus</hi>'s praecept is limited;
while He, leaving others to become exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of that Rule, with admirable patience,
and invincible magnanimity, endured the
tortures of the Stone in the Bladder, and
other most excruciating Diseases, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
years together, and awaited, till ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
old age gently put out the Taper
of his life. Thus <hi>Zeno,</hi> a man of the most
spotlesse fame of any Philosopher among
the antients, having by a fall bruised one
of his fingers against the ground, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
that to be a summons of him to
the earth, went presently home and hang'd
himselfe, and was therefore by <hi>Diogenes
Laertius</hi> honour'd with this Elogie; <hi>Mir√¢
felicitate vir, qui incolumis, integer,
sine morbo √® vivis excessit.</hi> Thus <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes,</hi>
you know, to prevent his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beholding to any man but himselfe
<pb facs="tcp:58804:19"/>
either for his life or death, drank mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
poison out of his own quill, which
had given him immortality long before.
Thus also <hi>Democles,</hi> to praevent his
pollution, by the unnaturall heat of a
certain lustfull Greek Tyrant, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to force him, leaped into a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
of boyling Water. And thus <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anthes,
Chrysippus,</hi> and <hi>Empedocles,</hi>
all brake open the gates of death, and
forc'd themselves into the other world.
To these you may please to add the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable
Examples of that Prince of
<hi>Romane</hi> wisdome (as <hi>Lactanrius</hi> calls
him) <hi>Cato,</hi> who with his own hands and
sword, opened a flood-gate in his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells,
to let his life flow forth, having all
the night before prepar'd himselfe to fall
boldly, with the Lecture of <hi>Plato</hi>'s
discourse, of the Immortality of the
Soul; and of the famous <hi>Cleombrotus,</hi>
who, upon no other incitement, but
<hi>Plato</hi>'s reasons in the same discourse,
threw himselfe from a precipice, as if he
<pb facs="tcp:58804:20"/>
went instantly to experiment the truth
of what he had newly read; and though
<hi>Aristotle</hi> would not admit, that he did
it upon any other account, but that of
<hi>Pusillanimity</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> yet Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine
(De Civit. Dei. Lib. 1. cap.
22.)</hi> ascribes it altogether unto <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of minde,</hi> his words being these;
<hi>When no Calamity urged him, no
Crime, either true or imputed, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but greatnesse of minde mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him to embrace death, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the sweet bonds of life.</hi> And
<hi>Lactantius,</hi> who was severe enough
in his censure, both of the <hi>Act,</hi> and the
<hi>Book</hi> that occasion'd it, sayes of him;
<hi>Praecipitem se dedit nullam aliam ob
causam nisi quod</hi> Platoni <hi>credidit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SIR, By this time you are satisfied, both
of the injuries done to the memory of the
<hi>Temperate, Good,</hi> and <hi>Pious</hi> EPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CVRVS,
and of my willingnesse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir
to redresse them. And my dull and
<pb facs="tcp:58804:20"/>
unequall Apologie for him being now
ended, I should begin another for <hi>my
selfe,</hi> in that I have rather disturbed,
then either delighted or informed you.
But this being much the greater difficulty
of the two, I think it safer for me, to put
my selfe upon your mercy for an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
forgivenesse, then to trust to my own
wit, to make excuses for my failings
herein; especially, since your patience

no man will deny, that he aimes at that End.
But, seeing it is too certain, that most men miss
of that end; it cannot be doubted, that the

may from thence safely conclude, that these

doth consist, and whence or how it is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained:

his Goods: and other things, which though he
would not, they should befall him; yet when
they do befall him, he doth not only constantly
and bravely endure, but also welcoms and
commends them, insomuch as they give him
an opportunity to experiment and gratulate
his Virtue, and with internall alacrity, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame,
<hi>I am burned, but not overcome; why should it
not be more desirable, not to have the fire overcome
my Constancy, than not to have it consume my

                  <p>FOrasmuch as it's sweet, or pleasant, for a
man to live without pain; and sweet, or
pleasant likewise, to enjoy Good things, and
be recreated by them: it is an evident truth,
that without both these sweetnesses or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
or one of them at least, Felicity cannot
be understood (for, we accept Pleasure, Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
Jucundity, and other Terms of the like
importance, for one and the same thing:)
though there have not wanted some, who with
great pomp and ostentation, have so discoursed
of Pleasure, as if it were a certain Evill, in its
own nature; and upon consequence, concluded
it to be not onely inconsistent with, but wholly
Alien from wisdom and Happiness. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
before we come to enquire, whether <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
doth consist in Pleasure,</hi> or not; requisite it is,
that we remonstrate, that <hi>Pleasure is a reall good,

in it self.</hi>

                  <p>Since that is Good, which helpeth, which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
which is amiable and inviting to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite;
and on the contrary, that is Evill, which
harmeth, which displeaseth, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull,
and so inciteth the Appetite to an
odium and aversion: certainly there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
which doth more please, more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
is more amiable, more desiderable,
than Pleasure; and on the contrary, nothing
that doth more incommode, more offend, is
more to be abhorred and avoided, than pain:
Wherefore, Pleasure seems to be not onely a
Good, but also the Essentiall <hi>Reason,</hi> or very
<hi>Root</hi> of Good; insomuch as it is that very and
onely thing, for whose sake, or in respect
whereof an object is Good or Desirable: as on
the reverse; pain seems to be not only an Evil in
it self, but also the Formall <hi>Reason,</hi> or very
<hi>Root</hi> of Evill; insomuch as it is that alone, in
respect whereof any thing is Evill or Hatefull.
For, though we somtimes avoid Pleasure; yet
is it not the pleasure it self which we avoid, but
some pain that is annexed unto it, or impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
on it: as likewise if we somtimes court and
pursue a pain, it is not the pain it self, that wee
pursue, but some pleasure that is conjoyned
unto it.</p>

neglect, hate, or decline pleasure, as it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but, because usually very great pains
follow and overtake such, who know not to
follow Pleasure with Reason and Moderation;
nor is there any man, that loves, desires, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues
Pain, simply as it is pain; but because he
expects some very great pleasure to accrew to
him thereupon; and such frequently may be the
constitution of the time, as that he hath no

                  <p>To instance in very small things; who is
there among us, that undertakes and endures
any laborious exercise of the body, unlesse to
the end, that he may thereby acquire some
commodity or benefit? And who can justly
reprehend him who desires and endeavours
to enjoy that pleasure, upon which nothing
of trouble or discommodity doth attend? Or
him, who endeavours to eschew that Paine, by
which no pleasure can be procured? But, we
may justly accuse, and esteem those persons
worthy of contempt, who being intricated
and corrupted with the blandishments of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
pleasures, do not foresee nor provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those pains and troubles, that must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue,
as being inevitably impendent upon all
heads that are blinded with cupidities. The
like blame is due also to those who forsake
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58804:29"/>
their stations, and desert the duties of their
places and offices, out of a certain softnesse
and weaknesse of Minde, <hi>i. e.</hi> of Fear, of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,

                  <p>Now, of these things, the <hi>Distinction</hi> is easie
and expedite. For, in times of freedome, when
all lies open to the arbitrary disposition of our
own choice, so that there is no impediment,
but we may do that which is most pleasing to
us; in such case, it is lawfull for us to pursue
and embrace all pleasure, and avoid all pain.
But, such frequently may be the constitution
of the times, as that pleasures are rather to be
repudiated, and labours and troubles not to
be refused.</p>

                  <head>VI.</head>
                  <p>So, though we esteem all pleasures to be a
reall good, and all pain to be a reall evill; yet
we do not therefore affirm, that we ought, at
all times, to pursue that, and avoid this. For,
it is good for us, to sustain some pains, that we
may afterward enjoy more abundant plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures;
and expedient to abstain from some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
that we may not by them incurre more

of the true <hi>Criteria,</hi> or judges of good

and evill, we deduced severall Canons, or
Rules, for the guidance and regulation of our
Affections, or Passions: accounting Pleasure
and Pain, for the most certain Criterion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
and Aversion. And this upon very
good reason; seeing that from the Benefit or
Harm that redounds unto us from the fruition
of them; all the Objects of our Affections or
Passions ought to be judged Good or Evill;

other times Evill as Good.</p>

                  <p>From these Considerations, therefore (that
we may inculcate the matter) we conclude, that
no pleasure is of it self Evill; but some things
there are, which albeit they afford some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
yet they are such, as occasion and induce
pains much greater than themselves. Whereto,
by way of Consequence, we superadd this; if
any one pleasure could be so collected into it
self, or sequestred from all dross, as that it should
neither comprehend in it, nor leave behind it
any the least measure of pain: assuredly, by that
Collection and simplicity, it would become no
less perfect and absolute, than are the chiefest
Works of Nature; and so pleasures could have
no Difference either of Qualities or Degrees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves, but would all be equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable.</p>

or, as Philosophers speak, the First <hi>Aptum</hi>

since the sence alone doth evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
it, no lesse than it doth that Fire is

sufficient it is for us onely to observe it. For, if
when we have taken away from man all his

it is, that what is according to Nature,
what against Nature, must be judged by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

it self: and consequently, that Pleasure is

                  <p>That Pleasure is also the <hi>Last</hi> or <hi>Highest of

soon understood even from hence; that it is
Pleasure alone, for which we desire all other
things: and never desire Pleasure for any thing
but it self. For, other things we may desire, to
the end we may be affected or delighted with
Pleasure: but no man did ever require a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
why we would be affected and delighted
therewith; truly, no more, than for what
Cause, or to what End we should desire to be
happy. Seeing that Pleasure and Felicity ought
to be reputed as in the same degree, so also for
one and the same thing: and consequently, for
the end, Extreme, or Supreme of Goods, to
which all other things subordinately conduce,
and which is it self subordinate or referrible

                  <p>The same may be Confirmed from hence;
that (as wee have praemonished) Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
cannot be understood, unlesse it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
to be a certain state wherein a man
may live most sweetly, most pleasantly, <hi>i. e.</hi> in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58804:32"/>
the greatest Pleasure, of which his Nature is
capable. For, but take away from life that
sweetnesse, that jucundity; and pray, what No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Felicity can remain? wee say of Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;
not onely such as we termed Divine, but
also that, which we account Human, and which
is not otherwise capable of more and lesse, or of
Intension and Remission, than onely as it may
admit of more and lesse of Pleasure.</p>

                  <head>VII.</head>
                  <p>That we may further manifest this Truth, by
a Comparation of Pleasure with pain; let us
suppose a man to enjoy many, great, and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
pleasures both in mind and body; no pain
molesting him in the present, nor threatning
him in the future: and then what state can bee
imagined more desireable, more happy than
this? For, in him, who is thus affected, there
must be a Constancy or firmnesse of Mind,
fearing neither Death, nor Pain; because Death
is insensible of any pain, and in life, if pain be
long, it must be light, if great, it cannot be long;
so that the Brevity is a comfort against the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
thereof, and the Levity against Diutur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
When a man arrives at such a Condition,
as that he doth not tremble at the thought of
Divinity, nor suffer the present pleasures to slip
away unenjoyd, while his mind is taken up
either with the memory of past Goods, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of future; and doth every day solace
himself with the assiduous recordation of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58804:32"/>

be added to encrease the Happiness of this mans
Condition?</p>

                  <p>Suppose again, on the other side, that a man
is afflicted with as great anguish of Mind, and
violent pains of Body, as his nature can receive;
that he hath lost all probability, all hopes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the least Extenuation of his Miseries; and
that his tempestuous thoughts cannot lay hold
of any comfort in the apprehension of any
pleasure, past, present, or expected: and

of all which doth arise only from a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

why we affirme this kind of pleasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone

pleased to observe, that Nature doth not tend
to any other pleasure, primarily, or as to her
principal scope, but only to what is <hi>stable;</hi>
which followes upon the remove of all paine
and Molestation. For she doth not propose to
her self the Moveable pleasure, as the end at
which she aimes; but hath provided it only
as the meanes conducible to that end, that it
might be as it were a Condiment to sweeten
that Naturall operation which is necessary to
the Eradication of all Pain and Molestation.
For instance; seeing that Hunger and Thirst
are things troublesome and incommodious,
in the present, to an Animal; the Primary End
of Nature, is to constitute the Animal in that
state, in which it may be free from that trouble
and offence: and because that cannot be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
but by Eating and Drinking; therefore
hath she wisely provided, that the Action of
Eating and Drinking should be accompanied
with a certain pleasantness and jucundity, that
so the Animal might be thereby invited the

necessary Action.</p>

Pleasures to order and Decorum; and teacheth
us that we are not to look upon any pleasure,
as the perfection and End of our lives, but
what Nature her self hath ordained for that
End, and which can be no other, but what we
have declared. For<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> while Nature is our guide,
whatever we do, must conduce only to this;
that we may not be pained in body nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed
in mind: and when we have once at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to that state, all the Tempests of our
mind cease, and all our Hopes and Desires are
lost in Fruition, and there can be nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
it, to which to aspire, in order to the
Complement of our Happinesse. For, we then
want Pleasure, when the absence of it
doth produce pain in us: but, when wee
are not pained, then doe we want no pleasure.</p>

                  <p>Hence comes it, that the Sum or Height of all
Pleasures, doth consist only in the Amotion of
all pains, or in that state which followes upon
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58804:35"/>
that Amotion: for, wherever Pleasure is, there
can be nothing of pain, of Anxiety. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it follows also, that the highest Pleasure
terminated in the privation of pain, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
be varied and distinguished; but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be Augmented or Amplified; for, Nature
so long as she hath taken away all pain, doth
encrease pleasure; but, all pain being removed,
she suffers not pleasure to be encreased in Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude,
but only admits some certain Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
thereof, that are not then at all necessary,
as being such, that are not comparated to this,
that we may not be pained.</p>

                  <p>Moreover, from hence it appears, that those
men insult without cause, who accuse us,
not to account this, <hi>To want all Pain,</hi> to be som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
consisting in the middle betwixt pain and
pleasure: but, so to confound it with the other
member of the Division, as to make it not only
a Pleasure, but even the <hi>Highest of all Pleasures.</hi>
For, because, when we are Exempted from
pain, we join in that very Exemption and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity
from all molestation, and every thing
wherein we joy, is a pleasure; as every thing
wherewith we are offended, is a pain: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the privation of all pain, by us, rightly
named a Pleasure. For, as when Hunger and
Thirst are expelled with meat and drink; that
very Expulsion of the trouble of them doth
adferr the Consequution of a pleasure: so, in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:58804:35"/>
every thing else, the very Amotion of pain
causeth the succession of pleasure.</p>

reply to those, who urge against us, that there
is no Reason, why this Middle state of Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
should be esteemed rather a pleasure
than a pain. For, upon the detraction of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
discontent doth not presently ensue, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
perhaps some pain immediately succeed
into the room of that former pleasure: but, on
the contrary, we alwaies conceive a joy upon
the losse of any pain, though none of those
pleasures succeed, which consist in the delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
affection of the Sense. By which we may
clearly understand, how great a pleasure it is,
<hi>Not to be in Pain:</hi> whereof if any man doubt,
let him ask of those, who are infested with
those sharp pains of the Gout, Toothach, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

                  <p>As for the Diseases of the <hi>Body;</hi> since the

for the prevention, as Cure of them; leaving
the praescription of both praeservative and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
remedies to the learned professors of that
Art, we shall sufficiently discharge our present
duty, if we admonish you of only two things.
The <hi>one</hi> is, that we alwaies observe <hi>Temperance,</hi>
and live soberly and Continently, to the end
that we may avert all diseases, or at least make
them more gentle and more easily curable;
since for the most part, the Harvest of Diseases
doth arise from the seeds of Intemperance and
Incontinence. The other, that when we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
with Diseases, we instantly have recourse
to Fortitude; that so we may both endure them
with Constancy of Mind, and not exasperate
them by impatience, and comfort our selves
with this, that if our pain be great, it must be
short; if long, light.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="part">
                  <head>IV.</head>
                  <p>And as for the Diseases of the Mind, against
them Philosophy is provided of Remedies;
being, in that respect, justly accounted the
Physick of the Mind: but it is not with equall
facility consulted, nor applied by those who are
sick in Mind. And this, because we judge of the
Diseases of the body, by the Mind: but the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
of the Mind we neither feel in the body,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58804:37"/>
nor know or judge of them as we ought;
because that, wherby we should judge, is
distempered.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="part">
                  <head>V.</head>
                  <p>Hence it appears, that the <hi>Diseases of the
mind are more grievous and dangerous than those of
the body:</hi> as among diseases Corporeall, those
are most dangerous, which deprive us of our
senses; such are the Apoplexy, Lethargy,
Phrensie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again, that the Diseases of the
Mind are more pernicious than those of the
Body, is manifest from the same reason, which
demonstrateth that the Pleasures of the mind
are much better than those of the Body, which is
this, that wefeel in the body nothing but what is
present, bnt in our mind we are sensible of also
what is past, and what's to come. For, as the
Anxiety of the mind, arising by consent from
the pains of the body, may be very much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated,
if we have possessed our selves with
a conceipt, that some Eternall and Infinite E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
is impendent over us: so may it be very
much mitigated, if we fear no such Evill. And
this likewise is manifest; that the greatest
Pleasure, or Trouble of the mind, doth more
conduce to an happy, or miserable life; than
either of the other two, though it should be
equally lasting in the body.</p>

                  <p>Now, because there are two Capitall disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Mind, namely Cupidity and Fear,
with their severall branches, and with discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
or trouble conjoyned, after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as pain is adjoyned to the diseases of the
body; therefore is it the part of Philosophy to
apply such Remedies, as may prevent them
from invading the mind; or at least overcome
and expell them, when they have invaded it.
Such chiefly are the vain Desires of Wealth,
of Honours, of Dominion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Fear of
Coelestiall Powers, of Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which having

drive away and expell those Desires and

a more Generall Prudence, which is nothing
else but very Reason it self, or the Dictamen

a certain perfect Disposition of the Mind,

which Reason, or prudence doth create, and

manifest it is, that we grant it to

being to Govern a mans life, and so to provide,

to order and compose all the accidents
and actions of a mans life, so as that they may
conduce only to Felicity, or the Pleasure for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
described: is more than manifest. For,
as we esteem the Knowledg of Physicians, not
for the art of Physick it self, but the End of it,
Health; and as the skill of a Pilot is not liked
of and commended for the ingenuity, but Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of it: even so Prudence, which is the art of
Living well, would never be considered nor
desired, if it were of no use or benefit in a mans
life; and it is studied and desired, as the sole
art, by which Happinesse, or pleasure is to be
acquired.</p>

                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>For, it is Prudence (or if you please Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
alone, which doth not only prevent the
incidence of any thing, that may cause Pain in
the Body; but also above all things doth expell
sadnesse from the mind, and suffers us not to
startle at those things, at the very mention
whereof the multitude usually trembles with
fear: and which being our Directresse, conducts
us to tranquillity, by extinguishing the arder of
all cupidities. For, cupidities are insatiable, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
not only single persons, but also nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and opulent Families; yea somtimes the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58804:45"/>
most potent and flourishing Common-wealths.
From Cupidities arise Hatred, Dissentions, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
Warrs; nor do they only diffuse
themselves abroad, or invade others with
blind fury: but being included in private
breasts, they cause intestine mutinies therein,
and totally evert the oeconomy and peace
thereof. So that it follows, that they must of
necessity make life most irksom and bitter;
and that none but the Wise, or Prudent man,
who have cut off all Inanity and Error, and
circumscribed his desires with the modest
boundaries of Nature; can live without sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude,
without Discontent, without
Fears.</p>

                  <p>It being evident, therefore, that all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations
of our life arise originally from Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and Indiscretion; and that it is Prudence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
which vindicates us from the violence of
Lusts and Fears, and teacheth us gently to bear
the injuries of Fortune, and pointeth out unto
us all the waies, that lead to Quiet and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity:

                  <p>Now the Reason, why we say, <hi>that a Prudent

foresee and provide against all in Generall.
Nor doth he, if any infortune intervene crosse
to his Hopes, or Councells, therefore afflict
himself: because he well knows it not to be in
the power of Human Reason, Sagacity, or
Policy, either to praevise, or praevent the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention

Accident. Yea, he holds it much better, to be

this; to be contented with the least, <hi>i. e.</hi> onely
so much, as sufficeth nature. And, as for those
impediments, which the sollicitous hunting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
more doth draw upon us; when they once
discover themselves (as soon they must) either
by the great labour of the body, or the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

man should, before he determines, upon what
course of life to put himself, strictly examine
his own Genius, and advise with himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the inclination thereof; that so he may
at length happily devote himself to that, which
he finds most agreeable to the Destination of it:
our purpose therein was, to intimate, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more miserable and more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent

                  <p>It follows from hence, that an Active life is
not fit for a slothfull and heavy person; nor a
slothfull lazy kind of life fit for an active: for
as idlenesse is quiet, and action labour to the
one; so to the other idlenesse is a labour, and
action quiet. Thus, a Souldiers life is unfit for
a Timorous and softly man; and an umbratile
life odious to an impatient and bold man: for
one cannot endure the heat of War; nor the
other the cool shadow of peace. So that nothing
can be more safe or hopefull, than for a man to
devote himself to that, to which he finds no
adversnesse or repugnancy in his nature.</p>

<hi>Paternall</hi> Prudence, let us observe onely what
may be inferred from the Praemises, touching
the Directions of a man, in the Election of his
course of life. Thus if you find your Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be such, as that you cannot, without the
ardors of the flesh, live single; that you can
with patience endure a morose and unquiet
Wife, and untoward and undutifull Children;
that you shall not be subject and apt to vex,
repine and grieve, when you shall hear your
Children crying and bawling, see them gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
on the bed of sicknesse, or snatcht away
by death before you; and that you shall not be
perplexed and distracted with those Cares and
sollicitudes, that accompany the provision of
all things necessary to a Conjugall state: why
then, indeed, it may be convenient for you, to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58804:49"/>
take a Wife, and beget Children; for which
you may provide by a Conjugall and Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

                  <p>You may presume, indeed, that your Wife
will be sweet and Complacent; that your
Children will be of ingenious and tractable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;
that your cares for them will not
be great, nor many; that you have so laid your
designs, as that you cannot expect any thing
but prosperity and good successe: and yet you
can but presume all this, nor do I know any
God, who will oblige himself, that your affairs
shal succeed according to this your presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Wherefore, seeing the businesse is very
doubtfull; it is far below the part of a Wise
man, willingly to put himself upon Chance,
to undergo the hazard, and engage himself in
that condition, from whence, in case he
should afterward repent, he cannot withdraw
himself.</p>

                  <p>We say, <hi>Willingly;</hi> because there may be some
such Circumstance, as may require a man,
though much against his will, to marry and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
Children; as, for instance, in case he live
in a Country but thinly peopled, and where
he is to be serviceable to the Common-wealth
by encreasing the members of it. Some, we
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:58804:50"/>
know, pretend the propagation of their speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
to which Nature seems to oblige all; but,
certainly, there is no fear that mankind should
fail, there being in all times and places enough
that give themselves to Marriage and Procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
so that some few Wise men may well be
permitted to abstain, and leave the businesse
of Propagation to be performed by others.</p>

                  <p>Now if any such Case, or certain Councell, or
any Necessity shall constrain you to marry;
then are you so to dispose your Wife, as that
she may be loving and complacent to you, and
a partner in your Cares: and to take such care
for your Children as is prescribed to you partly
by Nature, which by strong instinct obligeth
us to love and cherish them as soon as they are
born (and so much even Wolves, Tygers, and
all other wild Beasts alwaies do) and partly by
Prudence, which admonisheth so us to educate
and instruct them in the rudiments of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as that they may be obedient to the Laws
of the Country, and desire nothing so much, as
to be made Wise themselves.</p>

which they conceived that security chiefly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirable)
have affected to render themselves
illustrious with Glory and Renown: thinking
by that means to advance themselves to a state
of security and tranquillity. But, if the lives of
these proved really secure and tranquill (as, in
truth, it could hardly be) then did they indeed,
attain that very thing, which, to Nature is so
good and pleasant: and if they were not, then

a Wise man to the Helm, and really stand in

Casualities, as that while Fortune intervenes
in somelesse important Occurrences, the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

that the weaker, while they do their duties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

them, nor live in want of those necessaries to
life, wherewith the others superabound. For,
the End of every Society of men, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,

so is it of Fortitude to erect a Fearing

to be let down by Pusillanimlty, than to be

                  <p>Concerning Temperance, this is first to be
observed; that it is not to be affected and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
for its own sake, but for the Pleasure it
brings with it, that is, because it adfers peace
to a mans mind, and pleasantly affect it with
a certain Concord. For, its proper operation is
the Moderation of our Cupidities; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that we may follow the conduct of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
in the Election or avoydance of Objects,
it admonisheth us, that it is not sufficient for
us to judge rightly what is to be done, or
not to be done: but it behoves us also to stand
to and execute that judgement.</p>

                  <p>Most men, being not able to hold and keep
to what they have resolved upon, as overcome
and enfeebled by the apparence of a present
Pleasure; resigne up themselves to the fetters
of Lusts, and never foresee what is to follow
thereupon: and, for the same cause, inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
pursuing a small, transitory, and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
pleasure, and such as they might have
otherwise enjoyed, or wholly wanted. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any offence to Nature; they precipitate
themselves into grievous diseases, into losses,
into disgrace, and many times into the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
decreed by the Laws.</p>

                  <p>But, they who would so enjoy pleasures,
as that no pains shall ensue thereupon; and
constantly retain their judgement, not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
by Pleasure, to the doing of what they
know ought not to be done: these men acquire
the greatest Pleasure, by pretermitting Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
and frequently suffer some pain, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their falling into greater.</p>

                  <p>And hence is it understood, that Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is to be desired, not because it avoids
some Pleasures, but because by restraining a
man from them, it declines Troubles, which
being avoided, he afterwards obtains Greater
Pleasures. And this in the mean time it so doth,
as that the action becomes Honest and Decent:
and we may clearly understand, that the same
men are Lovers as of Pleasure, so also of Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;
yea, and that such, who esteem and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue
all Virtues, do for the most part perform
those actions, and attain to those Ends, as that
by them it is made manifest, how odious to all
men Cruely is, and how amiable Goodnesse
and Clemency; and that those very Pleasures,
which Evill men most eagerly desire and
hunt after, do fall into the lapps of onely good

                  <p>Moreover, for as much as among Cupidities,
about the restraint and Moderation of which
Temperance is imployed, some are Naturall,
others vain or meerly opinionative; and of the
Naturall ones some are Necessary, other Not-necessary
(we omit, that of the Necessary ones,
some pertain simply to Life; such is the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
of meat and drink, together with the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
which consists only in Motion: and others
absolutely to Felicity it self; such as that of
Indolency and Tranquillity, or the stable Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure)
manifest it is, that not without good
cause we have, in our Physiology, made Three
kinds of Cupidities, <hi>viz. (1.)</hi> some that are
both <hi>Naturall and Necessary: (2.)</hi> others that
are <hi>Naturall, but Not-necessary:</hi> and (3.) others
that are <hi>neither Naturall nor Necessary,</hi> but meerly
Vain, or arising from vain <hi>Opinion.</hi>

                  <p>And because we said, that those are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and Necessary, which cause damage and
pain in the body, if they be not satisfied; it is
evident, that such Cupidities, which inferr no
damage nor pain, if not satisfied, and yet are
joyned with earnest and vehement instigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
do become such, not by any Necessity, but
by Opinion: and though they have their seeds

from Nature, yet when they run up to Excesse,
their growth is caused only by the evill, but
powerfull influence of Opinion; which makes
men far worse then Beasts, since they are not
obnoxious to any such diffusion, or Excesse;
and again, that such Cupidities may be proved
to be not only Not-necessary, but also Not-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
only by this, that they import an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
in Excesse, and very hardly or never to
be satisfied, and are, for the most part, worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accounted the Causes of some Harm or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>Sobriety,</hi> which stands opposed to <hi>Gluttony,</hi> or

               <div n="1" type="part">
                  <p>IT can hardly be expressed, how great Good
redounds from Sobriety; which reducing a
man to a thin, simple, and spare Diet, by hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
experience teacheth, how little that is,
which Nature requires, and that her Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
may be abundantly satisfied with slender
and easily-provided Aliment, such as decocted
Barly, Fruits, Herbs, and Fountain-Water.</p>

                  <p>For, these things sufficiently remove the
trouble of the body arising from want of suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
are every where to be had, in good
plenty; and contain the Faculties of dry and
moist Aliments. Whatever is more than this,
amounts to Luxury, and concerns only the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of a Cupidity, which is neither Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
nor occasioned by any thing, whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
doth necessarily inferr any the least offence
or detriment to Nature: but ariseth partly
from hence, that the want of somwhat, after
which the exorbitant appetite longeth, is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
reall, and born with impatience; partly
from hence, that an absolute Delight, or such
as is entire and neither accompanied with, nor
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58804:58"/>
attended on by any trouble, is presumed from
the satisfaction thereof.</p>

               <div n="3" type="part">
                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>And forasmuch as such things, as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
provided to our hands, abundantly
suffice to supply all Natures wants; and
these Aliments are such, as partly for their sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
partly for their Exiguity, are easily
providible: hence it follows, that he, who feeds
upon flesh, hath need of other things to eat
with it; when he, who is satisfied only with
Inanimates, hath need of but half so much as
the other, and sustains himself with what is
easie in the provision, and of small cost and
pains in the preparation.</p>

                  <p>Now, as for the <hi>Commodities,</hi> which redound
from Sobriety, they are principally <hi>Four.</hi> The
<hi>First</hi> is, that it brings and conserves Health, by
accustoming the body to simple, course, and
spare Diet. For, sumptuous Feasts, and full
meals, and various dishes, are they which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
exasperate, and prolong Crudities,
Head-aches, Rheumes, Gouts, Fevers, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diseases: not that plain and simple fare,
which Nature affordeth both as Necessary and
wholsom, and this not only to other Animals,
but also to man, who yet depraves them by his
exorbitancy, and corrupts them by such Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licates
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58804:58"/>
as which while he affects, he affects on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his own Destruction.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="part">
                  <head>V.</head>
                  <p>Who so is Wise, therefore, let him alwaies
beware of that Dish, which his irregular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
earnestly covets and pursues; and upon
which he cannot feed, without being afterward
convinced, that it was gratefull to him only to
his own harm. Of this sort are all costly, fat,
and luscious meats; and therefore the use of
Flesh must be rather Hurtfull, than Beneficiall
to Health; of which this may be a very good
Argument: that since Health is preserved by
the same means, which restore it, when lost;
and abstinence from flesh is generally prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by learned Physicians, in most diseases,
especially acute ones; certainly, the best way
of conserving health, must be a spare diet, and
no Flesh.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="6" type="part">
                  <head>VI.</head>
                  <p>It is no wonder, that the People commonly
cry up the use of Flesh, as an Aliment highly
conducing to Health; for, they magnifie all
things that please the Gust, and think that the
direct way to Health lies in the wallowing in
Pleasures, nay, even of Venereall pleasures;
whereof, notwithstanding there is none, which
is beneficiall to any man, and that constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is very rare, to which it is not hurtfull at all
time.</p>

               <div n="7" type="part">

                  <head>VII.</head>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is this; that it makes men ready,
vivacious, and quick, in the doing of all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
necessary to life. For, if you regard the
Functions of the Mind, it conserves the same
in serenity, acutenesse, and vigour: if the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Body; it conserves it in health, and
so in strength, agility, and hardinesse. Whereas,
on the other side, Repletion, overmuch satie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
surfetting, beclouds the mind, dulls the
edge of it, and brings it to an unmanly languor
and stupidity: and the body it makes as disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
so feeble, unactive and burdensom. Now
I beseech you, what great matters can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
from that man, whose members are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
joynts enfeebled, sinews relaxed, head
beclouded, tongue heavy and paralyticall,
eys floating in rheums, veins glowing with heat
and Choler, mouth full of brawling and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and all by reason of Wine drunk in
excesse.</p>

                  <head>VIII.</head>
                  <p>Verily, a Wise man, who ought to content
his stomack either with lesse then a pint of
small Wine, or with Water from the Fountain,
the most not only wholsom, but sweet of all
Drinks; will be very farre from spending the
night in Compotations and Drunkennesse: and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58804:59"/>
as far from gorging it, and oppressing Nature
with meats fat, sweet and gustfull, and of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and slow digestion; since he well knowes,
that the most simple Cates, such as only Nature
gives and cooks, will equally satisfie the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and better preserve Health.</p>

                  <head>IX.</head>
                  <p>And, what though such simple and slender
Diet will not make a man as strong as <hi>Milo</hi>
was, not pamper the flesh and corroborate the
sinews? yet this doth no way disparage the use
of it to a Wise man, who hath no need of such
Robustnesse of body, and intension of strength,
the businesse of his life being chiefly Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
not Activity and Petulancy.</p>

                  <head>X.</head>
                  <p>A <hi>Third</hi> advantage accrewing from Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is this; that a sober man, coming to a Feast,
eats his meat with ten times more delight than
another, because he brings an exact palate to
tast, and a clean and sharp stomach, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it. Not that course and homly Cates do
not afford as much delight both to the Gust
and stomach, as the most sumptuous Banquets,
when a man brings with him the best of saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
hunger (for, every man knows, that in
case of perfect hunger and thirst, decocted Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and clean Water are highly gratefull, and
supply that defect of nourishment, from
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58804:60"/>
whence the trouble of hunger and thirst arise)
but because those, who are daily used to more
sumptuous entertainments, have their palates
so furred and imbued, and their stomachs so
oppressed and weakned by the continuall use
and ingurgitation of them, that they neither
relish nor swallow their meats and drinks with
pleasure comparable to that, which a sober
man receives, whose Gusto is sincere, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
strong. Thus also a Wise man, who comes
but now and then to publick shews and specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
is sensible of far more pleasure than those,
who daily frequent them.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="11" type="part">
                  <head>XI.</head>
                  <p>Nor can what we say, concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultance
of as much pleasure from the coursest
food, as from dishes of the greatest cost and
most exquisite Cookery; be contradicted by
any, but him, who exposeth himself to the
Tyranny of vain opinions; who doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that those only enjoy magnificence with
greatest pleasure, who do the least need or care
for it; and who never tasted the pleasure of
Bread and Water, when pressed with pure
hunger and thirst. For mine own part,
seriously, when I feed upon simple Bread
and Water, and somtimes (when I would
entertaine my selfe somwhat more splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly)
mend my chear with a little Cheese; I
apprehend abundant satisfaction therein, and
bid defiance to those pleasures, which the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58804:60"/>
and sensuall Vulgar so much like and
cry up in the magnificence of great Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and hereupon, if I have no more than
brown Bread, Decocted Barly, and clean Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
I think my Table so well furnished, as
that I dare dispute Felicity even with <hi>Iove</hi>

                  <head>XII.</head>
                  <p>We farther affirm, that the magnificence of
Feasts, and variety of Dishes, do not only not
exempt the mind from Perturbations; but not
so much as heighten the pleasure of the Body:
forasmuch as the end of Nature in Eating, is
the remover of Hunger. For Example; the use
of Flesh doth neither more especially take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
any thing, that is a trouble to Nature; nor
perform any thing, which might occasion or
convert to a trouble, if not performed. But, in
the mean time it doth affect nature with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
violent Gratefulnesse, and such as perhaps
may be contrary to it, insomuch as we observe,
that it doth the least of all meats conduce to
the prolongation of life: and all that it serveth
to, is the Variation of Imaginary Pleasures,
like the blandishments of <hi>Venus,</hi> and the drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Exotique wines, without which Nature,

this; that it makes us superior to the threats

their lives must be most miserable, unlesse they
can have wherewith to spend pounds and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents

Rapines, Murders, and the like horrid and

Luxury, and maintain their Profusenesse.
But, as for that sober person, who contents
himself with course and cheap food, such as

this man should stand in fear of Fortune? For,
who is there in the whole World so poor, as to
want these things? and what malignity of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

shew but boast of in publick. For, when they

which have no Turpitude really, or in

rob, defraud, commit adultery, is filthy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality,

the want of such shamefastnesse, as the Customs

commonly praescribe, and from the observance

Virtue. Because, while others being most easily
taken with the flattering temptations of each,
indulgently devote themselves to both; the
Wise man duly perpending and foreseeing the
Evill consequent upon them, doth wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudiate
them: declaring, that Musick is an
allurement to drink, an exhauster of moneys, a
friend to Idlenesse, an impediment to every
good, honest and generous work; and that
its sister Poetry is that, which hath in all ages
corrupted mens manners, made them prone to
all sorts of Vices, and chiefly to Lust, and this
by the Examples of even the Gods themselves.

whereas mean Riches, such as Nature offers

scraping together more than Nature knows

yet Nature doth not want them, nor doth she

money is desired (such are Love, Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

                  <p>Now, as for what we said, of the <hi>Immensity of
such Riches, as are coveted upon the suggestion of vain
Opinions;</hi> the Reason of it is this, that when
Nature is satisfied with Little, vain Opinion
ushering in Desire, alwaies engageth the mind
to think of somthing, which it doth not
possesse, and, as if it were really needfull, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
and fixeth the Desire wholly and entirely
upon it. Whence it comes, that to him, who is
not satisfied with a little, nothing can ever be
enough: but still the more wealth he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth,
the more he conceives himself to
want.</p>

                  <head>VIII.</head>
                  <p>Wherefore, seeing there can never be want
of a Little, the Wise man, doubtlesse, while
he possesseth that little, ought to account it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great Riches: because therein is no want,
whereas other riches, though great in esteem,
are really very small, because they want multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to infinity. Whence it follows, that
he who thinks not his own Estate, how small
soever, sufficiently ample; though he should
become Lord of the whole World, will ever
be miserable. For, Misery is the companion of
Want; and the same vain opinion, which first
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58804:73"/>
perswaded him that his own Estate was not
sufficient, will continue to perswade him that
one World is not sufficient, but that he wants
more and more to infinity.</p>

                  <p>Have you, then, a design to make any one
Rich indeed? Know, that the way is not by
adding to his Riches, but by Detracting from
his desires. For, when having cut off all vain
and superfluous desires from his breast, he shall
so compose himself to the praescripts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as to covet no more than she needs and
requires: then at length shall he find himself
to be a Rich man in reality, because he shall
then find that Nothing is wanting to him.
Hereupon may you also inculcate this maxim
to him; <hi>If you live according to Nature, you shall
never be poor: but if according to Opinion, you shall
nover be rich. Nature desires little, Opinion infinite.</hi>

is neither absolutely ours, nor absolutely Not ours.</hi>
More plainly; we are neither so to hope for a

Nor so to despair of it, as if it were certainly
not to come; because it may fall out, that no
Accident may intervene to prevent or divert
it. For, by the observation of this maxime, we
shall reap the benefit of Moderation; so as not
being destitute of all Hope, we shall not be

the Wise man and the Fool; that the Wise doth,
indeed, expect things Future, but not depend
upon them, and in the mean time enjoyes the
Goods that are present (by considering how
great and pleasant they are) and gratefully
remembers what are past: but the fool, fixing

of obtaining those Pleasures, with the hopes
whereof being enflamed, they had undergone
many and great Difficulties and Labours. That

we are generally too ungrateful toward

we have formerly received: forasmuch as no
Pleasure is more certain, than what cannot now
be taken from us. For, present Goods are not
yet Consummate and wholly solid; some

we have already hinted, that a Wise

thereupon instantly succeeds Desperation,
wich is alwaies accompanied with Trouble

much, that the greater Pleasure cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

                  <p>For, seeing that to measure the Ends of

that the Supreme pleasure is no other but an
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:58804:76"/>

                  <p>The Hopes of a more prolonged Pleasure,
or of a longer Age, we confesse, may seem to
render the present Pleasure more Intense; but,
it can seem so only to such, who measure the
Ends of Pleasure not by right Reason, but by
vain opinion, and the Consequent thereof, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire;
and who look upon themselves so, as if,

And hence it comes, that perfectly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that Death doth nothing concern

                  <p>That this Virtue also is to be embraced, in

that neither the undergoing of great labours,
nor the suffering of great pains, are things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting
and desireable in themselves; as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
is not Patience, nor Assiduity, nor Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
nor Industry it self, which is so highly
commended; nay, nor Fortitude: but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

the quiet of life is wholly perturbed; and as to
yeeld to pains, and endure them with a dejected
and weak mind, is a great misery, and by that
basenesse and weaknesse of Spirit, many have
uttterly lost their Parents, Friends, Country,
and most themselves: so, on the other side,
doth a strong and sublime mind make a man
free from all Care and Anguish, insomuch as
it contemns Death, upon this account, that all
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58804:77"/>
who suffer it, are in the same case, as before
they were in being; and is fortified against all
Pains, as being assured, that the greatest pains
are soon determined by Death, that small pains
have many intervalls of quiet, that mean pains
are not above our patience; that if they be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,
they are to be endured with constancy,
which much mitigates them; and if intolerable,
he is quietly to depart the world, as a Theatre

that Timidity and unmanlinesse are not to be

                  <p>THE other thing which invades, and
strikes the Minds of men with extream
Fear and Terror, is <hi>Death;</hi> and this, because of
we know not what Everlasting Evills, that are
expected, immediately to ensue thereupon (and
that's very strange, you'l say, that men should
fear to suffer Evill, then when they shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of all sense, and utterly cease to be)
they being ignorant, that all those solemn sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that are commonly told of Hell, Rhada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manth,
the Furies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the meer Fictions of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58804:81"/>
Poets: and that if they contain any thing of
truth in them, they are but cunning allusions to
the miseries, which many men suffer during
life, since those, who are uncessantly vexed
with vain Fears, superfluous Cares, insatiable
Desires, and other violent Passions, lead lives
so truly miserable, as that they may well be
said, to suffer the torments of Hell.</p>

from these Terrors; accustom your mind to
this thought, <hi>That Death doth nothing concern us;</hi>
and upon this Argument: whatever of Good
or Evill we are capable of in life, we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
thereof onely in respect of our Sense;
but, Death is a Privation of all Sense, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> That Death is a Privation of all Sense,
is consequent from hence, that it is a Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and what is once dissolved, must hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
remain without all Sense. So that Death
seems a thing most easily Contemptible; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as it is an ineffectuall Agent, and in vain
threatens pain, where the Patient is destroyed,
and so ceaseth to be capable of pain.</p>

                  <p>True it is, indeed, and too true, that men
generally abhor Death, somtimes because they
look upon it as the Greatest of Pains, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58804:82"/>
because they apprehend it as the Cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all their Enjoyments, or Privation of
all things that are Dear to them in life; but
in both these Respects, altogether without
Cause: since this thing, <hi>Not-to-live,</hi> or <hi>Not-to-be,</hi>
ought to be no occasion of Terror;
because when once we come to that, we shall

great Fooles who abhorre to think, that after
Death their Bodies should be torne by wild
beasts, burned in the flame of the funerall pile,
devoured by wormes, &amp;c. for, they doe not
consider, that then they shall not be, and so
not feele, nor complaine, that they are torne,
burned, devoured by corruption or wormes.
And that those are Greater Fooles, who take
it grievously, that they shall no longer enjoy
the conversation of their Wives, Children,

saith, that He feares Death, not because of any
Trouble or Anguish that it can bring, when it
comes; but because of the perpetuall Griefe,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58804:83"/>

till it comes, or while it is expected: foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as that, which can bring no trouble or

make us sad before it comes. Certainely, if
therebe any thing of Incommodity, or Feare
in the businesse of Death, it is the fault of him
that is Dying, not of Death it selfe: nor is there
any trouble in Death, more than there is after
it, and it is no lesse folly to feare Death, than
to feare old Age, since as old Age followes
close upon the heeles of youth, so doth Death

when we come to the point of Death, and are
even at the last gaspe, either we shall feele no

as no pain that is Great, can be Long; and so

                  <p>That Philosopher was very ridiculous, who
admonisheth the young man to live Honestly,
and the old bodie Honestly; because a Good
Life and a Good Death are not things to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58804:83"/>
be parted, and the Meditation of living honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and dying honestly, is one and the same:

that though man may provide for his Security,

no security, the youngest nor strongest cannot

                  <p>Finally, most of all foolish and ridiculous is
he, who saith, it is good either not to be born
at all, or to die as soon as born. For, if he speak
this in Earnest, why doth he not presently rid
himself of life, it being very easie for him so to
do, in case he hath well deliberated upon the
matter beforehand? And, if in jest; he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
mad, because these are things that admit
not of jesting. Again, in life there is somthing
Amiable in it self; and therefore he is as much
to be reprehended, who desires Death, as he
that is afraid of it. For, what can be so ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
as for a man to desire Death, when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
makes his life unquiet by the fear of
Death? or out of a wearinesse of life, to fly to

                  <p>Every man, therefore, ought to make it his
care, so to live, as that life may not be ingrate
or taedious to him; &amp; not to be willing to part
with life, till either Nature, or some intolerable
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58804:84"/>
Case call upon him to surrender it. And in
that respect, we are seriously to perpend whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is the more Commodious, for us to stay
till death come to us, or to go and meet it. For,
though it be an Evill, indeed, to live in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;
yet is there no Necessity for us to live
in Necessity: since Nature hath been so Kind
as to give us, though but one door into the
World, yet many doors out of it.</p>

                     <hi>COrporall Pain</hi> is that alone, which deserves
the name of Evill in it self, and which
indeed would carry the Reason of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of Evills, if so be our own delusive Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had not created and pulled upon our
heads another sort of pain, called the <hi>pain of the

and intollerable than any pain of the Body
whatever, as we have formerly deduced. For,
Discontent of mind, conceived upon the losse

height, that it exceeds the sharpest pains of the

by any such Losse whatever; in regard that all
such things are without the circle of our selves,
and so cannot touch us but by the interventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Opinion, which we coin to our selves.
And thereupon we may infer, that <hi>we are not
subject to any other reall Evill, but only the Pain of
the Body:</hi> and that the mind ought to complain
of nothing, which is not conjoyned to some
pain of the body, either present, or to come,</p>

                  <p>The Wise man, therefore, will be very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
that he do not wittingly draw upon
himself any Corporall pain; nor do any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

to ensue: unlesse it be in order either to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydance
of some Greater pain, that would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
certainly invade him; or the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of some Greater Pleasure dependent
thereupon; as we have formerly inculcated.
This considered, we may very well wonder
at Those [Philosophers] who accounting
Health, which is a state of Indolency, a very
great Good, as to all other respects; do yet, as
to this respect, hold it to be a thing meerly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different:
as if it were not an indecent playing

infirm and obnoxious to Diseases; or of any
Externall violence done him, which (so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

the condition of frail man) he could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent

rodds, or otherwise cruelly tormented by Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants)
we say, in case either of these shall have
brought pain upon him: then is it his part, to

either it is determined of its self, and suceeded
if not by absolute Indolency, yet by very great
Mitigation; or is determined by Death, in
which there can be no pain. And as for that
pain, which is Lasting; it is not only gentle and

daies, nay, not hours, in which the body may
enjoy not only ease, but very much Pleasure

that Great pain cannot be Long; nor Long

upon those things, which he hath most

               <div n="1" type="part">
                  <p>YOU may remember, we said even now,
that all Discontent of Mind is conceived
for such things, that are Externall Evills, and
the Contraries to those Goods that we most
love and desire. For, men usually call some
things Adverse, and others Prosperous: and
we may generally observe, that the Mind,
which is elevated and insolent with Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and dejected with Adversity; is low, abject
and base. This considered, you may easily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
that all we should in this place say, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Evills inducing Discontent, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
whereof, we have need of Fortitude;
may be sufficiently inferred from what we
formerly said, concerning those Goods, that
are the General objects of our Desires or Cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
and in respect whereof we have need of
Temperance.</p>

                  <head>II.</head>
                  <p>Let this Generall Axiome, therefore, suffice;
that <hi>Discontent of Mind is not grounded upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but upon meer Opinion of Evill;</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:58804:89"/>
respect thereof it becomes necessary, that every
man be in Discontent, who conceives himself
to be under some Evill, whether only praevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and expected, or already come upon him.
For, how comes it, that a Father, whose Son is
killed, is not a whit lesse cheerfull or merry,
if he know not of the death of his Son, than if
he were yet alive and in health? or, that he,
who hath lost much of his good fame abroad,
or all his goods and Cattell by robbery at home;
is not at all sensible of either losse, till he hears
of it? Is it not Opinion alone, which makes
him sad and discontented thereupon? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
if Nature it self were the Author of that
sadnesse, the Fathers mind would be strook
with a sense of the losse of his Son, in the same
moment wherein he was slain: and in like
manner, he that hath suffered Detraction from
his honour, or been robbed of his Goods and
Cattell, would in the same instant receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of his losse, from the secret Regret
impressed upon his mind.</p>

               <div n="3" type="part">
                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>To the production of Discontent, therefore,
in the mind, it is absolutely necessary, that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
(not Nature) intervene betwixt the
supposed Evill and the Mind. However, that
you may be the more confirmed in this truth,
be pleased to observe this; If a man have an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that such a one is his true Son, who was
indeed begotten by another man; and again,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58804:89"/>
believe, that such a one is not his Son, though
himself be the right Father of him: let it be
told him, that He, whom he accounts not to be
his true Son, but really is so, is Dead; and he
shall never be moved at the sad tidings: but
let him hear of the death of the other, whom he
took for his true Son, but really was not so; and
he shall instantly be moved at the news, and
suddainly break forth into sorrow and laments.
And this, not from any Naturall Instinct, or
Sentiments Paternall: but only from the delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
suggestions of Opinion, that the one, who
was his Son, was not so; and that the other, who
was not his Son, was so.</p>

                  <p>Certainly, to those, who account it an Evill

that Praemeditation should encrease those E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils

not totally expunged out of his Mind that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
that they are reall Goods, and wholly
his own; and so some little of Fortune inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene,
and give him a blow, that may put him
to some small Regret and Discontent: in this
case, he is for the Alleviation of that his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,

                  <p>For, the Mind, of a Wise man is instructed
to conform to the Laws of Reason, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
follow the conduct thereof; and Reason
forbids him to fix his cogitations upon those
things, which may advance and foment his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content,
&amp; by that means helps him to abstract
his thoughts from all regret, and convert them
upon Goods either to come, or formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed,

<hi>Tessera Utilitatis,</hi> the Symboll of Utility, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

the one, that it may be <hi>Profitable,</hi> or respect the

the other, that it be <hi>Prescribed</hi> by the Common

since not only what is profitable is said to be
Just, but also the very Paction, or Agreement,

                  <p>Some there are, we know, who conceive and
affirm, that all things, that can be said to be
Iust, are so of their own proper and invariate
Nature; and that Lawes do not make them
to be just, but only declare and prescribe them
to be so, in respect of their own Nature: but
truly the matter is farre otherwise, the case in
this point being as in most other things that are
Usefull and Profitable, as in those which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
Health, &amp; many others of the like nature;
of which some may be beneficiall to one man,
and hurtfull to another, and so being often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
misapplyed, they fail of the end propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
as well in common, as in private.</p>

to be such, as really it is in its own Nature; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that Nature is invariate: we may justly
demand of the Authors of that opinion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no such things as are accounted just at
some times, in some places, by some men, are
so at all times, in all places, and to all men?
Ought not such to have observed, that many
of those things, that are constituted by Laws,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58804:95"/>
and so accounted Lawfull and Just; are not so
constituted, nor accounted among all Nations:
but are partly negected as things Indifferent,
by many; and partly rejected as Hurtfull, and
condemned as absolutely Unjust, by as many
others? And are there not some, who accept
some things as Universally Profitable, which
really are rather universally Destructive; and
accordingly embrace and enact them to be
Universally accommodate, in case they judge
them to be Accommodate, and to promise
some Generall Emolument to that particular
Society, in which they live?</p>

                  <p>This duly considered, the most that can be
said, in favour of that Opinion, it only this; that
that is Universally Iust, which is Profitable, or
conform to the Notion of Right or Iust, even
now described: for, in speciall, indeed, as Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
is varied among various Nations, so also is
Right or Iust; so as what may be accounted and
really is Iust in respect of one Nation, may be
Unjust in respect of another. And, therefore,
if it be demanded, <hi>Whether or no the same thing be
Right or Iust among all men?</hi> our answer must be,
that as to the Generall, it is the same, as being
somwhat that is profitable in mutuall Society;
but as to particulars, it may come not to be the
same among all men, particular Countries, and
particular Causes in severall Nations conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

found to be Profitable to mutuall Society, or
the Common participation of such things, as
are reputed Iust; that, certainly, hath truly and
fully the nature of Iust, in case it be such, as
that the Utility thereof may be extended to all:
but, if any man shall determine and establish
such a thing for Iust, and the same shall not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

sometimes fail; yet neverthelesse, if therebe

to the Notion, which we have given of
what is Iust; it is truly Iust, for that time: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially

both from the fury of Wild Beasts,

themselves in certain Companies or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
that so they might the better provide
against those incommodities, by Building
themselves Huts or Cottages, and furnishing
themselves with other Defensatives against the
fury of Wild beasts, and against the injuries
of weather. But, in this state every one being
desirous to have his particular condition better
than another, and striving to make it so; there
arose various Contentions and Clashings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, about Food, Women, and other
Commodities, which the stronger alwaies
took from the weaker: untill at length they
found, that they could not live secure and
commodiously together; unlesse they made a
Common Agreement, and entred into mutuall
obligations not to do Harm or Injury each to
other; and that in case any one did harme or
injure another, the rest would punish him for

and freely alienate his propriety therein,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:58804:97"/>
by disposing of it to another. And this Bond,
or Generall Paction among them, was nothing
else but a Common Law, which all were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
bound to observe, and which did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
to every man a certain Right or Faculty of
Using and Disposing of whatever was his own,
according as himself thought meet. Whereupon
that very Law also came to be (as we formerly

                  <p>We need not commemorate, how the whole
Society, by Common Consent, transferred their
Power of Coercing or Punishing Delinquents,
upon some few Wise and Good men; or upon
One single person, who had the reputation of
being the Wisest and best among them all. That
which will be more pertinent and useful for us
to observe, is this; that in a Society those only
were accounted Iust, or Favourers and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers
of Iustice, who being content with their
own Rights, did not invade the Rights of any
other man, and so did injury to none: and those
Unjust, or Doers of Injustice, who being not
content with heir own Rights, did fly out and
invade those of others; and so doing them harm
either by rapine, or personall violence, or some
other way, were the Authors of an Injury.</p>

                  <p>And thus, truly, for some time, men lived
Peaceably and Happily, and especially under
either many Wise and Good Governours, or
one only Wise and Good Prince or King; who
being wholly intent upon the conservation of
the publique Utility, made, and by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the People, established divers Laws, by
which they might either prevent Dissentions
among the People, or, compose them, if any
did arise. But, (such was the Corruption of
mens manners) in processe of time; it came to
passe, that the Government delapsed into the
hands of Princes, or Kings that were not Good,
but Vicious and Tyrannicall: and they being
either Deposed, or killed, the whole returned
again upon the People, who instantly destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
each other, by reason of Tumults and the
Factions of those who affected superiority and
aspired to Empire; and being at length weary
of living by force and hostility, and exhausted
by Enmities and Dissentions, they became wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
again to submit to the Government of
Magistrates, Princes, or Kings. But, having by sad
experience found, that the Wills and mandates
of Princes had formerly passed for absolute
Laws; the People enter into certain Compacts,
or Covenants with their Governours, about
those Lawes, according to which they desired
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:58804:98"/>
to be Governed: and thus they again brought
themselves under Laws, <hi>i. e.</hi> under strict
Rights.</p>

which regards the preservation of mans <hi>Life,</hi>
(as the Dearest of things) whereof speciall
Care was had from the beginning, that every
mans security might be established by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Pactions and Laws: it appears that those
most Wise and Good Founders of Laws, fixing
their eye of Providence upon the Society of
life, and those things, which men usually do
each to other; did not only declare that it was
a wicked act and hainous Crime, to kill a man,
but also decree that the Murderer should be
punished with more than common Ignominy,
and the losse of his Head. And to this they seem
to have been induced, partly by considering
the Conciliation of men among themselves (of
which we hinted somwhat even now) in respect
whereof men ought not to be as forward to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
an Animal of the same species with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as to destroy one of another species, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
whose life they have a power granted them
by Nature: and partly by the consideration of
this, that men ought to abhor, that from which
no emolument or advantage toward the quiet
and happy spending of their daies can accrew,
but on the contrary, must be wholly destructive
thereunto.</p>

                  <p>For, indeed, from the Beginning, to those,
who fully understood and attended to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
of that Constitution; there was no need
of any other Cause or Respect, to make them
contain themselves from doing any act toward
the Violation thereof: but, as for those, who
could not sufficiently comprehend of what
high moment or Concern that Cause, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Utility, was; these absteined from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
mutuall slaughters, only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of Fear of those sharp Punishments,
which the Laws, in that case made, threaten to
inflict upon those who break them. And this
we may observe to be frequently Exemplified
even in our own dayes. And, truly, who so
well consider, how great the Utility of such a
Constitution is; they are sufficiently instructed
and comparated to the constant observance
thereof, without any other sinister respect: but,
such as are not capable of understanding that
grand and fundamentall respect, the Utility of
it, do conform themselves thereunto only out
of Fear of those Punishments, that the Lawes
threaten them, and which were, by the more
prudent sort of men, invented and made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such, as had no regard to the Utility of
the Constitution, the Major part of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
admitting them as Legitimate.</p>

                  <p>For, at first, no one of those Laws, which
have been either in Writing, or by Tradition,
derived to us, and are to descend down to our
posterity, did subsist or depend upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Force or Violence whatsoever; but (as we
touch't before) upon the meer Consent of the
People that used it. For, it was not by strength
of Body, or imperious sway, but only Prudence
of mind, whereby those transcended the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
who proposed those Laws to the suffrage
of the People; and this by inducing some men
to consider what would be profitable (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
when they did not before so well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it, as they ought) and by terrifying others
meerly with the greatnesse of the punishments
annexed. Nor could they, indeed, make use of
any other remedy for the Cure of the peoples
ignorance of the Utility of those Laws, than
that of their own Fear of the Punishments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by the Lawes: because even in our
daies, it is Fear alone which contains Vulgar
men within the bounds of their duty, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
them from committing any thing against
either the publick or private Commodity.</p>

                  <p>And, assuredly, if all men could equally both
understand, and bear in mind, what is truly
Profitable; they would need no Lawes at all,
but would of their own accord beware of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such things, as the Laws forbid, and do
such as the Laws prescribe and injoin: since,
only to know what is profitable, and what
hurtfull, would be more than sufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to avoid this, and pursue that. But,
as for those, who do not discern what is Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall,
what Hurtfull; doubtlesse, the Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Punishments against them, is highly
necessary: insomuch as the very Fear of the
Punishment impendent doth cause them to
suppresse and bridle those heats of their passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which instigate them to unjust actions;
and in a manner compell them, though against
their Wills, to do what is right and consenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous

                  <p>Hereupon was it, that the Antient Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
ordained, that even the Involuntary and
meerly Casuall slaughter of a man, should not
be free from all Mulct, or punishment. Not
that they might not, to such as affected Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
manslaughter, give any occasion of prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
or excuse for what they should do of set
purpose in that kind: but that they might not
seem not to have used sufficient Caution and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:58804:100"/>
Diligence, as to that Difficult particular. Nor
could this course but prove Beneficiall, for the
same Causes, for which men were expresly
prohibited to kill each other. So that conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
that of those actions of this kind that are
done involuntarily, some happen to Human
Nature from Causes that could not be foreseen,
nor any waies prevented; and others again
happen meerly through our Negligence, want

imminent: therefore, that they might, as
much as possible, prevent our negligence and
heedfulnesse, that may conduce to the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of our Neighbours; they provided, that
even an involuntary slaughter of a man should
not passe altogether unpunished, and by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

men more heedfull and circumspect, they most
happily diminished the Frequency of this

                  <p>Hereupon (that we may highly touch upon

those Nations, who make their choice of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sorts of Animals for their food, the matter
was determined and prescribed by certain
Laws, grounded upon Reasons correspondent
to those, we have now given: and as for those
Animals, that were not to be eaten; there was
respect had to their Utility, and Inutility in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

to each Country; to the Constitutions

                  <p>Now from these Considerations we come to
understand, that from the very Beginning a
Difference was put betwixt the Killing of Men
and the Killing of all other Animals. For, as to
other Animals, it is manifest, that no one of
those antient Sages, who have expresly prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
what we should, and what we should not
do, did forbid us to kill them: because that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiity,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:58804:104"/>
which is perceived in respect of them,
arose from a custom of acting, contrary to that,
which we have mentioned concerning men;
nor could it be, that men, living promiscuously
among Beasts, could preserve themselves in
safety otherwise than by expelling, or destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them.</p>

                  <p>But, as concerning Mankind; when among
those, who lived in the daies of old, there were
some more Comely and Gracefull than the
rest (and likely enough it is, that such were the
First Perswaders of men to enter into Pact, for
the Common safety) who remembring how
they had somtimes absteined from slaughter, in
respect of that Utility, which concerned their
safety; had also, when they were congregated
into one Company, put others in mind of what
had then hapned, when they lived promiscuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
that by absteining from the slaughter of an
Animal of their own species, they might defend
the Society of life, which is Generally the cause
of his proper safety, to every single person; and
that it had been formerly profitable to go apart
from the Society of other Animals, or men
flocking together, that so they might not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
or incense them, that were ready enough
of themselves to do harm: Hereupon, we say,
men came to restrain themselves from laying
hands upon an Animal of their own species,
that came and offered himself into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of things necessary to safety of life.</p>

                  <p>But, in processe of time, their Progenies
multiplying on each part, and Animals of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
species being depulsed and kept apart;
men began to make use of their Reason (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
before that time, they had trusted altogether
to Memory) and to enter into Consultation,
about what was to be done in order to their
safety, when they should come together and
conjoyn their habitations. For, they mainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to coerce those, who rashly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently
cut each others throats, and thereby
made the mutuall assistance, that men were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to afford each other, dayly the weaker; and
this, chiefly because those great incommodities,
which had frequently fallen upon their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
in the like cases, were utterly forgotten.
And earnestly striving to bring matters to that
good passet, hey at length made and introduced
those very Laws and Constitutions, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in all Cities and Nations even to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day: the multitude of their own accord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to them; forasmuch as the Major part
were already very sensible, how much greater
Utility would from thence accrew unto them
living in mutuall Society. In like manner, it
conduceth also to Common security, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
whatever is pernicious: so also to preserve
whatever is useful to the extermination of what

if not solely for the sake of Wise men;

must be the vain desire of living more opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently,

Crown of this our Discourse upon the Virtues,

afford more Comfort, more Delight, than true
Friendship: and the same Reason that confirms

men do not only enjoy the Good things of the

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:58804:111"/>

it must be very highly rationall in us, to procure
Friendships, whereby the mind may be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

us to bee more circumspect with whom
wee eate; than about what wee eate:
To eat ones meat alone, and spend ones daies
in Solitude; indeed, is to live the life of a Lion
or a Woolf: and yet no Friend is better than
such a one, that is not as well pleasant, as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
so that his Conversation may be the best
sawce to our meat. Such a Friend, therefore, is
to be sought for, to whom nothing is more in
esteem, than Candor, Simplicity and Verity; and
who is not morose, querulous and murmuring
at all things, but full of Complacency, Alacrity,
and pleasant hopes, that so his conversation may
not sowre; but sweeten the occurrences of life.</p>

                  <p>Friendship, we acknowledge, doth consist in,
and is kept alive by the mutuall participation of
Pleasures, or Goods; and yet we cannot admit it
to be therefore necessary, that betwixt friends
there should be a Community of the Goods of
Fortune: as that Philosopher conceived, who
was the Author of that saying, that <hi>among

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:58804:112"/>
that Community of Estates implies mutuall
diffidence or distruct of each others Constancy,
in case of Adversity or Poverty on one part: and
Distrust is wholly inconsistent with Friendship.
Then only are friends, who can with full Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and freedom take and make use of so
much of their friends Goods or Estate, as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of their present condition doth require;

For, being wholly uncapable of any part of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
that might render their Conversation
commendable and gratefull; and as uncapable
of either understanding what is privately, what

should be so; and Experience assuring that it
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:58804:112"/>
frequently hath been so. So that it is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
as well that such a perfect Conjunction
(you may call it Union) may be made betwixt
Wise men; as that nothing doth more conduce
to the Quiet and Pleasure of life; than such a
Conjunction once made and conserved.</p>

                  <p>For, as it is impossible for us, to conserve the
sweetnesse and security of our lives firm and
lasting, without the influence of Friendship: so
is it equally impossible to conserve Friendship
firm and lasting, without that Cement of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
our Friends, at the same rate, as we do our
selves. This, therefore, and Pleasure are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
Adjuncts of Friendship: and who so
doth not hold so full a sympathy with his
Friend, as to rejoyce at his joy, and condole
with him in his sorrow; doth but pretend to
the noble title of a Friend.</p>

                  <head>VIII.</head>
                  <p>Considering this, the Wise man will be sure,
to stand equally affected toward himself, and
his Friend; what labours and pains he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes
for his own Security and Pleasures, the same
will he undergo for the Security and Pleasures
of hls Friend: and as he rejoyceth to think, that
he hath one, with whom he may sit, and to
whom he may administer in his sicknesse, whom
he may visit and assist in case of imprisonment,
and whom he may relieve in case of want; so
will it rejoyce him to be confident that he hath
one, who will stick close to him, in sicknesse, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment;
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:58804:113"/>
want and all other Calamities. And
not only this; but his love will be so great to
him, as to oblige him to suffer the greatest of
torments, nay, if occasion be, even Death it self
for his Friends sake.</p>

                  <p>We have known, Certainly (and from our
Fathers, in whose memories it was fresh) that
many of those Wise and Good men, who had
the happinesse of procuring to themselves full
Confidence and Security in the Society of men,
living in one and the same opinon, and the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
affections with themselves; have lived in
a most pleasant and mutually comfortable
League of Friendship, and been conjoyned with
so absolute a Neernesse each to other, as that
they could heartily, and without the least of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy,
wish to suffer death in the place of
their friend destined to die.</p>

                     <p>AND this is the sum of all we had to say,
concerning ETHICKS or MORALS, which
from the very beginning we asserted to be the
Noblest and most Usefull part of Philosophy.
We now, therefore, Conclude with this Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
to you, whoever you are that aspire to
true Wisdom (for, our Designe herein was to
do a piece of acceptable service to all such) that
you both meditate upon, and earnestly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to put in practise each one of those many
Rules and Axioms of Prudence, that we have
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:58804:113"/>
here laid down: assuring your self, that they are
the very Elements or Fundamentals of the art of
Living Honestly or Virtuously, and (upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence)
peaceably and Happily.</p>
                     <p>We say, to Meditate upon them night and
day; and as well when you are alone, as when
you are in company of some faithfull Friend,
such to whom you may safely and comfortably
say: <hi>We are (indeed) Alone: but so much the better,
insomuch as we have the greater opportunity of discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things sincerely, and making the stricter inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for Truth: I speak not to many, but to you alone; and
and you speak not to many but to me alone, and that's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
since we are an ample Theatre each to other.</hi>

                     <p>By this time, we presume, you are fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
that he is the only <hi>Brave and Happy</hi> man,
who hath his mind possessed with true and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent
Conceptions of the Nature of the
Gods: who is at all times prepared to bid death
welcom, without the least of Fear: who hath so
reasoned concerning the end of Nature, or the
highest of Goods, as fully to understand, that
it may be attained with the greatest facility ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable:
who stands confirmed, that whatever
of Evill is to be endured by him, must, if Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
be short in duration; if not Vehement, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
in tolleration: who doth not emasculate and
soften himself with the Childish apprehension of
any such thing as inevitable Necessity, or the
vulgar belief of Fate; but well understands, that
he hath an absolute Freedom of Will, in all his
actions, and is not subject to the Controll of any
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:58804:114"/>
influence, besides that of his own Reason; and
knows also that nothing at all, or (at most) ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little of Fortune can at any time intervene to
crosse his designes, defeat his hopes, interrupt
his Felicity: and, finally, who hath composed all
his Desires to the sober modell of Nature, and
the Rules of Wisdom, by us prescribed in this
small Treatise.</p>
