            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE NEW

A
POEM,</p>
            <p>IN THREE BOOKS.</p>
            <p>With some Reflections upon the
<hi>HIND</hi> and the <hi>PANTHER.</hi>
            </p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>WHEN the Pamphlet of the <hi>Hind</hi> and the <hi>Panther</hi> came
out under so celebrated a Name, and was blown about
by some interessed little Fellows; I read it with as much eager
desire as Curiosity could possibly create, reasonably supposing, the
utmost could be said for the Cause of the <hi>Hind</hi> was there, and if
<hi>Troy</hi> was to be defended, it would be by the Hand of such an
Hero. But it cannot be imagined what a surprize I was in to
find, that all the seemingly dreadful Host prov'd no more than
that ridiculous Army drawn up upon the Mountains, which once
made even <hi>Alexander</hi> stand, but was afterwards with laughter
found to be but Troops of Apes. It was very surprising at first
sight, as Ostriches in the Desarts are said to be to the Caravans
of Merchants, appearing a far off like Horsemen, yet are discern'd
upon a nearer approach to be the most stupid and senceless of all
Fowls. Indeed for its bulk it imitated one of the mock Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
<hi>Semiramis</hi> made use of in her <hi>Indian</hi> Expedition, all
Straw within, and covered with Beasts Hides without.</p>
            <p>The Author (whatever he may otherwise have attain'd) hath
got sure little credit by it, except he intended it religiously as a
piece of mortification, or politickly design'd to annex the Fame
of a Prophet to that of a Poet, by making out what he so long
since foretold, his fumbling <hi>Age of Poetry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cause he pretends to vindicate, he hath much revil'd by
defending it so ill, and it hath made not a few think he plaid
booty, or at least took his measures from that Graecian Orator
and Politician, who intending in a great danger to perswade his
Countrymen to Arms, made his Declamation for Peace, but he
<pb facs="tcp:59853:3"/>
brought such weak Arguments, that according to his design they
prov'd the greatest Incitements to a War. The Person that vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates
the <hi>Hind</hi> and the manner of it, makes men naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
upon the Religion of Ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> whose chief Propagators
and Defenders were their Poets. This is sure whether the Religion
of Antient and Modern Times differ or no, the Policy and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
doth, for the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> never reserv'd their <hi>Velites</hi>
to the last.</p>
            <p>To the following Poem I shall say little, such as it is you have
it, it is my comfort the Justice of my Cause supplies my Defects.
Yet I am bold to say, that there is not the least part said against
the Cause of the <hi>Hind</hi> of what might have been; and was ready,
and even those things which are said are softned over and over;
many things left out in point of Prudence, but many more out of
good Manners. I have been as cool and moderate as Truth
would let me; and if there remains any bitterness, I had it from
the Author of the <hi>Hind</hi> and <hi>Panther</hi> in his Preface and Poem
of <hi>Religio Laici,</hi> which indeed is a Confutation of his <hi>Hind</hi> and
<hi>Panther</hi> before hand. I have took no Poetical Licence in any of
my Allegations, they may abundantly be prov'd out of the Writings
of the <hi>Hinds</hi> own Party. So that there is this difference between
the Task of my Adversary and me, That what I assert is truth, and
ready proved to my hand, and what my Adversary accuses the
<hi>Panther</hi> of is perfect Invention and Calumny, which he drudg'd
hard for; and therein I give him the better: I have done as
good Sportsmen do, who will not destroy all the Game, but reserve
them for their future Recreation and Sport.</p>

            <l>Behind a Scene of Seas, beneath a shade:</l>
            <l>Unknown to Ages that did uselessly,</l>
            <l>(He half creates that doth a Coast descry.)</l>
            <l>The News with doubtful wonder was receiv'd,</l>

            <l>Would hear, tho' at the cost of being deceiv'd.</l>
            <l>But when each day did with new Wonders swell,</l>

            <l>Thy great Example may brave Spirits bind,</l>
            <l>The same desire of knowledge swells the Mind,</l>

            <l>News is as welcome, and doth fly as fast,</l>

            <l>Nature has left for each succeeding Age,</l>
            <l>Something that may their warm pursuit engage.</l>
            <l>Something yet undiscover'd, that may be</l>

            <l>A new Discovery of a World is made,</l>
            <l>Grounds of Belief more than <hi>Columbus</hi> had.</l>

            <l>And in the form of Sanctity away did slip:</l>
            <l>Yet not so clearly but I was pursu'd</l>
            <l>With Batts and Stones, and Curses still renew'd.</l>
            <l>No place to hide my loathed head I spy'd,</l>

            <l>That may a Malefactor's Crimes embrace!</l>
            <l>I invocated every Saint in vain,</l>

            <l>At last, loaded with Injuries and Blows,</l>
            <l>Twice down I sunk and fell, and twice arose:</l>

            <l>But <hi>Trimmer</hi> is the currant'st Name of all.</l>

            <l>All variously the Tumult did revile,</l>

            <l>The murmur ceas'd, and <hi>Bavius</hi> that was fled,</l>

               <l>How show'ring Joys did on <hi>Atlantis</hi> fall,</l>
               <l>The Canopy of Heaven did shade it all,</l>
               <l>In Blessings Heaven dissolv'd did it a <hi>Goshen</hi> call:</l>
