         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN
EXPLICATION and VINDICATION
OF THE
Athanasian Creed.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN pursuance of what I have said in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Letter, concerning (what we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
call) the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed; it may
not be amiss to express it a little more
distinctly.</p>
            <p>We call it commonly <hi>the Athanasian Creed,</hi> not
that we are certain it was penned (just in this
form) by <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself; (for, of this, I find
that learned men are doubtful,) but it was pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
either by himself, or by some other about
that time, according to the mind and doctrine
of <hi>Athanasius.</hi> In like manner as what we call <hi>the
Apostles Creed,</hi> we take to be penned (very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently)
according to what Doctrine the Apostles
had taught them, though not perhaps in those
very words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:106448:3"/>
But whoever was the Compiler (whether
<hi>Athanasius</hi> himself, or some other) of the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasian</hi>
Creed, I suppose, the <hi>Damnatory Sentences</hi>
(as they are called) therein, were not by him
intended to be understood with that Rigor that
some would now insinuate, (who, because per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they do not like the main Doctrines of
that Creed, are willing to disparage it, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
it to the greatest disadvantage they
can,) as if it were intended, That whoever doth
not explicitely and distinctly know, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
and assent to, all and every clause and
syllable therein, could not be saved. (Which, I
suppose, neither the Author did intend, nor
any other sober person would affirm.) But, that
the Doctrine therein delivered (concerning God
and Christ) is sound and true Doctrine in it self,
and ought, <hi>as to the substance of it,</hi> to be believed
as such, by all persons (of Age, and Capacity,
and who have opportunity of being well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in it,) who do expect salvation by
Christ; at least so far as not to disbelieve the
substance of it, when understood. There being
no other ordinary way to be saved, (that we
know of) than that by the Knowledge and
Faith of God in Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:106448:3"/>
But what measures God will take in cases ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
(as of Infancy, Incapacity, Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Ignorance, or the like,) is not the thing
there intended to be declared; nor is it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for us to know; but to leave it rather to the
Wisdom and Counsel of God, <hi>whose Iudgments
are unsearchable, and his Ways past finding out,</hi> Rom.
11. 33.</p>
            <p>Much less do I suppose, that he intended to
extend the necessity of such explicite Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to the Ages before Christ. For many
things may be requisite to be explicitely Known
and Believed by us to whom the Gospel is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
which was not so to them, before <hi>the
Veil was taken away from Moses face,</hi> and <hi>Immortality
brought to light through the Gospel,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 13, 14.
2 Tim. 1. 10.</p>
            <p>Nor are we always to press words according
to the utmost rigor that they are possibly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of; but according to such equitable sence
as we use to allow to other <hi>Homiletical</hi> Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and which we have reason to believe to
have been the true meaning of him whose words
they are.</p>
            <p>And I have the more reason to press for such
equitable construction, because I observe those
<hi>hard Clauses</hi> (as they are thought to be) annexed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106448:4"/>
only to some Generals; and not to be extended
(as I conceive) to every Particular, in the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of those Generals.</p>
            <p>It begins thus; <q>
                  <hi>Whosoever will be saved; before
all things, it is necessary, that he hold the Catholick
Faith.</hi>
               </q> Where, <hi>before all things,</hi> is as much as <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primis;</hi>
importing, that it is <hi>mainly necessary,</hi> or a
<hi>principal requisite,</hi> to Believe aright; especially,
concerning <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which, as to persons of Years, and Discretion,
and who have the opportunity of being duly
Instructed, I think is generally allowed by all of
us, to be necessary (as to the <hi>Substantials</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion)
in the ordinary way of salvation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
disputing, what God may do in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Cases, or how far God may be pleased,
upon a general Repentance, as of Sins un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
to pardon some culpable Misbelief.</p>
            <p>It follows; <q>
                  <hi>Which Faith, except every one do
keep whole and undefiled, (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) without
doubt he shall perish everlastingly.</hi>
               </q> That is, (as I
conceive) Unless a person (so qualified and so
capacitated, as I before expressed) do keep it
<hi>whole</hi> or <hi>sound,</hi> as to the <hi>Substantials</hi> of it (though
possibly he may be ignorant of some Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of the true Faith;) and <hi>undefiled,</hi> or <hi>inteme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi>
(without adding thereunto, or putting such
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106448:4"/>
a sence upon such <hi>Substantials,</hi> as shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
thereof,) shall (except he repent) pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
everlastingly. Which, I think, is no more
than that of <hi>Mar. 16. 16. He that Believeth not,
shall be Damned.</hi> And what Limitations or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigations
are there to be allowed, are (by the
same equity) to be allowed in the present Clause
before us. Which therefore may (in this true
sence) be safely admitted.</p>
            <p>And here I think fit to observe, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
there may be an ambiguity in the English
word <hi>whole,</hi> which sometime signifies <hi>totus,</hi> and
sometime <hi>sanus</hi> or <hi>salvus,</hi> it is here certainly to
be understood in the latter sence, as answering
to the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>totam,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>sanam</hi> or <hi>salvam.</hi> And <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to
keep the Faith <hi>salvam &amp; intemeratam,</hi> which is
translated <hi>whole and undefiled,</hi> might (to the same
sence) be rendered <hi>safe and sound.</hi> Now a man
may well be said to be safe and sound, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
a Wart or a Wen, or even a Hurt or
Maim, so long as the Vitals be not endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered.
And so, of the Catholick Faith, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Doctrine, so long as there is nothing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
of the main Substantials or Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
of it, though possibly there may be an Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
or Mistake, as to some particulars of les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
moment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:106448:5"/>
After this Preface (between it and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
or Epilogue) there follows indeed a
large Exposition of (what he declares to be)
the Catholick Faith; (That is; to be some Part
of it: For I take the whole <hi>Scripture</hi> to be <hi>the
Catholick Faith;</hi> whereof this Collection is but a
part.) beginning with, <hi>The Catholick Faith is this:</hi>
And Ending with, <hi>This is the Catholick Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it is not said, That except a man Know
and Believe <hi>every particular</hi> of that <hi>Explication,</hi> he
shall perish eternally; but only, <hi>Except he keep
the Catholick Faith</hi> (as to the Substantials of it)
<hi>safe and sound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For doubtless there may be many Particulars
of Catholick Faith (contained in the Word of
God) which a man may be ignorant of, and
yet be saved. It is <hi>True,</hi> That the Name of
our Saviour's Mother was <hi>Mary;</hi> and the Name
of the Judge who condemned him was <hi>Pontius
Pilate:</hi> and both these are put into (what we
call) the Apostles Creed; and are part of the
Catholick Faith; and which (supposing that
we know them to be declared in Scripture) we
ought to Believe. But I see not why it should
be thought (of it self) more necessary to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
(if he do not know it to be declared in
Scripture) for a man to know that her Name
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106448:5"/>
was <hi>Mary,</hi> than that the Name of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Wife
was <hi>Eve,</hi> or <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Wife <hi>Sarah,</hi> or that one
of <hi>Iob</hi>'s Daughters was called <hi>Iemima;</hi> (for all
these are declared in Scripture; and, supposing
that we know them so to be, ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
as part of the Catholick Faith.) Nor do
I know, that it is (of it self) more necessary to
know that the Name of the Judge who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
our Saviour was <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> than that
the Name of the High-Priest was <hi>Caiaphus.</hi> And
though one of these, and not the other, be put
into the Apostles Creed, whereby we are more
likely to know that than the other: yet both of
them being True, and declared in Scripture;
they are, both of them, parts of the Catholick
Faith, and to be believed: but neither of them
(I think) with such necessity, as that, who knows
them not, cannot be saved.</p>
            <p>And what I say of this General Preface in the
beginning, is in like manner to be understood
of the General Conclusion in the end; <hi>which</hi>
(Catholick Faith) <hi>except a man believe faithfully,
he cannot be saved.</hi> Of which I shall say more
anon.</p>
            <p>After the General Preface, (concerning the
necessity of holding the Catholick Faith,) he
proceeds to two main Branches of it, (that of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106448:6"/>
the Trinity, and that of the Incarnation, with
the Consequents thereof;) which he declares
likewise, as what <hi>ought to be believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That of the Trinity, he declares thus in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral;
<q>
                  <hi>And the Catholick Faith is this;</hi>
               </q> (that is,
this is one main part of the Catholick Faith;)
namely, <q>
                  <hi>That we worship One God in Trinity,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>and
Trinity in Unity; Neither Confounding the Persons,
nor Dividing the Substance.</hi> Which is what we
commonly say, <hi>There be Three Persons, yet but One
God.</hi> And this General (which, after some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Explications, he doth resume) is what
he declares <hi>ought to be believed.</hi> But he doth not
lay such stress upon each Particular of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
though True.</p>
            <p>He thus explains himself; <q>
                  <hi>For there is one
Person of the Father, another of the Son, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Holy Ghost.</hi>

            <p>Nor is any such Sanction annexed to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Where, by the way, here is no Anathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation
of the Greek Church, (of which those
who would, for other reasons, disparage this
Creed, make so loud an out-cry.) 'Tis said in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<hi>He doth proceed,</hi> (and so say they,) but not
that he doth <hi>proceed from the Father and the Son.</hi>
And 'tis said, He is <hi>Of the Father and Of the Son</hi>
(<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) some way or other;
(and even this, I suppose, they would not deny;)
but whether by <hi>procession from both,</hi> or (if so)
whether <hi>in the same manner,</hi> it is not said; but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
avoided. (Though indeed it seems to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
what I think to be the truth, and what in
the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed is said expressly, that he doth
<hi>proceed from both;</hi> and, for ought we know, <hi>in
the same manner;</hi> which yet we do not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine)
Nor do I see any reason, why, on this
account, we should be said to Anathematize the
Greek Church, or they to Anathematize us,
even though we should not exactly agree, in
what sence he may be said to be <hi>Of the Father,</hi>
and in what <hi>Of the Son.</hi> And those who are
better acquainted with the Doctrine and the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106448:8"/>
Languages, of the present Greek Churches, than
most of us are, do assure us, that the differences
between them and us are rather in some forms
of expressions, than in the thing it self. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
those who would make so great a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of this, should rather quarrel at the <hi>Nicene</hi>
Creed, than the <hi>Athanasian:</hi> where it is expresly
said of the Holy Ghost, that <hi>he proceedeth from
the Father and from the Son.</hi> 'Tis not therefore
for the phrase <hi>Filioque,</hi> that they are so ready to
quarrel at this Creed rather than the <hi>Nicene,</hi> but
from some other reason, and, most likely, because
the Doctrine of the Trinity is here more fully
expressed than in that, at which the <hi>Socinian</hi> is
most offended.</p>
            <p>I observe also, That these Personal Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are expressed just by the Scripture words,
<hi>Beget, Begotten, Proceeding,</hi> without affixing any
sence of our own upon them; but leaving them
to be understood in such sence as in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
they are to be understood. Agreeable to
that modest Caution, which is proper in such
Mysteries.</p>
            <p>It follows; <q>
                  <hi>So there is One Father, not three
Fathers; One Son, not three Sons; One Holy Ghost,
not three Holy Ghosts. And in this Trinity, none is
afore or after other.</hi>
               </q> (That is, not in Time,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:106448:8"/>
though in Order.) <q>
                  <hi>None is greater or less than
another: But the whole three Persons are co-eternal
together, and co-equal.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Having thus finished these particular Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
or Illustrations, concerning the Trinity,
(without any <hi>condemning Clause</hi> of those who think
otherwise, other than what is there included;
namely, that if this be True, the contrary must
be an Errour:) He then resumes the General,
(as after a long Parenthesis,) <q>
                  <hi>So that in all things
(as is aforesaid) the Unity in Trinity, and the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in Unity, is to be Worshipped.</hi>
               </q> And to this
General, annexeth this Ratification, <q>
                  <hi>He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that will he saved, must thus think of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
               </q>
or, thus ought to think of the Trinity,
or, <hi>Let him thus think of the Trinity,</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And to this, I suppose, we do all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
who believe the Doctrine of the Trinity
to be true. For, if the thing be true, those who
would be saved, ought to believe it.</p>
            <p>He then proceeds to the Doctrine of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation.
Which he declares in general as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to salvation. <q>
                  <hi>Furthermore, it is necessary
to everlasting salvation, that he also believe rightly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106448:9"/>
the Incarnation of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </q> Which
is no more than that of <hi>Iohn 3. 36. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of
God abideth on him.</hi> And therefore we may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say this also: <hi>There being no other Name under
Heaven whereby we must be saved, neither is there Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in any other,</hi> Acts 4. 12.</p>
            <p>After this (as before he had done of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Trinity) he gives first a general
Assertion of his being God and Man; and then
a particular Illustration of his Incarnation.
<q>
                  <hi>For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess,
That our Lord Iesus Christ, the Son of God, is God
and Man.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What follows, is a further Explication of this
General.</hi> 
               <q>God, of the substance of the Father,
begotten before the Worlds. And Man, of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of his Mother, born in the World. Perfect
God, and perfect Man; of a reasonable Soul and
humane Flesh subsisting. Equal to the Father, as
touching his Godhead; and Inferiour to the Father,
as touching his Manhood. Who, although he be God
and Man, yet he is not Two, but One Christ. One,
not by conversion of the Godhead into Flesh, but by
taking of the Manhood into God. One altogether, not
by Confusion of Substance, but by Unity of Person. For
as the reasonable Soul and Flesh is one Man, so God
and Man is One Christ.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:106448:9"/>
And thus far, as to the Description of Christ's
Person and Natures. The Particulars of which
I take to be all true; and therefore such as
ought to be believed, when understood. But
such (many of them) as persons of ordinary
capacities, and not acquainted with School
Terms, may not perhaps understand. Nor was
it, I presume, the meaning of the Pen-man of
this Creed, that it should be thought necessary
to Salvation, that every one should particularly
understand all this: but, at most, that, when
understood, it should not be disbelieved. That
in the general, being most material, That <hi>Iesus
Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man:</hi> the rest
being but Explicatory of this. Which Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though they be all true, are not attended
with any such clause, as if, without the explicite
knowledge of all these, a man could not be
saved.</p>
            <p>He then proceeds to what Christ hath done
for our Salvation, and what he is to do further
at the last Judgment, with the Consequents
thereof. <q>
                  <hi>Who Suffered for our Salvation, Descended
into Hell, Rose again the third day from the
Dead.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>That Clause of <hi>descending into Hell,</hi> or <hi>Hades,</hi>
(<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,) which we meet with here,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106448:10"/>
and in the Apostles Creed, as it is now read,
is not in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed; nor was it anciently
(as learned Men seem to be agreed) in what we
call the Apostles Creed. When or how it first
came in, I cannot well tell: Nor will I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
here to determine the sence of it.</p>
            <p>The Hebrew word <hi>Sheol,</hi> and the Greek <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi>
which here we translate <hi>Hell,</hi> (by which
word we now-a-days use to denote <hi>the Place of the
Damned,</hi>) was anciently used to signifie, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the <hi>Grave,</hi> sometime, the Place, State, or
<hi>Condition of the Dead,</hi> whether good or bad. And
when <hi>Iob</hi> prays (<hi>Iob</hi> 14. 13.) <hi>O that thou wouldst
hide me in Sheol</hi> (as in the Hebrew;) or <hi>in Hades,</hi>
(as in the Greek Septuagint;) certainly he did
not desire to be in what we now call <hi>Hell;</hi> but
rather (as we there translate it) in the <hi>Grave,</hi> or
the condition of those that are <hi>Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what it should signifie here, is not well
agreed among learned Men. The Papists ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
(because that is subservient to some of
their beloved Tenents) would have it here to
signifie the Place of the Damned; and would
have it thought, that the Soul of Christ, during
the time his Body lay in the Grave, was amongst
the Devils and Damned Souls in Hell. Others
do, with more likelyhood, take it for the Grave,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106448:10"/>
or condition of the Dead: and take this of
Christ's <hi>descending into Hades,</hi> to be the same with
his <hi>being Buried,</hi> or <hi>lying in the Grave.</hi> The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, where is
mention of his being <hi>Buried,</hi> there is no mention
of his <hi>descent into Hell,</hi> or <hi>Hades:</hi> And here, in
the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed, where mention is made
of this, there is no mention of his being <hi>Buried;</hi>
as if the same were meant by both phrases, which
therefore need not be repeated. And though
in the Apostles Creed there be now mention of
both, yet anciently it was not so; that of his
<hi>descent into Hell,</hi> being not to be sound in ancient
Copies of the Apostles Creed. If it signifie any
thing more than his <hi>being Buried,</hi> it seems most
likely to import his <hi>Continuance in the Grave,</hi> or
<hi>the State and Condition of the Dead,</hi> for some time.
And the words which follow, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, say
nothing of his <hi>coming out of Hell,</hi> but only of his
<hi>rising from the Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the words here stand undetermined to
any particular sence; and so they do in the
Apostles Creed; and are so also in the Articles
of our Church. Where it is only said, (because
in the Creed it stands so,) That we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<hi>That he descended into Hell,</hi> without affixing
any particular sence to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:106448:11"/>
The words, doubtless, have respect to that of
<hi>Acts</hi> 2. 27. where, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in
Hell,</hi> (or <hi>Hades) nor suffer thine Holy One to see
Corruption,</hi> is applied to Christ, (cited out of
<hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 10. where the same had before been
spoken of <hi>David.</hi>) And his <hi>not being left in Hades,</hi>
seems to suppose his <hi>having been</hi> (for some time)
<hi>in Hades,</hi> whatever by <hi>Hades</hi> is there meant.
And <hi>Verse 31. his being not so left,</hi> is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expounded of <hi>his Resurrection.</hi> And so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 35. Now, as we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to think, that <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>being in Hell,</hi> or <hi>Sheol,</hi>
(though not to be left there) can signifie, his
being in Hell <hi>among the Devils and damned Spirits,</hi>
but rather in the <hi>Grave,</hi> or the <hi>Condition of the
Dead;</hi> so neither that Christ's being in <hi>Hell,</hi> or
<hi>Hades,</hi> (which is the Greek word answering to
the Hebrew <hi>Sheol</hi>) should signifie any other
than <hi>His</hi> being in the <hi>Grave,</hi> or condition of the
<hi>Dead;</hi> from whence, by his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> he was
delivered. And to this purpose seems that
whole Discourse of <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2. 24,—32. and
of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 13. 30,—37.</p>
            <p>But, without determining it to any particular
sence, the Creed leaves the word <hi>Hell</hi> indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
here to be understood, in the same sence what
ever it be, in which it is to be understood,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106448:11"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 27, 31. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 10. And so far we
are safe.</p>
            <p>It follows; <q>

               </q> That is, this is
true and sound Doctrine, and such as every true

            <p>And, as he had begun all with a general Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
so now he closeth all with a general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion:
<q>
                  <hi>Which</hi> (Catholick Faith) except a man
<hi>believe faithfully, he cannot be saved.</hi>
               </q> That is, the
Doctrine here delivered is true, (and so I think
it is in all the parts of it,) and is (part of) the
Catholick Faith: (The whole of which Faith, is
the whole Word of God.) That is, part of that
Faith, which all true Christians do, and ought
to Believe. Which Catholick Faith, (the whole
of which is the whole Word of God) except a
man (so qualified as I before expressed) do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
faithfully, (that is, except he truly believe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106448:12"/>
it) as to the <hi>Substantials</hi> of it, (though possibly
he may be ignorant of many particulars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in)
he cannot (without such Repentance as God
shall accept of) be saved. Which, so limitted, (as
it ought to be) I take to be sound Doctrine, and
agreeable to that of <hi>Iohn 3. 16. He that believeth
not, is condemned already; because he hath not believed
on the Name of the only begotten Son of God:</hi> And
<hi>Ver. 36. He that believeth not the Son, shall not see
life; but the wrath of God abideth on him:</hi> That is,
(according to the words of this Creed) he that
believeth not aright (of God and Christ) <hi>cannot
be saved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which words of Christ, we may safely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
both with an aspect on the Doctrine of
the <hi>Trinity</hi> (because of those words, <hi>the only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Son of God;</hi>) and to that of the <hi>Incarnation
of Christ,</hi> and the Consequents thereof; (because
of those words in the beginning of the Discourse,
<hi>Ver. 16, 17, God so loved the World, that he Gave
his only Begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>God sent his Son into
the world—that the world through him might be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi>)
Which are the two main Points insisted
on in the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed. And he who doth
not <hi>Believe</hi> on the Name of this <hi>only Begotton Son
of God,</hi> and <hi>thus sent into the world,</hi> (the Text tells
us) <hi>shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:106448:12"/>
him.</hi> Which fully agrees with what is here said,
<hi>Except a man believe the Catholick Faith,</hi> (of which
the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and of the <hi>Incarnation,</hi>
are there intimated, and are here expressed, to
be considerable Branches) <hi>he cannot be saved.</hi>
And what Limitations or Mitigations are to be
understood in the one place, are reasonably to be
allowed as understood in the other. And, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
those Damnatory Clauses (as they
are called) in the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed (rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood)
are not so formidable (as some would
pretend) as if, because of them, the whole Creed
ought to be laid aside.</p>
            <p>For, in brief, it is but thus; The Preface and
the Epilogue tell us, That <hi>whoso would be saved,
it is necessary, or (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) he ought to hold the Catholick
Faith. Which Faith, except he keep whole and undefiled,</hi>
or (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>safe and inviolate, he shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
everlastingly;</hi> or, <hi>which except he believe faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he cannot be saved.</hi> Which is no more severe,
than that of our Saviour, <hi>Mark 16. 16. He that
believeth not, shall be damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He then inserts a large Declaration of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Faith, especially as to two main Points
of it; that of the Trinity, and that of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation.
And if all he there declares be true,
(as I think it is,) we have then no reason to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106448:13"/>
quarrel with it upon that account. But he doth
not say, That a man cannot be saved, who
doth not Know or Understand every particular
thereof.</p>
            <p>Of the First, he says but this, <hi>He that would be
saved, ought thus to think,</hi> or (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>let him
thus think of the Trinity;</hi> namely, That <hi>the Unity
in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, ought to be Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Second, what he says is this, <hi>Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
it is necessary to Eternal Salvation, That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
aright the Incarnation of our Lord Iesus Christ:</hi>
Which is no more severe than that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>He that believeth not the Son, shall not see life,
but the wrath of God abideth on him; because he hath
not believed on the Name of the only begotten Son of
God, whom God hath sent into the world, that the world
through him might be saved,</hi> John 3. 17, 18, 36.</p>
            <p>Beside these, there are no Damnatory Clauses
in the whole. All the rest are but Declaratory.
And, if what he declares be true, we have no
reason to find fault with such Declaration.</p>
            <p>Now as to those two Points; that of the
Trinity, and that of the Incarnation, (which
are the only Points in question,) there is a
double Inquiry, (as I have elsewhere shewed,)
Whether the things be Possible; and whether
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106448:13"/>
they be True. The Possibility may be argued
from Principles of Reason: The Truth of
them from Revelation only. And it is not much
questioned, but that the Revelation, in both
Points, is clear enough, if the things be not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.</p>
            <p>As to that of the Trinity; I have already
shewed, (in a former Letter) That there is
therein no Impossibility, but that what in one
consideration are <hi>Three,</hi> (which we commonly
call three Persons,) may yet (in another consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration)
be <hi>One</hi> God.</p>
            <p>I shall now proceed to shew, That neither
is there any Impossibility, as to the Incarnation
of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Now this consists of two Branches; That of
his being born of a <hi>Virgin;</hi> and that of the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postatical
Union</hi> (as it is commonly called) of the
Humane Nature with the Second Person of the
Sacred Trinity.</p>
            <p>As to the former of the two, there can be no
pretence of Impossibility. For the same God
who did at first make <hi>Adam</hi> of the Dust of the
Earth, without either Father or Mother, and
who made <hi>Eve</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Rib, (without a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at least, however <hi>Adam</hi> may be fansied as a
Father,) and who shall at the last day recall
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:106448:14"/>
the Dead out of the Dust, may doubtless, if he
so please, cause a Woman, without the help of
Man, to conceive a child. There is certainly
no Impossibility in nature, why it may not, by
an Omnipotent Agent, be brought to pass. And
when the Scripture declares it so to be, there is
no reason (if we believe the Scripture) to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
the Thing.</p>
            <p>It is no more than when Christ cured <hi>the
blind man's eyes with day and spittle:</hi> Or<note place="margin">Joh. 9. 6.</note>
when he said, <hi>Lazarus, come forth,</hi> and<note place="margin">Joh. 11. 43. 44.</note>
he did so. Or when <hi>God said, Let</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 1. 3.</note>
               <hi>there be Light, and there was Light:</hi>
And, of the whole Creation; <hi>He spake,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 33. 9.</note>
               <hi>and it was done, he commanded, and it
stood fast.</hi> No more than when he
made <hi>Aaron's Rod</hi> (a dry Stick) <hi>to bud</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. 17. 8.</note>
               <hi>and blossom, and yield Almonds:</hi> Or what
is implied in that, <hi>Let not the Eunuch</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isai. 56. 3.</note>
               <hi>say, I am a dry tree.</hi> And not much
more than when God gave <hi>Abraham</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 18. 11, 12.</note>
               <hi>a Son in his old age;</hi> and, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 19.</note>
               <hi>the deadness of Sarah's womb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was about to say, (and it is not much amiss
if I do) it is not much more than what (pretty
often) (happens amongst men, when God gives
both Sexes to the same person, (such there
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:106448:14"/>
are, and have been; and I think there is one
yet living, who was first as a Woman married
to a Man, and is since as a Man married to a
Woman;) and what hinders then, but that
God, if he please, may <hi>mingle</hi> the <hi>Effects</hi> of both
these Sexes in the Same Body? A little altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the structure of the Vessels would do it.
For when there is in the same body, and so near,
<hi>Semen virile &amp; muliebre,</hi> what hinders but
there might be a passage for them to mix? And
Plants, we know, do propagate without a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
though it be otherwise in Animals. And
whereas this is said to be by <hi>the Holy
Ghost coming upon her,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke. 1. 35.</note> 
               <hi>and the Power of
the Highest over shadowing</hi> the Blessed Virgin; it is
not much unlike that of <hi>the Spirit of God's</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubation,
or <hi>moving upon the face of
the Waters.</hi> So that, as to this Point,<note place="margin">Gen. 1. 2.</note>
here is nothing Impossible, nothing Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.</p>
            <p>The other Particular, as to the <hi>Hypostatical
Union;</hi> How God and Man can be united in
one Person, may seem more difficult for us to
apprehend, because we understand so little of
the Divine Essence, and consequently are less
able to determine, what is, and what is not,
consistent with it. And, when all is done, if we
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106448:15"/>
be never so certain, that there is such an Union,
yet it will be hard to say How it is.</p>
            <p>But we have no reason from thence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the thing Impossible because we know
not How it is done. Because there be many
other things in nature, which we are sure to Be;
of which we are almost at as great a loss as to
the manner How they be, as in the present
case.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon,</hi> as wise as lie was, and how well so
ever skilled in Natural Philosophy, doth yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
himself, in many things to be at a
loss, when he would search out the bottom of
Natural things, and even when he made it his
Business so to do. <hi>When</hi> (says he) <hi>I applied my
heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is
done upon the earth: Then I beheld all the work of
God; that a man cannot find out the work of God that
is done under the sun: Because though a man labour to
seek it out, yet he shall not find it. Yea further, though
a wise man seek to know it, yet shall he not be able to
find it,</hi> Eccles. 8. 16, 17. And shall we then
say, of <hi>the deep things of God,</hi> The<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 10, 11.</note>
thing is impossible, because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
find it out? And if we consider how many
puzzling Questions God puts to <hi>Iob,</hi> in the 37,
38, 39, 40, 41. Chapters of <hi>Iob,</hi> even in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106448:15"/>
things, we may very well (as <hi>Iob</hi> did) <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor
our selves in dust and ashes,</hi> and be ashamed of
our ignorant curiosity; and confess (as he doth)
<hi>I have uttered what I understood not; things too won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for me which I know not:</hi> when he found he
had <hi>talked like a fool, while he thought to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 22.</note>
               <hi>be wise,</hi> and would measure the Power
and Wisdom of God by the narrow limits of
our understanding: And might come to <hi>Iob</hi>'s
Resolution (when he had well weighed the
matter) <hi>I know that thou canst do every thing, and that
no thought can be withholden from thee,</hi> Job 42. 2,
3, 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The wind bloweth where it listeth,</hi> (not where
you please to appoint it,) <hi>thou hearest the sound
thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 8, 12.</note>
               <hi>or whither it goeth,</hi> (saith Christ to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus:</hi>)
But shall we therefore conclude,
The Wind doth not blow, because we know
not how or whence it bloweth? Or, that God
cannot <hi>command the Winds,</hi> because we cannot?
We should rather conclude, The <hi>Wind doth</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<hi>Blow,</hi> (because <hi>we hear the sound of it,</hi>)
though we know neither How, nor
<hi>Whence:</hi> And, though they do not<note place="margin">Mat. 8. 26, 27.</note>
obey us, yet <hi>the Wind and the Seas obey him.</hi> Now
(as he there further argues) <hi>If, when he tells us of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106448:16"/>
earthly things, we do not apprehend it, how much more
if he tell us of Heavenly things? of the deep things of
God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (to come a little nearer to the business)
consider we a little the Union of our own Soul
and Body. 'Tis hardly accountable, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
conceivable by us, (who are mostly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
with material things,) How a Spiritual
Immaterial Being (such as our Souls are) and
capable of a separate existence of its own, should
inform, actuate, and manage a material sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
such as is that of our Body, and be so
firmly United as to be One Person with it. By
what handle can a Spirit Intangible take hold of
a Tangible Material Body, and give Motion
to it? Especially if we should admit <hi>Lucretius</hi>'s
Notion;
<q>Tangere vel Tangi, nisi Corpus, nulla potest res:</q>
(which he repeats almost as often as <hi>Homer</hi> doth
his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) who doth thence repute
it impossible for an Immaterial Being to move
a Body. But we who believe the Soul to be a
a Spirit, know it to be possible. Much more is
it possible for God (though a Being infinitely
Act. 17, 25, 27, 28. more pure) who <hi>giveth to all, Life and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106448:16"/>
Breath and All things;</hi> and in whom <hi>we Live and
Move and have our Being;</hi> and who <hi>is not far from
every one of us.</hi> It would be hard for us to give
an intelligible account, either how God moves
all things, or how our Soul moves the Body;
yet we are sure it is so. That a Body may move
a Body, seems not so strange to apprehend, (for
we see one Engine move another;) But, by
what Mechanism, shall a Spirit give Motion
to a Body when at rest? or, Stop it when in
Motion? or, Direct its Motions this way or
that way? It would be thought strange, that
a <hi>Thought</hi> of ours should Move a stone: And
it is as hard to conceive (did we not see it daily)
How a <hi>Thought</hi> should put our Body in Motion,
and another <hi>Thought</hi> stop it again. Yet this we
see done every day, though we know not How.
And it is almost the same thing in other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
And more yet, when an Angel assumes a
Body. There are none of these things we know,
How; and yet we know, they are done.</p>
            <p>I shall press this a little farther. Our Soul (we
all believe) doth (after Death) continue to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist,
in a separate condition from the Body. And,
I think, we have reason to believe also, that it
will continue to Act as an Intellectual Agent,
(not to remain in a stupid sensless <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>)
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:106448:17"/>
Else I see not why <hi>Paul</hi> should <hi>desire to depart, or
to be dissolved, and to be with Christ,
which is far better;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 21, 23, 24.</note> rather than <hi>to abide
in Flesh.</hi> For while he abides in the Flesh, he
hath some enjoyment of Christ, (as well as an
opportunity of doing some Service) which is
more desirable, if when he is departed, he
have none at all. And, how can he then say,
<hi>That to Dye is gain?</hi> Whether the Soul thus
separated shall be said to have a <hi>Subsistence</hi> as
well as an Existence; Or, whether it may
be properly said then, to be an intire <hi>Person;</hi>
(as the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> are, before <hi>Death,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the <hi>Resurrection</hi>) I will not Dispute, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
that were to contend about Words, and
such Words so signify, as we please to define
them, and bear such a Sence, as we please to put
upon them. But it is (as the Angels are) an
Intellectual, Spiritual Agent; and we use to say,
<hi>Actiones sunt Suppositorum;</hi> and <hi>Suppositum Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale,</hi>
is either a Person, or so near a Person, that
it would be so if men please to call it so. And
the Spiritual Being, which doth now separately
Exist, shall at the Resurrection, resume a Body
into the same Personality with it self, and shall
with it become one Person, as before Death it
had been.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:106448:17"/>
Now if a Spiritual Immaterial Intellectual
Being, separately existent by it self, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
acting as an Intellectual Agent, may, at
the Resurrection, assume or reassume a Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Corporeal Being (Heterogeneous to it self)
into the same Personality with it self, or so as to
become one Person with it, while yet it self re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
Spiritual as before: What should hinder
(for it is but one step further) but that a Divine
Person, may assume Humanity, into the same
personality with it self, without ceasing to be a
Divine Person as before it was? If it be said,
That Person and Personality in the Sacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
are not just the same as what we so call in
other cases: It is granted; and by these words
(which are but Metaphorical) we mean no
more, but somewhat analogous thereunto; and
which, (because of such analogy) we so call,
as knowing no better words to use instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
According as we use the words, <hi>Father,
Son, generate, beget,</hi> and the like, in a metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
sence, when applied to God. For no words,
borrowed from Created Beings, can signifie just
the same when applied to God, as when they
were applied to Men, but somewhat analogous
thereunto. And if the Soul (though we know
not How) may and do (at the Resurrection)
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106448:18"/>
assume a Body so as to become the same Person
with it self (though neither the Body be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
made a Soul, nor the Soul a Body; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
as before, that a Body, and this a Soul,
though now united into one Person:) Why
may not a Divine Person assume Humanity, so
to be what is analogous to what we call a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
the Humanity remaining Humanity, and
the Divinity remaining Divinity, though both
united in One Christ; though we do not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
know How?</p>
            <p>We should be at a great loss, if (to answer
an Atheist, or one who doth not believe the
Scriptures) we were put to it, to tell him, How
God made the World? Of what Matter? With
what Tools or Engines? or, How a Pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
could produce Matter where none was? He
would tell us perhaps, <hi>Ex nihilo nihil, in nihilum nil
posse reverti;</hi> Where nothing is, nothing can be
made: and what once is, (though it may be
changed) can never become Nothing: And
will never believe the World was made, (but
rather was from all Eternity) except we can
tell him, How it was made. Now, if in this
case, we may satisfie our selves (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it will not satisfie him) by saying, God
made it, but we know not How: The same
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106448:18"/>
must satisfie us here; That Christ was Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
(God and Man) we are certain, (for so
the Scripture doth assure us, as well as, That
God made the World;) But, How God made
the World; or, How the Son of God assumed
Humanity, we cannot tell. Nor indeed is it fit
for us to enquire, farther than God is pleased to
make known to us. All further than this, are
but the subtile Cob-webs of our Brain: Fine,
but not Strong. Witty Conjectures, <hi>How it may
be;</hi> rather than a clear Resolution, <hi>How it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Objection I have met with: to
which the Objecters must be contented with
the same Answer; We know <hi>it Is,</hi> but we know
not <hi>How.</hi> It would be endless for us, and too
great a Curiosity, to think our selves able fully
to explicate all the Hidden things of God. The
Objection is this: Since the Three Persons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Divided; How is it possible, that One
of them can Assume Humanity, and not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
And why the Second Person, and not the
First or Third?</p>
            <p>As to the Question, Why? I say, It is so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
so it pleased God; And <hi>he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not account of his Matters;</hi> He is<note place="margin">Job 33. 13.</note>
not accountable to us, why he so willeth.</p>
            <p>As to the Question, How is it Possible? I see
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:106448:19"/>
no difficulty in that at all. The Persons are Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished,
though not Divided. As in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Attributes, God's Justice and Mercy are
Distinguishable; though in God they cannot
be Divided. And accordingly, some things
are said to be Effects of his Justice, others of his
Mercy. So the Power and Will of God (both
which are Individual from himself:) But when
we say God is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> we do not say he is
<hi>Omnivolent.</hi> He wills indeed All things that Are,
(else they could not be) but he doth not will all
things Possible. And the like of other Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</p>
            <p>If therefore we do but allow as great a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
between the Persons, as between the
Attributes, (and certainly it is not less, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more,) there is no incongruity in ascribing
the Incarnation to One of the Persons, and not
to the rest.</p>
            <p>'Tis asked further, How I can accommodate
this to my former Similitude, of a Cube and its
Three Dimensions; representing a Possibility
of Three Persons, in one Deity. I say, Very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily.
For it is very possible, for one Face of a
Cube, suppose the Base, (by which I there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
the Second Person, as Generated of
the Father,) to admit a Foil, or Dark Colour,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:106448:19"/>
while the Rest of the Cube is Transparent;
without destroying the Figure of the Cube, or
the Distinction of its Three Dimensions, which
Colour is adventitious to the Cube. For the
Cube was perfect without it, and is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
by it. Which may some way represent
Christ's <hi>Humiliation.</hi> Who being <hi>Equal with God,</hi>
was <hi>made Like unto Us,</hi> and <hi>took upon him the Form
of a Servant,</hi> Phil. 2. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>So that, upon the whole Matter, there is no
Impossibility in the Doctrine of the Incarnation,
any more than in that of the Trinity. And, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
them to be not Impossible; it is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
but that they are, both of them, sufficiently
Revealed; and therefore to be Believed, if we
believe the Scripture. And of the other Articles
in the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed, there is as little reason
to doubt.</p>
            <p>There is therefore no just Exception, as to
the <hi>Declarative</hi> part of the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed. And,
as to the <hi>Damnatory</hi> part; we have before shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that it is no more severe, than other passages
in Scripture to the same purpose; and to be
understood with the like Mitigations as those
are. And, consequently, that whole Creed, as
hitherto, may justly be received.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:106448:20"/>
'Tis true, there be some Expressions in it,
which, if I were now to Pen a Creed, I should
perhaps chuse to leave out: But, being in, they
are to be understood according to such sence as
we may reasonably suppose to be intended,
and according to the Language of those times
When they did use to Anathematize great Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
which they apprehended to be Destructive
of the Christian Faith, as things of themselves

            <p>WHen this Third Letter was Printed,
and ready to come abroad, I stopped
it a little for this Postscript; occasioned by a
small Treatise which came to my hands, with
this Title, <hi>Dr.</hi> Wallis'<hi>s Letter, touching the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Blessed Trinity, answered by his Friend.</hi>
It seems, I have more <hi>Friends</hi> abroad than I am
aware of. But, <hi>Who</hi> this Friend is, or whether
he be a <hi>Friend,</hi> I do not know. It is to let me
understand, that a <hi>Neighbour</hi> of his, <hi>reputed a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian,</hi>
is not <hi>convinced</hi> by it: But names some
<hi>Socinian</hi> Authors, who endeavour to elude Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
alledged for the Trinity, by putting some
other sence upon them. He might have named
as many, if he pleased, who have (to better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
written against those Authors, in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the True sence. And if he should Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
what Those have said on the one side;
and I, say over again, what Those have said on
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106448:21"/>
the other side; we should make a long work
of it.</p>
            <p>But he knows very well, That was not the
business of my Letter, to discourse the whole
Controversie at large, (either as to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or as to the Antiquity, of the Doctrine.)
For this I had set aside at first, (as done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
to whom I did refer:) and confined my
Discourse to this single Point, That there is <hi>no
Impossibility</hi> (which is the <hi>Socinians</hi> great Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction)
but that What in one consideration is
Three, may in another consideration be One.
And if I have sufficiently evinced this, (as
I think I have; and I do not find that he
denies it;) I have then done what I there un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook.
And, in so doing, have removed the
great Objection, which the <hi>Socinians</hi> would cast
in our way: and, because of which, they think
themselves obliged to shuffle off other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
on this pretence. Now (whether he
please to call this <hi>a Metaphysick,</hi> or <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Lecture,</hi>) certain it is, that there are <hi>Three
distinct Dimensions</hi> (Length, Breadth, and Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness)
in <hi>One Cube.</hi> And, if it be so in Corporeals,
there is no pretence of reason, why in Spirituals
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> should be thought Impossible, that there be
<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ree <hi>Somewhat's</hi> which are but One God. And
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:106448:21"/>
these <hi>Somewhat's,</hi> till he can furnish us with a
better name, we are content to call <hi>Persons,</hi>
(which is the Scripture word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3.) Which
word we own to be but <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> (not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
just the same here, as when applied to
men,) as also are the words, <hi>Father, Son, Generate,
Begot,</hi> &amp;c. when applied to God. And more than
this need not be said, to justifie what there I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to defend.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis easie for him (if he so please) to
<hi>burlesque</hi> this, or turn it to <hi>ridicule,</hi> (as it is, any
the most Sacred things of God;) but not so safe,
<hi>Ludere cum Sacris.</hi> The Sacred Trinity (be it as
it will) should by us be used with more Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
than to make Sport of it.</p>
            <p>I might here end, without saying more. But
because he is pleased to make some Excursions,
beside the Business which I undertook to prove,
(and which he doth not deny;) I will follow him
in some of them.</p>
            <p>He finds fault with the Similitude I brought,
(though very proper to prove what it was
brought for,) as too high a Speculation for <hi>the
poor Labourers in the Country, and the Tankard-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
in</hi> London. And therefore (having a mind
to be pleasant) he adviseth rather (as a more <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
Parallel</hi>) to put it thus, <hi>I</hi> Mary, <hi>take thee</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:106448:22"/>
Peter James <hi>and</hi> John <hi>for my wedded Husband,</hi> &amp;c.
(thinking this, I suppose, to be Witty.) And
truly (supposing <hi>Peter, Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> to be
the same Man,) it is not much amiss. But I
could tell him, with a little alteration, (if their
Majesties will give me leave to make as bold
with their Names, as he doth with the Names
of Christ's Mother, and of his three Disciples
which were with him in the Mount at his
Transfiguration, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 1.) it were not
absurd to say, <hi>I</hi> Mary, <hi>take thee</hi> Henry William
Nassaw; without making him to be three Men,
or three Husbands; and without putting her
upon any difficulty (as is suggested) How to
dispose of her Conjugal Affection. And, when
the Lords and Commons declared Him to be
King of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> they did not
intend, by alotting him three distinct Kingdoms,
to make him three Men. And when, for our
Chancellor, we made choice of <hi>Iames,</hi> Duke,
Marquess and Earl of <hi>Ormond;</hi> though he had
three distinct Dignities, he was not therefore
three Men, nor three Chancellors. And when
<hi>Tully</hi> says<note n="*" place="margin">2 de Orat.</note>, <hi>Sustineo unus tres personas;
meam, adversarii, judicis;</hi> which is in
English, (that the <hi>Tankard-bearer</hi> may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it,) <hi>I being one and the same Man, do sustain
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106448:22"/>
Three Persons; that of Myself, that of my Adversary,
and that of the Iudge:</hi> He did not become three
<hi>Men,</hi> by sustaining three <hi>Persons.</hi> And (in this
Answer to my Letter) the <hi>Friend</hi> and his <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi>
may (for ought I know) be the same <hi>Man,</hi>
though he sustain Two <hi>Persons.</hi> And, I hope,
some of these <hi>Resemblances,</hi> may be so <hi>plain,</hi> and
so <hi>familiar,</hi> as that <hi>He and his Tankard-bearer</hi> may
<hi>apprehend</hi> them: and thence perceive, It is not
Impossible that Three may be One. For if
(among us) <hi>one Man</hi> may sustain <hi>three Persons,</hi>
(without being <hi>three Men,</hi>) Why should it be
thought incredible, that <hi>three Divine Persons</hi> may
be <hi>one God?</hi> (as well as those three other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
be one Man?) Nor need he the less be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it for having (as this Answerer suggests)
been <hi>taught it in his Catechism,</hi> or (as <hi>Timothy</hi> did
the Scriptures) <hi>know it from a Child.</hi> But I would
not have him then to tell me, the Father is a
<hi>Duke,</hi> the Son a <hi>Marquess,</hi> the Holy Ghost an
<hi>Earl,</hi> (according as he is pleased to prevaricate
upon the Length, Breadth and Thickness of a
Cube;) but thus rather, That, God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
God the Redeemer, and God the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier,
are <hi>the same God.</hi> That God the Creator is
<hi>Omnipotent</hi> and <hi>Allsufficient;</hi> that God the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
is so too; and God the Sanctifier like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:106448:23"/>
That God the Creator is to be <hi>Loved with
all our Heart;</hi> and so God the Redemer, and God
the Sanctifier. And then there will be no Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
in all this.</p>
            <p>As to what he says, that <hi>All people that have
reason enough to understand Numbers, know the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between One, and More than one;</hi> I might
reply, That all people who can tell Mony,
know that <hi>Three Groats</hi> are but <hi>One Shilling,</hi> and
<hi>Three Nobles</hi> are <hi>One Pound;</hi> and what in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
is <hi>Three,</hi> may in another consideration
be but <hi>One.</hi> Which, if it look like a slight An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
is yet sufficient to such an Argument.</p>
            <p>He tells me somewhat of Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I am not concerned,) and somewhat of <hi>the
Brief History of the Unitarians,</hi> (of which his
Neighbour <hi>gives</hi> the Friend <hi>a Copy;</hi>) But he
doth not tell me, as he might, (and therefore I
tell him) that Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> hath confuted that
<hi>History.</hi> But Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> says nothing contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to what I defend. For if there be such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
(between the three Persons) as he
assigns, then at least, there is a Distinction
(which is what I affirm, without saying how
great it is;). Nor doth he any where deny them
to be <hi>one God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:106448:23"/>
He tells me a story of somebody, who, in a
publick Disputation at <hi>Oxford,</hi> maintaining a
<hi>Thesis</hi> against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> was <hi>baffled</hi> by his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent.
Whom, or when, he means, I do not
know; and so say nothing to it: But, that I
may not be in his debt for a story, I shall tell
him another, which will be at least as much to
the purpose as his. It is, of their great friend,
<hi>Christophorus Christophori Sandius,</hi> a diligent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter
of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Cause. He printed a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
<hi>Thesis</hi> or Discourse against the Divinity of
the Holy Ghost, which he calls <hi>Problema Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxum
de Spiritu Sancto,</hi> with a general Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to this purpose, <hi>Ut siquis in toto Orbe erudito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
forte sit, qui doctrinâ magis polleat, quam quibus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum
hactenus sit collocutus, ea legat quae à se publice
sint edita argumenta, seque errare moneat, ac rectius
sentire doceat.</hi> Hereupon, <hi>Wittichius</hi> accepts the
Challenge, and writes against <hi>Sandius.</hi> To
which <hi>Sandius</hi> answers, (taking in another as a
partner with him in the Disputation.) And <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichius</hi>
replies. And that with so good success,
that <hi>Sandius</hi> and his partner, acknowledged
themselves to be convinced by it, and to change
their Opinion. This happening but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Sandius</hi> his death; His Partner (surviving)
published to the World an Account hereof, (and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:106448:24"/>
of <hi>Sandius</hi> declaring, before his death, that he
was so convinced,) in a Letter of Thanks to
<hi>Wittichius</hi> for it. What <hi>Sandius</hi> would have done
further, if he had lived a little longer, we cannot
tell. That of <hi>Wittichius</hi> bears this Title, <hi>Causa
Spiritûs Sancti, Personae Divinae, ejusdem cum Patre
&amp; Filio essentiae, (contra C. C. S. Problema Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxum,)

The Letter of Thanks bears this Title, <hi>Epistola
ad D. Christophorum Gittichium Professorem Lugdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensem;
Qua gratiae ei habentur pro eruditissimis ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius
in Problema de Spiritu Sancto Animadversionibus:
Scripta à Socio Authoris Problematis Paradoxi: Per

Nicolai.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He takes it unkindly, that I charge it upon
some of the <hi>Socinians</hi> that though they do not
think fit directly to reject the Scriptures, yet
think themselves obliged to put such a <hi>forced
sence</hi> upon them, as to make them signifie some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
else. And tells me of some <hi>Socinians,</hi> who
have so great a respect for the Scriptures, as to
say that <hi>the Scripture contains nothing that is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to manifest Reason;</hi> and <hi>that what doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with Reason, hath no place in Divinity,</hi> &amp;c. But
this is still in order to this Inference; That
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106448:24"/>
therefore what they think not agreeable to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
must not be thought to be the sence of
Scripture: and therefore that they must put
such a <hi>Force</hi> upon the Words, how great soever,
as to make them comply with their sence. If he
except against the words, <hi>how great a Force soever,</hi>
as too hard an Expression of mine: They are
<hi>Socinus</hi>'s own words, (in his Epistle to <hi>Balcero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi>
of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 30. 1581.) <hi>Certe contraria senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
adeo mihi &amp; absurda &amp; perniciosa (pace Augusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,
&amp;c. dixerim) esse videtur, ut</hi> Quantacun<expan>

               </expan> Vis
<hi>potius Pauli verbis sit adhibenda, quam ea admittenda.</hi>
That is, <hi>The contrary Opinion (with Augustin's
leave, and others of his mind) seems to me so absurd and
pernicious, that we must rather put a</hi> Force, <hi>how great
soever, upon Paul's words, than admit it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, as to the suspicion I had of some of
their Sentiments, as to <hi>Spiritual Subsistences,</hi> (that
it may not appear to be groundless) He doth
(in his <hi>Epist. 5. ad Volkelium</hi>) absolutely <hi>deny,</hi> that
<hi>the Soul after death doth subsist;</hi> and adds expresly,
<hi>Ostendi me sentiresnon ita vivere post hominis ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius
mortem, ut per se praemiorum poenarumve capax
sit:</hi> that is, that <hi>the Soul after death doth not subsist;
nor is in a capacity of being, by it self, rewarded or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</hi>
And how he can then think it an <hi>Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Being,</hi> I do not see. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> it seems,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106448:25"/>
was of another mind, when <hi>he had a desire to be
dissolved</hi> (or <hi>depart hence) and to be with Christ,</hi> as
being <hi>far better</hi> for him, than to <hi>abide in the flesh,</hi>
Phil. 1. 23, 24. <hi>And willing rather to be absent from
the body, and present with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 8.
Now I do not understand the advantage of his
<hi>being with Christ,</hi> or being <hi>present with the Lord;</hi>
if he were then to be in a <hi>sensless condition,</hi> not
capable of pain or pleasure, punishment or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Epist. 3. ad Dudithium,</hi> we have these words,

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Socinus,</hi> in his Tract, <hi>de Ecclesia,</hi> pag. 344.

is pretty plain. <hi>I am not</hi> (says he) <hi>to regard what
other men do teach or think, or have before now taught
or thought, whosoever, or how many soever, they be or
have been.</hi> And if his <hi>whosoever</hi> are not here to
be extended to the Sacred Writers; he tells us
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106448:25"/>
of them elsewhere, <hi>Ego quidem, etiamsi non semel,
sed saepe, id in</hi> sacris monimentis <hi>scriptum extaret,

Soc. de Jesu Christo servatore, Par. 3. cap. 6.

<hi>though it were to be found written in the</hi> Sacred Moni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<hi>not once, but many times, I would not yet for
all that believe it so to be.</hi> And a little before, in
the same Chapter, (having before told us, that
he thought the thing <hi>Impossible,</hi>) he adds, <hi>Cum
ea quae fieri non posse aperte constat, divinis etiam ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis
ea facta fuisse in speciem diserte attestantibus, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaquam

appear,</hi> (or when he thinks so, whatever all the
World think beside) <hi>that the thing cannot be; then,
though the Divine Oracles do seem expresly to attest it,
it must not be admitted: and therefore the Sacred
Words are, even by unusual Tropes, to be interpreted to
another sence than what they speak.</hi> Which Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are, I think, full as much as I had charged
him with.</p>
            <p>And if these Instances be not enough, I could
give him more of like nature. But I shall conclude
this with one of a later date: at a <hi>Publick Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
at <hi>Franeker,</hi> Octob. 8. 1686. where (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106448:26"/>
others) this <hi>Thesis</hi> was maintained;
<hi>Scripturae divinitatem non aliunde quam ex Ratione ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strui

                     <am>

Ratio aliud quid nobis dictaret quam Scriptura, huic
potius esse credendum.</hi> And when <hi>Ulricus Huberus</hi>
(because it was not publickly censured, as he
thought it deserved to be) did oppose it in
Word and Writing; the same was further as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted,
in Publick Disputations, and in Print, by
two other Professors in <hi>Franeker,</hi> in Vindication
of that former Thesis; that, <hi>If Reason do dictate
to us any thing otherwise than the Scripture doth; It is
an Error to say, that, in such case, we are rather to
believe the Scripture.</hi> An account of the whole is
to be seen at large in a Treatise entituled, <hi>Ulrici
Huberi, Supremae Frisiorum Curiae ex-senatoris, De
concursu Rationis &amp; Scripturae Liber. Franakerae apud
Hen. Amama &amp; Zachar. Taedama,</hi> 1687. And
a Breviate of it in the <hi>Lipsick Transactions</hi> for the
Month of <hi>August,</hi> 1687. And, after this, I hope
this Answerer will not think me too severe in
charging such Notions on some of the <hi>Socinians,</hi>
while yet (I said) <hi>I was so charitable as to think di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of them were better minded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what should make him so angry at what
I said of <hi>Guessing,</hi> I cannot imagine. That <hi>there
is a Distinction between the Three, we are sure;</hi> (this
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:106448:26"/>
I had said before, and the Answerer now says,
It is so.) <hi>But not such as to make three Gods;</hi> (this I
had said also, and the Answerer says so too.)
That <hi>the Father is said to Beget, the Son to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
and the Holy Ghost to Proceed,</hi> I had said also,
(and I suppose he will not deny,) because thus
<hi>the Scripture tells us.</hi> (And whatever else the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
tells us concerning it, I readily accept.)
But if it be further asked, (beyond what the
Scripture teacheth,) as, for instance, <hi>What this
Begetting is,</hi> or, <hi>How the Father doth Beget his only
begotten Son;</hi> This, I say, <hi>we do not know,</hi> (at least
I do not) because this, I think, the Scripture doth
not tell us; (and of this therefore I hope this
Gentleman <hi>will give me leave to be ignorant:</hi>) Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it <hi>is not</hi> so as when one Man begets ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but How <hi>it is,</hi> I cannot tell. And if I
should set my thoughts awork, (as some others
have done, and each according to his own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination)
to <hi>Guess</hi> or Conjecture, <hi>How perhaps it
may be;</hi> I would not be <hi>Positive,</hi> That <hi>just so it
is:</hi> Because I can <hi>but Guess</hi> or Conjecture, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be <hi>sure</hi> of it. (For I think it is much the same
as if a man born Blind, and who had never seen,
should employ his Fancy to think, What kind
of thing is Light or Colour: of which it would
be hard for him to have a clear and certain
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106448:27"/>
               <hi>Idea.</hi>) And if this Gentleman please to look over
it again, I suppose he will see, that he had no
cause to be so angry, that I said, We <hi>can but
Guess</hi> herein, at what <hi>the Scripture doth not teach
us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Socinians</hi> have set their Wits awork
to find out other Subsidiary Arguments and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasions
against the Trinity, beside that of its
Inconsistence with Reason, I do not deny: But
That is the Foundation, and the rest are but
Props. And if they admit, that there is in it no
Inconsistence with Reason; they would easily
answer all the other Arguments themselves.</p>
            <p>I thought not to meddle with any of the
Texts on either side, because it is beside the
Scope which I proposed, when I confined my
Discourse to that single Point, of its not being
Impossible or Inconsistent with Reason: and
did therefore set aside other Considerations, as
having been sufficiently argued by others, for
more than an Hundred Years last past. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
already followed him in some of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions,
I shall briefly consider the two sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
places which he singles out as so mainly
<hi>clear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the former of them, <hi>Iohn 17. 3. This is
life eternal, that they might know thee the only true
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:106448:27"/>
God, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent;</hi> he puts
a Fallacy upon us: which perhaps he did not
see himself, or at least hoped we would not see
it. And therefore I desire him to consider, that
it is not said <hi>Thee only</hi> to be the true God; but
Thee, the <hi>only true God.</hi> And so in the Greek;
it is not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The
Restrictive <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>only,</hi> is not annexed to <hi>Thee,</hi> but
to <hi>God.</hi> To know <hi>Thee</hi> to be the <hi>only true
God;</hi> that is, to be that God, beside which
God, there is no other true God. And We say
the like also, That the Father is that God, beside
which there is no other true God: and say, the
Son is also (not another God, but) the same
only true God. And if those words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>;
should be thus expounded, <hi>To know Thee to be the
only true God; and whom thou hast sent, Iesus Christ,</hi> (to
be the same only true God;) repeating <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
those words <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> he would not
like that interpretation; but both the Words
and the Sence will very well bear it, (without
such Force as they are fain to put upon many
other places.) Or if, without such repetition,
we take this to be the scope of the place; To
set forth the two great Points of the Christian
Religion, or Way to Eternal Life; That <hi>there
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106448:28"/>
is but one true God</hi> (though in that Godhead there
be three Persons, as elsewhere appears,) in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the <hi>many Gods</hi> of the Heathen: and
the Doctrine of Redemption, by <hi>Iesus Christ,
whom God hath sent,</hi> (of which the Heathen were
not aware:) the sence is very plain. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in it so clear, as he would have us think,
against the Trinity; but all very consistent with
it.</p>
            <p>And the same Answer serves to his other
place, 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 6. But to us there is but one God,
the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him,</hi> (or
<hi>for him:) and one Lord Iesus Christ, by whom are all
things, and we by him.</hi> For here also <hi>One God</hi> may
be referred <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, both to <hi>the Father</hi> (if here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as a distinct person) and to <hi>the Lord Iesus
Christ:</hi> Or, without that, it is manifest, that <hi>One
God</hi> is here put in opposition (not to the plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Persons, as we call them, in One Deity;
but) to the <hi>many Gods</hi> amongst the Heathen: and
our <hi>one Saviour,</hi> against their <hi>many Saviours.</hi> As is
manifest, if we take the whole context together;
<hi>We know that an Idol is nothing in the World: and that
there is no other God but one. For though there be that
are called Gods, whether in Heaven or in Earth, (as
there be Gods many, and Lords many:) But to us
there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106448:28"/>
and we in him; and one Lord Iesus Christ, by whom are
all things, and we by him,</hi> Ver. 4, 5, 6. Where it
is evident, that the scope of the place is, not to
shew either how the Persons (as we call them)
or how the Attributes of that One God are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
amongst themselves: But to set our
<hi>One God</hi> (who is the Father or Maker of all
things,) in opposition to the <hi>Many Gods</hi> of the
Idolatrous World: and our <hi>One Saviour</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
against their <hi>Many Saviours.</hi> Indeed, if
we should set up our Jesus Christ to be <hi>another
God,</hi> the Text would be against us: but not
when we own him for <hi>the same</hi> God. So that
here is nothing clear in either place (as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends)
against Christ's being the <hi>same God</hi> with
the Father.</p>
            <p>But in that other place of <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. (which he
labours to elude) the evidence for it doth so
stare him in the face, that if he were not (as he
speaks) <hi>Wilfully blind,</hi> (or did Wink very hard)
he must needs see it. <hi>In the beginning was the
Word; and the Word was with God; and the Word
was God. The same was in the beginning with God.
All things were made by him; and without him was not
any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the
life was the light of men,</hi> (Ver. 1, 2, 3, 4.) <hi>He was
in the World; and the World was made by him; and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:106448:29"/>
the World knew him not. He came unto his own, and
his own received him not. But to as many as received
him, he gave power</hi> (or <hi>right,</hi> or <hi>privilege,) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the sons of God, even to them that believe on his
Name,</hi> (Ver. 10, 11, 12.) <hi>And the Word was made
flesh, and dwelt among us; and we beheld his glory,
the glory as of the only begotten of the Father; full of
grace and truth,</hi> (Ver. 14.) Why he should not
think this very clear, is very strange, if he were
not strangely prepossessed. Unless he think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
clear, but such as no man can cavil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst.
But there can hardly be any thing said
so clearly, but that some or other (if they list
to be contentious) may cavil at it, or put a <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
sence</hi> upon it. For thus the whole Doctrine
of Christ, when himself spake it, (and he spake
as clearly, as he thought fit to speak,) was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villed
at. And himself tells us the reason of it,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 14, 15. and <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 37, 38, 39, 40.
and after him St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 28. 26. and <hi>Rom.</hi>
11. 8. Not for want of <hi>clear Light,</hi> but because
they <hi>shut their eyes.</hi> In <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. it is thus, <hi>But
though he had done so many miracles before them, yet
they believed not on him: That the saying of Esaias the
Prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake; Lord, who
hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of
the Lord been revealed? Therefore they could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106448:29"/>
because Esaias said again, He hath blinded
their eyes and hardened their heart, that they should
not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart,
and be converted, and I should heal them. These things
said Esaias, when he saw his glory and spake of him.</hi>
And thus in <hi>Matth 13. Hearing ye shall hear
and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see and
shall not perceive. For this peoples heart is waxed gross,
and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they
have closed; lest at any time they should see with their
eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their
heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</hi>
So that 'tis no argument of a place or doctrine's
not being clear, because prejudiced persons are
able to pick cavils at it, or put a forced sence
upon it.</p>
            <p>But let us see what these cavils are. <hi>This I
confess</hi> (saith he) <hi>were to the purpose, if by the term</hi>
Word <hi>could be meant</hi> (he should rather have said,
<hi>be meant) nothing else but a pre-existing person; and,
by the term</hi> God, <hi>nothing but God Almighty the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of Heaven and Earth; and if taking those terms
in those sences did not make</hi> St. John <hi>write Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in reply to this, I first take exception
to that phrase, <hi>if it could be meant of nothing else.</hi>
For if his meaning be this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>If no Caviller can start
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106448:30"/>
up another sence, right or wrong:</hi> this is no fair play.
For hardly can any thing be so plain, but that
somebody may find a pretence to cavil at it. It
is enough for us therefore, if <hi>it be thus meant,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
saying, it is impossible to put a forced sence
upon it. But this would have spoiled his design,
in mustering up a great many forced sences;
not that he thinks them to be true, (for surely
they be not all true; and I think none of them
are) nor telling us which he will stick to; but
only that he may cast a mist; and then tell us
(which is all that he concludes upon it) <hi>the place
is abscure,</hi> he knows not what to make of it.</p>
            <p>But when the Mist is blown off, and we look
upon the Words themselves, they seem plain
enough, as to all the Points he mentions. <hi>The
Word</hi> which <hi>was with God,</hi> and <hi>was God,</hi> and <hi>by
whom the World was made,</hi> and which <hi>was made flesh
and dwelt amongst us, and we saw his glory,</hi> and of
whom <hi>Iohn bare witness;</hi> must needs be a <hi>Person;</hi>
and can be no other than our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi>
who was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> And <hi>this
Word,</hi> which <hi>was in the beginning,</hi> and by whom
<hi>the World was made,</hi> must needs have been <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent</hi>
before he was so born. And <hi>this Word,</hi>
which was <hi>with God</hi> (the true God) and <hi>was
God,</hi> and by whom <hi>the World was made,</hi> and who
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:106448:30"/>
is <hi>one with the Father,</hi> (Joh. 10. 30.) and<note n="*" place="margin">What we render <hi>who is,</hi> (in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5.) is in the Greek, not <gap reason="foreign">

And so the description of <hi>Christ,</hi> Rom. 9. 5. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in its full Emphasis, is thus, <hi>that BEING over all,</hi> (or, the Supreme Being) <hi>God blessed for ever,</hi> (or the ever blessed God) <hi>Amen.</hi> And there will be need of <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Expedient, (<hi>quantacunque Vis Pauli verbis adhibenda</hi>) to make it signifie any other God, than <hi>God Almighty, the Creator of Heaven and Earth.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>who is
over all, God blessed for ever, (Rom.</hi> 9. 5.) is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God than <hi>God Almighty, Creator of Heaven
and Earth.</hi>) And this plain sence the words
bear, without any force put upon them: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Incoherence, Inconsistence, or Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
s<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e that they do not agree with the
<hi>Socinian</hi> Doctrine. And there is no other way
to avoid it, but what <hi>Socinus</hi> adviseth in another
case, <hi>Quantacunque Vis verbis adhibenda; putting a
Force upon the words, no matter how great,</hi> to make
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106448:31"/>
them, not to signifie, what they plainly do. Or
else to say, (which is his last refuge) that <hi>St. Iohn
writes Nonsence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let him then consider, Whether this do
savour of that respect which he would have us
think they have for the Holy Scripture; and
whether we have not reason to susp<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
of some of them. And, Whether we have
not reason to complain of their putting a <hi>forced
sence</hi> upon plain words, to make them comply
with their Doctrine. And lastly, Whether it
be not manifest, that the true Bottom of their
aversion from the Trinity (whatever other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidiary
Reasons they may alledge) is, because
they think it <hi>Nonsence,</hi> or not agreeable with
their Reason. (For, set this aside, and all the
rest is plain enough; but, because of this, they
scruple not to put <hi>the greatest force</hi> upon Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.)
Nor is there any other pretence of
Nonsence in the whole Discourse, save that he
thinks the Doctrine of the Trinity to be Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
So that the whole Controversie with
him, turns upon this single Point, Whether there
be such <hi>Impossibility</hi> or <hi>Inconsistence,</hi> as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>That of 1 <hi>Iohn 5. 7. There be three that bear
record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106448:31"/>
Ghost; and these Three are One:</hi> is wanting, he
says, in some Copies. And it is so; (and so are
some whole Epistles wanting in some Copies.)
But we will not for that quit the place. For
we have great reason to think it genuine. If
this difference of Copies happened at first by
chance (upon an oversight in the Transcriber)
in some one Copy, (and thereupon in all that
were transcribed from thence;) it is much
more likely for a Transcriber to leave out a line
or two which is in his Copy, than to put in a
line or two which is not. And if it were upon
design, it is much more likely that the <hi>Arians</hi>
should purposely leave it out, (in some of their
Copies) than the Orthodox foist it in. Nor was
there need of such falsification; since <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
concludes as strongly, as to a Plurality of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
(and of the Son in particular, which was
the chief controversie with the <hi>Arians;</hi>) as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
doth as to all the Three. And, I think, it is ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> in his Book <hi>De unitate Ecclesiae,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Arian</hi> Controversie was on foot. And
therefore, if it were done designedly (and not by
chance) it seems rather to be <hi>razed out by the</hi> Arians,
than <hi>thrust in by the Orthodox.</hi> And the Language of
this in the Epistle, suits so well with that of the
same Author in his Gospel, that it is a strong
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:106448:32"/>
presumption, that they are both from the same
Pen. The <hi>Word,</hi> in 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 7. agrees so well
with <hi>the Word</hi> in <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. (and is peculiar to
St. <hi>Iohn:</hi>) and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 7. with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
in <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 30. (<hi>these three are One,</hi> with <hi>I and the
Father are One</hi>) that I do not at all doubt its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
genuine. And that Evasion of his, <hi>these three
are one,</hi> that is, <hi>one in testimony,</hi> will have no
pretence in the other place, where there is no
discourse of Testimony at all: but <hi>I and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are One, (unum sumus</hi>) must be <hi>One Thing,</hi>
One in <hi>Being,</hi> One in <hi>Essence.</hi> For so Adjectives
in the Neuter Gender, put without a Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
do usually signifie both in Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin:
and there must be some manifest reason
to the contrary, that should induce us to put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
sence upon them.</p>
            <p>The other place, <hi>Matth. 28. 19. Baptizing
them in</hi> (or <hi>into) the Name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost;</hi> is not so slight an
evidence as he would make it. For whether
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) be rendred <hi>in the
Name,</hi> and taken to denote the joint Authority
of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, admitting the
person baptized into the Christian Church: Or,
<hi>into the Name,</hi> (which this Answerer seems to
like better) and taken to denote the Dedication
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106448:32"/>
of the person baptized to the joint Service or
Worship of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; (Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
it self being also a part of Divine Worship:)
They are all conjoined; either, as in joint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
or as joint Objects of the same Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Worship; and, for ought appears, in the
same Degree. And <hi>Socinus</hi> himself doth allow,
the Son to be Worshipped with Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
as <hi>Adoration,</hi> and <hi>Invocation;</hi> as Lawful at
least, if not Necessary. Now when this Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
tells us of the First Commandment, <hi>Thou
shalt have no other God but me,</hi> (the God of <hi>Israel;</hi>)
He might as well have remembred that of
Christ, <hi>Matth. 4. 10. Thou shalt worship the Lord
thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
since <hi>Socinus</hi> (and other of his followers)
do allow Christ to be Worshipped, they must
allow him to be God, even the God of <hi>Israel.</hi>
And I am mistaken if he be not expresly called,
<hi>the Lord God of Israel.</hi> Luke 1. 16. <hi>Many of the
children of Israel shall he</hi> (John the Baptist) <hi>turn
to the Lord their God; for he shall go before Him in
the spirit and power of Elias,</hi> &amp;c. Now he before
whom <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> was to go in the spirit and
power of <hi>Elias,</hi> is agreed to be our Lord Jesus
Christ; 'tis therefore He that is here called the
Lord God of <hi>Israel.</hi> And we who own him
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106448:33"/>
so to be, Worship no other God in Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
him. It is those, who do not own him so
to be, and do yet Worship him, that are to be
charged with Worshipping another God. Now
when here we find Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
all joined in the same Worship, we have reason
to take them all for the same God; and, that
<hi>these Three are One.</hi> And do say, (as willingly
as he) <hi>Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is One God.</hi>
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are but One God:
As God the Creator, God the Redeemer, and
God the Sanctifier, are One God. And what
in the Old Testament are said of God, indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,
without taking notice of this or that of
the three Persons; are, in the New Testament,
attributed some to one, some to another, of the
three Persons.</p>
            <p>That which makes these Expressions seem
harsh to some of these men, is because they have
used themselves to fansie that notion only of the
word <hi>Person,</hi> according to which Three Men are
accounted to be Three Persons, and these Three
Persons to be Three Men. But he may consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that there is another notion of the word
Person, and in common use too, wherein the
same Man may be said to sustain divers Persons,
and those Persons to be the same Man, That is the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106448:33"/>
same Man as sustaining divers Capacities. As
was said but now of <hi>Tully, Tres Personas Unus
sustineo.</hi> And then it will seem no more harsh
to say, The three Persons, Father, Son and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost are one God; than to say, God the
Creator, God the Redeemer, and God the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifier
are one God; which, I suppose, even to
this Answerer would not seem harsh, or be
thought <hi>Nonsence.</hi> It is much the same thing,
whether of the two Forms we use. And, all the
Cavils he useth, may be equally applied to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
What answer therefore he would give to
one who should thus object against the latter
form, will serve us as well to what he objects
against the former.</p>
            <p>If therefore the Gentleman please to consider
it calmly; he will find, that, even amongst
men, though <hi>another person</hi> do many times denote
<hi>another man,</hi> (and thereupon the words are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
used promiscuously,) yet not always; nor
doth the word <hi>Person</hi> necessarily imply it. A
<hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Husband</hi> (though they imply very
different Notions, different Capacities, different
Relations, or different Personalities,) yet may
both concur in the same Man. (Or, in that sence
wherein Person is put for Man, in the same Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.)
So a King and a Father, a King and a
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:106448:34"/>
Brother, and the like. And this Gentleman,
though (in the Dialogue) he sustain two <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi>
that of an Opponent, and that of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer;
or that of a Friend, and that of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary;
(that so, while one gives ill Language,
the other may give up the Cause;) yet they do
not act each their own part so covertly, but that
sometime the vizard falls off, and discovers the
<hi>Man</hi> to be the same. For though my Letter be
<hi>answered by a Friend,</hi> pag. 1. yet 'tis the <hi>Neighbour</hi>
that is <hi>weary of Writing,</hi> p. 13.</p>
            <p>Now, if <hi>Person,</hi> in a Proper sence, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to Men, do not imply, that <hi>different Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
must needs be so many <hi>different Men:</hi> much
less should it be thought <hi>Nonsence,</hi> when (in a
Metaphorical sence) it is applied to God, that
<hi>different Persons</hi> in the Deity, should not imply
<hi>so many Gods:</hi> Or, that <hi>three Somewhat's</hi> (which
we call <hi>Persons</hi>) may be <hi>One God.</hi> Which is what
I undertook to prove.</p>
            <p>And, having made this good, I need not
trouble my self to name more Texts (though
many more there be which give concurrent evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to this truth) or discourse the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
at large, (which was not the design of
my Letter.) For himself hath reduced it to this
single Point; When St. <hi>Iohn</hi> says, <hi>The Word was
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106448:34"/>
with God, and the Word was God;</hi> if by <hi>the Word,</hi>
be meant <hi>Christ,</hi> and by <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>true God;</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in so saying, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> do not <hi>speak Nonsence?</hi>
And if I evince this <hi>not to be Nonsence,</hi> (as I think
I have done) he grants <hi>the place is to the purpose.</hi>
Which quite destroys the Foundation of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi>
Doctrine. Without being obliged to prove,
that these Persons are just such Persons, and so
distinct, as what we sometime call Persons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Men, (but with such Distinction only
as is agreeable to the Divine Nature, and not
such as to make them Three Gods.) Like as
when God the Father is said to <hi>Beget</hi> the Son;
not so as one man Begets another, (nor is the
<hi>Son</hi> so a Son as what we call Son amongst
Men:) but so as suits with the Divine Nature:
which <hi>How it is,</hi> we do not perfectly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</p>
            <p>I have now done with him. But I have one
thing to note upon what I have before said, of
the <hi>Athanasian Creed.</hi> I there read it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
because I so find it
in the Copy I used; which is that at the end of
the Greek Testament in <hi>Octavo,</hi> Printed at <hi>London</hi>
by <hi>Iohn Bill,</hi> 1622; with <hi>Robert Stephan</hi>'s, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph
Scaliger</hi>'s and <hi>Isaac Casaubon</hi>'s Annotations.
But in <hi>Whitaker</hi>'s Greek Testament, reprinted by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:106448:35"/>
this Copy, 1633, I since find it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. (Which
Edition, I suppose, is followed by some others.)
I take the former to be the better reading, (as
giving a clearer sence;) and that the Correcter
of the Press, had put <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, intending thereby
to mend the Greek Syntax, (because <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
follows,) but doth (I think) impair the sence.
But, as to the Doctrine, it is much one whether
we read <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And what I have said of that
whole Creed, is chiefly intended for those who
do believe the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and of
Christ's <hi>Incarnation;</hi> that there is no reason (in
my opinion) why they should not allow of that
Creed. But such as do not believe those Points,
cannot (I grant) approve the Creed. And it is
these, I suppose, who would fain have others to
dislike it also.</p>
