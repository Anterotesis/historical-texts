            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

God only wise hath so resolved, that, by means of sanctified trouble the Heirs of glory may be weaned from earth, and learn to place their chief contentment and happinesse, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their enjoyments below, which are uncertain, empty and perishing; but upon things above, <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for them.</hi> How hard were it to make, even those who are born of God, long to be dissolved and bid adieu to all their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary contentments, except the Lord in mercy did


<pb facs="tcp:44180:3"/>
place a prick in every one of those roses, and make their most promising earthly comforts within a little to prove <hi>as streams of brooks that passe away, Job</hi> 6. 15? And how should this conciliate love to a sad and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering lot, and make the Lord's People (who are strangers and pilgrims) delight in the way, which leadeth to such an home as Heaven is? It is indeed our unacquaintance with Scripture, and with what the Word of Truth holdeth forth to be the mind of God, while He <hi>scourgeth every son whom He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth,</hi> which doth occasion so much proud rising of spirit, or base dejectedness of mind, when the Lord doth not carve us out such a satisfying lot in all things as we would. How often do we mistake our way, and little lesse than quarrel with God? only because He hedgeth us in with thorns of affliction, that we cannot find out our lovers; and therefore that man is truly <hi>blessed</hi> whom the Lord doth not only <hi>chastise,</hi> but also <hi>instruct out of His Law, Ps.</hi> 94. 12. and thereby make him understand and <hi>hear the voice of the rod, and of Him who hath appointed it, Mica.</hi> 6. 9. And herein indeed the Lord doth greatly manifest His marvellous loving kindnesse, and in wrath remembreth mercy, that He joyneth instruction with correction, and doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish His afflicted People with abundant means, by which they may take up the mind of God for good unto them under His saddest dispensations, even that <hi>the fruit of affliction is to take away their sin, Isa.</hi> 27. -9-. that <hi>He doth punish them seven times more,</hi> and yet <hi>seven times more, untill their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they accept of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their iniquity, Levit.</hi> 26. 24, 28, 41. that though He <hi>visit their transgression with the rod, and


<pb facs="tcp:44180:3"/>
their iniquity with stripes: Nevertheless His loving kindnesse will He not utterly take from him, Psal.</hi> 89. 32, 33. and that <hi>when they are judged, they are chastened of the Lord, that they should not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 32. All this, and much more to this purpose, hath the Lord made known by His Word, and doth daily inculcate and make more and more known by His sent Ministers, who, according to their Commission, do open up and apply the rich treasure of holy Scripture unto the Lords People of their charge. And, as if all this were not sufficient, He hath besides stirred up the spirits of many of His Servants in every age to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Labours upon Scripture unto writing, for the more publick use of the Church of God, not only in the present, but also the succeeding gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>As for my self, I ingenuously professe, that, being conscious of mine own weaknesse, I did much incline to rest satisfied with expressing my Commission by word only in preaching to, and conferring with, my Flock and those of my charge: But, being earnestly requested, and in a manner commanded by some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Brethren, whom I honour and reverence in the Lord, to draw up briefly in writ, a plain Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysis, a short and sound Exposition of, and the chief Observations grounded upon such Scriptures as I had either largely preached upon, or more briefly opened<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up to the Lords People of my charge, I shewed them some of my weak endeavours of that kind to be disposed upon at their pleasure: which when they were pleased to publish and to call for more work of the same nature, expressing their confidence,


<pb facs="tcp:44180:4"/>
that what I had already done, was acceptable to all that love the Truth, and would be edifying to the present and after-ages; and, being thereunto also encouraged by diverse faithfull and understanding persons, I have, in obedience to their desires, given<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this other Piece to be disposed of by them as they should see good.</p>
            <p>And seing they have advised the publishing of it, To whom could I, with more confidence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of duty, dedicate these my mean labours than to your Honours; considering, that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me <hi>to watch for your souls, as one who must g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>n account,</hi> and that your Honours have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, for your parts, to encourage me to go about all the parts of my Ministery <hi>with joy, and not with grief?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lords, when I called to remembrance how long each of you was detained these years by-past from enjoying the benefit of my publick Ministery, by your necessitated abode elsewhere, I thought the best way to give you an account, and to make you reap some fruit of my labours in your absence, was, to present these my weak endeavours to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours: and what you have heard from me upon these Scriptures in publick, when you were permitted to be my hearers, I hope this little piece shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to bring it to your remembrance, and the Lord Himself convey it into your hearts, there to remain, to make your Honours more and more wise to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in the day of the Lord Jesus ye may be matter of joy, and a crown of rejoycing to those who have laboured among you and spoken the Word of God unto you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44180:4"/>
And for you, Madam, who hath had liberty to be my hearer more frequently and constantly than my noble Lords, as I trust your Honour will observe there is a good harmony betwixt that which I taught in the Congregation and which I now publish to the world; and that this little piece shall (according to your usuall diligence in searching Scripture, and in keeping fellowship with God in the practice of all commanded duties) be improved by your Honour for your further edification and encouragment to <hi>walk worthy of the Lord unto all well-pleasing:</hi> So, when I consider how refreshfull it hath been often unto me to behold your sweet submission under the Lord's hand, your truly Christian courage under va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of afflictions, your tractable disposition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive wholsome counsels, your willingnesse to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the way to life, and, in order to that end, to attend publick duties beyond many of your equals; your strengthening my hands in the work of my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, as by other means, so especially by your good example amongst the People of my charge, I should judge my self very unanswerable to God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding much blame-worthy if I did not encourage your Honour to make progresse in that good way, wherein ye are already engaged. And if my present essay upon this Piece of sacred Truth do contribute any thing to this end, it shall be matter of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving from me unto the Lord, who alone <hi>doth teach His People to profit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And finally, I do professe unto you all (Right Honourable and most dearly beloved in our Lord) that those words, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 14, 15. sound much in mine ears, and do sometimes work upon my


<pb facs="tcp:44180:5"/>
heart, if so I may in some measure follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of that blessed Apostle who wrote them, <hi>Wherefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>I will not be negligent to put you alwayes in remembrance of those things, though ye know them, and be established in the present Truth. Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, to stir you up, by putting you in remembrance. Knowing, that ere long</hi> (or, not knowing how soon) <hi>I must put off this tabernacle. Moreover, I will endeavour, that you may be able after my decease, to have these things alwayes in remembrance.</hi> Now, it is the Lord alone who blesseth the endeavours of His Servants, and giveth increase both to our plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and watering. To whose rich and saving grace I commend your Honours most heartily, and shall ever pray for all manner of blessings on you and all your rising posterity, as is the duty of,</p>

               </hi> Do here present thee with an Exposition of two of <hi>Paul's</hi> Epistles after the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern (so far as my weaknesse could reach) held forth by those two Reverend Brethren, Mr. <hi>David Dickson,</hi> and Mr. <hi>George Hutcheson,</hi> in their late Pieces of this kind upon other parcels of holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>The Reasons of my undertaking (besides what is held forth in the former Epistle) were not any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence I had to come up to my copie, wherein I doubt not, but, as I my self am very conscious, so, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Reader will easily perceive that I come far short, and that the superstructure by me is much unanswerable, as to fulnesse of purpose, accuracie and stile of language to the foundation laid by them: But, first, an apprehension I had, that as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of such a work as this upon the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is much wished for by many, and would prove acceptable and profitable to the Church of Christ; So, many of greater abilities and fitnesse than I for such a task, who did lie-by, might be strongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to contribute their endeavours towards it, if any essay of mine should be accepted, Wherein, I blesse the Lord, I have not been in a mistake, as may appear by what is sent abroad to the world since the publishing of my former Piece, by a Reverend Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther


<pb facs="tcp:44180:6"/>
my nearest fellow-labourer in the work of the Ministery, upon the two Epistles of <hi>PETER.</hi> And, secondly, I was one of those, who, some ten years ago, without my knowledge, were pitched upon by some Reverend Brethren of the Ministery for carrying<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Work: at which time, I almost perfected the whole task then allotted for me; but, through some sad accident in those times of trouble, all the Papers I had written upon that subject, were destroyed and lost, and so a great part of my time and life in a manner lost with them: which, notwithstanding, did not so discourage me, but the remembrance of what sweetnesse I tasted in that study, and of the manifold advantage wherewith it did recompense my pains, did make me full seven years after more easie to be wrought upon and perswaded by the earnest desires of others to make a new essay, as being confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from former experience, I my self at least should be no loser by it.</p>
            <p>If any shall think this present Piece to be of greater length than my former, and some others of this kind are, I hope they will (for satisfaction) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that seing the Apostle doth discusse a great and needfull controversie in the Epistle to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> it requireth time and enlargement to find and follow the threed of an intricate dispute; and to explain those excellent Truths, which the Apostle doth so much labour to assert. And as for the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> it is well known to be so comprehensive (as containing the whole substance of Christian Religion in so little bulk) that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can any man (at least not I) satisfie either himself, or his Reader, without inlarging himself


<pb facs="tcp:44180:6"/>
somewhat in opening up such a rich treasure and excellent subject.</p>
            <p>I know there may be much coincidencie of Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, which do nativly arise from those Epistles and from those others to the <hi>Philippians</hi> and <hi>Colossians;</hi> But, the <hi>Reader</hi> may, for his satisfaction, consider that (besides I have frequently referred him to those places, where such Doctrines were formerly raised) seing the Spirit of God hath thought it necessary to assert necessary truths oftner than once, in severall Scriptures, for our further confirmation, it should not be thought an idle repetition in a Writer to draw out the same conclusions from the same truths when they occurr: for, hereby is given a proof of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficiency and fruitfulnesse of Scripture, as furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many arguments to establish one and the same necessary truth; <hi>To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe,</hi> saith our Apostle, <hi>Philip. 3. 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I trust it shall not offend, that in some places I do not only hold forth the doctrine and conclusion, which flow naturally from the text; but also couch-in some explanations, cautions, reasons, and somtimes some short uses; for, those serve to obviate mistakes about the truth in hand, and to leave some impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion of it upon the heart and affections.</p>
            <p>If any take exception that Scriptures are too frequently cited, and think they are hereby retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from making progresse in reading the treatise, They may be pleased to consider, that I cite no Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to confirm the Doctrines themselves, which, as I conceive, are sufficiently grounded upon, and confirmed from the text, but only the cautions rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons


<pb facs="tcp:44180:7"/>
and uses of those Doctrines, which not being grounded upon the present Scripture, I desired none to take off my hand upon trust. However, if any understand the purpose to be truth, and grounded upon Scripture, he needeth not stand to seek the particular passage, which is brought to prove it, except he please and judge it convenient, that he may have some further ground of meditation upon the truth in hand thereby afforded.</p>
            <p>And now, beloved Christians, let me exhort you all, and especially you to whom the Lord hath carved out such a lot in things worldly that ye have abundance of time and leasure from your other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, Give more of your time to the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture, and labour to understand the mind of God concerning your Salvation revealed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Hereby shall you be preserved from being led aside by Satans emissaries, who <hi>do erre, not knowing the Scriptures,</hi> Matth. 22. 29. Hereby ye shall be <hi>made wise unto Salvation,</hi> and rendered victorious over your strongest lusts, and throughly fitted for the most difficult duties, while the Lord by His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit shall make the <hi>Scriptures profitable unto you for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousnesse, and thereby make you perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works, 2 Tim 3. 16, 17.</hi> Only in order to the gaining of those rich advantages by reading Scripture, ye would read, not superficially, but conscientiously, attentivly, and devoutly; and do not slight to take what helps ye can get from the Labours of others for attaining to the increase of solid knowledge and sanctifying grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44180:7"/>
What humane frailties you discerne in this piece of mine (which doubtlesse are not a few) pitie them and so much the more pray for me that I may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and amend them: and if any will be so faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and free as to advertise me either immediately, or by causing others to acquaint me with them, I shall (God willing) be humbly thankfull, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make the best use I can of their freedom, knowing that such reproofs <hi>will not break my head, but be as a precious ointment.</hi> The great and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God blesse all your endeavours for advancing your selves and your relations in knowledge and grace. So prayeth,</p>

Upon which occasion, the Apostle writeth unto them this Epistle: wherein his scope, is, to convince those Galatians of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; to reduce them to the right way; to confirm them in the Truth, and to presse upon them the duties of an holy life, chap. 3, and 4, &amp;c. which he laboureth to effectuate (after prefacing, to ver. 6. chap. 1.) First, by asserting the truth of the Gospel preached by him, and the Authority of his own Apostleship, to ver. 15. of chap. 2. Secondly, by vindicating the true doctrine of justification by faith, and of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary use and abrogation of the Levitical Law, and of the whole legal dispensation of the Covenant of Grace, to the end of chap. 4. Thirdly, by instructing them in the right use of Christian Liberty, having exhorted them to stand to it, and pointing out, and pressing upon them the exercise of several Christian Vertues, to ver. 11. of chap. 6. From whence he concludeth the Epistle, to the end of chap. 6.</p>

               <p>In the second part, he reproveth the <hi>Galatians</hi> for their defection from the Gospel, ver. 6. to Errors, which did overturn it, ver. 7.</p>
               <p>In the third part, that he may justifie this reproof, he asserteth the divine authority of the Gospel preached by him, First, by cursing those who should hold out another Gospel, differing from it, ver. 8, 9. Secondly, from the scope of his doctrine, and his aim in preaching it, ver. 10. Thirdly, because both the first saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which he had of the Gospel, and his office to preach it, were immediatly from God, and not from men, whether Apostles or any other, ver. 11, 12. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he giveth several evidences; As first, that ever untill the instant of his conversion, he was a learned, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting Pharisee, ver. 13, 14. Secondly, that being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously converted and called, he went presently with no small pains and hazard to discharge his Apostolick Office, without instruction or authority received from any Apostle, ver. 15, 16, 17. Thirdly, that after three years he went to <hi>Peter,</hi> but not to be informed by him, or to receive ordination from him, or from any other Apostle, ver. 18, 19. The truth of all which history he confirmeth by an oath, ver. 20. Fourthly, that he preached as an Apostle in <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Christian Jews whom formerly he had persecuted, ver. 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>

                  <p>IN these two Verses is the Inscription of the Epistle, holding forth, 1. Who did write it, to wit, <hi>Paul,</hi> described from his Office, and his Call to that Office, which were both wholly divine, as being immediately from God, ver. 1. <hi>And the Brethren with</hi> him; such were eminent Professors, but especially publick Preachers, who then were with <hi>Paul,</hi> and did give their testimony to those Truths contained in this Epistle, though they were not the immediate Pen-men of the holy Ghost in it, as <hi>Paul</hi> was. 2. To whom the Epistle was written, ver. 2. From ver. 1. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Free-grace doth often light upon the most unworthy, not only by giving grace and salvation to themselves, but also making them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times instrumental for the Kingdom of Christ, and for bringing about the salvation of others: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> once a wicked persecutor, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13—is now made an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Apostle; <hi>Paul an Apostle.</hi> 2. Faithful and called Ministers of Jesus Christ, are to be so far from cowardly ceding, or heartlesse fainting under the bold, bitter and unjust aspersions of those who would labour to question their Calling, and thereby weaken their Authority, and render the truth of their Doctrine doubtsom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 23. that they ought so much the more, for the credit of their Office, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 13. and for the Truth's sake which they preach, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 25. avow their Calling against all, who do question it. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> writing to these <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> amongst whom, by means of the false Apostles, his Authority was questioned more than in any other Church, (chap. 2. 6, 9, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> expresseth himself more largely in avowing his Call to the Apostolick Office, than in any other Epistle: not only affirming that he

The Apostolick Office had this common to it with all other Church-offices, whether ordinary, or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11. that it was not the invention of man, or founded upon authority meerly humane, but was instituted by Jesus Christ, to whom only it apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to appoint Office-bearers in His House, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. for which respect, <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth he was an <hi>Apostle not of man,</hi> as the Ambassadors and Officers of Princes and States are: Ministers are Ambassadors for Christ, representing Him, and having their Authority from Him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. 4. The Office of an Apostle had this peculiar unto it self, that the designation of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to undergo that Office, was not mediately by the election and suffrages of men, as it is in the calling of ordinary Office-bearers, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. but immediately from God; so that the Function of the Apostles ceased with them, and did not passe by succession to a Pope or any other: for, in this respect, <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth he was an <hi>Apostle, not by man,</hi> to wit, meer man, <hi>but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father.</hi> He was called immediately by God, <hi>Act. 9. 15.

That Jesus Christ is not meer man but God also, appeareth from this, that the Apostle here opposeth Christ to man, and so He behoved to be more than man: and this was not an Angel, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. and therefore He was also God; <hi>Neither by man</hi> (saith he) to wit, meer man, <hi>but by Jesus Christ.</hi> 6. When Scripture ascribeth an action to the Father, the first Person of the blessed Trinity, as done by Him, it is not to be so under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as if the Son and holy Ghost were excluded from having hand in that action; but that they are rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Father, as persons of the same Godhead: for, the calling of the Ministers of the Gospel, which is ascribed to God the Father, is ascribed to the holy Ghost, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. and <hi>Paul,</hi> who is here said to be called by God the Father, is by the holy Ghost separated and sent forth unto a particular imployment in his Calling, <hi>Act.</hi>

13. 2, 4. and the raising of Christ from the dead in like manner ascribed to God the Father here, is ascribed to Christ also, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 18. and to the holy Ghost, <hi>Rom. 8. 11. And God the Father, who raised Him from the dead.</hi> All the external actions of the Godhead towards the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are common to the whole Trinity, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19. So that the ascribing of some actions to the Father, is not, as if any of the rest were not concurring, But because of the order of working, which is among the Three Persons; the Father being the first fountain of working, as doing all things from Himself (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6.) by the Son (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6.) and holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 6, 8. because of this order, those actions which are common to the whole Trinity, are frequently ascribed unto the Father. 7. As Jesus Christ who hath life in Himself, <hi>Job.</hi> 5. 26. and is the fountain of life unto others, <hi>(Joh.</hi> 6. 33.) was once among the dead; so He was raised again by the power of the Father from death unto life, and is alive for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, Amen, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 18. it being impossible that He should be holden by death, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 24. and Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice having received full satisfaction from Him for all which He undertook to do or suffer, as our Cautioner, <hi>Joh. 16. 10.

So blinded are men usually with preposterous zeal to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their erroneous opinions, that frequently they do alleage those things for to uphold them, which of all other things are most contrary unto them: Thus the false Apostles, that they might shake the Truth preached by <hi>Paul,</hi> and establish their own contrary Error, did alleage that he was no lawful Apostle, as for other reasons, so it would seem mainly for this, Because he had not seen Christ in the flesh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 1. nor yet was called before His death; and that therefore his Doctrine was not to be much regarded: Which reason <hi>Paul</hi> doth here refute, by shewing he was called by Christ, after He was raised from the dead, and had taken possession of His glorious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; leaving unto them to gather, that therefore his Call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They are also in all their reproofs, to use much warinesse and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, not omitting any circumstance which may justly extenuate the sin reproved, or furnish with any ground of hope concerning the amendment of him who is reproved: for, hereby the bitter potion of a medicinal reproof is much sweetned, &amp; the guilty patient alluted to the more thorow-receiving of it: <hi>Paul</hi> useth this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection, while he saith, not ye of your selves do remove to another Gospel, but <hi>ye are removed,</hi> passively; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by laying the chief part of the blame upon others; and while he speaketh of them in the present time, not that they were already removed, but as being in the act of removing, so that their case was not desperate; <hi>I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, that ye are removed:</hi> In the Original, it is a word of the present time. 4. The most quick-sighted of Christ's Ministers, may be much deceived and disappointed in their expectation of good things from some eminent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors (for, in charity they are obliged to hope the best of all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. in whom the contrary doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16.) and so may readily fall short of their


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44180:15"/>
hope, as <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth he did, while he saith, <hi>I marvel, that ye are removed;</hi> importing, that their defection had fallen forth beyond his expectation; for, at such things men use to marvel, <hi>Mark 15. 44. Doct.</hi> 5. The Servants of Jesus Christ, are not, under the pretence of warinesse and circumspection in reproving, to omit any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which may deservedly aggrege the sin reproved, whereby the guilt may be charged home with greater weight upon the sinners conscience, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 7. pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and faithful freedom may well consist, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 16. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> heapeth together several things, whereby their apostasie was aggreged, as that it was sudden, a turning from God, and to another Gospel; <hi>I marvel that ye are so soon removed, &amp;c.</hi> 6. How great need have they who stand, to take heed lest they fall, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12. seing such is mans inconstancy, especially in the matter of Religion; that they who are flourishing Professors of saving Truths now, may upon a sudden, and with very little ado, be carried away to soul-destroying Errors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be long: for, such were those Errors, unto which the Galatians were removed, chap. 5. 2. and that <hi>so soon,</hi> either after their first conversion, or after the time when they were first assaulted by the false Apostles, which doth not militate against the doctrine of perseverance, seing <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh to the whole visible Church, among whom some had never saving grace; and for the few truly gracious, which were among them, there is nothing here to prove that their falling away was either total or final. 7. This aggregeth the sin of any person not a little, when he doth suddenly without difficulty or resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and with ease succumbe and yeeld unto the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for, hereby is their defection aggreged, even that they were <hi>so soon removed;</hi> they did not long resist the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Yet, even those of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sort, are not altogether free of guilt; when the blind do lead the blind, both fall together in the ditch: for,


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44180:16"/>
herein were these Galatians guilty, that they did suffer themselves to be seduced, or, <hi>so soon removed from Him that called them.</hi> 9. As the dangerous consequences which follow upon Error, ought to be presented unto People, that thereby they may be made the more to flie from it; So there are some Errors in Doctrine, which do no lesse separate the person erring from God and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in free-grace, than profanity of life doth: of which Errors, this is one, the maintaining of Justification by works: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that by this Error <hi>they were removed from God, who had called them, and from the grace of Christ.</hi> 10. As the inward effectual calling of sinners from the state of nature unto grace, is the work of God, which He bringeth about by the preaching of His Word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. Yea, and the external calling of men from Idols, to be Members of the visible Church, which is attended with professed subjection upon his part, who is called, unto God's Laws and Ordinances, is his work also, though in an inferiour degree and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect: So it is no small aggravation of sin or error in any person, when it is evidently inconsistent with, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon, that state, unto which he is called: for, <hi>Paul</hi> describeth God here, as elswhere, chap. 5. 8. from His calling of them, and chooseth to describe Him so, while he is speaking of their defection; that hereby he may aggrege it, as reflecting so much upon their calling; <hi>From Him that called you.</hi> 11. The Gospel is a Doctrine which holdeth forth much of Christ's free-grace and good-will to sinners, and specially in this, that Heaven and Salvation, though purchased at a dear rate by Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. is notwithstanding freely offered unto all, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 17. and really to be bestowed upon all who do but come to Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. and by saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faith lay hold upon Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. for, God's calling them to receive the Doctrine of the Gospel, is here ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med His <hi>calling them unto the grace of Christ.</hi> 12. It is ordinary for Seducers, and those that are acted by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing spirit, to usher-in their Errors by some excellent


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44180:16"/>
designations, as of New-Lights, a more pure Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and what not? as here they design their Eerror, by the name of another Gospel; and this doubtlesse, as they would have had the people believe, a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Gospel than what <hi>Paul</hi> had preached: for, <hi>Paul</hi> in imitation of the false Apostles, calleth their Errors <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Gospel.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle taketh away that excellent title from the error of the false Apostles, whereby themselves did design it, and denieth it to be a Gospel at all; yea, and to be any other thing but the invention of men, whereby they troubled the Churches peace, and laboured to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and corrupt the doctrine of the Gospel. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the part of Christ's Ministers to undeceive a seduced People, by taking off the vail of fair pretences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Error useth to be covered, and so made the more taking, and to set it forth in its vilest colours, that People may loath it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth take the name of <hi>Gospel</hi> from this error, declaring it to be nothing else but a perverting of the Gospel; <hi>Which is not another.</hi> 2. There is but one Gospel, one in number, and no more; and but one way to Salvation held out in the Gospel, which is by Faith laying hold upon the righteousnesse of Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. Whatever doctrine holdeth forth any other way to Salvation than this, it is no Gospel, no glad-tidings of Salvation, but a perverting of the Gospel: for, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> affirm of the doctrine taught by the false Apostles; <hi>Which is not another, &amp;c.</hi> 3. The proper effect of Error, is, to trouble the Churches peace; first, their outward peace among themselves, the patrons of Error being zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of nothing so much as to gain many followers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 15. for attaining whereof, they scruple not much to make wofull rents and deplorable schismes within the Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17. Secondly, their inward peace of


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44180:17"/>
conscience, while some are thereby rendred first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, and anxious what to choose or what to refuse, and at last are made to question all Truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 32. and others to imbrace Error for Truth, and so to ground their peace upon an unsure foundation, which can give no solid peace, no not in the mean time; and whatever false peace is thereby offered, it will afterwards end in trouble, <hi>Jude</hi> 13. Hence it is said here of the false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles by <hi>Paul, There be some that trouble you,</hi> to wit, by their Errors. The Scripture-use of the word, is, mainly to signifie inward trouble, anxiety, fear and perplexity of mind, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 3. and 14. 26. The word seemeth to be borrowed from the troubling of waters, <hi>Job.</hi> 5. 4, 7. which usually cometh to passe by great winds, <hi>Jona.</hi> 1. 7. and applied to the troubling of the Galatians by the winds of erroneous doctrine, <hi>Eph. 4. 14. Doct.</hi> 4. Then is usually the design of Satan, and of his instruments, against Truth, most dangerous, and so most to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against and feared, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 15. when they speak fairest and endeavour to palliate their Errors with specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences: for here, when they pretend to no lesse than the holding out of a more excellent Gospel than <hi>Paul</hi>'s, ver. 6. they endeavour even to <hi>pervert</hi> and overturn <hi>the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Christ.</hi> 5. However people, who are in hazard of seduction, or already seduced unto Error, are to be tendered, and by all means servently to be laboured with, in order to their confirmation or recovery, <hi>Jude</hi> 22, 23. Yet these obdured Leaders and desperate Seducers, are not much to be taken notice of: <hi>Paul</hi> thinketh such unworthy, whom he should once name; <hi>But there be some that trouble you.</hi> 6. The Doctrine which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth that Justification and Salvation are obtained partly by Christ, and partly by the merit of good works, is a perverting and total overturning of the Gospel, in so far as it contradicteth the main scope of the Gospel, which is to hold out and exalt Christ as our compleat Saviour, Mediator, and Ransom, and not in part only, <hi>Eph. 2. 7, 8, 9. 1 Joh.</hi> 1. 7. Hence the false Apostles, while

they presse justification by works, as appeareth from the tenour of the following dispute, are said to <hi>pervert the Gospel of Christ.</hi>

                  <p>IN the third part of the Chapter, the Apostle, that he may justifie his former reproof, asserteth the Divine Authority of that Gospel, which he had preached unto them. And first, by denouncing the terrible curse of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal separation from Christ against those who should corrupt that Doctrine by preaching another way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation differing from it. The certainty of which denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation he confirmeth from the supposition of an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible case, That if either he himself, or the other Apostles with him, Yea, or if an Angel from Heaven should teach otherwise, they were not to be exempted from this curse; and therefore much lesse should there be exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for others. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The written Word of God, without the help of unwritten traditions, containeth in it all Truths necessary for bringing about the salvation of those who yeeld themselves to be instructed by it: for, the written Word comprehendeth the sum and substance of all that <hi>Paul</hi> preached or believed, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. 14. and no Doctrine, differing from what he had preached, was to be taught under the hazard of a curse, which could not be, except he had preached all necessary Truths; <hi>Let him be accursed,</hi> saith he, <hi>who preacheth any other Gospel.</hi> 2. Whatever Doctrine is propounded unto the Church, as a part of God's Word and necessary to Salvation, if it be diverse and differing from, or besides the written Word, though it be not directly contrary unto it, it is a cursed Doctrine, and the Authors thereof accursed: The Ambassador who speaketh any thing beside his Commission, is as well in a fault, as he who speaketh the contrary, though not so much: for, saith the Apostle, <hi>If


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44180:18"/>
we preach unto you any other Doctrine than that</hi> (the word signifieth <hi>besides that we have preached unto you) let us be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed.</hi> 3. So assured ought Ministers to be of the truth of what they hold forth as the way to life and salvation, that nothing imaginable, no not the authority of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from Heaven may prevail to brangle them in their leaving of it; yea, and that knowingly and with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they may be able to denounce the curse of God against those who would dare to hold out another way of Salvation contrary unto it: for, so doth <hi>Paul; If an Angel preach besides what we have preached, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed.</hi> 4. The Ministers of Jesus Christ ought to be faithfull unto the souls of those over whom they are set, by declaring the whole Counsel of God unto them, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 27. and keeping up no Truth necessary for Salvation from them: for, <hi>Paul</hi> was thus faithful to the Galatians, else he could not denounce those accursed who would preach any thing, to wit, as necessary to Salvation, even <hi>besides that which he had preached unto them,</hi> as he doth here. 5. So much of glory to God's Justice and Mercy is manifested in the Doctrine of the Gospel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 12. the keeping of this Doctrine pure and uncorrupt is so necessary for the salvation of sinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. the perverting of this Doctrine by adding any thing of mans inventions to it, is so dishonourable to God, whose wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is hereby taxed as defective; so destructive to the Doctrine of the Gospel it self, ver. 7. and so perniciously poisonable to the souls of People <hi>(Act.</hi> 15. 24.) that they who are guilty of this sin, and labour to seduce others to imbrace their pernicious Errors, are liable to the terrible curse of eternal separation from Christ, and ought to be pronounced such judicially by the Church, <hi>Tit. 3. 10. Let him be accursed,</hi> or, <hi>Let him be Anathema,</hi> which was one kind of that dreadfull sentence of Excommunication, as it was used with the Jews; and the word signifieth that which is put apart from the use of man, and dedicated unto God, with the accursing of them who should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert it to their own use; and so, by a translated sense, it


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44180:18"/>
signifieth eternal separation from Christ. <hi>Rom. 9. 3. 1 Cor. 16. 21. Doct.</hi> 6. The more impartial the Ministers of Christ be in reproving of sin, and denouncing of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings against all without exception, who are guilty of the sin threatned, the word of reproof and threatning will have the more weight from his mouth; and when the Word is dispensed with evident respect to persons, so that the faults of some are sharply rebuked, when the sins of others equally guilty for by-respects are wholly connived at, usually no person careth for it: therefore, <hi>Paul,</hi> that the judgment denounced may have the more weight with others, exempteth not himself, if so he should be found guilty of the sin against which he threatneth, <hi>Though</hi> (saith he) <hi>even</hi> I <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other of the Apostles, <hi>preach any other Doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> 7. As people, when they discern any excellencies or perfections, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in gifts or graces in Ministers, are ready to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trust whatever they deliver; so nothing of that kind should make faith to what they preach, if it be not foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Word of Truth: the first of these is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the other more directly expressed, while he saith, <hi>If we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Doctrine, let him be accursed.</hi> 8. The Authority of the Gospel and written Word, is far above the Authority of the most trust-worthy Men; yea, and of the glorified Angels, So that neither Man nor Angel, Church or any other, can adde any Authority to it, as though without the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of those it had not sufficient Authority in it self, (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.) and from God the Author of it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. to give faith unto it; neither can they detract any thing from its Authority, though they should all in one voice contradict it, as it appeareth from this impossible case, supposed by the Apostle; <hi>Though we, or an Angel from Heaven, preach any other Gospel, let him be accursed.</hi>

It is not enough for the Salvation of peoples souls, to have the Gospel preached in purity

                  <p>HEre is a second Argument, proving the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Gospel, which <hi>Paul</hi> had preached to those Galatians, taken partly, from the scope of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which was not to <hi>perswade men,</hi> that is (by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Ellipsis and a construction somwhat unusual) he did not by his Doctrine perswade men to be heard and obeyed (as the false Apostles, who did alwayes inculcate the Authority of men upon the hearers, that hereby they might gain credit to their Doctrine;) but the drift of his Doctrine was to draw men to God, <hi>perswading God,</hi> that is, to be heard and obeyed; that so the faith of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers might rely only upon the Authority of God, and not of men; partly, from the scope of the preacher, <hi>Paul</hi> himself, which was not to hunt after the favour of men, (as the false Apostles did presse the Legal Ceremonies, that they might hereby gain the applause of, and decline persecution from, the Jews, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 12.) but his aim was, singly to approve himself to God, however men should esteem of him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. and withall, giveth a reason inducing him to be thus single and sincere, to wit, if he


<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44180:20"/>
should set himself to hunt after the favour of men, as he did when he was a Pharisee, he could not be an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Servant of Christ, but of those whose favour he stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died to gain. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The faithfull Servants of Jesus Christ, beside their many other sufferings, must resolve to suffer somewhat sometimes in their credit and estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from those, who, being set on by a spirit of spight and malice, will spread sinistrous reports in secret of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Ministers, the truth whereof they dare not avow or publickly stand to, when they are put to it, and have fair opportunity to do it if they could: for, it appeareth <hi>Paul's</hi> adversaries had been secretly whispering, as if the scope of his Doctrine had been to set up his own Authority and Testimony in the Points controverted, not only above the other Apostles, to whom they falsly boasted of to have favoured them (as is collected from chap. 2. 6.) but also above the Authority of God speaking in the Old Testament, and that he was not constant to himself, sometimes disproving Circumcision, and sometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it, chap. 5. 11. as he might best please the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of men with whom he had to do: and <hi>Paul</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth off these calumnies, not by a positive denial of any Truth to be in them, but by interrogations and questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which, as they serve for strong negations of the things questioned, according to the use of Scripture, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 3. So they in a manner provoke the adversary to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert the thing questioned for truth, if he be able: for, <hi>do I now perswade men, or God? or, do I seek to please men?</hi> 2. Though the Minister of Jesus Christ may make use of humane Authority as a secondary proof and testimony unto the Truth, already proved to be Truth from the Word of God, and chiefly towards those with whom the testimony of such will have most weight, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 28, Yet the Authority and Writings of men, or of any man whatsoever, are not to be rested upon as the first and main proof of any religious Truth: neither are they, especially in preaching, to be alwayes inculcated and promiscously unto every sort of hearers; lest thereby the


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44180:20"/>
faith of people be brought to rely on the Authority of men: for, this is to <hi>perswade men,</hi> to wit, to be chiefly heard, as the supream Judges of religious Truths, which <hi>Paul</hi> denieth to have been his practice; <hi>Do I now perswade men?</hi> 3. That Doctrine only, the truth whereof is grounded upon Divine Testimony, and <hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi> is to be received in the Church, as that which men may safely venture their eternal well-being on, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 12, 15. and which God will own for His, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 24. for, <hi>Paul</hi> proveth that the Doctrine preached by him was the only true Gospel of Jesus Christ, because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he did <hi>perswade God,</hi> to wit, to be heard and obeyed, and His Authority only to be stood to, as appeareth by the causal particle <hi>for; For do I now perswade men, or God?</hi> The first part of the question hath the force of a denial; the second of a vehement affirmation, as if he had said, I do not perswade men, but God. 4. It is not enough that a Minister preach nothing to people, but that which is the Truth of God; he must also preach Truth sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not concealing any part of necessary Truth, or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applying Truth so, as that thereby he may please the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full affections, humours and dispositions of men, but aiming singly to approve himself to God in doing of his duty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> denieth that his aim in preaching, was to please men; <hi>Or do I seek to please men?</hi> 5. As true conversion doth work a real change in a man from what he once was in his unconverted state, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. so particularly in this, that where before he did prostitute his gifts and parts; yea, his very conscience to the slavery of mens sinfull humours whom he conversed with, and by pleasing of whom he did expect any profit, credit or contentment, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 44. he will not now abase himself, or dishonour God by doing so any more: thus was it with <hi>Paul; For if I yet pleased men;</hi> where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuateth that formerly, and while he was a Pharisee, he did please men, but he would do so no more. 6. Though the Minister of Jesus Christ, ought not to set himself of purpose, and without necessity to displease men, or, by


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44180:21"/>
his imprudent disobliging carriage to irritate and stir up their corruptions; (for hereby the Word in his mouth should be made unsavory unto them) and though he ought to endeavour the pleasing of all men, by eschew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing which may be just ground of offence to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 2. by retrenching or inlarging himself in the use of his christian liberty in things indifferent, as he may be least offensive unto them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 32, 33. and as he may gain most upon them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 20, 21, 22. and by accommodating himself in his publick preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the case, capacity and state of all, by assigning unto every one what is competent, 1 <hi>Joh</hi> 2. 13, 13. and so is to please men for their good to edification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 2. Yet, there is a way of pleasing men, most sinfull and base, especially in a Minister, and which is inconsistent with fidelity in Christ's service, to wit, when he concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth any necessary Truth, which he is otherwise called to deliver; lest he displease men, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 13, 14. when his highest aim is to gain applause from men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 5-. and generally when he is so timerously disposed, as to venture rather upon the displeasure of God, by omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any part of His duty, than to irritate and displease the sinfull humours of men, by faithfulnesse in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his Calling, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 10. A Minister who setteth himself so to please men, and who resolveth not in these respects to meet with the displeasure of some men, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a faithful Servant to Jesus Christ; for, a man cannot serve two masters, <hi>Mat. 6. 24. If I yet pleased men, I should not be the Servant of Christ.</hi> 7. A faithfull Servant of Jesus Christ, will prize his acceptation with Christ, his being approven of Him, and the testimony of a good conscience for fidelity in His Service, more, than all the favour, countenance, applause, or any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage flowing from these, which he can receive from men; and before he hazard the losse of the former, he will rather a thousand times imbrace with gladnesse the most certain losse of the latter: for, <hi>Paul</hi> maketh this an argument, why he did not seek to please men; because

that hereby he should lose the approbation of Christ: <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe Apostle addeth a third Argument, to prove the Divinity of that Gospel which he had preached, whereby he asserteth also his own lawfull Call to be an Apostle, which was questioned by his adversaries, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (as it appeareth from his so much insisting to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the contrary from ver. 13. chap. 1. to ver. 15. chap. 2.) that he was no Apostle, but some ordinary Preacher, who had received the Doctrine of the Gospel at the second hand only, and having so received it, had now himself corrupted it, contrary to what was taught by the other Apostles, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> of whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Patrociny his adversaries did falsly boast, whereby they created a prejudice in the minds of those Galatians, both against <hi>Paul's</hi> person, and his doctrine, which he wipeth off, while he prosecuteth this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at large. And, in the first place, he propoundeth the Argument as a thing known, at least which could not be contradicted, to wit, that the Gospel preached by him was not <hi>after man,</hi> ver. 11. that is, as he explaineth presently, <hi>he neither received it of man,</hi> or, he received not his Office to teach and preach the Gospel from any meer man, and so was no ordinary Preacher; <hi>Neither was he taught it by man,</hi> that is, the knowledge which he had of the Gospel, was not by any ordinary mean or instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from men, and so he had it not at the second hand, but it was immediately revealed to him by Jesus Christ; and therefore behoved to be divine, ver. 12. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the part of a faithful and prudent Minister by loving and affectionate insinuations to bear himself in upon the affections of people, even though deeply prejudicate

against him, so long as there is any hope of gaining them: for, thus doth <hi>Paul</hi> to these Galatians, while he calleth them <hi>Brethren.</hi> 2. It is the usual custom of Hereticks and adversaries of Truth, when they have nothing to say in reason against the Doctrine it self, to cast reproach upon the persons of those who preach it, and especially to question their Call and Authority to preach; that so they may indirectly at least reflect upon the Doctrine which they preach. So do the Papists now against the Ministers of the Reformed Churches, and so did the false Apostles then against <hi>Paul,</hi> as we cleared in giving the sense of the words, and appeareth from his asserting his Call to be an Apostle; <hi>It is not after men, neither received I it from man.</hi> 3. When subtil wits do thus puzle the People of God by such diversions from the main pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and by Arguments which do not directly strike at the Truth in question; it is nevertheless the part of Christs able and faithfull Ministers, to take off those indirect prejudices, by shewing how groundlesse they are; and particularly they are not only to clear the truth of the Doctrine, but also their own Call from God to preach that Doctrine: for, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> here, and to the end of the Chapter; <hi>Now I certifie you, Brethren, &amp;c.</hi> 4. As none may take upon him to dispense the Word of God publickly unto others, without a lawful Call from God to do it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. So there are several sorts of callings, one, of men, and ordinary, when God calleth by the voices and consent of men, following the Laws of the Word, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. another of God, and extraordinary, when He doth call immediately, the Call of the Church not interveening, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 21. for, Paul doth not preach untill he receive the Office to preach, and this <hi>not of man,</hi> in the ordinary way; and so of God extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily; <hi>For neither received I it of man,</hi> saith he. 5. They who are to teach others, are first to be taught themselves, to wit, ordinary Preachers by ordinary means, whereby they may be enabled by sound Doctrine both to exhort and convince gainsayers, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 9. The Priests lips should

It was required to the Office of an Apostle, that the person called to it, should have the infallible knowledge of the truth of the Gospel, and this not wholly by the help of humane means, as we do now learn knowledge at Schools of Learning, and by our own private study, but also and mainly by immediate inspiration from the Spirit of God: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that the Gospel was not taught him of man; and this he saith not to depresse humane learning, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of divine Mysteries, which we attain unto by the help of Learned-men, and of their Writings, this being the ordinary way of attaining knowledge now, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 13. 2 Tim. 2. 2.</hi> but, that hereby he may obviate the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny of his adversaries, who alleaged he had the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Gospel by ordinary instruction from men only, and so was no Apostle; <hi>Neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ,</hi> that is, it was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately revealed unto him by Christ. 7. And this that Christ is opposed unto man, doth point at His Deity. See <hi>Vers. 1. Doct.</hi> 5.</p>

                  <p>BEcause the Argument presently mentioned, is most weighty, therefore the Apostle doth at large prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, and giveth, in this Chapter, four Evidences of the truth of what he asserted in it, to wit, That neither the knowledge which he had of the Gospel was from humane perswasion, or by ordinary means; nor yet his Call to preach the Gospel was from the suffrage of men,

in Heaven and Earth, <hi>(Ps.</hi> 135. 6.) that the will of man, though never so deeply engaged in the course of sin and wickednesse, cannot resist it, but most willingly doth yeeld unto it, whenever the Lord thinketh fit to let forth that His good pleasure in its gracious and powerfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of drawing a sinner out of Nature to the state of Grace, as it appeareth from the adversative particle, <hi>But,</hi> whereby the Apostle opposeth Gods pleasure to his own former weaknesse, as prevailing over it; <hi>But when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The fountain-cause of man's salvation, and of all things tending to it, especially of his effectual calling, and of that, whereby he is made first to differ from another, is, God's good-pleasure, and nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>(Eph.</hi> 2. 1.) or foreseen to be <hi>(Rom.</hi> 9. 11.) in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, who is called: for, the Apostle ascribeth all of that kind in himself, to the pleasure of God; <hi>But when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to reveal His Son in me.</hi> 3. The disposing of events, or of things which shall fall out, together with the time when they shall fall out, are wholly ordered by God's will and pleasure: for, this pleasure of His, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribeth even the time of <hi>Paul</hi>'s calling; <hi>But when it pleased God, then,</hi> and neither sooner nor later, <hi>was Christ revealed to him.</hi> 4. The Lord, by His working in us, and particular acts of providence towards us, is often making way for some hid design and purpose of His about us, which for the time we are ignorant of, but when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the event, a wonderfull contexture of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences making way for it, and tending to it, is also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested with it: Thus <hi>the Lord had separated Paul from the mothers womb, to preach the Gospel among the Gentiles;</hi> whereby is meant, that God was without Paul's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, preparing him for that Office, by His providence about him from his very birth, as, that he was born of such parents, with such a bodily temper, fitted, as it would appear, to endure much travel and hardships, that he was educated at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> that he was a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee, instructed in all humane and divine learning ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 5.

                  <p>From Vers. 16. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. However man, by the light of Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. and by the works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>(Rom.</hi> 1: 19, 20.) and Providence, <hi>(Psal.</hi> 19. 1.) may attain to know there is a God, and that this God should be served, <hi>(Act.</hi> 17. 23.) and will be terrible to those who serve Him not <hi>(Rom.</hi> 1. 23.) Yet the knowledge of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ the Son of God, and of Redemption purchased to lost sinners through Him, is a thing which the greatest Wits, by the fore-mentioned helps, cannot reach, except it be revealed unto them, either by an ordinary or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary revelation: for, even <hi>Paul</hi> had this knowledge by revelation; <hi>It pleased God to reveal His Son in me.</hi> 2. As there is an ordinary way of revealing Christ to souls, to wit, by the Word preached, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 10. 17.) and God's blessing upon the Word, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. so there is another extraordinary, without the Word preached, whether by voice, instinct or apparition: This latter way was Christ revealed to <hi>Paul,</hi> as appeareth not only from the history of his conversion, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. and 22. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but also from the expression here used, <hi>to reveal His Son,</hi> not, <hi>to,</hi> but, <hi>in me;</hi> whereby, as some conceive, is signified, that the grace and knowledge of Christ did from Heaven immediately break-in upon his soul. 3. The knowledge of Jesus Christ, which Ministers especially do receive from God, is not only for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but that it may be communicated by them unto others: So that the Lord doth bestow the more liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon them for His Peoples sake, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4. Thus, <hi>God revealed His Son in</hi> Paul, <hi>that he might preach Him among


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44180:27"/>
the Heathen.</hi> 4. Though before Christ's coming in the flesh, the doctrine of Salvation was by God's appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confined in narrow bounds, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19, 20. Yet by Christ's death, the partition-wall was removed, and the division which was betwixt the Jews and the Gentiles, quite abolished, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13. so that the doctrine of Salvation was to be spread among the Heathen; and this, that the Prophecies of the calling of the Gentiles might be fulfilled, <hi>Psal. 2. 8. Isa. 2. 2. That I should preach Him among the Gentiles,</hi> saith <hi>Paul.</hi> 5. The Call of God, whether to amendment and newnesse of life, or to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo any lawfull Office, especially an Office in His House, it being once known to be His Call, ought not to be shifted, but immediately and without delay obeyed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 7, 8. because our life is uncertain, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 14. we know not if we shall again get such an offer, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 46. or, though we get a new offer, yet the longer we delay, there will be the greater indisposition to imbrace it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. for, this made <hi>Paul</hi> immediately to follow the Call of God; <hi>Immediately I conferred not with flesh and bloud.</hi> 6. Because flesh and bloud (whether thereby be meant carnal men, friends or any other, or our own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and natural reason) will furnish abundance of seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reasons, either for questioning the reality of God's Call, or for not obeying, or at least for postponing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to His Call, chiefly when obedience to it doth carry hazard, losse, or probability of discredit with it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 22. Therefore, in the things of God, and in the matter of obedience to the will of God, we are not to consult with flesh and bloud, but once knowing what the will of God is, we are without deliberation, whether we shall obey or not, to put it in execution, committing all our cares and fears about the issue to God, <hi>Esth.</hi> 4. 16. for, Paul <hi>conferred not with flesh and bloud:</hi> the word signifieth to lay down our cares and difficulties, as a burden, in some friends bosom; but he looked not on flesh and bloud as a friend to be advised with in the present case.</p>

From Vers. 17. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That extraordinary way of revelation, whereby the Lord made known His mind to the Penmen of Scripture, was so infallible in it self, and so evident to those unto whom it came, to be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion, but the very mind of God, that they were above all doubt to the contrary, and needed not so much as to advise with the best of men in order to their thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confirmation about the realitie of it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> was so perswaded of his immediate Call from God to be an Apostle, and of the infallible truth of the Gospel, which was revealed unto him, that he did not consult with the very Apostles about it; <hi>Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me,</hi> to wit, that he might consult with them, and obtain a Permission or Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from them to discharge his Office; otherwise it is probable, from <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 17. that <hi>Paul</hi> shortly after his conversion went to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> going through it in his way to <hi>Arabia,</hi> but went not at that time to any of the Apostles, being discharged by God to stay any longer there. 2. There may be more ground of hope to bring the most wild and barbarous savages to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, than a people outwardly civilized living under the drop of Ordinances, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inured to a form of godlinesse without the power thereof: for, <hi>Paul</hi> being commanded to make hast out of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> (there being no hopes that his Testimony would be received there, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 18.) is sent to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and savage Arabians; <hi>But I went to Arabia.</hi> 3. The Lord maketh sometimes the first piece of publick service, which He putteth His Ministers upon, as hazardous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth, and unsuccessful-like as any wherein He doth ever imploy them afterwards; that hereby they may be taught to depend more on God's blessing, than upon any humane probabilities for successe to their pains, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 9. and that they may give proof of the sincerity of their obedience to the Call of God, when no apparent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard will make them repent their undertakings, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 16. and withall that they may, in the first entry, receive


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44180:28"/>
a proof of God's fidelity in bearing them through all hazards, which they may meet with in following of His Call, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10. Thus was it with <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 2. 10, &amp;c. so was it with <hi>Jeremiah, Jer.</hi> 1. 19. and so here with <hi>Paul,</hi> whose first work, after God had called him to be an Apostle, was to preach the Gospel among the wicked and savage Arabians; <hi>I went to Arabia.</hi> 4. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles by their Office, were not fixed or tied unto any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Charge, as ordinary Ministers now are, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 1, 8. but their Charge being the whole World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. they went from place to place, as the necessities of People required, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 1. 11.) rules of Providence <hi>(Rom.</hi> 15. 20.) or God by His Spirit did immediatly direct, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 9, 10. Thus <hi>Paul went unto Arabia, and returned again to Damascus,</hi> near to which he was converted, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 3. at which time of his return, did fall out that hazard, wherein he was, from the Jews, mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 23, &amp;c. for, the history sheweth, it was many dayes after his conversion, and that immediately after his delivery from it, he went to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> and conversed familiarly with the Apostles, and therefore it could not have been before his journey to <hi>Arabia,</hi> else that history should contradict <hi>Paul</hi> himself, affirming here, <hi>that he went up to Jerusalem to them who were Apostles before him.</hi>

                  <p>HEre is a third Evidence, to wit, that three years after his conversion he went to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to give a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, serious and friendly visit to <hi>Peter,</hi> in token of mutual consent and agreement to one and the self-same Truth, which was preached by them both, but not that he might learn the knowledge of the Gospel from <hi>Peter,</hi> as his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries alleaged: for, his abode with <hi>Peter,</hi> was but for fifteen dayes only, ver. 18. And lest any should object,


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44180:28"/>
that he had been taught at that time by some other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, he sheweth he saw no other Apostle there but <hi>James,</hi> and that he did see him only, as it were, upon the by: which <hi>James,</hi> was not the son of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> who was beheaded by <hi>Herod, Act.</hi> 12. 2. but the son of <hi>Alpheus, Mat.</hi> 10. 3. who either himself, or his wife, hath been of kinred with <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Jesus. Hence <hi>James</hi> their son is here called the <hi>Lord's Brother,</hi> according to the custom of the Hebrews, who called men of the same kinred and bloud, <hi>Brethren, Gen. 13. 8. Doct.</hi> 1. That nothing of <hi>Peter's</hi> supposed supremacy over <hi>Paul</hi> and the rest of the Apostles can be gathered from this place, as the Papists do alleage, appeareth from this, that <hi>Paul</hi> went first to his Work before he came to <hi>Peter</hi> at all, and that his businesse with <hi>Peter,</hi> was not to receive ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from him, or to evidence his subjection to him, but from the respect and reverence he carried to him, to give him a friendly visit; Besides that, it is the Apostle's scope in a great part of this Epistle, to shew that he was nothing inferiour to <hi>Peter,</hi> or to any other of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. 2. We ought so to spend our time for diligence and faithfulnesse in our stations, that we may be able to give a good account how time hath been spent both for dayes and years: <hi>Paul</hi> giveth such an account, while he sheweth he preached three years in <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Damas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and after stayed in <hi>Jerusalem</hi> fifteen dayes; <hi>Then after three years I went up and abode fifteen dayes.</hi> 3. It ought to be the endeavour of Christ's Ministers to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain love and familiarity one with another, as also to make their so doing evident unto others; it being most unseemly for those who preach the Gospel of Peace unto others, to live in discord among themselves: for, Paul <hi>went up to Jerusalem to see Peter,</hi> as for other reasons, so that hereby he might evidence that love and harmony which was between them. 4. The Lord doth so direct the steps of those who do acknowledge Him in all their wayes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 6. that His glory and their good is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eminently brought about by some of the ordinary


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44180:29"/>
passages of their life, even beyond their own intention or purpose: as here <hi>Paul</hi>'s deferring to go to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> for the space of three years, his abode there only fifteen dayes, and his seeing none of the Apostles there save <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> do serve as an evidence to refute that calumny of his adversaries against his Doctrine and Office, and hath been ordered so of God for that end; although <hi>Paul</hi> in the mean time knew not so much, being then ignorant that ever he should meet with such a calumny. 5. As Ministers may and ought to meet sometimes together, to evidence and entertain mutual love and concord, and because of that mutual inspection which they ought to have one of another; So their meetings ought neither to be so frequent, or of so long continuance, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by their Flocks may suffer prejudice: for, the word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth that this was a serious visit, and about serious things, made by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Peter,</hi> and yet he remained with him but a short time untill he returned to his Charge again; <hi>He went to see</hi> Peter, <hi>and abode with him fifteen dayes.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, having to do with adversaries, and some also amongst the seduced Galatians, who gave not much credit to his Word, asserteth the truth of all he hath said, and is to say, in matter of fact, through the whole Epistle, and confirmeth it by an oath, where, according to the use of Scripture els-where, he expresseth but one principal part of an oath, to wit, a confession of God's presence and power to witnesse and judge the Truth, and includeth the other parts, such as our invocation of God to bear witnesse that we speak the truth, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. and imprecation, that God would be a Judge to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon us, if we lie, <hi>Ruth 1. 17.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44180:29"/>
whence the truth of it may be made out, and all atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal doubtings to the contrary removed, among which this is one, the solemn Oath of those who write it, being men otherwise godly and worthy of trust, attesting the truth thereof, and taking God to witnesse against their own soul, if they did lie in what they wrote; <hi>Behold, before God, I lie not.</hi> 2. The choicest Servants of Christ may be looked upon as liars, and unworthy to be trusted, even by those to whom they are sent: and yet they must not give over to preach, as knowing the Word spoken by them doth still get credit from some, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. and will beget trust to it self from others, whom God hath ordained to be saved, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48. and for the rest, it will seal up their condemnation and make them inexcusable, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. for, <hi>Paul</hi> his purging of himself from lying, doth import some did suspect him for a liar, and yet he ceaseth not to take pains upon them; <hi>I lie not.</hi> 3. It is not unlawfull for Christians under the New Testament to take an Oath, providing it be with these conditions, 1. That the thing which we swear be truth; so was it in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Oath; <hi>I lie not.</hi> 2. That there be weighty reasons for taking an Oath; so was it here, the glory of God, the dignity of his Apostleship, which was que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned by his adversaries; the confirmation of the Faith of those Galatians, and of all Christians, as to the truth of the things asserted, did call upon <hi>Paul</hi> to swear. 3.

Immediately, or very soon after Christ's Death and Resurrection the preaching of the Gospel hath been marvelously blessed, in converting of numerous multitudes to Jesus Christ; yea, and more blessed than readily it hath been in any age of the Church since, whereof this is one evidence amongst many other, which are in the history of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, that at this time whereof <hi>Paul</hi> writeth, which is supposed to be the fourth or fifth year after Christ's As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension, there were several Christian Churches planted with Officers, and constituted according to the Rule of the Gospel, even in <hi>Judea</hi> amongst that people, who had hardened their hearts against the light, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 15. and rejected and crucified the Lord of life, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 15.

duties of a Christian-life, besides that God's design was to bring the Gospel once in credit and request with a blinded and idolatrous World at the first breaking-up thereof, and therefore the preaching of it was attended with more successe, and a richer blessing at that time than ordinarily it hath been since; <hi>Unto the Churches in Judea.</hi> 4.

We ought so to look upon notable changes which do fall out, whether in particular persons or publick societies, whether to the better or the worse, as that we may see somewhat of God manifested in them, either His Justice or Mercy, Wisdom or Power, some one Attribute of His or other, and so as we may give a suitable return, whether of fear or joy, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse or admiration, or of any other sanctified frame of spirit and holy performance, for which, such a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation calleth: for, those Christians in Judea, did so look upon this notable change in <hi>Paul,</hi> as to see God's mercy and power manifested in it, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly with joy, did give God thanks: so much is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in this, <hi>They glorified God in me,</hi> saith he. 9. Whensoever God is pleased to make a man instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, whether for our own particular good, or the more publick benefit of Christ's Church, as we would not be ingrateful unto the instruments themselves, <hi>Judg. 9. 16, &amp;c.</hi> so neither are we to rest upon them, ascribing the praise of what they do to them, but as we would not provoke the Lord to smite them, or at least to make

The more that God hath made it convincingly, and from clear evidences, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest to the conscience of His People, that a Work is owned and approven by Him, and hath drawn an acknowledgement from them to that purpose unto His own praise, it aggregeth the sin of those the more, who would afterwards question or deny that Work to be His: for, the Apostle's scope, in part, is, to aggrege the sin of his adversaries, who denied him to be an Apostle immediately sent from Jesus Christ, and that the Doctrine preached by him was the Truth of God, from this, that the Churches in <hi>Judea</hi> were convinced of the contrary, and had acknowledged so much long since, to the praise of God, by giving glory unto Him on <hi>Paul</hi>'s behalf, so that those Galatians and the false Apostles, were guilty of obscuring the glory of God, shining forth in his Conversion and Office, which was already acknowledged by others; <hi>And they glorified God in me.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>IN the first part of this Chapter, the Apostle addeth some further Evidences, that both his Office and Doctrine were divine. As first, They were such as might abide the censure of the chief Apostles, ver. 1, 2. Secondly, In the main thing controverted, which was about Circumcision, the other Apostles did joyn with him, in that they were not for, but against, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcizing of <hi>Titus,</hi> ver. 3. and for a weighty reason, ver. 4, 5. Thirdly, In that meeting, which was at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> the other Apostles did find nothing for which to challenge either him or his Doctrine, ver. 6. but upon the contrary, perceiving that <hi>Paul</hi> was called of God to be an Apostle, ver. 7. both from that divine assistance, wherewith he was accompanied, ver. 8. and from those Apostolick gifts wherewith he was endued, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged both him and <hi>Barnabas</hi> for Apostles, ver. 9. and all of them did part good friends; the collecting of some supply to the poor Jews among the Gentiles being recommended by the rest to <hi>Paul,</hi> ver. 10. Fourthly. He did rebuke <hi>Peter,</hi> when in his practice he declined from the Doctrine taught by <hi>Paul</hi> concerning the abrogation of the Ceremonial Law; and for any thing which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to the contrary, <hi>Peter</hi> in this debate, did yeeld to <hi>Paul,</hi> as having truth for him, to ver. 15.</p>
               <p>In the second part, because this dispute about the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial Law did fly very high (the false Apostles urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the observation of it, as meritorious of justification) therefore the Apostle turneth the force of the dispute against Justification by Works, and proveth by several Arguments, that we are justified by Faith only: As first, The believing Jews, who had as much reason to boast in their works as any, ver. 15. did renounce all confidence in them for Justification, ver. 16. Next, he preoccupieth an Objection, and sheweth that this Doctrine of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Faith without Works, giveth no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44180:33"/>
to sin, ver. 17. Because, 1. it did presse the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and destroying of sin, ver. 18. And, 2. though it did free them from the Law in several respects; yet not, as it is the rule of an holy life, ver. 19. Yea, 3. it doth tye the justified person more strictly to subdue sin, and lead an holy life, ver. 20. Lastly, he addeth a second Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to prove that we are justified by Faith only; because, if we were justified by Works, Free-grace and Christ's death should be uselesse, ver. 21.</p>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 1. THen fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem, with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also. 2. And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that Gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run in vain.</head>
                  <p>THe Apostle, first, mentioneth another journey of his to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> together with the time, when, and the companions with whom he went, and that extraordinary Instinct and Command from God, which moved him to undertake that journey, ver. 1, 2—And secondly, sheweth that when he came to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> he did privately communicate the Doctrine which he had preached among the Gentiles, to the most eminent of the Apostles; that by their subscribing unto it, as to the same with that which themselves did preach, his by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past and future labours might have the more successe, which (as it seemeth) was in hazard to be much retarded by the calumnies of his adversaries, affirming that the other Apostles did not approve of the Doctrine which he preached ver. -2. So that here is a fifth Evidence, that both his Doctrine and Office were divine; in that not only they were such as might abide the censure of the other Apostles, but also that he in the course of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry was singularly owned and approved of by God, as being directed by immediate revelation from Him.


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44180:33"/>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It pleaseth the Lord often, in mercy toward His Church, to preserve the lives of profitable Instruments for His Work for a long time, notwithstanding of all the endeavours of Men and Devils to the contrary: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> whose bloud was much thirsted after, and whose ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards were so many in several places, and from several hands, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26.) is yet preserved, in despight of all, in the free exercise of his Ministery, for the space at least of fourteen years together, even though the space of time here mentioned were to be reckoned from his first conversion, which yet some do reckon from the third year following, to wit, the time mentioned, Chap. 1. ver. 18. <hi>Then fourteen years after I went up, &amp;c.</hi> 2. It may be sometimes lawfull; yea, and necessary also, for a Minister, to go abroad from the Flock committed to his charge for a season, to wit, when and where the glory of God in defence of Truth, and in removal of what may mar the edification of the Lord's People, doth call him: for, <hi>Paul</hi> here taketh journey to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> leaving the Gentiles for a season, who were his own more proper Charge, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 15. that his consent in Doctrine with the other Apostles might be made evident, and so the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of those, to whom he did preach, more advanced; <hi>I went up to Jerusalem,</hi> saith he, and that <hi>lest I should run in vain. Jerusalem</hi> was seated on a mountain, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed with mountains, <hi>Psal.</hi> 125. 1, 2. whence it is said he went up to it. 3. It is the part of all, and especially of Christ's Ministers, the moe they are who mark their steps, and mis-represent their actions, to walk the more circumspectly; that so far as is possible, the mouth of adversaries may be stopped, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 12. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> being to make it evident that the other Apostles did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Doctrine preached by him, taketh with him <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> as two witnesses, according to the Law, sufficient <hi>(Deut.</hi> 17. 6.) to give testimony to the Apostles what Doctrine he had preached to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; and again to testifie to the Gentiles that consent, which was betwixt him and the Apostles; And this, lest


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44180:34"/>
his adversaries might have objected that he had lyed in both, or either of these; <hi>With Barnabas, and took with me Titus also.</hi> 4. Though we are not now to expect im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate revelations from God, whether for direction in one duty, or information of future events, such as were in use before the Canon of the Scripture was compleated, and the gift of extraordinary Prophecy had ceased, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. Yet seing the written Word is given unto us as a compleat Rule both for Faith <hi>(Joh.</hi> 20. 31.) and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17.) and as that which may abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly supply the defect or want of all those extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wayes, whereby God did make known His mind unto His People then, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. Therefore we ought to advise with God's Will, revealed in Scripture, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate all our actions, motions and journeys according to it, both for the lawfulnesse and expediency of what we undertake, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 9. that thus while we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God in all our wayes, He may direct our paths, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 6. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> advised with God in his journey: for, he <hi>went up by revelation;</hi> in place whereof, as said is, we have the written Word now. 5. How little ground the Papists have to infer from <hi>Paul</hi>'s practice here, that the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and particularly the Pope, the head thereof, is the supream Judge upon Earth of all questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons pertaining to Religion; and that all Preachers, after <hi>Paul</hi>'s example, should submit their Doctrine to be tried and judged by Peter's Successor, appeareth from this, passing-by other things, that <hi>Paul</hi> did not submit his Doctrine to be judged by <hi>Peter,</hi> or by any other, as if he had been either inferiour to them, or uncertain of the truth of that which he had preached: both which had been contrary to <hi>Paul</hi>'s scope, which, as said is, was to evidence, that both his Doctrine and Office were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God: Neither will the words bear further than that he did in a friendly and brotherly manner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them with the Doctrine preached by him, that their approbation being given unto it, the mouth of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries might be stopped: for, the word, rendred <hi>to


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44180:34"/>
communicate,</hi> signifieth to make any thing known to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in a familiar and friendly way, which in strict Law we are not bound to. See <hi>Act.</hi> 25. 14. where the same word is used: <hi>And communicated unto them.</hi> 6. Though the Minister of Jesus Christ is not to depend upon the approbation of others for confirmation of his Doctrine, as if he himself were uncertain of the truth thereof, before their testimony be added to it, chap. 1. ver. 8. Yet he is not to be so self-willed as to misregard what others do judge or think of what he preacheth, but ought to dimit himself so far, as, when there is necessity, he may give a friendly account unto others of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine preached by him; that so, if it be possible, mistakes arising through misinformation, may be removed, and the joynt consent of others to the truth of what he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth may be obtained: thus <hi>Paul,</hi> that he might gain their approbation, did <hi>communicate</hi> unto the Apostles <hi>that Gospel which be preached among the Gentiles.</hi> 7. When the approbation of others is sought after unto any action or deed, christian candor will, and ordinary prudence may teach a man to report the matter of fact truly, which he would have approved of; lest otherwise an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation surreptitiously required, and given upon misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and through mistake, may, upon a discovery, tend unto the informer's greater prejudice: for, <hi>Paul</hi> here, being to gain the approbation of the Apostles un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Doctrine, did give them a faithfull account of that same Doctrine which he had preached: <hi>I communicated that Doctrine which I preach among the Gentiles.</hi> 8. It ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in no small measure to uphold the credit of a man's Ministery against his adversaries, that in his Doctrine he hath been alwayes constant to himself, without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering or contradicting of himself in any thing, which he did ever vent for Truth; providing alwayes, that he be constant in the Truth: for, constancy in Error, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but obstinacy; and to retract an Error, is praise-worthy, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 7. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> that he may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stop the mouth of adversaries, sheweth the Doctrine


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44180:35"/>
which he did preach from the beginning of his Ministry, and whereof he did give an account to the Apostles, was the same which he did presently preach, while he saith, <hi>I communicated unto them the Gospel which I preach.</hi> It is a word of the present time. 9. As there are alwayes some in the Church of God, who for their place, graces or parts, have deservedly more of reputation than others: so christian prudence will teach a man to be so far from striving against the stream and current of common fame and universal applause, by labouring to discountenance or oppose without necessity, those who are so deservedly applauded unto; that he will endeavour, by giving due respect unto them, to receive approbation from them, whereby he may be in a better capacity to do good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, as being approved-of by such: for, <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> addresseth himself to those that were of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to wit, <hi>James, Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> (ver. 9.) who, though in their Apostolick Power they were but equal with the other Apostles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 5. Yet because of their age, gravity and some other respects, were generally more esteemed of, than the rest; and this he did for gaining of their approbation to his Office and Doctrine: that so he <hi>might not run in vain; I went up,</hi> saith he, <hi>to them that were of reputation, &amp;c.</hi> 10. There is much prudency required in the publick debating of controverted Truths in Religion, neither would it be ventured upon without necessity, and until all other private means for compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of differences be first assayed, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28. lest there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by unnecessary doubts and scruples be created in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar sort, who do often prove but unskilfull Judges in weighty and intricate Questions: thus <hi>Paul,</hi> while this controversie was but yet in its birth, did not make any publick noise of it, communicating the matter <hi>but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to them that were of reputation.</hi> 11. It is the part of a faithfull Minister, not only to preach the Gospel, and go about all the other parts of his Ministerial Office faithfully and painfully, and so as he may be approven unto the consciences of all, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5. but he must be


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44180:35"/>
also sollicitous about the successe of his pains towards those among whom he laboureth: for, so was <hi>Paul,</hi> who compareth his continual labours and painfulnesse in his Ministry to running in a race, and yet was carefull, lest he had run in vain, that is, lest his labours had wanted fruit among the hearers; for otherwise, and as to the end intended to be brought about by God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15, 16. or as to the promised reward <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 4. the work of a faithfull Minister is never in vain; <hi>Lest by any means I should run in vain,</hi> saith he. 12. Nothing marreth the good and successe of the Gospel among the hearers more than difference of judgments, and strites and debates about these differences among the eminent Preachers thereof: for, hereby are people carried unto schismes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. the Truth of God received with respect to persons, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. and atheism given way to by many, as resolving to believe nothing till Preachers agree among themselves, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 17. and many stumbling-blocks casten before people of all sorts by the venting of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, jealousies, animosities, and sometimes a spirit of revenge, which do usually accompany such divisions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20. for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth he endeavoured so much to get the joynt consent of the other Apostles, to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine preached by him, lest by the calumnies of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, who affirmed that <hi>Paul</hi> did differ from the rest, his preaching and other pains should have been uselesse; <hi>Lest by any means I should run, or had run in vain.</hi>

                  <p>HEre is a sixt Evidence, especially of the truth of his Doctrine, to wit, that in the point controverted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and his adversaries, the other Apostles did joyn with Paul, judging Circumcision to be a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and not of absolute necessity to Salvation, else they would have required <hi>Titus</hi> to be circumcised, which they did not, but received him in fellowship with them,


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44180:36"/>
though he was an uncircumcised Greek. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those controversies which did very early trouble the Christian Church, this, concerning the necessity of observing Circumcision, and the rest of those Levitical Ordinances, was one, which appeareth (as from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 1, 2. so) from this, where Paul, mentioning how the Apostles joyned with him in that controversie, which was betwixt him and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, doth give the instance in Circumcision; <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Titus was compelled to be circumcised.</hi> 2. Though Circumcision, and the rest of those Levitical Ordinances, were necessarly to be observed by vertue of a divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>Gen. 17. 10, &amp;c.</hi> and as the external part of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship then prescribed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. untill Christ should come in the flesh, and offer-up Himself a Sacrifice upon the Crosse, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 15. Yet, after he was come, they were abolished, and all necessity to observe them, through ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a divine precept, removed: the body being come, the shadow did evanish, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. the Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were then to be united in one People, and so that partition-wall was to be removed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 14, 15. the Church also then, to wit, under the New Testament, was bound to believe, and accordingly to professe, that Christ had already come in the flesh, &amp; offered-up a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and satisfactory Sacrifice to God, which was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconsistent with the observing of those Legal Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Sacrifices, which by vertue of divine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution did serve mainly for types and figures of Christ to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 5. and 9. 8, 9. for, because of those reasons, the Apostles did admit of <hi>Titus,</hi> a Greek, to their fellowship, not requiring him to be circumcised; <hi>But neither Titus was compelled to be circumcised.</hi> 3. It is not unlawful, but a duty incumbent to those who are in place, not only to injoyn attendance upon, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the external commanded duties of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but also by rebuke and other Church-censures, to constrain and urge those who are disobedient: for, <hi>Paul</hi> maketh the Apostles their not compelling of <hi>Titus</hi> to be


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44180:36"/>
circumcised, an evidence that they did not judge Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision at that time to be a part of commanded Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which imports, if they had thought otherwise, they would have compelled him to it (to wit) by the force of Church-censures; for they had not the power of the Magistrate to compel him by pecunial mulcts, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or such like; <hi>But neither Titus was compelled to be circumcised.</hi> 4. From this it followeth, that the Civil Magistrate may constrain men, by inflicting of corporal punishments, to go about the external duties of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Worship, in case that more gentle means do not prevail: for, if constraining by Ecclesiastick-censures be not unlawful, nor a tyranny over the consciences of men, constraining by Civil-censures, must be lawful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: now that men may be compelled by the former, as said is, is here supposed, while he saith, <hi>Neither Titus was compelled to be circumcised.</hi>

                  <p>HE giveth the reason, why <hi>Titus</hi> was not compelled to be circumcised, to wit, because some, called here <hi>false brethren,</hi> as having been urgers of the necessity of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, and of the other Levitical Ordinances, and were brought in to be members of the Church at <hi>Jerusalem</hi> by fraud, and through reason of their large pretences to piety, whereby they covered their heretical spirits for the time: for, so much doth the word, rendred <hi>unawares brought in,</hi> hold forth: these men, I say, had secretly conveyed themselves to that meeting, which <hi>Paul</hi> had with the other Apostles: and this of purpose to try if <hi>Paul</hi> would stand to the defence of that liberty from the Ceremonial Law before the Apostles, which he had preached among the Gentiles, as a part of Christ's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase:


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44180:37"/>
which if he had not done, but ceded to them in that one particular of circumcising <hi>Titus,</hi> then they would have triumphed over <hi>Paul,</hi> among the Gentiles, as if he had recanted before the Apostles; and so would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to bring back the Apostles, Gentiles, and the whole Church, to the bondage of the Ceremonial Law, ver. 4. Therefore was it that neither <hi>Paul,</hi> nor the other Apostles, would yeeld to the importunate desire of these false brethren, no not <hi>for an hour,</hi> that is, in using of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision but that once; and that because, this had been to subject the Apostles, and their Doctrine in the Truth controverted, to their adversaries; which the Apostles did resolutely withstand, that so the Doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel might remain sincere and uncorrupt among the Churches of Christ, and particularly among the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, ver. 5.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 4. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Though the Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was abolished by Christ's coming in the flesh; (See upon <hi>vek. 3. doct.</hi> 2.)

and unprofitable, but also deadly and damnable: thus the Apostles did not compel <hi>Titus</hi> to be circumcised; not as if the use of Circumcision had been at that time sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and in it self unlawfull and sinfull: for, <hi>Paul</hi> himself did circumcise <hi>Timothy</hi> upon grave and weighty consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, much about, and probably after that time, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 3. but because that false brethren, then present, would have made bad use of their doing otherwise, to the prejudice of the Gospel; <hi>And that because of false brethren, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Though the practice of the Ceremonial Law was for that time a thing in it self indifferent; Yet (which also holds, of all other things in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indifferent, 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 9, 10, &amp;c.)</hi> it might not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and upon all occasions lawfully, and without sin be practised, but the practice thereof was to be ruled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to charity and prudence; So that in the case of giving scandal by the neglect thereof to the weak and infirm, it was to be practised, as Paul did, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 3. but in case of hardening the obstinate, and confirming them in their opinion of its necessity to Salvation, and thereby giving the adversaries of Truth advantage against the Truth by the practice thereof, it was to be foreborn: for, the Apostles here, did not circumcise <hi>Titus, because of false brethren, brought in unawares,</hi> who would have taken ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from the practice of the Apostles, if they had circumcised him, <hi>to bring the Church of Christ again into bondage.</hi> 3. It hath been the Churches lot in all times and all places, to have a mixture of wheat and tares, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and unregenerate, godly and profane in it: even the Church which was planted and governed by the Apostles themselves, had false brethren: for, saith Paul, <hi>Because of false brethren unawares brought in.</hi> 4.

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical spirits are most active, vigilant, and so effronted as to ingyre themselves upon the most private Societies and Fellowships of others, if their presence may contribute any thing to advance their pernicious Errors: Thus those false brethren do intrude themselves upon that meeting, which <hi>Paul</hi> had with the other Apostles, though it was but of few, and private, ver. 2. <hi>Who came in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to spy out our liberty.</hi> 6.

Thus those <hi>false bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren came in privately to spy out their liberty,</hi> resolving whatever had been done, they should have ground from it to make Paul invidious; if <hi>Titus</hi> had been circumcised, they were ready to traduce him to the Gentiles, as a man who preached one thing to them, and practised the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary among the Apostles; if he had not been circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, they had ground to incense the Jews against him, as a contemner of that divine Ordinance. 7.

When things in themselves indifferent, are urged as necessary, and required as an evidence of our assent unto an untruth, or quitting of any part of Truth, in that case, which is indeed a case of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, the practice of a thing indifferent, is sinfull, and to be abstained from: for, so did the false brethren urge the Circumcision of <hi>Titus,</hi> even as an evidence of Paul's receding from the Doctrine of Christian Liberty, and therefore he obeyed them not; <hi>To whom we gave place, no not for an hour.</hi> 2. Though much may be done for comopsing of Church-differences, by using all meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and forbearance towards those who oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. acting joyntly with them in those things, wherein there is an harmonious agreement, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 16. holding off publick debates in those things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about the difference is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5. providing they be not of the most weighty and substantial Truths, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3. Yet we are not for peace's cause to quit the least part of Truth, whether by a formal denying of it, or doing that which in reason may and ought to be so expounded: thus <hi>Paul,</hi> who for lawfull ceding did become all things to all men, 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 19, &amp;c.</hi> would not give place by way of subjection, so as to yeeld the cause controverted to the adversaries, neither would he do any thing, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so little, and in its own nature indifferent, which

might be an evidence of his yeelding; <hi>To whom we gave place by subjection, no not for an hour:</hi> he would not use Circumcision, no not that once, he would not cede one hair breadth to them. 3. A Minister of Christ, when he is called to confesse and avow Truth, hath not only his own peace with God, and keeping of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to look unto, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 11, 12. but also the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his Flock, who will be much shaken or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the Truth, by his faint, or bold and faithfull confession: Thus Paul, in the present business, had an eye to the converted Gentiles, of whom were these Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians, lest their Faith had been shaken by his incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy; <hi>We gave not place,</hi> faith he, <hi>that the truth of the Gospel might continue with you.</hi> 4. It is not enough that people have the name of the Gospel among them, of some Truths of it being mixed with several Errors, but all, and especially Ministers, should endeavour to have the Gospel in purity and integrity, free from any mixture of contrary Errors; for, a little leaven (to which Error is compared, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 12.) leaveneth the whole lump. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6.

                  <p>FOlloweth a seventh Evidence, that both Paul's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Office were divine, containing the event of that meeting which he had with the Apostles, in three things; the first whereof, is in this Verse, to wit, that <hi>of these,</hi> or from those who were looked upon as chief among the Apostles, of whom Paul's adversaries did boast, as if they had been his superiours, <hi>Paul had learned nothing</hi> (which last words, or some such like, are to be supplied for making out the sentence) and because their


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44180:39"/>
personal prerogatives such as that they had seen Christ in the flesh, were Apostles, when he was a persecutor, might have been objected to his prejudice; he sheweth these were not to be taken notice of by him, neither would be taken notice of by God, whose judgment is not swayed by any thing which is extrinsecal, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to the cause in hand; and therefore their being Apostles before him, would not make his Office or Doctrine more uncertain, or lesse divine than theirs; seing he was an Apostle now, aswell as they, and his Doctrine such as could not be questioned by themselves: for, after that conference, wherein he related to them the Gospel preached by him, they corrected nothing and added nothing to what he had said, but approved all. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is nothing contrary to, but agreeth very well with Christians modesty and humility, for a man to speak to his own commendation in some cases; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he laboureth under reproach, and when the honour of God and the Gospel do also suffer with him: for, <hi>Paul</hi> avoweth that he learned nothing from the chief Apostles, and was not in any thing inferiour to them; because if he had yeelded to the contrary, his adversaries would presently have retorted that he was no Apostle, but, at the most, an ordinary Preacher, and his Doctrine in time bypast had been erroneous; <hi>But of these,</hi> or from those, <hi>who seemed to be somewhat,</hi> supply (for making out the sense) <hi>I learned nothing;</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> concealeth in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, it being that part of the phrase which should have expressed his praise most, and leaveth it to be supplied by the reader from the scope of the purpose, and from the like expression in the close of the verse: The like form of speaking is used, 1 <hi>Chron. 4. 10. Oh that thou wouldest, &amp;c.</hi> or, <hi>If thou wouldest.</hi> 2. It is not unusual for heretical spirits, to cry-up some of Christ's faithfull Ministers above the rest, and so to have the persons of men in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; and this not from any respect to them, but for their own advantage, <hi>Jude,</hi> ver. -16. as hereby rendring those, whom they so cry-up, suspect of favouring their


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44180:40"/>
Error, and bearing down the rest with the pretended shew of their authority: Thus <hi>Paul's</hi> adversaries did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> as much preferible to him, because of their personal prerogatives above him, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from <hi>Pauls</hi> labouring so much to prove that they were no wayes superiour to him, and to take off any prejudice which might rise against himself from their personal prerogatives of seeing Christ in the flesh, and being Apostles before him; <hi>But from those I learned no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, whosoever they were, &amp;c.</hi> 3. In our esteem of persons and things, our judgment ought not to be ruled by the approbation of men, so as to put a price upon every thing which is commonly esteemed of among men, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 15. but by the approbation of God, so that every thing may have more or lesse weight with us according as He estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of it: Thus Paul regarded not the personal prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of the other Apostles, as bearing any weight in the present businesse, because God regarded them not; <hi>It maketh no matter to me, God accepteth no man's person.</hi> 4. The Lord, in passing judgement upon persons or things, is not swayed with any thing which is extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and belongeth not unto the cause whereabout He judgeth: He respecteth not the person of man, that is, He will not approve or disapprove of a man's cause for his person, if it be not otherwise worthy of approbation or reproof; because most frequently a man's cause and person come under different considerations: for, saith he, <hi>God accepteth of no mans person:</hi> whereby in this place is meaned, that the personall prerogatives of the other Apostles did not bear weight with God to make <hi>Paul's</hi> Office or Doctrine more uncertain, and lesse divine than theirs; seing whatever other use those prerogatives did serve for; Yet they appertained nothing to the present cause. 5. Though some of Christ's faithfull Servants, may be cryed-up by light wits, or heretical spirits, to the down-bearing of the deserved estimation of others; Yet so far ought they themselves to be from being transported with groundlesse applause, and from despising those


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44180:40"/>
others, beyond whom they are so much esteemed of, that they are to bear-up their credit so much the more by withholding no approbation of theirs from them which is their due, although they should thereby contradict their own flatterers, and make them lyars: for, those Apostles, who were so much cryed-up by the false bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to Paul's prejudice, did throughly approve his Doctrine, declaring him to be an orthodox Preacher and an Apostle of Jesus Christ as well as themselves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what his adversaries and their flatterers affirmed of him; <hi>In conference they added nothing to me:</hi> and, ver. 9. <hi>They gave me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship.</hi>

And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, perceived the Grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the Heathen, and they unto the Circumcision.</head>
                  <p>HEre is a second part of the event of that Meeting at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> to wit, that when the Apostles, <hi>James, Cephas,</hi> (that is, <hi>Peter,</hi> Joh. 1. 42.) and <hi>John</hi> had by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain evidences found that the Gospel of the Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, or the Apostolick-office to preach the Gospel among the uncircumcised Gentiles, was concredited by God to <hi>Paul</hi> as well as the Gospel of Circumcision, or the Apostolick-office to preach the Gospel among the circumcised Jews, was committed unto <hi>Peter,</hi> ver. 7. which they did gather from this, that the like divine assistance, blessing and successe, did accompany the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours both of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> towards their respective Charges, and so their Office behoved to be equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, ver. 8. and when those three Apostles (who were


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44180:41"/>
commonly, and no lesse deservedly, reputed pillars of the Church, as being, under God, the upholders of it by their Ministry, gifts, diligence and fidelity) had seen the <hi>grace,</hi> or gifts, both ordinary and extraordinary, which were bestowed by God upon <hi>Paul,</hi> fitting him every way for the Apostolick-office, they did without more ado ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge both <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> for their Collegues or fellow-Apostles, giving them the right hand in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the same, as also of their mutual agreement in dividing of their Charge, so as that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> should go on to discharge their Apostolick-office among the Gentiles, and the other three among the Jews, vet. 9. which paction is nothing contrary to what is held forth, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 7. for, <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh not there, that his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Charge was to preach unto the Gentiles, but of that one act of his, mentioned <hi>Act.</hi> 10. whereby he was at one time imployed to preach to them at the first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their conversion: All which, doth evidence that <hi>Paul</hi> was an Apostle, immediately called, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be such by the other Apostles. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. This Scripture doth many wayes refute that dream of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists concerning <hi>Peter's</hi> primacy, or supremacy over the rest of the Apostles, and over the Catholick Church, and of the Pope's succeeding to <hi>Peter</hi> in that supposed illimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted trust: for, 1. the Apostle's drift in all this, is, to shew that he was every way equal with <hi>Peter,</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, and no wayes inferiour unto them, and that he was acknowledged to be so by <hi>Peter</hi> himself; so that <hi>Peter</hi> was not supream over all: <hi>When they saw that the Gospel of uncircumcision was committed unto me, &amp;c. 2. Paul</hi> doth here compare himself mainly and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with <hi>Peter,</hi> while he expresseth him by name, even when he is speaking of these things, which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to <hi>Peter</hi> with the other two, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> as that the Gospel of Circumcision was committed to <hi>Peter,</hi> and this because it seemeth <hi>Paul</hi> s adversaries did mainly cry-up <hi>Peter,</hi> as superiour to him; so that this of <hi>Peter's</hi> primacy above the other Apostles hath been an old plea,


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44180:41"/>
but ill grounded, and expresly confuted by <hi>Paul</hi> in this place; <hi>As the Gospel of Circumcision was committed unto Peter.</hi> 3. We find here a divine Ordinance, that <hi>Peter</hi> should exercise his Office among the Jews, as their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, of which Ordinance they can produce no change; and so if the Pope plead to be <hi>Peter's</hi> successor, he must challenge a superiority over the Jews, and hath nothing to do with us; <hi>As the Gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter. 4. Paul,</hi> by vertue of the same divine Ordinance, was to exercise his Office among the Gentiles, as their Apostle, and endued with the same Authority in all points, which <hi>Peter</hi> had over the Jews; and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> was not supream: But if the Pope give-out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for universal Pastor over the whole World, he must not plead his succession to <hi>Peter</hi> so much as to <hi>Paul,</hi> who had the <hi>Gospel of the Uncircumcision committed to him:</hi> which was a Charge extending almost to all the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal World. 5. While there is a question here of dignity anent the Apostles, <hi>James</hi> is first named before <hi>Peter,</hi> as being of eminent Authority among the Apostles, who was President at the Council of <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> for, he spake last, and concluded all, <hi>Act. 15. 13, &amp;c.</hi> to whom <hi>Paul</hi> did betake himself, and with whom all the Elders did conveen in a matter of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not with <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 21. 18. so that <hi>James</hi> hath rather been supream than <hi>Peter;</hi> at least, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, the first naming of <hi>Peter</hi> in other places, <hi>(Mat. 10. 2. Mark</hi> 3. 16.) is no sufficient ground whereon to build his supremacy: <hi>And when James, Cephas, and John. 6. Peter</hi> was at this time at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and without doubt had not yet seen <hi>Rome,</hi> seventeen years at least after Christ's Resurrection, ver. 1. compared with chap. 1. ver. 18. Yea, neither was he at <hi>Rome</hi> a long time after this, when <hi>Paul</hi> was there a prisoner, <hi>Col. 4. 11. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 16. How then could he have sitten Bishop at <hi>Rome</hi> twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five years before his death? as is alleaged for one main ground, upon which the Popes succession to <hi>Peter,</hi> as universal Bishop over the whole World, is founded:


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44180:42"/>
                     <hi>And when James, Cephas and John perceived.</hi> 7. There is here a solemn and mutual agreement, that <hi>Paul,</hi> and not <hi>Peter,</hi> should be the Apostle of the Gentiles: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, How could <hi>Peter</hi> have been twenty five years Bishop at <hi>Rome,</hi> except he had violated his solemn paction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by giving his hand, which were most absurd once to mention? <hi>They gave the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the Heathen. Doct.</hi> 2. The more we wait upon God for His Call and Direction to our Undertaking, we have ground to expect, that the more of successe and of a blessing will accompany them: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> who did not undertake this journey to <hi>Jerusalem</hi> without the Call of God, ver. 2. hath all things suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with him according to his hearts wish; so that not only the Apostles, did not condemn the Doctrine preached by him, ver. 6. but, on the contrary, gave him their approbation, acknowledging him for their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league and fellow-Apostle, whereby the mouthes of his adversaries might have been fully stopped: <hi>But contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi> for, so are the words to be constructed, all that which interveeneth being the reason which moved <hi>James, Peter,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to do what they did. <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. The Note which ariseth from dividing of the Charge of Jews and Gentiles betwixt <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> is at large, <hi>Col. 1. 25. doct. 3. Doct.</hi> 4. The Office of preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, is a special Trust, whereby a rich treasure of saving Truths (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7.) is concredited to weak men, who must be answerable to God how they keep, maintain and dispense that Treasure for the good of souls: hence he saith, <hi>the Gospel was committed,</hi> or, as a rich Treasure, intrusted to him; <hi>The Gospel of the Uncircumcision was committed unto me.</hi> 5. It is not the pains of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 4. or any vertue which is in the Word preached, as of it self, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. from whence the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of the Ministry among a People floweth, but from the effectual working of the Spirit of God, whereby He effectually worketh that which the Word doth presse


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44180:42"/>
upon us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. for, <hi>Paul</hi> ascribeth the successe both of his own and <hi>Peter's</hi> Ministry to this; <hi>He that wrought effectually in Peter, the same was mighty in me.</hi> 6. The power with which the Lord accompanieth His Word towards those whom he intendeth to convert by it, is most efficacious and such as cannot be resisted, but breaketh through and taketh away whatever doth op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it; <hi>He that wrought effectually:</hi> the word signifieth to work with pith and energy, and frequently it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to work with irresistible efficacy. 7. Where a Ministers pains are much blessed of God, for the turning of many souls to God, and where a man is endued with gifts and parts for the Ministerial Calling, it is a real testimony, and speaking-evidence of that man's calling from God: for, from this do they gather, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of Uncircumcision was committed to <hi>Paul,</hi> because his Ministry was powerfull among the Gentiles, and endued with gifts fitting him every way for the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Office: for, saith he, <hi>the same was mighty in me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Gentiles,</hi> and <hi>they perceived the Grace which was given unto me.</hi> 8.

As the Ministers of Jesus Christ are bound to reprove sin and vice; so they are to reprove it, first, with much boldnesse and resolution, not faintly, as if they were more feared for the offence of man, than grieved for the dishonour of God: so <hi>Paul,</hi> in reproving <hi>Peter,

withstood him:</hi> In the Original, it is a military word, and signifieth to stand against, whether it be by force of arms, or arguments: it is a word of defiance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating, as it were, hand to hand, face to face, and foot to foot, not yeelding a hair breadth to the adversary, <hi>Rom. 13. 2.

Thirdly, with certainty and knowledge of the deed reproved, both for the truth of the fact, and the vicious quality of it: <hi>Paul</hi> before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, was assured of both these; <hi>Because he was to be blamed,</hi> saith he. <hi>Doct.</hi> 3.

                  <p>NExt, the Apostle enlargeth what he had briefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded: and, first, he sheweth <hi>Peter's</hi> sin for which he was reproved, to wit, that whereas before some Jews did come from <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> where the Apostle <hi>James</hi> had his residence, <hi>Peter</hi> did keep fellowship with the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Gentiles, and had eaten freely with them, (wherein he did right according to the Doctrine of Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, by which all differences of meats, and betwixt Jew and Gentile, are removed under the New Testament, as Peter himself was instructed by vision, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. 9.) but when those Jews did come, he did separate from the Gentiles, as if it had been unlawful to eat with them, and this through fear of offending those forementioned Jews, who were most tenacious of the Ceremonial Law, ver. 12. by which bad example of Peter's, the other Jews, which were at <hi>Antioch,</hi> were moved to withdraw from the Gentiles, as if it had been unlawfull to have intire fellowship with them; Yea, and <hi>Barnabas</hi> also did the like, ver. 13. From whence we <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Such influence have circumstances upon our actions, that though an action, considered simply and in it self, be not sinfull; Yet, by reason of accompanying circumstances, it may become exceeding sinfull: for, the exceeding sinfulnesse


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44180:45"/>
of Peter's action, for which he was here reproved, did not consist in his simple abstinence from certain kinds of meats, to eschew the offence of the weak; for, <hi>Paul</hi> did something like to this himself, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 3. and 21. 26. but in the circumstances which did accompany that his abstenance, which will appear by pointing at some of those circumstances, whereby also the Text will be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cleared; as first, That he did withdraw from the Gentiles in eating, as if they had been no Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, with whom it was lawfull to have intire fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; <hi>He withdrew, and separated himself.</hi> Secondly, That he abstained not among the Jews at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which had been more tolerable, but at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where, a little before, he had openly done the contrary, in using his Christian Liberty: for, <hi>before he did eat with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles; but when they were come, he withdrew.</hi> Thirdly, That he did withdraw, not as if it had been a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to have done so, or otherwise, and therefore would do it for a time to gain the Jews; but as if it had been a thing in it self sinful to have eaten with them, contrary to what himself knew, and was informed of by the heavenly vision; and therefore it is called dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation in him, while it is said, <hi>The other Jews dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with him likewise.</hi> Fourthly, That his abstinence was not for gaining of the weak Jews, whom he might afterwards have informed of the abrogation of these Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Ordinances, but from fear of losing esteem with, and incurring the hatred of, those who were spying-out their liberty, and would doubtlesse make bad use of that his abstinence, for confirming themselves in, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over others to, their Errors; <hi>Fearing them which were of the Circumcision.</hi> Fiftly, That by his example he did hurt to the other Jews, who were beginning to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed concerning the abrogation of the Ceremonial Law, and in evidence of it, had been eating with the Gentiles; but now, by this practice of Peter's, did again drink-in their former error; <hi>And the other Jews dissembled likewise.</hi> Sixtly, This practice of his (as is clear from


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44180:46"/>
the following 14. verse) did tend to force the Christian Gentiles to take on the yoke of the Ceremonial Law, (which had been most sinfull in them, they being never under it) as they would not have been debarred from the fellowship of Peter, and of the Church; <hi>Why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as the Jews?</hi> And, seventhly, He hereby gave a great dash to Paul's Doctrine, and the Doctrine of the Gospel concerning Christian Liberty, and the abrogation of the Ceremonial Law; for, his practice did speak as much, as if it had been yet in force; <hi>He withdrew and separated himself, and the other Jews dissembled likewise. Doct.</hi> 2. So weak and unconstant are the best of men, that, being left to themselves, the least blast of tentation will make them break off the course of doing-well in the very midst, and, without respect had either to conscience or credit, openly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert it: for, Peter having begun well in the use of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Liberty, by eating with the Gentiles, giveth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of great levity, in that for fear of man's offence he did presently slip from it; <hi>Before that certain came from</hi> James, <hi>he did eat with the Gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew.</hi> 3. To separate from, and to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>off communion with, a true Church, and the received Members thereof, is such an act as cannot be attempted without sin, no not though hereby we could eschew the offence and stumbling of many: for, this was it that made Peter blame-worthy, even his separating from the Church of the Gentiles, as if it had been unlawful to keep communion with them, notwithstanding the Jews would have been offended if he had done otherwise; <hi>He withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the Circumcision.</hi> 4. It is of great concernment to men of grace and parts, who are in publick place, and do enjoy the applause of many, to be both men of courage, and self-denyed spirits; and even when they enjoy the applause of all, to be dead and dying to it; lest, if they conceit more of it than they ought, through their fleshly fear of losing applause and incurring hatred from men,


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44180:46"/>
they venture upon the dishonour of God: for, even <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> fearing too much his losse of esteem among the Jews, did sin against the Lord; <hi>He withdrew and separated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, fearing them which were of the Circumcision,</hi> or the Jews, who are frequently so designed. 5. As good men sometimes, under the fit of a violent tentation, will in practice condemn that which in their judgment they do approve; so for any to sin thus against their light, is an high aggravation of their guilt: for, this is the dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation wherewith <hi>Peter</hi> is charged, and whereby his sin is here aggreged: by his practice he pretended, that fellowship with the Christian Gentiles was unlawfull, in the contrary whereof, he was instructed by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly vision, <hi>Act. 11. 9. And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him.</hi> 6. Of so great force is the bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of men, eminent, gracious and learned, that not only the weak and infirm, but even those who are strong, and richly endued both with grace and parts, will sometimes be corrupted by it: It is usual for us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares to esteem of such, as of somewhat more than men, and being once that far engaged in our esteem of them, we do not so narrowly examine their actions, as we would of other men, Hence all is taken for current that cometh from them: thus not only the vulgar Jews, but even <hi>Barnabas</hi> himself, an eminent Apostle, <hi>(Act.</hi> 13. 1, 2.) was carried away with <hi>Peter's</hi> bad example; <hi>And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him, insomuch that Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A speat and inundation of evil examples, though even held forth by private Christians, especially if they be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise pious, is so impetuous, and of such force, to carry others along in their practice with it; that even the very best of men can very hardly stand out against it: for, <hi>Barnabas</hi> his dissimulation, is ascribed not only to <hi>Peter's</hi> bad example, but also, if not mainly, to that influence

It is of great concernment unto all Superiours, and chiefly those who are eminent for piety and parts, to take diligent heed left they give bad example unto others; and this not only because of what is partly expressed in the two former Doctrines, but also because the sins of others, which are occasioned by the evil example of any, will be justly charged upon him whose bad example they do follow: for, the dissimulation of the Jews and <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas,</hi> is mentioned as an aggravation of <hi>Peter's</hi> sin, which had such dreadfull consequences; <hi>And the other Jews dissembled likewise.</hi>

rebukes; that hereby the publick scandal may be removed, and others may be scared from taking encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from those sins to do the like, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20. Thus, because <hi>Peter</hi> did sin publickly before all, <hi>Paul,</hi> by way of reproof, <hi>said unto</hi> Peter <hi>before them all.</hi> 5. Though the binding power of the Ceremonial Law was abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated at Christ's death, and the practice thereof, in some things at least, left as a thing lawful, and in it self indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent unto all for a time after that, (See ver. 4. doct. 1.) Yet the observation thereof, even for that time, was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed with more for the Jews sake, and was more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable in them who were born and educated under the binding power of that yoke, than in the Gentiles, to whom that Law was never given, and so were to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, or any part of it, only in case of scandalizing the weak Jews by their neglecting of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 20, 21. This difference betwixt Jew and Gentile, as to the practice of the Ceremonial Law, is gathered from the Apostle's way of arguing with <hi>Peter,</hi> from the lesse to the more; <hi>If thou, being a Jew, livest not as do the Jews,</hi> to wit, in observing the Ceremonial Law, <hi>why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</hi> Whereby he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, that the observation of these Ceremonies was more to be comported with in the Jews than in the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. 6. It is a piece of unreasonable absurdity in a Minister, for which he can give no accompt neither to God nor man, to take liberty of practice to himself in those things which he doth condemn in others, and the contrary of which he doth either by his Doctrine or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample at other times constrain them to, as appeareth from the question here propounded, <hi>If thou livest not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</hi> as if he had said, Thou can neither answer to God nor man for it. 7. It is no small sin for Superiours to bind where the Lord hath left free, by urging upon their Inferiours the observing of a thing, in its own nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, as necessary; except it be in these cases where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Lord, by those circumstances which do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany

it, doth point it out as necessary; such are the cases of scandal, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28, 29. and contempt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40. for, hereby mainly is Peter's sin aggreged, that he did compel the Gentiles to the necessary observation of the Ceremonial Law, though the use of it was at that time indifferent; <hi>Why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</hi> 8. In the primitive times of the Christian Church, the People of God did wonderfully subject themselves to the Ministry of the Word in the hand of His Servants, and much more than People now do: for if the actions of the Apostles compelled men to do this or that, as Peter's action did compel the Gentiles, what then did their Doctrine and heavenly Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? <hi>Why compellest thou the Gentiles, &amp;c.?</hi>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44180:49"/>
of the Apostles dispute, together with the state of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent question, and the sense and force of those arguments which he maketh use of to confirm the Truth in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, We shall premit three things in general, First, the Apostle's adversaries erred in two things mainly, 1. they urged the rigid observation of the Ceremonial Law, as necessary by vertue of a divine Precept standing yet in force, as may be gathered from the Apostle's reasoning, chap. 3. 19, 25. and chap. 4. 3, 4, 5. 2. As Seducers wax worse and worse, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13. so they went higher, and urged the observation of these Ceremonies, as that whereby, joyntly at least with Christ, sinners are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God, as appeareth from chap. 2. 16, 21. and 3. 11. Now the Apostle addresseth himself to the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of both those Errors: and because the latter Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, to wit, That sinners are justified by their obedience to the Law, is most dangerous, therefore he doth refute it first, and apart, to ver. 19. chap. 3. And next, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futeth that first Error joyntly with the other, proving there was no necessity at all of observing the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, or any part of that Mosaical Pedagogie, now under the New Testament, and that it ought not now to be observed, the date prefixed by God for the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it being already expired, to ver. 13. chap. 5. Secondly, while the Apostle, all-along this dispute, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth we are justified, or that righteousnesse and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance do come by the Law, he understandeth by the <hi>Law,</hi> not the whole Doctrine delivered by <hi>Moses</hi> upon Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> for, the <hi>Law,</hi> being so taken, was a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, as appeareth from the Preface and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Decalogue, and from the Ceremonial Law, which shadowed forth Christ and remission of sins through Him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 4, 8, 9. so that Believers under the Old Testament may be said to have been justified, and to have had righteousnesse by the Law in this sense: for, it implyeth no further than that they were justified according to the tenour of the Covenant of Grace, as it was wrapped-up in that ancient legal dispensation. The


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44180:49"/>
Apostle therefore takes the <hi>Law</hi> more strictly, and, in the sense of his adversaries, for the mere precepts and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Law, as it requires perfect obedience, and curseth those who have it not, abstracting from Christ, and Grace, which were held forth (though but obscure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) in it; for, in that sense his adversaries maintained justification by the Law, and therefore the Apostle while he refuteth justification by the Law, must be understood to speak of the Law in the same sense also, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he clearly expresseth, while he explaineth his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by denying we are justified by the works of the Law, vers. 16. and chap. 3. 5, 10. Thirdly, that the Apostle may strike at the root of this their most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Error of Justification by Works, he excludeth all Works in general, not only those of the Ceremonial Law, but the Works also of the Moral Law; Yea, and all Works of ours whatsoever, from having influence upon Justification: for, as shall be observed in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it self, the Arguments used by the Apostle to prove that we are not justified by Works, are applicable to the Moral Law equally, if not more than to the Ceremonial Law; Yea, and do exclude the Works of the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as well as of the Unregenerate: Besides, it is sure that none professing the Name of Christ, as the Apostle's adversaries did, would have urged the naked external performance of those Ceremonies, as having influence upon Justification, except as it was conjoyned with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal love to God and our neighbour, commanded by the Moral Law, and signified, expressed, and some one way or other advanced by those outward performances: Neither is it conceivable how they, maintaining a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Faith in Christ, could imagine that any Works whatsoever, whether done in obedience to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law, or to the Moral being such Works only as are done by the power of Nature and strength of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, without the Grace of Christ, should have justified a sinner, and made him righteous before God; So that if <hi>Paul</hi> in this Dispute had excluded from Justification


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44180:50"/>
only the external Works of the Ceremonial Law, and not the Works of the Moral Law also, or only all Works whatsoever flowing from the strength of Nature, or, the Works of the Unregenerate, and not the Works of the Regenerate also, which are performed by the Grace of Christ, he should have quite mistaken the question, and not at all refuted his adversaries. It doth therefore of necessity follow, that the Apostle reasoneth against Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by Works, done in obedience to the Law in general, and that he affirmeth we are justified only by Faith in opposition unto all Works of ours whatsoever; which he proveth by two Arguments in this Chapter. First, because he himself and other Jews, who, though they enjoyed by birth and education (as being born Members of the visible Church) many priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Gentiles, who were profane sinners and born aliens from God; and therefore might have expected to be justified by their good works, if so any could be justified that way; Yet they (knowing perfectly that all their Works, done in obedience to the Law, could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver justifie or make them righteous before God, and that only Faith in Christ would make them so righteous) even they, who had as much reason to boast of their Works as any other, had renounced all confidence in their Works, and betaken themselves only to Faith in Jesus Christ for Justification, and hereby he leaveth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them to gather what madnesse it were for those Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, or any other of the Gentiles, to rely upon the Works of the Law, so as to be justified by them; which he further confirmeth, as it seemeth, from <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. -2. affirming that no flesh, whether Jew or Gentile, shall be justified, to wit, by the Works of the Law, which is here supplyed by the Apostle, without adding to the sense. The like addition of words for explication, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wronging the sense, is frequently used in the New Testament, where Scriptures are cited out of the Old, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 10. compared with <hi>Deut. 6. 13. Heb.</hi> 10. 5. compared with <hi>Psal. 140. 7. Doct.</hi> 1. Though every


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44180:50"/>
man by nature, is a childe of wrath and enemy to God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. as <hi>Nature</hi> speaketh that which is born with us, and conveyed unto us from our parents by carnal gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 5. Yet all those who are born within the visible Church, have a right by nature unto Church-priviledges and to enjoy the external means of Grace and Salvation as <hi>Nature</hi> speaketh that which is born with us, not of natural generation, but of free-grace, which God is pleased to honour His People with, and to deny unto others: for, the Apostle here calleth himself and others come of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who had been from that time upwards the only visible Church, <hi>Psal. 147. 19, 20. Jews by nature,</hi> wherby he doth not simply design them to be men of such a Nation; for, that could make nothing to the Apostle's scope in the present argument, besides that the <hi>Jew</hi> is here opposed to <hi>sinners of the Gentiles;</hi> so it must relate some way to their spiritual state, neither doth it import that much, as if they had inherent holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and were altogether sinlesse by nature: for, this is contradicted by Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 9. So the meaning must be, that from their birth, and because of God's love to them in making choice of them to be a Church to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self above all Nations, <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 6. they were (externally at least) in covenant with God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 11. whereby they had a right to all Church-priviledges, as of being under God's special care and government, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4. 5, 6. of enjoying the ordinary means of Salvation, as they were capable of them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 12. And as it was with the Jews then, so is it with those that are born within the visible Church now: they are <hi>Christians</hi> by birth, to wit, in the sense presently mentioned: for, the visible Church under the New Testament, and among the Gentiles, hath succeeded to those priviledges, which were enjoyed by the Church under the Old, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. So that even young Infants are expresly called <hi>holy, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 14. to wit, with an external and federal holinesse: and on this account they have right to Baptism, the seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which no Infidel can claim, <hi>Act. 2. 38, 39. We


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44180:51"/>
who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles.</hi> 2. The Doctrine of free Justification by Faith in Jesus Christ, and not by Works, was early opposed by Satan and heretical spirits, and no Doctrine so much opposed as it was, and that because no Truth is more necessary to be keeped pure than this is, it being such a Truth as if it be keeped pure, several other Truths are keeped pure also; and if it fall, many other Truths do also fall with it: Therefore is it that Satan did so much labour, and yet laboureth to bear it down: for, the defacing of this Truth was mainly aimed at by the false Apostles among those Galatians, as appeareth from the Apostle his set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of himself so much to defend it; <hi>That we might be justified by the Faith of Christ, and not by the Works of the Law,</hi> saith he. 3. Concerning the nature of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we learn several things; First, That Justification is not the Lord's making one, who was before unjust, to be just by working of habitual and inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse in him, as the Papists do take it, confounding Justification and Sanctification, contrary to Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. But it is a judicial action, whereby the Lord absolveth the sinner from death and wrath, and adjudgeth him to life eternal: for, the word expressing this grace here, is a judicial word taken from Courts of Justice, which, being attributed to the Judge, is opposed to <hi>condemn, Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. and so signifieth to absolve, and give sentence: neither doth the Scripture ever make use of this word in any other sense, where the justification of a sinner before God is spoken of; <hi>Knowing that a man is not justified, &amp;c. and that we might be justified.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The ground whereupon, and the cause for which sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are thus justified or absolved from wrath, and adjudged to life eternal, is not any Works which they do in obedience to the Law of God, whether Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial or Moral: for, <hi>Works</hi> are excluded, while he saith, <hi>A man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jesus Christ;</hi> it is not, <hi>except by the Faith, &amp;c.</hi> as if Works were only excluded, when Faith is not joyned


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44180:51"/>
with them, as the Papists do read it; but the word is well turned here by the adversative particle, <hi>But,</hi> as it is frequently in Scripture. See chap. 1. 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 4. So that Works are simply excluded, and Faith established, as only having hand in this businesss: which is more plainly asserted afterwards; <hi>That we might be justified by the Faith of Christ, and not by the Works of the Law:</hi> by which are meaned both the Works of the Moral and Ceremonial Law, as we cleared in the Exposition. Thirdly, The Works which are excluded from having hand in Justification, are not only those which are done before conversion, but also which follow after, and flow from the working of God's Spirit in us; even those Works are imperfect, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6. and so cannot make us compleatly righteous, and we do owe them to God in the mean time, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 10. and so they cannot satisfie divine Justice for the failings of the bypast time, They are the work of God's Spirit in us, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 13. and so we can merit nothing at God's hand by them: for, He excludeth the Works of the Law in general; now the good Works of the Regenerate are such, as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Law, and done in obedience to the Law, besides that those false Apostles did admit a mixture of Faith and Works in Justification, so that if the Apostle had not excluded even Works which flow from Faith, they might have quickly agreed upon the point; <hi>Man is not justified by the Works of the Law.</hi> Fourthly, That, through vertue whereof we are thus justified and absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by God, is the righteousnesse of Jesus Christ, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Himself, while He was here on Earth, both in doing what we should have done, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 15. and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering what we ought to have suffered, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. which righteousnesse is not inherent in us, but imputed to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17, 18, 19. as the sum of Money paid by the Cautioner, standeth good in Law for the principal Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, So we are said to be <hi>justified by the Faith of Christ,</hi> or Faith in Jesus Christ, as laying hold upon His righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which is imputed to us, as said is, and by which


<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44180:52"/>
only we are made righteous. Fifthly, Though Faith be not alone in the person justified, but is ever accompanied with all other saving graces; for, it worketh by Love, chap. 5. 7. Yet Faith is that only grace which hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in our Justification: for, all other Works, even those that flow from Grace, are excluded, and only Faith admitted to have hand in this businesse; <hi>A man is not justified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jesus Christ,</hi> and, <hi>that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ, and not by the Works of the Law.</hi> Sixthly, Faith hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon our justification, not as it is a Work, or because of any worth which is in it self, more than in other graces, or, as if the act of believing, whether it alone, or joyntly with other graces, were imputed unto us for righteousnesse, but only as it layeth hold on Jesus Christ, and giveth us a right to His Righteousnesse, through the merit whereof alone we are justified: for, it is <hi>by the Faith of Jesus Christ,</hi> or, Faith receiving <hi>(Joh.</hi> 1. 12.) and resting on Jesus Christ <hi>(Isa.</hi> 26. 3, 4.) that we are justified; besides that all Works of the Law, or commanded by the Law, are here excluded, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence Faith it self, as it is a work, is excluded also. Seventhly, This way of Justification by Free-grace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of us for the Righteousnesse of Jesus Christ, and not because of our own worth, is common to all who ever were, are, or shall be justified, whether good or bad: the most eminent and best of men must quit the conceipt of their own righteousnesse, and rely upon Him who justifieth the ungodly by Faith: for, even those who <hi>were Jews by nature, Paul</hi> and the other Apostles, betook themselves to this way, <hi>Even we</hi> (saith he) <hi>have believed in Jesus Christ,</hi> and the Scripture cited by <hi>Paul,</hi> speaketh universally of all; <hi>For by the Works of the Law shall no flesh be justified.</hi> Eightly Before man be justified through vertue of this imputed Righteousnesse, he must first be convinced of his own utter inability to satisfie divine Justice, and so to be justified by any thing which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self can do: So natural is it to seek for a righteousnesse


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44180:52"/>
of our own and in our selves, that we will never seek in earnest to the Righteousnesse of Christ until we be made to despair of our selves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. for, the Apostle shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that this conviction went before their Justification; <hi>Knowing that a man is not justified by the Works of the Law.</hi> Next, he must be convinced also of a worth in Christ's Merit to satisfie divine Justice, and that this Merit of Christ's is offered to all, who shall lay hold on it by Faith, so as that it shall stand good in Law for them in order to their Absolution, as if they had given an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent satisfaction to God's Justice themselves; for, none will venture his immortal soul upon that, the worth whereof he doth not know. Hence the Apostle sheweth that the knowledge of this also did preceed their Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; <hi>Knowing that a man is not justified but by the Faith of Jesus Christ.</hi> And lastly, being thus convinced, he must by Faith receive and rest upon Jesus Christ and that most perfect Righteousnesse of His, by making his soul adhere and cleave to the Word of Promise, wherein Christ is offered, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39, 41. whereupon followeth the real Justification and Absolution of the man, who so doth: for, <hi>Paul</hi> marketh this as a third thing going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Justification; <hi>Even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified. Doct.</hi> 4. The former practices of ancient Believers, eminent for parts, privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and graces, who have quit their own righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and ventured their soul wholly upon this imputed Righteousnesse of Christ, laying hold upon it by Faith, ought to be looked on as a strong argument inforcing us to do the like: for, the Apostle's scope is to prevail with those Galatians by this argument; <hi>We who are Jews by nature,</hi> saith he, <hi>have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might bejustified.</hi> 5. Though the approved practices of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent godly persons, may have their own weight in order to our encouragement to deny our selves and lay hold on Christ; Yet it is the Word of the Lord which can only quiet a man's conscience in this matter, and make his mind fully aquiesce to it: for, the Apostle unto their


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44180:53"/>
example subjoyneth a Scripture-confirmation of the Truth in hand; <hi>By the Works of the Law shall no flesh be justified.</hi>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 17. But if while we seek to be justified by Christ, we our selves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.</head>
                  <p>HE preoccupieth an Objection, which might have been framed against the present Doctrine, thus, If the Doctrine of Justification by Christ, doth suppose that even the Jews themselves, who are sanctified from the womb, are equally sinners with the Gentiles, and that, being unable to attain to Justification by the Works of the Law, they must only rely on Christ by Faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> had but presently affirmed, ver. 16. Then it would seem to follow, that Christ were <hi>the minister of sin,</hi> or, that the Doctrine of the Gospel did make men sinners, both by taking away that Righteousnesse of the Law, which the Jews thought they had, and were warranted, as they conceived, by the Scriptures of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so to think, as also by furnishing both Jew and Gentile with an occasion to cast-by all care of Holinesse and good Works, seing that thereby they were not to be justified, but by Faith in Christ only (See the like Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection propounded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31.) Which Objection the Apostle answereth, first, by repelling the Inference as absurd and blasphemous in this verse; and next, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing it in the following. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Ministers of Jesus Christ, in holding forth Truth, would carefully foresee, and prudently take off what atheistical, loose or erring spirits do usually object against it, to make it odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: so doth <hi>Paul</hi> here; <hi>But if while we seek, &amp;c.</hi> 2. It is too usual for people to conceit too much of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Church-priviledges, as if by having them, they had saving Grace, and stood not in so much need of Christ's imputed Righteousnesse as others: for, this is that which the adversaries did stumble at, that the Jews


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44180:53"/>
by nature, who enjoyed so many rich priviledges, should be found sinners, and as unable to be saved by their own works as others: <hi>For if while we seek to be justified by Christ, we our selves are found also sinners.</hi> 3. Whatever be a mans priviledges otherwise, he must; if so he would be justified by Christ, take his confidence off them, and reckon himself equal to the most vile and worthlesse sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in the point of unability to merit any thing from God by his own Works: for, this is supposed, as that whereon their Objection is grounded, and <hi>Paul</hi> doth passe it as granted, and speaketh only against their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from it; <hi>But if while wee seek to be justified by Christ, we our selves are found also sinners.</hi> 4. It is no new prejudice, though a most unjust one, whereby the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Justification by Faith alone, and not by Works, hath been unjustly loaded, that of its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it doth tend to foster people in sin: The Papists do object so now, and the false Apostles did so of old; <hi>Is therefore Christ the minister of sin?</hi> say they, or, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine preached by Christ the occasion of sin? 5. To take occasion from Free-grace, or the Doctrine of it, to live in sin, is, so much as in us lyeth, to make Christ the minister of sin, and therefore a thing which all christian hearts should sk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

propose himself an example unto others. The first, is, that <hi>Paul,</hi> in preaching the Doctrine of Justification, had joyntly with it prest the ruine and destruction of sin, as necessarily flowing from that Doctrine: and therefore if he should again build up sin, by giving way to the practice of it, he should contradict himself in what he had preached, not walking according to the Doctrine of the Gospel, but contrary to it: and so himself should be the transgressor, and the Gospel free from giving him any occasion so to be. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Doctrine of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Free-grace, cannot be rightly preached, except the Doctrine of Mortification and destroying of sin be joyntly preached with it: for, the same Faith which layeth hold on Christ for Righteousnesse, doth rest upon Him also for grace and strength to subdue corruption and sin, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. and if He be not imployed for the latter, He will not bestow the former: thus sin and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption were those things which <hi>Paul</hi> destroyed, in so far as he did hold forth the most solid and ready way how to get them destroyed, while he taught the Doctrine of Justification; <hi>If I build again the things which I destroyed,</hi> 2. From this it followeth, that the untender lives of those who professe this Doctrine, do not reflect upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as if in it self it did give occasion or encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto them so to live; but upon themselves, who do not make the right use of that Doctrine, but abuse it, and walk quite contrary to what is prescribed by it: for, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> infer; <hi>For if I build again the things which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, I make my self a transgressor;</hi> or, the fault is not in the Doctrine, but in my self.</p>

                  <p>HEre is a second Reason by preoccupation of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; for they might say, The Doctrine of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as taught by <hi>Paul,</hi> did free Believers from the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4. and therefore did give them encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

to sin. The Apostle answereth, by granting they were freed from the Law, but denyeth that inference de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from it, upon two reasons: and his Answer doth furnish us with three Doctrines, which will further clear the meaning of the words. First, <hi>Paul</hi> and all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are dead indeed to the Law, that is, so, as they put no confidence in their obedience to it for their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 9. so, as they are freed from the condemning power of it, Chap. 3. 13. and as by its rigorous exaction of perfect obedience under hazard of the curse, which we were not able to perform, it did make us desperate and carelesse, and so did occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoke and stir-up corruption in the heart, <hi>Rom. 7. 5, 6. I am dead to the Law.</hi> Secondly, It is the Law it self, which maketh them thus dead to the Law; the curse of the Law putting them so hard to it, that they are made to despair of getting Heaven and Salvation by their obedience to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20, 21. and are forced to fly unto Christ, by being in whom, they are freed from condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. and get their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption so far mortified, as that it taketh not occasion to sin the more from the Law's discharging of sin as it was wont, <hi>Rom. 6. 14. For I through the Law am dead to the Law</hi> And, thirdly, Though Believers are delivered from the Law in the former respects; Yet not as it is the rule of an holy life: for, the very end of their freedom, is, That being so delivered, they might, by vertue of the Spirit of Christ dwelling in them, live righteously and holily to the glory of God: for, saith he, <hi>I am dead to the Law that I might live unto God.</hi> By all which, it doth evidently appear, That the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Justification in it self, doth give no encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to sin: which answereth the Objection, and refuteth the blasphemous Inference, which is made, ver. 17.</p>

                  <p>HEre is a third Reason to the same purpose with the former, shewing more fully that justified persons are most strictly tyed to mortify sin and lead an holy life, if so they walk according to the prescript of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Justification which was taught by <hi>Paul:</hi> for he, and by consequence all real Believers, were <hi>crucified with Christ,</hi> to wit, the old man of their indwelling cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. it did receive the stroke of death by His death, He having by death redeemed them from the slavery of it, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. which crucifixion with Christ, doth not destroy the natural life of Believers; for so <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth he did live: only the old man of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth not live in them, so, as to act them in what they do, but Jesus Christ doth live in them, He being united to them, as the root to the branches, or head to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and furnishing them with spiritual life and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby the very natural life, which they live, and those things which concern that life are ordered and gone about by vertue of strength drawn from Christ, by Faith in Him: and the consideration of Christ's love to them, and His dying for them, because he loved them, is a great inducement unto justified persons so to live. Now, this being true in <hi>Paul,</hi> and in some measure in all Believers, and seing the principles of the Doctrine of Justification did bind all to this, It is evident, that to affirm this Doctrine did tend to foster sin, is but a foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forged calumny. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As Jesus Christ did die a most shameful, painful and cursed death upon the crosse, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. so in His dying He did stand, not as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, but as a publick person in the room and place of all the Elect; for He was their surety, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 22. and died for them, <hi>Job.</hi> 11. 50. so that when they lay hold


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44180:55"/>
upon Him by Faith, and thereby are made one with Him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17 the crosse and passion of Christ, as to all those benefits which were purchased by it, whether in order to the removal of the guilt of sin <hi>(Mat.</hi> 26. 28.) or to the subduing of its strength, and quickning of them in the way of holinesse (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15.) or to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasing of life eternal for them, <hi>(Joh.</hi> 3. 16.) is as verily made theirs, as if they had been crucified in their own persons: for, <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himself, as an instance of all Believers, <hi>I am crucified with Christ.</hi> 2. The former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideration of the Believer's right to Christ's purchase, in order to the subduing of sin, layeth a strong engagement on him, and giveth a great encouragement unto him to oppose, resist, and set about the mortification of sin in himself: for, <hi>Paul</hi> maketh this an argument to prove that the Doctrine of Justification, in its own nature, is no friend to sin; because, according to the principles thereof, the justified person is <hi>crucified with Christ.</hi> 3. God's infinit wisdom hath found out the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the threatning of death <hi>(Gen.</hi> 2. 17.) is fulfilled in the Elect, so that they die, and yet their lives are spared; they die, and yet they live: for, they are reckoned in Law to have died, when Christ their Surety died for them; so that He was taken, and they go free, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 8. thus is that riddle solved, which is here propounded by <hi>Paul, I am crucified with Christ, yet I live.</hi> 4. Though not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of fulfilling the threatning of death upon the Elect, they do live; yet upon their believing in Jesus Christ, the old man of corruption and power of sin is so far weakened in them, that it doth not bear the chief sway in their heart, to command, execute, and order all their actions, as formerly it did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. for, thus is that other riddle solved, which is here propounded, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless I live, yet not I,</hi> to wit the old <hi>I:</hi> the body of death and corruption did not live in him, but was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and the dominion thereof removed, <hi>Rom. 6. 14. Dost.</hi> 5. The Doctrine of Justification by Free-grace, revealed in the Gospel, layeth on strong obligations upon


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44180:56"/>
the justified person to set about the whole duties of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, not only those, which relate to the mortifying of sin, but also to his quickning in the way of grace: both those must go together, and the justified man is obliged to both, and furnished with help and encouragement from the Doctrine of Justification to set about both: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth they were both conjoyned in himself; the first, while he saith, <hi>Not I live;</hi> the second, while he saith, <hi>Christ liveth in me:</hi> whereby is meant his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the motions of Christ's Spirit, as the guide of his life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. and this he speaketh of himself, as a thing that he was obliged unto, and furnished for by the Doctrine of Justification which he taught; otherwise he should not have refuted the calumny of his adversaries. 6. That Christians may live the spiritual life of grace, they must, 1. be united to Christ, and have Christ dwelling in them by Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. for, speaking of the spiritual life which he lived, he supposeth Christ to be in him; <hi>But Christ liveth in me.</hi> 2. Besides this union with Christ, there must be a communication of influence from the Spirit of Christ to excite them unto, <hi>(Cant.</hi> 5. 2.) enable them for, <hi>(John.</hi> 15. 5.) make them persevere <hi>(Philip.</hi> 1. 6.) and effectually to order and direct them in <hi>(Philip.</hi> 4. 13.) the practice of every thing that is spiritually good: for, this is to have Christ living in them, to wit, as the head in the members, or root in the branches, which do furnish the members and branches with all things necessary for life and growth: and Christ's quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Believers in the way of grace, is frequently see forth by similitudes drawn from those, <hi>Col. 2. 19. Joh.</hi> 15. 5. 3. The Believer, if so he would live this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, must not only have the habit of Faith in his heart, but also must keep it in daily exercise, so as first thereby to try what he is to do, if so it be warranted by the Word of Truth, and how it is to be circumstantiated, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. Secondly, thereby to draw furniture from the Spirit of Christ for exciting, enabling, and directing him in the way of duty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. And, thirdly to


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44180:56"/>
apply pardoning mercy for covering the defects of duty, when he hath gone about it, and for removing the guilt of all his other sins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 11. for, this is to <hi>live by the Faith of the Son of God,</hi> or, in the Son of God, which <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of as a necessary ingredient in this spiritual life. 4. This spiritual life, and life of Faith, must be extended not only to spiritual duties, and of God's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Worship, but also to all the actions of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and temporal life, in so far as they fall under a Command, even to our eating and drinking, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. duties of our lawful imployments, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 33. and to our carriage under crosses, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24, 25. for, by the life which <hi>Paul lived in the flesh,</hi> is meaned this natural life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 2. and his living this spiritual life of Faith, was extended even to the things of that life; <hi>The life which I now live in the flesh, is by the Faith of the Son of God. Doct.</hi> 7. As Jesus Christ did give Himself a Ransom for the Elect, (See chap. 1. 4.) so no worth in us, no good which He expecteth from us, or need which He stood in of us, but only love in Him to us did move Him so to do; <hi>He loved me, and gave Himself for me.</hi> 8. Though the full perswasion and assurance of Christ's special love unto, and His dying for <hi>me</hi> in particular, is not the very essence and being of saving Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13. for, saving Faith may be without it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 10. Yet it is a thing which may be had without extraordinary revelation, the Spirit of God enabling the Believer to discern in himself those graces (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.) which are set down as marks of His special love and favour in Scripture, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14, 18, 19, 21, 24. and bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with His Spirit that he is a childe of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. and this assurance should be aimed at in the right method by all, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. for, <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking in the name of other Believers, sheweth he had attained it; <hi>Who loved me, and gave Himself for me,</hi> saith he. 9. This full perswasion and assurance, in its own nature, is so far from making those, who have it, loose the reigns to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse and security, that upon the contrary, it serveth


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44180:57"/>
as a strong incitement to make them mortifie sin, and live that spiritual life of Faith which is here spoken of: for, it served for this use unto <hi>Paul; I live by the Faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself forme.</hi>

                  <p>HAving removed the objection, the Apostle proceedeth to establish Justification by Faith, and not by the Works of the Law, by a second argument, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, If we be justified by the Law, or works done in obedience to the Law, Then those two absurdities would follow, 1. God's free grace and favour should be rejected, despised, frustrated and made uselesse, (for the word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth all these) and the reason of the consequence lyeth in this, That if Justification be by Works, Then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be by Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. 2. Christ's death had been in vain without any necessary cause or reason, if the Justification of finners could have been attained by Works or by any other mean. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. They who have attained unto the perswasion and full assurance of God's favour and love in Christ, ought above all others, to maintain the glory of His Grace and Mercy in saving of sinners freely, not admitting of any thing, whether in practice or opinion, whether in themselves, or, so far as is possible, in others, which may incroach upon it, obscure it, or weaken the thoughts of the excellency of it in the minds of men: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> who was perswaded of Christ's love, ver. 20. doth look upon this as his duty, flowing from that assurance; <hi>I do not frustrate the Grace of God,</hi> saith he. 2. The joyning of Works with Faith in the matter of Justification, is a total excluding of God's Free-grace and favour from having any hand in this Work: for, Grace admitteth of no partner; so that if Grace do not all, it doth nothing; if any thing be added to it, that addition maketh Grace to be no Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 4. for, the Apostle, reasoning against those who would


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44180:57"/>
have made Works to share with God's Free-grace and favour in Justification, sheweth his joyning with them in that opinion, would be a total rejecting, and making uselesse of God's Grace; <hi>I do not frustrate the Grace of God.</hi> 3. That the Apostle doth exclude in this dispute from having any influence in Justification, the Works, not only of the Ceremonial, but also of the Moral Law, appeareth from this, That he opposeth the Merit of Christ's death, to all Merit of our own, whether by obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the one Law, or to the other; neither can any reason be given for which our meriting by obedience to the Ceremonial Law maketh Christ to have died in vain, which is not applicabl to the Moral Law: <hi>For, if righteousness come by the Law, then Christ died in vain.</hi> 4. That he excludeth also, not only the Works of the Moral Law, which are performed by the natural and unregenerate man, but also those which the Godly do perform by vertue of Faith drawing influence from Christ, appeareth from this, that the Apostle useth this argument taken from the uselesnesse of Christ's death, not against the unconverted Jews, (who had not received the Gospel, and so would easily have granted, that Christ was dead in vain) but against those who had received the Gospel, and so would never have pleaded that any Works done by a natural man, but those only which flow from the Grace of Christ, could justifie a sinner; and yet <hi>Paul</hi> reasoneth against those, <hi>If righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain.</hi> 5. That he doth exclude also all Works of ours whatsoever from being the meritorious cause of our Justification, not only in whole and their alone without the Merit of Christ, but also in part and joyntly with His Merit, appeareth from the former ground that he is reasoning against professed Christians, who doubtlesse did give Christ's Merit and Death some share at least in Justification; else the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity, which is deduced from their Doctrine by <hi>Paul,</hi> should have had no weight with them, as being no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity in their mind; <hi>Then Christ is dead in vain.</hi> 6. If


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44180:58"/>
there had been any other way possible in Heaven or Earth, by which the Salvation of lost sinners could have been brought about, but by the Death of Christ, then Christ would not have died; our disease was desperate as to any other cure: for, while he saith, <hi>If righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in vain,</hi> he affirmeth two things, 1. That to suppose Christ hath died in vain, or without cause, is a great absurdity no wayes to be admitted of. 2. If the Justification and Salvation of sinners could have been attained by Works, or any other mean, then His Death had been in vain; and so that it were an absurd thing to suppose he would have died in that case.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>IN the first part of this Chapter, the Apostle (having sharply rebuked these Galatians for their defection, ver. 1.) useth five other Arguments to prove that we are justified by Faith, and not by Works. First, They had received the saving Graces of God's Spirit, by hearing the Doctrine of Justification by Faith, and not by Works, ver. 2. Which Argument, is further urged, ver. 3, 4. and enlarged unto their receiving these other miraculous Gifts of the Spirit by the means of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and as confirmations of it, ver. 5. Secondly, <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by Faith, ver. 6. From which he inferreth, that Believers are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s children, ver. 7. and that all of them, whether Jew or Gentile, must be justified by Faith also, ver. 8, 9. Thirdly, Those who seek to be justified by the Law, are under the curse of the Law; and therefore not justified, ver. 10. Fourthly, Scripture testifieth that men shall be justified by Faith, ver. 11. Whence he inferreth and proveth his Inference, that therefore they cannot be justified by the Law, ver. 12. Fifthly, Christ's redeeming of us from the curse of


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44180:58"/>
the Law, and all the fruits following upon His Death, are received by Faith, ver. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>In the second part of the Chapter, he answereth some Objections, and joyntly sheweth the date prescribed by God, for keeping the Ceremonial Law, was now past. <hi>Object.</hi> 1. It seemeth the way of Justification by Faith in the Promise made to <hi>Abraham</hi> was changed by the Law given upon Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> He answereth by a simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude taken from humane Covenants, ver. 15. that the Covenant of Grace made and ratified by God with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in Christ, could not be altered nor abrogated by the Law, which was given so long after, ver. 16, 17, 18. <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The Law seemeth to be given in vain and to no purpose, if it do not justifie. He answereth by shewing another end for which the Law was given, to wit, for the discovery and restraint of sin; and that God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was not, that people should be thereby justified, ver. 19, 20. <hi>Object.</hi> 3. The Law seemeth then to be contrary to the Covenant-promise, if the one discover sin, and the other forgive and cover it. He answereth, first, retort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Objection against the Propounders, to wit, that by their way the Law would be contrary to, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive of the Promise, ver. 21. Secondly, shewing the Law in discovering sin, and condemning for it, was sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to the Promise, while it did necessitate guilty sinners to believe, and apply the Promise, ver. 22. <hi>Object.</hi> 4. It seemeth the Ceremonial Law, and the whole ancient dispensation ought to be observed under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel for the same use and end at least. He answereth, shewing the Law was for good use to the ancient Church, ver. 23. which he illustrateth by comparing the Law to a Schoolmaster, ver. 24. but denieth that therfore it should be observed now; because the Church was come to perfect age, and so could not be any longer keeped under a Schoolmaster, ver. 25, 26. <hi>Object.</hi> 5. It seemeth Circumcision at least ought to be observed; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was not added upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> but instituted long before. He answereth, shewing that Baptism doth

Thus the Apostle, speaking of that influence which false Teachers had upon them, in drawing them from the Truth, he saith, <hi>Who hath bewitched you?</hi> It's a word borrowed from the practice of Witches and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, who, being assisted by the Devil, use to cast mist before the eyes to dazle, and so delude them. 4. For a people to have the Gospel among them, and not to make use of it, but to reject it, and make defection from it, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth them to be fools indeed, whatever be their wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom otherwise in things relating to this present life: for, the Doctrine of the Gospel containeth saying Wisdom, which maketh wise unto Salvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. which Wisdom they reject. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> calleth them <hi>foolish Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> because they <hi>obeyed not the Truth.</hi> 5. Though neither Ministers, nor any other, ought to charge men with folly, with a mind to reproach them, or in way


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44180:60"/>
of private revenge, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 22. Yet the Minister of Jesus Christ, or any other who hath a Call to it, may up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid a man with folly, if, first, the party reproved be guilty of folly, as those Galatians were. Secondly, if the reproof flow from love and compassion in the person who doth reprove, and an honest desire after the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's good, as it was here: for, he casteth not up their folly in passion, but in compassion, desiring nothing but their good and amendment. Thirdly, if the reproof carry along all lawfull and allowed moderation with it, as here, he calleth them not <hi>wicked,</hi> but more gently, <hi>foolish</hi> or imprudent, and withall layeth the great weight of their sins upon their Seducers, who had <hi>bewitched</hi> them. And, fourthly, That the reprover not only himself do know that there is reason so to charge them, but also hold forth these reasons to them, that they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced also: for, so doth <hi>Paul,</hi> he demonstrateth their folly, from that they obeyed not the Gospel, which was so plainly preached among them; <hi>O foolish Galatians, &amp;c. Doct.</hi> 6. Ministers ought not to rest upon a coldrife way of preaching Truth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7,-29. but are to endeavour the delivery of it, with that perspicuity and plainnesse, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 4. that power and livelinesse, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.—4. as it may penetrate the conscience of the hearers, and be so clear and evident to them, as if it were pictured and painted out before their eyes: and in order to this, they would not only labour to understand throughly what they preach, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 7. but also to believe it themselves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. and to have their own affections in some measure warmed with love to it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15-. And above all, would labour with God, that the effectuall operation of His Spirit may come along with what they preach, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. -4. that so the Truth delivered may be the more lively, and convincingly represented to the hearers: for, <hi>Paul</hi> did so preach; <hi>Jesus Christ was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently set forth, crucified among them, before their eyes:</hi> He did so represent Christ and Him crucified to their ears, by the preaching of the Word, as if they had seen Him


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44180:60"/>
with their eyes. 7. Though Jesus Christ and His suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are to be painted out, vively represented and pictured by the plain and powerful preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; Yet it doth not follow, that they are to be artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally painted with colours upon stone or timber, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious use: for, God commandeth the former, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the latter, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 4. And, the graven image is but a teacher of lies, <hi>Hab. 2. 18. Doct.</hi> 8. The more clearly and powerfully that the Gospel hath been prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched among a People, their defection from it, and not giving obedience to it, is the more aggreged: for, <hi>Paul</hi> aggregeth their not obeying the Truth, from this, that <hi>before their eyes, Jesus Christ had been evidently set forth, crucified among them.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, having stirred them up to attention by a reproof, doth now return to his former dispute, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that we are justified by Faith, and not by Works, (See chap. 2. 16.) And this he proveth, first, because the Spirit of Regeneration and other saving Graces of the Spirit of God (called here the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as being fruits of the Spirit, chap. 5. 22.) were wrought in those of them, who were regenerate, not <hi>by the works of the Law,</hi> that is, by the Doctrine of Justification by Works, but <hi>by the hearing of Faith,</hi> that is, by hearing the Doctrine of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by Faith: for here, as usually elswhere, (See chap. 1. 23.) <hi>Faith</hi> is taken for the Doctrine that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: And for the truth of this assertion, he appealeth to their own conscience and experience, leaving them to gather, that therefore they were justified and reconciled by the Doctrine of Faith, seing God bestoweth His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon none but such as are reconciled unto Him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2, &amp;c. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

that <hi>the Spirit,</hi> and saving graces of the Spirit, were in some of those Galatians, because of whom, he speaketh generally unto all; <hi>Received ye the Spirit?</hi> saith he. 2. Even those who are truely gracious, may stagger strangely in reeling times, and be in a great measure overtaken with the most dangerous Errors of the times, though they cannot totally (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23.) nor finally <hi>(Isa.</hi> 54. 7, 8.) fall away: for, <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh even to them who had received the Spirit, as to those who were taken with the common Errors; <hi>Received ye the Spirit?</hi> 3. As Regeneration and saving Grace is the work of God's Spirit in the Elect; So the ordinary mean whereby He conveyeth Grace to the heart, is, by hearing the Word preached: for, they had <hi>received the Spirit by the hearing of Faith.</hi> 4. Though the hearing of the Law preached, doth work conviction of sin, terror of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and legal contrition, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. whereby the heart is in some sort prepared for receiving of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; Yet the Law, as distinct from the Gospel, and as it presseth perfect obedience in order to our Justification before God, (in which sense it was mistaken by the false Apostles, and is so spoken of in this dispute; See upon chap. 2. 15.) can never be a mean of begetting Grace in the heart; for so it driveth the soul to despair, and worketh wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. Thus the Apostle affirmeth, they <hi>received not the Spirit by the works of the Law.</hi> 5. It is the Gospel preached and heard, which the Lord maketh use of, as a mean for conveying Grace to the heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first convinced of sin and misery, by the preaching of the Law, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37, 38. for, the Gospel offereth Christ freely, from whom, being laid hold upon by Faith, we do all receive Grace for Grace, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 16. Thus the Apostle affirmeth they had <hi>received the Spirit by the hearing of Faith.</hi> 6. Though a gracious heart, may be overtaken with Error, as said is, (See <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.) Yet there remaineth somewhat of conscience in vigour with them, in so far as that being appealed unto, about the truth of things weighty, and which belong to the reality

of God's work in their heart, and the way of His work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, they dare not readily lie, and contradict their own known experience: for, <hi>Paul</hi> at least supposeth so much, while he doth appeal to their own conscience and experience how saving Grace was wrought in them; <hi>This only would I learn of you, Received ye, &amp;c.</hi> 7.

The Text speaketh nothing against the Doctrine of Perseverance, as if those who were once renewed, and truly spiritual, might lose the Spirit of God altogether, and turn fleshly: For besides, first, that the Apostle doth not positively assert, that they


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44180:62"/>
were changed already, but only, by way of question, holdeth out the hazard which should follow upon their change. Secondly, he speaketh not of a change of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities or dispositions from good to bad, but in their judgment, from the Doctrine of Faith, here called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to the Doctrine of Justification by Works, here called <hi>flesh.</hi> Thirdly, though he did imply a change of qualities and disposition from <hi>Spirit</hi> to <hi>flesh,</hi> and from holinesse to sin, as a consequence of this change of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and opinion; Yet there is nothing here importing that any total or final change of that kind, either had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, or could fall upon those who were truly gracious. 2. The Doctrine maintained by the Papists now, That Faith in Jesus Christ doth begin our Justification, in so far as it disposeth us unto good works, and that by those our Justification is compleated, is no new error, but that which hath been held of old by these Hereticks, who had seduced the Galatians, and whom <hi>Paul</hi> here refuteth: for, he supposeth, that in answer to the present argument, they might readily affirm, that though the Doctrine of Faith (here called the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.—6.) did begin the work; yet the Doctrine of Works, here called <hi>flesh,</hi> did perfect it; <hi>Having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</hi> 3.

                  <p>HE cleareth what he said of the folly and madnesse, which is in following the way presently spoken of, by shewing, if they should hold on to seek Justification by Works, or partly by Faith, and partly by Works, they would lose all the fruit of their former constancy and sufferings, sustained by them for that Truth which he did now preach; this he speaketh not positively, but as it were doubtingly, and suspending its certainty, upon the hopes he had of their amendment. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the lot of those who professe Truth, to suffer many things in the defence of it. See chap. 1. ver. 13. doct. 6. The Galatians found the truth of this, <hi>Have ye suffered so many things?</hi> 2. They may suffer many things for Truth, who afterwards will make foul defection from it: for, as the example of others, particular interest, wrapt up in the publick, and the general applause which sufferers for Truth do receive from the lovers of Truth, will make even Hypocrites suffer much; so continued sufferings, will make even the godly faint for a time; yea, the best, being left to themselves, in an hour of tentation, will turn their back upon Truth, so that no engagements by a profession, no experience or remembrance of that joy and sweetnesse, which they have found in the way of Truth, nor yet their former sufferings for Truth, will make them adhere unto it: for, these Galatians had suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered many things for the Doctrine of Justification by Faith; yea, and had found much sweetnesse and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in it, chap. 4. 15. and yet now they have made defection from it; <hi>Have ye suffered so many things in vain?</hi> 3. Afflictions and sufferings for the Truth, are very useful and profitable to the sufferers, though not to satisfie God's justice for sin, neither in its guilt nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, neither eternal nor temporal; for, these are fully done away in Christ, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 5. Yet for other ends,

as for the trial of their Faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. for conforming them to Christ their head, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.—10. who was a man of sorrows, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 3. for making them die to the world, chap. 6. 14. and to fit them for Heaven; afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and crosses being the beaten way which leadeth to it, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 22. for, while he saith, <hi>Have ye suffered so many things in vain?</hi> he importeth their sufferings would have been usefull for them, if they themselves had not hindered it. 4. Whatever have been the sufferings of a people or person for Truth, they are all in vain, lost, and to no purpose, as to any thing which can be expected from God to the party who hath suffered, if so he make defection from, and turn his back upon Truth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: for, <hi>Paul</hi> insinuateth this as an undoubted Truth, while he saith, <hi>Have ye suffered so many things in vain?</hi> 5. Though these who have suffered much for Truth, should afterward make defection from it, we are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse to keep charity towards them, as hoping God will give them repentance, and reclaim them: Yea, all our sharpnesse towards them, whether in aggreging their sin, or in holding out the terrible consequences which are deserved by, and probably will follow upon, their sin, ought to be wisely tempered, by expressing those chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thoughts which we have of them: for, so doth the Apostle here, while, speaking of these Galatians, who had formerly suffered much for Truth, and threatning them for their present defection with the losse of all those advantages which they might have expected from their sufferings, the suspendeth the certainty of the threatning, upon their hoped-for repentance; <hi>If it be yet in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

among them with the fruits of the Spirit of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and saving Graces, wrought by it, but also with other extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, such as the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of miracles, speaking with strange tongues, curing of diseases, which were so many confirmations, that the Doctrine was of God. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though the saving Graces of God's Spirit, are conveyed to the hearts of hearers, by the preaching of the Gospel; Yet God is the author and worker of them, and the Gospel only a mean by which He worketh: for, having spoken of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Spirit, when he first propounded this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ver. 2. he doth here in the resuming of it, explain how they received it, to wit, by God's bestowing of it; <hi>He therefore that ministreth to you the Spirit.</hi> 2. When the Doctrine of the Gospel, as it is now dispensed under the New Testament, did first break up, the Lord, to confirm the Truth thereof, did accompany the preaching of it with the working of miracles (which properly are works above natures strength, and so could be wrought by none but God) and this, that hereby the truth of the Doctrine might be confirmed, which being once suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently done, there is no further use for miracles now: for, the Apostle sheweth that miracles were wrought among the Galatians, by the hearing of Faith, and that this was one Argument of the divinity of that Doctrine, while he saith, <hi>He that worketh miracles among you, doth He it by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> 3. So strong and provalent is the spirit of Error, where it is letten loose, and so weak are the best in themselves to resist it; that for love to Error they will quit Truth, though formerly never so much confirmed and sealed unto them, by the saving fruits of God's Spirit in their hearts accompanying it: for, though these Galatians had the Doctrine of Justification plainly preached, ver. 1. and sealed to them by the saving Graces of God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and by many miracles wrought among them; yet they make defection from it: <hi>He therefore that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44180:64"/>
hath for its general object, the whole Word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of Histories, Threatnings, Commands and Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, both of temporal and eternal blessings; for, Faith giveth firm assent unto the whole Word, because of that divine Authority which revealeth it, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. -14. yet the principal object of justifying Faith, is the Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise holding forth Christ and His Righteousnesse, as the meritorious cause of the Believers Salvation: for, this Promise which <hi>Abraham</hi> did believe, and the Faith wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was imputed to him for righteousnes, had Jesus Christ in its bosom, it being a Promise of giving unto <hi>Abraham</hi> a numerous seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 4, 5. and so a Promise of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ to come of him, in whom all the Nations <hi>(Act.</hi> 3. 25.) and <hi>Abraham</hi> himself (ver.—9.) were to be blessed: <hi>Even as Abraham believed God.</hi> 2. That it may go well with a soul, and be accepted in God's sight, who can endure no unclean thing, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 13—. it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that it be cloathed with some righteousnesse of one sort or other: for, <hi>Faith was accounted unto Abraham for righteousnesse.</hi> 3. It being wholly impossible for fallen man, to attain unto that personal, perfect righteousnesse, which the Law requireth, <hi>Rom. 3. 10, &amp;c.</hi> the Wisdom of God hath found out another way of making him righteous, to wit, that, whereby Faith is imputed, rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned or accounted unto him for righteousnesse: for, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith <hi>was accounted unto him,</hi> to wit, by God, <hi>for righteousnesse.</hi> 4. Faith is not in a proper sense im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Believer for righteousnesse, as if the work of Faith it self were imputed to us, and accepted of God, whether freely, or because of the merit of Christ, for our total and perfect righteousnesse, but it's imputed in a figurative sense, with respect had to that which Faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth and layeth hold upon, to wit, the obedience and sufferings of Jesus Christ, these being laid hold on by Faith, become our righteousnesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. and 10. 4. for, the Apostle, all alongst this Chapter, opposeth Faith and Works: now his Arguments would be of no force, if Faith did justifie as a work, and for any worth


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44180:65"/>
in it self; <hi>It was accounted to him for righteousness.</hi> 5. In the matter of Justification, Faith is opposed not only to those Works which go before Conversion, but to those also which follow after it, and are the real fruits of God's Spirit in the Believer: all Works, whether of the one sort or other, are excluded; for, even to <hi>Abraham</hi> many years after his Conversion, when he had abounded in good Works, and many gracious Vertues, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 12, 13, 14, chapters) <hi>his Faith was accounted for righteousnesse.</hi> 6. As there is a second and reiterated Justification of one and the same person in this sense, that upon our renewed apprehending of the Promise by Faith, the sentence of our absolution and adjudication to life eternal, is also renewed; so this second Justification is not upon the account, or for the merit of our good Works, no more than the former. It is alwayes Faith that justifieth: for, <hi>Abraham</hi> who was justified long before, upon a renewed act of his believing, hath his Faith of new, and not his Works, <hi>imputed to him for righteousness.</hi> 7.

Rom.</hi> 8. 1. so were they, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 5. otherwise the Apostle could not argue from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Justification to ours, as he doth here; <hi>Know ye therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>that they which are of the Faith, &amp;c.</hi> 8. They <hi>who are of the Faith,</hi> or who seek after Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Faith, are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s children and his seed; they who are Members of the visible Church, and profess the Doctrine of Faith, are his children outwardly, because they walk in the steps of their father <hi>Abraham,</hi> by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing of, and assenting to that Doctrine of Faith, which he believed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 12. whereby they have title to the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Act. 2. 39. Rom.</hi> 11. 16, 17. which title of theirs to the Covenant, implyeth a right to enjoy all divine Ordinances, <hi>(Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39.) whereof they are capable, and from which they do not debar themselves

by ignorance, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28.) or scandal, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. It implyeth also all external Church-priviledges leading unto Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. Yea, and a right to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it self, upon God's tearms, required in the Gospel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16.

They again, who do not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the Doctrine of Faith, but also imbrace it in their hearts, by the grace of saving Faith, are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren inwardly; because, they have not only a title to the Covenant of Grace, but also come up to the conditions required in it; and so do walk in the steps of saving Faith and Repentance, wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> walked, who is held forth as a pattern and father for imitation unto others, whereby they enjoy not only outward priviledges, but also saving benefits and blessings, and have not only a conditional, but an absolute and actual right unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Glory, the covenanted Inheritance of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s children, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16-.

                  <p>BEcause the former consequence from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to ours, might be questioned to hold in the Gentiles, who were not of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s posterity, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle doth clear it from the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12. 3. that <hi>in him,</hi> or, in his seed, Jesus Christ who was to come of him <hi>(Gen.</hi> 22. 18.) all the Nations, or Gentiles, were to be blessed; which


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44180:66"/>
Promise, he sheweth, was no other than the Gospel or glad tydings, that all the blessings to be purchased by Christ <hi>Abraham</hi>'s seed, (among which Justification by Faith was one) were to be bestowed by God upon the Gentiles, and that the Scripture, or Spirit which speaks in Scripture, fore-knowing, to wit, in the Decree, that God was to do so, did contrive the Promise in these words, of purpose that it might bear so much, ver. 8. from which he inferreth, that all Believers indefinitely, the Nations not excluded, but included, do partake of all those saving blessings which <hi>Abraham</hi> did partake of, by Faith, among which, free Justification was the chief; for of that is the question, ver. 9. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not an invention of man, but the Word of the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing God, appeareth from this, that several things are foretold therein, which had their accomplishment a long time afterwards, according as they were foretold, the knowledge of which things at so great a distance of time, could not be in any but God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 22, 23. for, the calling of the Gentiles, and their Justification by Faith, was foretold about the space of two thousand years before it fell out; <hi>And the Scripture foreseeing that God would justifie the Heathen through faith.</hi> 2. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of future events, at the greatest distance, doth most properly and peculiarly belong unto God; which doth alwayes suppose His Will and Decree, that such things shall come to passe; in which Decree of His, He doth foreknow them, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23. Whatever foresight of this kind is in any of the creatures, they have it by bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed light from Him, and (as we say) by lighting their Candles at His Torch: for, the foreknowing that the Gentiles would be justified by Faith, is attributed to Scripture, or the Spirit of God speaking in Scripture; <hi>And the Scripture foreseeing, &amp;c.</hi> 3. The calling of the Gentiles, and their attaining to Salvation by free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and all the spiritual priviledges of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s seed, was a thing hardly credible at the first breaking-forth of the Gospel, the case of all Nations, except the Jews,


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44180:66"/>
seemed to be so desperate and damnable, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 11, 12. Hence the Apostle seeth it necessary upon all occasions almost, to clear, that the calling of the Gentiles had ground from Scripture, as here, <hi>The Scripture foreseeing that God would justifie the Heathen by Faith.</hi> 4. Hence we learn several things, tending to the right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Promise made to <hi>Abraham, Gen. 12. 3. In thee,</hi> or <hi>in thy seed (Gen.</hi> 22. 18.) to wit, Christ, <hi>all Nations shall be blessed;</hi> As, first, That the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> whereof this Promise is one Article, was extended not only to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s carnal seed, but to all Believers in every place, even among the Gentiles: for, <hi>in thee all Nations shall be blessed.</hi> Secondly, All men by nature, and considered without respect had to, and as not having interest in this gracious Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> in Christ, are destitute of all blessings, under the drop of God's wrath and curse, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.—3. and so are really cursed: for, this is imported, while he saith, <hi>in thee,</hi> and not otherwise, <hi>all Nations shall be blessed.</hi> Thirdly, That we who by nature are cursed creatures, should be freed from the curse, and do partake of the contrary bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, it cometh to passe by vertue of that gracious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant made with <hi>Abraham:</hi> and more particularly, it is through Jesus Christ <hi>Abraham</hi>'s seed, in whom we, being ingraffed by faith, are delivered from the curse, ver. 13. for, <hi>In thee,</hi> or <hi>in thy seed (Gen. 22. 18.) all Nations shall be blessed.</hi> Fourthly, The Blessings promised to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s seed, in the Covenant made by God with him, were not only temporal, carnal, and appertaining to this life, but heavenly and spiritual. The former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were often inculcated upon the Ancient Church, <hi>Deut. 28. 2, 3, &amp;c.</hi> not, as if these had been all, or the main Blessings of the Covenant, but as they were sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows only of things more heavenly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 14, 15, 16. for, the Apostle explaineth one part at least of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings promised, to be Justification by Faith; <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture foreseeing that God would justifie the Heathen by Faith, saith, In thee shall Nations be blessed.</hi> Fifthly, The man


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44180:67"/>
who is justified by Faith, is a blessed man; and there is no blessednesse under the Sun comparable unto this, for a man to have his sin pardoned, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 1. and the Righteousnesse of Christ imputed unto him, and so to be placed in a state of favour with God: for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle expoundeth the Blessing promised, by <hi>being justified: The Scripture foreseeing that God would justifie the Heathen by Faith.</hi> Sixthly, This Promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth in it the summe of the Gospel, to wit, the glad tydings of all spiritual blessings, and particularly of a free-gifted Righteousnesse, purchased by Christ, to be bestowed upon all who by Faith should be ingraffed in Christ, and that the Gentiles should have accesse in the dayes of the Gospel, to these Blessings among the rest: for, the Promise holdeth out all this; and <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the revealing of this Promise, the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; <hi>The Scripture preached before the Gospel unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi> Seventhly, The Gospel therefore is no new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but the same in substance with that which was taught to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to the Church under the Old Testament: for, saith he, <hi>The Scripture preached before the Gospel unto Abraham.</hi> Eightly, Though the Gospel, or glad tydings of Salvation, was not unknown to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church; yet it was but a very small glimmering light which they had of it, in comparison with what we do now enjoy: all that Scripture recordeth <hi>Adam</hi> and the Patriarchs to have had of it, was in that obscure Promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and all that <hi>Abraham</hi> had of it, was in this Promise here mentioned, which, though it was much clearer than the former, because the day-light of the Gospel under the New Testament, was then draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nearer; yet it was far short in clearnesse and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of these Gospel-promises which we do now enjoy, as <hi>Joh, 3. 16. Scripture preached before the Gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all Nations be blessed.</hi> Ninthly, The blessing of Justification by Faith, and of other spiritual favours promised to the Nations in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> was such, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was not the author of it, but


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44180:67"/>
a sharer in it with the rest of those to whom it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised: so he inferreth from the Blessing promised to <hi>Abraham, That we are blessed with faithfull</hi> Abraham. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. Eminent Priviledges bestowed by God upon particular persons, do not exempt them from walking to Heaven in the common path-way with others, if so they look for it at all: for, <hi>Abraham,</hi> though highly priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be the father of Believers, ver. 7. in whom all Nations were to be blessed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. yet behoved to enjoy the Blessing, not because of his own merit, but freely and by Faith as well as others, as is imported in the Epithet of <hi>Faithful,</hi> given to <hi>Abraham; We are blessed with faithful Abraham;</hi> not with circumcised vertuous <hi>Abraham.</hi> 6. God, in bestowing of Blessings promised upon condition of Faith, doth not so much look upon the greatnesse of Faith, as the truth and sincerity of it: for, though every one <hi>who are of Faith,</hi> believe not so strongly as <hi>Abraham</hi> did; yet <hi>they are blessed with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Abraham.</hi>

                  <p>HEre is a third Argument, to prove that we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith, and not by Works; because they who seek to be justified by the works of the Law, are under the curse of God, and so not justified; which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, because according to Scripture <hi>(Deut.</hi> 27. 26.) the Law pronounceth the curse upon every man, who ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth not the whole Law in every tittle or jot of it: now he taketh it for granted that none fulfill the whole Law, and so doth leave unto them to gather that the Law doth fasten the curse upon all who seek Justification by it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That <hi>Paul</hi> doth mean the Works not only of the Ceremonial Law, but also of the Moral, all alongs this dispute, while he excludeth Works from being the


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44180:68"/>
cause of Justification, appeareth from the Scripture here cited, which is verified mainly in the Moral Law, as it appeareth from these sins in particular, against which the Levites were to denounce the curse, all of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing transgressions of the Moral Law, <hi>Deut. 27. 15, 16, &amp;c.</hi> to the end: <hi>For it is written, Cursed is every one.</hi> 2. Fallen man, is so far from attaining to a state of favour with God and happinesse here or hereafter, by any Works which he can do; that when he hath done the utmost, even of what his natural strength or renewed faculties of grace can reach, if he seek to be justified by it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth under God's curse and wrath, notwithstanding of all: for, the Apostle affirmeth universally of all, <hi>that are of the works of the Law,</hi> that is, who seek to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by works done in obedience to the Law, (for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was the great controversie) that <hi>they are under the curse.</hi> 3. The cursed estate of man by nature through sin and misery, together with that impossibility he lyeth under, to be recovered from that wofull estate, and to regain a state of favour with God by any work of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse which he doth, is a thing known, not by the discoursing of natural reason, which, being blind in the things of God, cannot judge aright neither of its own misery, nor of the way of recovery from it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. The knowledge of those is borrowed from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-light, whose sentence alone is to be stood to in this matter: hence <hi>Paul</hi> appealeth to Scripture for probation of what he hath herein affirmed; <hi>For it is written,</hi> saith he, <hi>Cursed is every one.</hi> 4. Every sin, even the least, as being a wrong done against God, <hi>(Iam.</hi> 2. 11.) who is infinit in all His Attributes <hi>(Job</hi> 11. 7, 8, 9.) and a transgression of His holy and righteous Law (1 <hi>Joh. 3. 4. Rom.</hi> 7. 12.) deserveth no lesse than that the curse of God should light upon the sinner; under which curse is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all the miseries of this life <hi>(Lam.</hi> 3. 39.) death it self, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 6. 23-.) and the pains of Hell for ever, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41, 46-. for, so the Scripture cited affirmeth, <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things,</hi> that is,


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44180:68"/>
who transgresseth in one thing. 5. There is no person whether rich or poor, noble or ignoble, learned or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, whose sin deserveth not the forementioned curse: The consideration indeed of the person of some sinners, doth aggrege their sin beyond the sin of others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 17. to 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but no consideration of the person of any can so far extenuate his sin, as to make it not deserving of God's wrath and curse: for, saith he, <hi>Cursed is every one,</hi> without exception, <hi>who continueth not.</hi> 6. Not only sins of commission, or doing of that which the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth, but also sins of omission, or the leaving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done of what the Law commandeth, do deserve the curse: for, saith he, <hi>Cursed is every one,</hi> not only who doth what the Law forbiddeth, <hi>but who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them.</hi> 7. It is not the bare knowledge of our duty, nor yet a fair profession of love and respect to our duty so known, which cometh up to that exact righteousnesse, that the Law requireth under hazard of the curse; there must be practice also according to that knowledge: for, <hi>Cursed is every one who continueth not to do them.</hi> 8. This real obedience and practice that the Law of God requireth under hazard of the curse, is universal, extending it self to the conscience-making of all duties commanded, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the way wherein they are commanded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 8. and to the abstaining from all sins forbidden, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their occasions, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 1. for, <hi>Cursed is every one who continueth not in All things,</hi> he saith not, in some things only. 9. This obedience required, is also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, from the first minute of a man's life, to the hour of his death; so that though he should but once sin, he is under the curse; for, <hi>Cursed is every one who coutinueth not to do them.</hi> 10. It is altogether impossible for any one of fallen mankind, either of himself <hi>(Joh.</hi> 15. -5.) or, by any grace received in this life (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 8.) to keep the Law perfectly, or to attain to that exact mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of righteousnesse, that the Law requireth; which appeareth, not only from what the Law requireth, as it


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44180:69"/>
hath been formerly cleared, but also from this; <hi>Paul</hi> takes it here for a confessed and granted conclusion: for, if any could keep the Law, then every man who seeketh to be justified by the works of the Law, should not be cursed, providing they did what they could, as <hi>Paul</hi> here affirmeth, seing the Law doth curse none but those who do not keep the Law; <hi>For as many as are of the works of the Law, are under the curse: for it is written, &amp;c.</hi> 11. Though every man doth break the Law, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth that curse, which is pronounced against sin by the Law; Yet all are not left to perish under this curse, some are delivered from it, to wit, those that <hi>are of Faith,</hi> or, who by Faith lay hold on Jesus Christ for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, who was made a curse for them, ver. 13. such ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fled from the sentence and curse of the Law, and laid hold on the Covenant of Grace revealed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, shall be judged not by the Law, but the Gospel, which admitteth of the Righteousnesse of a Cautioner imputed <hi>(Philip.</hi> 3. 9.) instead of an exact personall righteousnesse, required by the Law: for, saith the Apostle, <hi>As many as are of the works of the Law, are under the curse,</hi> and so, not they who are of Faith. 12. Those who do not betake themselves to the Covenant of Grace, must stand and fall according to the sentence of the Law, or Covenant of Works; and therefore seing the Law doth curse them (as not having come up to the exact righteousnesse required in it) cursed are they, and cursed shall they be: for, saith he, <hi>They who are of the Law,</hi> or, seek Justification by the Law, <hi>are cursed;</hi> because the Law seeketh more than they can perform.</p>

The force of which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as the Apostle declareth, doth ly in this, that <hi>the Law is not of Faith,</hi> that is, the way of Justification, which the Law prescribeth, (to wit, the <hi>Law,</hi> as strictly taken for the meer precepts, legal promises, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings of the Law, See chap. 2. ver. 15.) doth not consist with the way of Justification by Faith; because the Law promiseth life to him only who observeth what the Law prescribeth, and so hath a perfect inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, as he proveth from <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. but Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyeth life to him who is destitute of that righteousnesse, if he believe on Him that justifieth the ungodly by Faith, as he hath cleared frequently before (See <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5.) and so doth not expresse it now, ver. 12. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is a twofould Justification of a sinner, one which is in the sight of God, and is here expressed, whereby he is reputed and standeth righteous and just in the estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God the Judge, whose judgment is unerring, and alwayes according to Truth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. 20. Another, which is before men, and is here implyed, whereby the sinner is reputed and standeth righteous in the estimation of men, whose judgment, as flowing from charity (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7.) and grounded upon outward appearance (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. -7.) may frequently erre and be deceived; <hi>But that no man is justified in the sight of God.</hi> 2. Though God do not justifie any, or esteem of him as righteous for any works done in obedience to the Law; Yet that a man may be justified in man's sight because of his works, is not here denied by the Apostle: for, Justification before men is nothing else, but a charitable judgment past up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the person, that God hath justified him by Faith; which judgment is grounded upon the evidences of the person's faith, manifested in the fruits of good works, <hi>Iam. 2. -18. But that no man is justified by the Law in


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44180:70"/>
Gods sight, &amp;c.</hi> 3. The spirit of Error being once given way to, doth so far blind the understanding <hi>(Isa.</hi> 44. 20.) that it cannot see, and so far engage the will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the maintaining of it (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3.) that the person erring will not see what Scripture saith against that Error, though it be never so evident to an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent eye: for, though the maintainers of Justification by Works, would not, or could not see it; yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, even of the Old Testament, did give clear testimony against that Error, and for the contrary Truth; <hi>It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) for, the Just shall live.</hi> 4. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Justification by Faith, and not by Works, is no new-fangled opinion, the Scriptures, even of the Old Testament, give testimony to it, as the only way of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification before God, which then was: for, <hi>Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that none are justified by the Law, from an Old Testament-Scripture, cited out of <hi>Hab. 2. -4. The Just shall live by Faith.</hi> 5. The Scripture cited, teacheth, first, That the way of justifying a sinner, or of making him righteous under the Old Testament, and under the New, is the same; and therefore we may safely draw arguments from the one to the other: for, so doth the Apostle here, <hi>It is evident: for, The Just shall live by faith.</hi> Secondly, Faith in God, and His Promises, especially these wherein Jesus Christ and His Righteousnesse are offered, is that which maketh a sinner just and righteous in God's sight; for, the words may be rendred thus, <hi>The Just by Faith shall live;</hi> so that they shew what that is, which makes a man just and righteous. Thirdly, The man who is thus just by Faith, is recovered from that state of death, wherein every man by nature lyeth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1.) and doth live; which life of his, doth also flow from faith: for, both righteousnesse and life are here ascribed to faith; <hi>The Just shall live by Faith.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, This life by Faith, which the Believer doth enjoy, is such, as furnisheth him with comfortable through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing in the midst of hardest dispensations, without apostasie and fainting, in so far as he doth not walk

Though the Law and Faith, or the Gospel which is the Doctrine of Faith, be not contrary each to other (both of them being the Truths of God) but are mutually subservient one to another in many things, the Law making sin known, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. -20. the Gospel holding forth the remedy of sin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 29. the Law pointing forth our need of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. and the Gospel giving us an offer of Christ for life and righteousnesse, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. The Law again holding forth those duties wherein the man, made righteous by Faith, ought to walk, and to testifie his thankfulnesse, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 1, 2. and the Gospel, or Faith in Jesus Christ of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Gospel, furnishing him with spirituall strength to walk in these duties, which the Law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth,

2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. -6. Yet, the Law and Faith are mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inconsistent in the point of Justification; so that if Justification be sought by the works of the Law, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had by Faith; and if it be had by Faith, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained by the works of the Law; there can be no mixture of Law and Gospel, Faith and Works in this matter: for, in this sense the Apostle affirmeth, <hi>The Law is not of Faith.</hi> 2. The Law doth offer life to none up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on easier terms than perfect obedience, and the constant and universal practice of whatsoever the Law prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth; for, the voice of the Law is, <hi>The man that doth them,</hi> to wit those things that the Law enjoyneth, <hi>shall live in them,</hi> or attain eternal life by his so doing. 3. The way of Justification by Faith, doth wholly exclude our doing and works, and those of every sort, from having influence as causes or conditions, either in part or in whole, upon our Justification before God: for, the Apostle proveth the inconsistency of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> in the point of Justification from this, that the Law sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth our right to life upon the condition of doing and works; and therefore the way of Justification by Faith, must wholly exclude Works, else the Apostle should not cogently have proved the thing intended, to wit, That the Law is inconsistent with Faith, from this, <hi>That he who doth them shall live in them.</hi>

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44180:71"/>
by Him, are applied to Believers: for, the Apostle, obviating an objection, which he foresaw might arise from ver. 10. (to wit, If the Law do curse all men, how then are any freed from the curse?) sheweth, that Jesus Christ hath delivered us from God's wrath, or the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the Law's curse, by taking upon Himself the curse due to us, while He was obedient to death, even the death of the crosse, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 8. Which kind of death was pronounced to be accursed, as he proveth from <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. -23. This is contained ver. 13. And hence he shewes a double fruit did flow: the first, to the Gentiles, the blessing of Church-priviledges, divine Ordinances, and of Reconciliation, Adoption, Grace here, and Glory hereafter, promised to the Nations in <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22. 18. being now purchased by Christ, and residing in Him as the Head and Fountain, did come through Him to the unrighteous Gentiles, who before the time of Christ's death were strangers to Christ, and to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s blessing purchased by Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. The second fruit of Christ's death, did accresse to the Jews (among whom he reckoneth himself) joyntly with the Gentiles, who being by Christ's death joyned in one, did enjoy the Promise of the Spirit, or the spiritual Promise, as being now denuded of these earthly and external Ceremonies, wherewith it was vailed formerly, and set forth in its native and spiritual beauty and lustre: both which fruits of Christ's death he sheweth are conveyed unto, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by both Jews and Gentiles only by Faith: So that the Apostle in these two Verses, doth not only prove the main Conclusion, That Faith, laying hold on Christ, is that which delivereth from the Law's curse, and which conveyeth <hi>Abraham</hi>'s blessing, together with the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-promise, unto us, and so doth justifie us; but also indirectly, and (as it were) at the by, hinteth at two other Truths, tending also to clear the main controversie between him and his adversaries, which therefore he is to assert more directly afterwards, to wit, first, That now after Christ's death, the Gentiles being called by the


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44180:72"/>
Gospel, were to be joyned in one body with the Jews, and both of them to make up one seed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and equally to partake of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s blessing, whereof free Justification through Faith, spoken of, ver. 9. was a main part. And, secondly, that the Covenant-promise (that God would be a God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7.) was now after Christ's death to be held forth more clearly and spiritually, the types and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of earthly Ceremonies, and of that legal Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, under which it was formerly hid, being laid aside.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 13. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The threatnings of the Law, denouncing a curse against those who yeeld not personal obedience to it, did not exclude or forbid a Surety to come in the sinners room, and to undergo the curse due unto Him: for, though it be clear from ver. 10. that the Law doth curse all; yet this impeded not, but Christ might come <hi>to redeem us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us.</hi> 2. Every man by nature, the Elect not excepted, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. -3. are under the sentence of the Law's curse, whereby in God's justice they are under the power of darknesse, <hi>(Col.</hi> 1. 13.) slavery and bondage to sin and Satan, <hi>(Eph.</hi> 2. -2.) so to remain until they be cast in utter darknesse, <hi>Jude,</hi> 13. except delivery and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption do interveen: for, while it is said, <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law,</hi> it is supposed that by nature we are under it. 3. There is no delivery of enslaved man from this wofull bondage, but by giving satisfaction, and by paying of a price for the wrong done to Divine Justice, either by himself, or by some surety in his stead; God's fidelity <hi>(Gen.</hi> 2. 17.) His righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous nature <hi>(Psal.</hi> 11. 6, 7.) and the inward desert of sin <hi>(Rom.</hi> 1. 32.) do call for it; for, <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law:</hi> the word signifieth to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by giving a price. 4. It is not in the power of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len man to acquire a ransom for himself by any thing he can either do or suffer, whereby Justice may be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and he delivered from this state of slavery and bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44180:72"/>
The redemption of the soul is precious, and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth for ever (to wit) among men, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49. 8. for, if man could redeem himself, Christ had not been put to it <hi>to redeem us from the curse of the Law.</hi> 5. Jesus Christ the second Person of the blessed Trinity, hath undertaken this great work of redeeming captive-man from his sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and bondage, and accordingly hath accomplished it. The work was indeed undertaken at the appointment of all the Persons, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 68. to whom also the price was paid, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. only the execution of this work, was by that wise design of sending the second Person in the flesh to become man; that so he might not only have right as our near kinsman, <hi>Ruth</hi> 3. 12, 13. but also be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to redeem, as having a price to lay down for our ransom, <hi>Heb. 10. 5. Christ hath redeemed us.</hi> 1. Our Redeemer, Jesus Christ, is true God, who being man's Creator, and having entred a Covenant of friendship with man at the beginning, by vertue whereof He had interest in man, not only as His creature, but as one in state of friendship with Himself; from which blessed state man did fall, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 29. and so brought himself and all his posterity (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21—) to this state of bondage wherein he now is: for, so much is imported, while Christ is said to <hi>redeem;</hi> Redemption being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly of those things which once were our own, but for the time are lost; <hi>Christ hath redeemed us,</hi> saith he. 7. This work of man's Redemption, undertaken and accomplished by Christ, was a Redemption properly so called; our freedom and delivery being obtained, not by power or strong hand meerly, nor yet coming from the sole condescension and pity of the injured party, without seeking reparation for former injuries, but by the payment of a sufficient price, and by giving a just satisfaction to a provoked God; as appeareth not only from the word rendred <hi>redeem;</hi> which, as said is, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>to buy with a price,</hi> but also from this, that the price is condescended upon, to wit, Christ's undergoing the curse of the Law due to us; and this He did <hi>for us,</hi> that


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44180:73"/>
is, not only for our good, but also in our room and stead: for, by His undergoing this curse, we are freed from it, so that although to <hi>buy</hi> or <hi>redeem,</hi> be sometimes taken im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, and doth signifie to obtain a thing without any price, <hi>Isa.</hi> 52. 3. yet what is presently said, and other circumstances do evince, that in this work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption performed by Christ, the word must be taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for a delivery obtained by a payment of a just price; <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the Law, being made a curse for us.</hi> 8. The price paid by Christ, in order to our redemption, was no lesse than His under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going that curse of the Law, which was due to us: whence it followeth that Christ's sufferings, by way of satisfaction, were not only in His body, but also in His soul: He did not only wrestle with the fear of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. -7. but was also deprived of that joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, or the sense and feeling of God's favour and help, which He formerly enjoyed; and had His own sad conflicts and agonies arising in His Soul hereupon, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 46. which, though in us they would necessarily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce sin, yet in Christ they did not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. -15. because of His most pure nature, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. for, <hi>He was made the curse of the Law for us.</hi> Now the curse of the Law did reach to the terrors of the soul, as well as to the pains of the body. 9. Though Jesus Christ, as considered in His own Person, was altogether holy and innocent, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. -9. and alwayes, even when He was made a curse, most beloved of the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. yet being considered as our Surety <hi>(Heb.</hi> 7. 22.) and sustaining our person, He was the object of sin-pursuing justice, and no more spared than if we our selves who sinned, had been in His place: for, the Text saith, He was not only accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>but made a curse,</hi> in the abstract, to shew how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was accursed in death; neither was this execration only in respect of man, who indeed did judge Him exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 3, 4. but also in respect of God, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the testimony alleaged out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 23. for, though the Apostle, intending the sense only, and


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44180:73"/>
not the words, omitteth the mentioning of <hi>God;</hi> Yet in the place cited we have it thus, <hi>He that is hanged, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed of God.</hi> 10. The malefactor among the Jews, who was adjudged to end his life by hanging on a tree, was pronounced by God to be a curse, or accursed; not as if every one who died that death, even notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their repentance, had been rejected of God, and condemned, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 39, 43. but partly, because that was a most odious and infamous death in it self, as being aflicted only for atrocious and heinous crimes; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because it was fore-ordained of God, that Christ our Surety should end His life by that kind of death, in order to our redemption and delivery from the Law's deserved curse; for which cause mainly, God was pleased to pronounce that kind of death accursed above any other; as appeareth from the Apostle's alleaging this Scripture, to clear that Christ was made a curse for us; <hi>It is written,</hi> saith he, <hi>Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From Vers. 14. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. So wonderfull is God in working, especially in that great work of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, that He bringeth about one contrary by another; He giveth life by death, and the blessing by the curse; and frequently in His way of working, our choicest mercies do come through greatest miseries: for, <hi>Christ was made a curse, that the blessing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come upon the Gentiles.</hi> 2. The blessing promised to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and to the Nations in <hi>Abraham,</hi> or rather in Christ <hi>Abraham</hi>'s seed, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 22. 18.) was not of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things only, as of Corn and Wine, of a fat and rich soile: these were only the shell, but the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell of that Promise were blessings of another sort, even spiritual, such as Grace here, and Glory hereafter; which appeareth from this, that before this blessing could be conveyed to <hi>Abrahams</hi> believing seed, a price of infinite value behoved to be paid for it, a price too precious to purchase any temporal blessing by; for, <hi>even Christ was made a curse, that the blessing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gentiles.</hi> 3. The spiritual blessing of Grace here


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44180:74"/>
and Glory hereafter, promised to, and in <hi>Abraham,</hi> as it was purchased by Christ at a dear rate, so it resideth and is exstant in Him, who is as it were the storehouse, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the blessing is laid up <hi>(Col.</hi> 2. 3.) and the dispenser of it unto <hi>Abraham</hi>'s seed <hi>(Act.</hi> 5. 31.) in whom Believers are truly blessed <hi>(Gen.</hi> 22. 18.) and from whose fulnesse we do all receive, and Grace for Grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. for, saith the Text, <hi>That the blessing of</hi> Abraham <hi>might come upon the Gentiles through Jesus Christ;</hi> or, as it is in the Original, <hi>in Jesus Christ:</hi> So that this blessing is still in Him, as the fountain and dispenser of it. 4. Though Jesus Christ was the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. -8. in so far as remission of sins and life eternal, were bestowed upon Believers under the Old Testament, through the merit of His death, even before He actually died, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. it being sufficient, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to these effects, that it was transacted between the Father and the Son, that He should die, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 10. and that it was certainly known by God that He would die, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 18. Yet, there were some effects of His death, and those of great advantage to the Church, both of Jews and Gentiles, which were keeped in store, and in Gods wise dispensation not to be actually bestowed, untill the time of His death; As, first, in relation to the Gentiles, the real making-over of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s blessing unto them, whereby they were made one actual seed unto <hi>Abraham</hi> with the believing Jews, was to follow upon Christ's death, God having so provided, and not to go before it: for, <hi>Christ was first made a curse,</hi> by being hanged on a tree, before <hi>the blessing of</hi> Abraham <hi>did come upon the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> Secondly, in relation to both Jew and Gentile, the Covenant-promise made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed <hi>(Gen.</hi> 17. 7.) which before Christ's death was vailed over with many carnal Ceremonies, and lay hid under the many reiterated Promises of temporal blessings and an earthly <hi>Canaan, Gen. 15. 7, &amp;c.</hi> was after Christs death to be made more clear, the vail of Ceremonies and earthly blessings to be removed, and the promised blessings of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44180:74"/>
and life everlasting to be held forth in their spiritual beauty and lustre: for, upon Christ's being made a curse, he saith, <hi>We,</hi> to wit, not only the Gentiles, but the Jews also, of whom <hi>Paul</hi> was one, <hi>do receive the promise of the Spirit,</hi> that is, after the manner of speaking used by the Hebrews, <hi>the spiritual promise,</hi> in opposition to those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal rites and shadows under which it did formerly lurk. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. Though by the grace of saving Faith, a Christian believeth to be true whatever he knoweth to be revealed in the Word, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. -14. and is in some measure (especially when Faith is lively) affected, and doth practise according to what each Truth calleth for, yeelding obedience to the Commands, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.—26. trembling at threatnings, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. -2. and imbracing the Promises of God for this life <hi>(Psal.</hi> 23. 1.) and that which is to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. Yet, the principal acts of Faith, as it is saving and justifying, are the accepting and receiving of the Promise, and of Christ's satisfaction to the Father's justice, held forth in the Promise: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of Faiths part in Justification, setteth forth the exercise of it thus, <hi>That we might receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise by Faith.</hi> 6. Faith doth justifie and make us blessed, not for any worth in it self, as if the work and merit of Faith were reckoned to us for righteousnesse, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the instrument, and, as it were, the hand of the soul, whereby we receive the Promise, and Christ in the Promise, whose satisfaction alone is our only righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before God, <hi>Rom,</hi> 5. -19. for, that <hi>Paul</hi> is to be understood thus all alongs this dispute, appeareth from these two Verses, wherein he ascribeth our delivery from the curse, and partaking of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s blessing, to Christ's merit, or to His being made a curse for us, giving unto Faith only the receeiving and imbracing of that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as it is offered in the Promise; <hi>That we might receive the Promise through Faith,</hi> saith he.</p>

Now to Abraham and his seed were the Promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. 17. And this I say, that the Covenant that was confirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of God in Christ, the Law which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disanul, that it should make the Promise of none effect. 18. For if the inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of Promise: but God gave it to Abraham by Promise.</head>
                  <p>THe Apostle, having confirmed the truth of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine by several Arguments, doth in the second part of the Chapter, answer some Objections, and joyntly herewith refuteth the other Error, maintained by his adversaries, about the necessity of observing the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law; shewing, that however the <hi>Law,</hi> or the legal way of dispensing the Covenant of Grace prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed unto <hi>Moses</hi> upon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> was for good use, so long as by God's appointment it was to stand in force; yet, Christ being now come in the flesh, the date, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed for its continuance, was now expired, and so the Christian Church of Jews and Gentiles wholly freed from the observation of it.</p>
                  <p>The first Objection, as may be gathered by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, was to this purpose, That granting what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle had said concerning Justification by Faith in the Promise, and not by Works, did hold true, before the Law was given by <hi>Moses;</hi> yet afterwards that way of Justification seemeth to have been altered, and Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Works established according to the tenour of the Law given by God on mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> seing that latter Acts and constitutions do not only stand in force, but also abrogate the former, in so far, at least, as they are inconsistent with the latter.</p>

                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:44180:75"/>
The Apostle answereth by a comparison, which he sheweth is taken from humane affairs; and, first, setteth down the similitude to this purpose, That a Covenant or Paction made among men for preserving mutual peace and friendship, being once confirmed by Oath, and other usual solemnities, cannot without imputation of levity or injustice be disannulled and quite broken, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any condition destructive to the former, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to it, ver. 15. And, secondly, That he may apply this similitude with greater evidence and force, he first sheweth, the nature of that Covenant, made by God with <hi>Abraham,</hi> did consist in Promises, wherein the blessing promised is given freely, and not for the merit and worth of our obedience and works (as the word rendred <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> doth signifie) and next he sheweth, that all <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s seed, not only those who lived before the giving of the Law, but those also who lived after; and not only the Jews, but also the Gentiles were comprehended in the Covenant, and to partake of the promised Blessing, according to the tenour of it; which he proveth from the formal words of the Covenant-tender, which express all those who were to partake of the covenanted Blessing, by the name of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of his <hi>Seed,</hi> in the singular number, to shew, that it is under one and the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, that they all are his seed, and do partake of his promised Blessing; otherwise, if it had been Gods purpose to convey the heavenly Inheritance unto some upon their Faith in the Promise, and unto others for the merit of their Works, Then the Promise should have been made unto his <hi>Seeds</hi> in the plural number, as point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the different grounds of this their spiritual relation unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not unto his <hi>Seed</hi> in the singular; which seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is here called <hi>Christ,</hi> to wit, Christ mystical, which comprehendeth Christ the Head, and all Believers, whether before the Law or after, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jew or Gentile, as the Members of that Body whereof Christ is the Head: all of which are designed by the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor. 12. -12. Col.</hi> 1. 24. and


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44180:76"/>
so here, to shew, that not <hi>Moses,</hi> not the Law, not Works, but Christ, the Promise, and faith in Christ, and the Promise is the bond and ty of this Union pleaded-for in <hi>Abrahams</hi> seed, ver. 16. Thirdly, He applyeth the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude taken from the unchangeablnesse of humane Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and inferreth, that much lesse can that Covenant which was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, or any condition destructive be added to it by the Law, which was given four hundred and thirty years after: which consequence, is inforced by four Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, 1. It was a Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> not by a man like himself, but by God. 2. It was not only made, but long before ratified and confirmed, both by the Oath of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 14. and other more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary solemnities, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 9, 10, &amp;c. And, 3. a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, not only made and confirmed, but a Covenant confirmed in Christ, or, (as the Original will bear) <hi>looking toward Christ,</hi> as Him alone, upon whom the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of that Covenant did depend, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 18. So that if this Covenant had been abrogated, whether by the Law or any other thing, there had been no necessity of sending Christ. And, 4. because this Covenant, upon Gods part was a free absolute Promise, the performance whereof did not depend upon the works of the other party, and so their unworthinesse could be no pretence for the abrogation of it: this inference from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, is ver, 17. And, fourthly, Because some, in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the present Objection, might have urged, that though the giving of the Law did not fully abrogate the way of Justification by Faith in the Promise; Yet this much behoved to be granted, that the Law and Works were to be conjoyned, at least, with the Promise and Faith in the point of Justification; Therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle answereth, ver. 18. that even this much cannot be granted; and that because Works and Faith, Law and Promise are inconsistent as to the point of conveying a right to the covenanted Inheritance, so that if the works of the Law have any influence upon our Justification,


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44180:76"/>
and right to Heaven, the free-gifted Promise made of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and Faith in that Promise can have none, and thus the confirmed Covenant should yet be abrogated; the absurdity whereof he hath already shewen, to wit, ver. 17.</p>

Though the Servants of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ will be necessitated sometimes to use some more than ordinary sharpness of speech in their reproofs toward the People of God committed to their charge; yet they are carefully to guard, lest their affections be imbittered against them, and would alwayes keep love and affection toward them; yea, and testifie their love to them, even when they do most sharply reprove them: for, the Apostle, though he upbraided these Galatians with folly, ver. 1. Yet here he testifieth, that neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he loved them, while he calleth them <hi>Brethren; Brethren, I speak after the manner of men.</hi> 2. It is not only lawful, but also exceedingly conducing for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of hearers, that Ministers make use of simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and examples, taken from things natural, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 38, &amp;c.) artificial <hi>(Iam.</hi> 3. 7.) or from common custom among men, for clearing or confirming of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Truths to the understanding, and for inforcing the practice of some spiritual duty upon the will and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 24. for, similitudes from things earthly, as being more notour unto us, do conduce much, not only to illustrate things spiritual, but also to bring them frequently to our remembrance afterwards, especially, when those earthly things, from which the similitude is taken, do occur in our daily imployments: Hence the Apostle professeth he would <hi>speak after the manner of men,</hi> that is, he would make use of a similitude taken from the custom of men in their civil affairs for clearing of the Truth in hand. 3. As it is lawfull for men, whether particular persons or Nations, to enter a Covenant or paction for keeping of mutual peace and friendship, and to confirm their Covenant so made by subscription, oath (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 16, 17.) and other lawfull and accustomed

olemnities, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 31. 51, &amp;c.) that hereby it may be the more esteemed-of as sacred and inviolable: So it is a mark of extream inconstancy, and carryeth with it the guilt of high perfidie for those who have once entred such a Covenant, to disanul, alter, or adde to it at their pleasure, or to stand to it no longer than it maketh for their own advantage: for, saith he, <hi>Though it be but a mans Covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disanulleth, or addeth thereto: No man,</hi> to wit, even the men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves who made the Paction; else the similitude would not quadrate to the Truth, for illustration whereof it is made use of, to wit, that even God Himself that made the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, could have no such purpose in giving the Law, as to alter and abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate that Covenant, as is clear from ver. 17.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 16. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his spiritual seed, is a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of promise, wherein the thing promised is freely bestowed, and not from the merit or worth of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and works; and herein the promises of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant do differ from the promises of the Law or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works: for, by the <hi>Promises,</hi> which signifie a free promise, is meaned the Covenant of Grace; <hi>to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and his seed were the Promises made:</hi> the word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a free promise. 2. This Covenant of Grace is also a Covenant of <hi>Promises,</hi> as containing many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; for, although it sometime have the name of a promise, in the singular number, as ver.—17. from that comprehensive and chief Promise, <hi>I will be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, Gen.</hi> 17. -7. yet it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth a numerous number of other promises, which are as so many rivulets and streams, flowing from that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-promise presently mentioned, even the Promises of the life that now is, and of that which is to come, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. for, saith he <hi>To Abraham and his seed were the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made.</hi> 3. This Covenant of Grace, or Promise, was entred by God with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as accepting the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it, not only for himself, but for his seed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44180:77"/>
all his natural issue, excepting those only who were expresly excepted by God (to wit, all the posterity of <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> who continued and waxed worse in the apostasie of their forefathers from <hi>Abrahams</hi> God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 13.) were comprehended within the Covenant, by vertue whereof, though none did attain Salvation, but those only who did come up to the conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, whereupon Salvation was tendred, to wit, Faith <hi>(Habak.</hi> 2. 4.) and Repentance <hi>(Isa.</hi> 55. 7.) yet all of them did enjoy the priviledge of Ordinances <hi>(Gen.</hi> 17. 10.) and had Salvation offered unto them, <hi>(Joh.</hi> 4. 22.) not absolutely, but upon Gods terms revealed in His Word, to wit, if only they would believe and repent: hence, saith the Apostle, <hi>To Abraham and his seed were the Promises made.</hi> 4. As the Christian Church of the Gentiles is <hi>Abraham</hi>'s spiritual seed, as well as the Church of the Jews, and was looked upon as his seed in that Covenant-promise made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. -5. compared with <hi>Rom</hi> 4. 16, 17-. So it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one and the same consideration that both Jew and Gentile, and all who reckon spiritual kindred to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> are his seed, to wit, as they follow the steps of his Faith, and at least do professe that Doctrine of free Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by Faith, wherein <hi>Abraham</hi> walked, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 12, (See the distinction of the <hi>seeds,</hi> or <hi>children,</hi> ver. 7. doct. 8.) for, seing the Promises, spoken of in the Text, were made to his seed, it seemeth they cannot be that Promise, which aimed principally at Christ, <hi>In thy seed shall all Nations be blessed,</hi> Gen. 22. 18. but the Promises made to his seed, the Church, and chiefly that Promise, <hi>I will be a God unto thee, and to thy seed, Gen.</hi> 17. -7. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the mentioning of <hi>seed</hi> in the singular number, were not an argument of any weight, to prove that Christ per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall was only meaned in the Promise, seing <hi>seed</hi> is a word collective, and may comprehend a number under it, even in the singular number, as the words <hi>Flock, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and such like; so it seemeth most probable, that by the <hi>seed</hi> here is meaned Christ mystical, or Christ with

His Body the Church, made up both of Jew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, who reckon spiritual kindred unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> upon one and the same account; and therefore are designed in the Promise by <hi>seed,</hi> and not <hi>seeds; He saith not, And to seeds, as of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So strict and near is that union which is betwixt Christ and the Church, that not only is He the Churches Head <hi>(Eph.</hi> 1. 22.) but also as the Church is His Body and fulnesse, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 23. So Christ is mystically and virtually the fulnesse of the Church, in so far as it is He dwelling and working in them by the efficacy of His Spirit, who separateth them from the world, maketh them one mystical Body among themselves, and one with Himself, and worketh all their works in them, even those which belong to Him, not only as the Head, but, which also belong to them, as Members of the Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11, 12. for, hence is it, that the whole belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> is here called <hi>Christ,</hi> He being the bond of their union, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21. the fountain of their life and motion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14. and the active immediate principle from which all their spiritual actions do flow, <hi>Joh. 15. 5.

                  <p>From Vers. 17. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. That though God might have dealt with man by way of soveraignity, as an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Monarch, enjoyning to man his duty, without giving him any ground to hope for a reward of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; yet He hath been graciously pleased to wave such right, and to deal with him by way of covenant, or pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and agreement, upon just and equal terms, prescribed by God Himself, in which God promiseth true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to man, and man engageth himself by promise for performance of what God requireth: for, as these are the terms in general upon which God did ever enter any Covenant with man; so the Apostle supposeth, that Gods dealing with man is by way of a Covenant, while he saith, <hi>And this I say, that the Covenant that was confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med before of God.</hi> 2. So merciful is God, that after the Covenant of Works, made with man before the fall, was


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44180:78"/>
broken by <hi>Adam (Gen.</hi> 3. 6.) and made uselesse unto all his posterity, as to the obtaining of Heaven and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by it, ver. 10. he was graciously pleased to enter a Covenant of Grace with fallen man, to deliver him from the estate of sin and misery, and to bring him into an estate of salvation by a Redeemer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 21, 22. This is that Covenant here spoken of; <hi>The Covenant that was before confirmed of God in Christ.</hi> 3. Though the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or Paction, entred by God with the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ came in the flesh, did differ in the way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, and in some considerable circumstances, from that Covenant which God hath entered with His people in the dayes of the Gospel, upon which account they are distinguished by the names of <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New, (Heb. 8. 13.) First</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7. yet both these Covenants are one and the same in substance, and do fully agree in all the essential parts: for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's intent, is, to prove, that we are justified under the New Testament, by that Covenant, which <hi>was confirmed before of God in Christ unto Abraham, four hundred and thirty years before the Law.</hi> 4. So prone is fallen man to misbelieve the truth and reality of Gods offer in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 48. and especially to question the making out of that offer to himself in particular, <hi>Psa.</hi> 88. 4, 5, &amp;c. and so willing is God to have all doubts of that kind fully satisfied, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17-. that though His gracious word of promise be of it self worthy of all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation and trust, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. yet He hath been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously pleased to adde all those confirmations unto His Covenant-grant, which are used among men, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most suspected would most gladly be trusted. He hath committed it to writing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 31. confirmed it by witnesses, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 2. 3.) with miracles <hi>(Heb.</hi> 2. 4.) by oath <hi>(Heb.</hi> 6. 13, 17.) and by seals, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 28. &amp; 28. 19. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. for, saith he, <hi>The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that was before confirmed of God.</hi> 5. The Covenant of Grace had a special relation to Jesus Christ, as well under the Old Administration as under the New; He


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44180:79"/>
being that Seed of the Woman, who was to bruise the head of the Serpent, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 3. -15.) and in whom all the Nations of the earth were to be blessed, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 22. 18.) and the substance of all those ceremonial shadows, (the practice whereof was then enjoyned) <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. and being the thing signified in all their Sacraments, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 7. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 4. and God's design in giving the Law, being to drive men to Christ for righteousnesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. for, saith he, <hi>The Covenant was confirmed before of God in Christ,</hi> or, <hi>tending towards Christ,</hi> as the Original will bear. 6. The knowledge of Scripture-chronologie, whereby we know not only those things which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture-story, but also the time when every thing did fall out, so far as may be gathered by the Scripture it self chiefly, is necessary and profitable for the better understanding of God's mind in diverse parts of His Word: for here, the Apostle observeth the time when the Law was given, and layeth the great stresse of his argument upon it, whereby he proveth, that the Law could not disanul the Covenant of free-grace, made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> even because <hi>the Law was four hundred and thirty years after the Covenant was confirmed of God in Christ:</hi> The beginning of which space of years, is to be reckoned from the first solemn sanction and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant by God to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15. 8, &amp;c and the close of it was at the giving of the Law upon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which was the first year of <hi>Israels</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt, Exod. 19. 1. Doct.</hi> 7. God's intent in giving the Law, and urging exact obedience to it under hazard of the curse, neither was, nor is, that hereby people should be taken-off from seeking righteousnesse and life eternal only by faith in the Promise, or, that they should set about the practice of duties commanded by the Law, as that which was to make them righteous before God: the Law was given for other ends, as the Apostle doth after declare; but not for this: for, he sheweth here, that Gods design in giving the Law, could not <hi>disanul the Covenant made with Abraham,</hi> or, <hi>make the Promise of none effect.</hi>
                  </p>

From Vers. 18. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. So subtil is the spirit of Error, that it will seem to cede somewhat to Truth, as hereby intending to prejudge the Truth more than if it had ceded nothing: for, the oppugners of Justification by Faith, did sometimes give Faith some place in Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and pleaded only for a joynt influence of Works and Faith, of the Law and the Promise: which conceit of theirs, the Apostle doth here refute; <hi>For, if the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance be of the Law, it is no more of Promise.</hi> 2. The state of Grace and Favour with God here, and of Glory hereafter, is the inheritance, portion and heirship of the Lord's People; there being no temporal worldly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance which can sufficiently furnish the heart with sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. of which spiritual and heavenly Inheritance, the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was a type: for, the Apostle speaking of Justification, and all the spiritual blessings which flow from it, calleth them the <hi>Inheritance,</hi> by way of excellency; <hi>If the Inheritance be of the Law.</hi> 3. There are only two wayes of attaining a right to this Inheritance; one, by the Law, or by Works done in obedience to the Law, chap. 2. 16-. which was the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Covenant of Works; the other, is by the Promise, or, by Faith in Jesus Christ offered in the Promise, chap. 2. -16-. according to the tenour of the Covenant of Grace. The Apostle speaketh of these two wayes here, <hi>If the Inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of Promise.</hi> 4. There can be no mixture of these two, so that a right to Heaven should be obtained, partly by the merit of Works, and partly by Faith in the promise; the one of those removeth the other: for, saith he, <hi>If the Inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of Promise.</hi> 5. The only way of attaining right to this Inheritance now since the fall, is, by God's Free-gift, without the merit of Works: for, <hi>God did give it to Abraham,</hi> the father of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> justified persons: the word signifieth, He gave it freely, without respect had to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s works. 6. The tender and offer of this gracious gift, is made in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Gospel; which, being laid hold upon by


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44180:80"/>
Faith, do entitle the Believer to the tendered Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 10, 11, 12. for, saith he, <hi>God gave i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>HEre is a second Objection, to wit, If the Law, or works done in obedience to the Law, do not justifie. Then it seemeth the Law hath been given by <hi>Moses</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mount <hi>Sinai</hi> in vain and to no purpose: which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is expressed in a Question, the meaning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is, For what end was the Law at that time delivered, containing such a number of precepts, enjoyning so many moral, judicial and ceremonial duties, promising life unto the obedient? <hi>Lev.</hi> 18. 5. and threatning God's wrath and curse to the disobedient, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was all this, if the inheritance of life eternal come not by the works of the Law? The Apostle answereth, shewing, first, one main end for which the Law was added to the Promise, and so much inculcated at that time, to wit, for the discovery <hi>(Rom.</hi> 3.—20.) and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint of sin, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 39. and for the more through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conviction of the sinners lost and cursed estate in himself because of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 19. He sheweth, secondly, that this servile and childish discipline, as having more of terror than love in it, was to continue only during the infant-state of the Church, until at Christ's coming in the flesh that spiritual seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom the Promise was made, should appear compleat in its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal parts, and both Jew and Gentile be gathered into one Body. But, thirdly, lest he should seem to debase the Law too much, he commendeth it, partly from the ministry of the Angels used therein, <hi>Heb. 2. 2. Act.</hi> 7. 38.


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44180:80"/>
and partly from the mediation of <hi>Moses,</hi> who did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the Word of the Law from God to the people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 5. Which latter, as it serveth to commend the Law, so also to inforce the Apostle's main scope, to wit, That the precepts and threatnings of the Law were only added because of transgressions, and that God intended no such thing, as thereby to hold forth to the people of <hi>Israel</hi> a Covenant of life upon condition of obedience to what the Law required, seing there was a necessity to make use of <hi>Moses,</hi> as a mids-man, to speak between God and the people; which did argue them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to themselves of their own guilt, and therefore durst not approach unto God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. -18, 19. And therefore, fourthly, The Apostle proveth this conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, (ver. 20.) from the office of a Mediator, which is not used but only betwixt disagreeing parties, whence he leaveth them to gather that it had been altogether in vain for God to have entred a Covenant for life, upon condition of works, with such a guilty sinfull people, as could not fulfill the condition required in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and consequently could reap no advantage by it, especially seing, as he expresly affirmeth, God is alwayes one, consonant to Himself, and doth not dispense with one jot of that perfect, universal and constant obedience, required as the condition of obtaining Salvation accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenour of the Covenant of Works, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 19. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. So bent are men upon the abuse of things, in themselves good, (whether divine Ordinances, or any other gift bestowed by God upon them) that they cannot difference betwixt the right use and the abuse of these things, and are apt to conclude, if they may not abuse them to gratifie some one lust or other, that they can serve for no use to them, and so are given by God in vain: Thus the false Apostles conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that if the Law was not given to justifie, it was wholly uselesse; <hi>Wherefore then serveth the Law?</hi> say they. 2. As the Moral Law <hi>(Gen.</hi> 13. 8.) together with


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44180:81"/>
the powerfull working of Gods Spirit in the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 39 9.) and Gods restraining grace, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 20. 6.) the discipline of the Church, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 9. 25.) and the power of Magistracy which then was <hi>(Gen.</hi> 9. 6.) did serve to discover and restrain transgressions, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince sinners of their lost estate because of sin, before the Law given upon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and do yet serve for the same uses and ends to the christian Church: So the Lord was pleased in renewing the Covenant of Grace with His People upon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> to cast it in such a legal mould, as that hereby He might bring down the pride of that stiff-necked people, and the more effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of sin, and of God's curse due to them for sin: which legal dispensation of the Covenant, did stand in this mainly, that the duties and curses of the Law were held forth frequently, fully and clearly, <hi>Exod. 20. 2, &amp;c. Deut. 5. 6, &amp;c. 27. 15, &amp;c.</hi> and 28. 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Promises chiefly of eternal life; yea, and of Christ and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, but sparingly, and for the most part very obscurely under the vail of earthly shadows and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13. and under some dark prophecies, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 7, 8. compared with <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 34. And besides all this, there was a yoke of other duties, over and above the duties of the Moral Law, laid upon them, to wit, the duties of the Law both judicial and ceremonial, <hi>Exod. 24. Lev.</hi> 1. and obedience to them most strictly urged, and that under hazard of the same so much reiterated curse, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. for, saith he, <hi>The Law was added,</hi> to wit, on mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and added to the Covenant-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise made to <hi>Abraham, because of transgressions.</hi> Now, he cannot mean the Moral Law, as to the substance of it; for, that did perpetually sound in the Church ever since it was a Church, even before <hi>Moses, Gen.</hi> 18, 19. and so it was not then added: neither doth he mean by the <hi>Law,</hi> that whole Doctrine, which was delivered from God upon mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> for, that Doctrine did contain in it a Covenant of Grace, the very promise of salvation and pardon of sin through the Messias to come,

                     <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 29. which was formerly made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> only it was cloathed with a more legal dispensation; and so the Law taken so generally, cannot be said to have been added. It remaineth therefore, that by the Law, which was then added to the Promise because of transgressions, must be meaned that legal dispensation of the Covenant of Grace, set down in the body of this second Doctrine, whereby it did at the first view, and without very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate inspection, appear to be a Covenant of Works, although it was really a Covenant of Grace. 3. This legal dispensation of the Covenant of Grace, was not to continue alwayes in the Church, but until the partition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall being broken down at Christ's death <hi>(Eph.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16.) the Gentiles should be called unto the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Church, and, together with the Jews, make up one compleat seed unto <hi>Abraham:</hi> then was the yoke of judicial <hi>(Gen.</hi> 49. 10.) and ceremonial duties <hi>(Act.</hi> 15. 10.) to be taken off; the vail of shadows and dark prophecies, whereby Christ and free-grace were hid and covered, to be laid aside, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11, 12. And though the duties of the Moral Law are yet to be pressed <hi>(Col. 3. 18, &amp;c.)</hi> and the curse of the Law to be denounced against all who are in their natural estate, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 6. yet covenanted grace and furniture for duty, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 17. and Christ's becoming a curse for us, to redeem us from the curse of the Law, are more clearly held forth now in the dayes of the Gospel (ver. 13.) than they were formerly: for, saith he, <hi>It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come, to whom the Promise was made.</hi> 4. The Gospel is so to be commended and preferred unto the Law, as nothing of that honour and respect which is due unto the Law, be taken from it; and the Doctrine of the Law and Gospel are to be so bounded, as neither may encroach upon the other: for, left <hi>Paul</hi> in setting limits between the Law and the Gospel, should seem to vilisie the Law, he commendeth it from this, <hi>That it was ordained by Angels in the hand,</hi> or, by the ministry and service, <hi>of a Mediator.</hi> 5.

                  <p>From Vers. 20. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Conscience of guilt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth God as terrible, and taketh away all confidence from the guilty sinner to approach in a friendly manner by himself to a provoked God: for, no entercourse can be between God and His people, when they are not one, but differ by reason of His peoples sin: <hi>A Mediator is not of one,</hi> saith he: there was a disagreement through sin, which called for a Mediator. 2. The Covenant of Works, entred with <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of innocency, was immediate, no Mediator interveening to make them one, wherein it differeth from the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 6. for, God and man, before the fall, were one, and no disagreement betwixt them because of sin; and so there was no use for a Mediator in the Covenant that was then made: for, <hi>A Mediator is not a Mediator of one,</hi> saith <hi>Paul.</hi> 3. No man can attain to Heaven, or reap, any advantage by a Covenant of Works, except he were perfectly holy, and as free of sin as <hi>Adam</hi> was before his fall: for, the Apostle, proving that God made no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works with them upon mount <hi>Sinal,</hi> and that they could have reaped no benefit by such a Covenant, thinketh it sufficient to evince, that they were then a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people; which he evinceth from this, that they stood in need of a Mids-man betwixt God and them; <hi>Now a Mediator is not a Mediator of one,</hi> saith he. 4.

He answereth, 1. by denying and rejecting the consequence as absurd and abominable. 2. By retorting the Argument against the Adversaries themselves: for, if the Law, or, if our works done in obedience to the Law, could procure eternal life, as they affirmed, Then our righteousnesse before God, should consist in Works, or, the Law should justifie; leaving them to gather, that this would suppose the former Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant by promise to be abolished and quite destroyed by the Law; so that, according to their Doctrine, the Law was both contrary unto, and destructive of the Promise, ver. 21. 3. He answereth directly, shewing the Law, called here <hi>the Scripture,</hi> (or, <hi>that Scripture,</hi> as it is in the Original) while it convinceth, accuseth and


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44180:83"/>
condemneth all mankind for sin, and so concludeth and incloseth all men under sin, and the curse due to sin, as the Judge doth the malefactor in prison, is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but subordinate and subservient to the Promise, in so far, as that hereby the guilty sinner, (being made to lay aside all confidence in his own righteousnesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9.) doth flee by Faith in Jesus Christ for a refuge to the Promise; and so the thing promised, to wit, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and Salvation, becometh the sinner's, and is conveyed upto him, to wit, upon his believing.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 21. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is the way of Hereticks to set Scripture against Scripture, and to make one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture seem to contradict another, except their errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sense and interpretation of Scripture be received, as intended by the Spirit of God: for, these false Apostles did affirm, if so the Law did not give life, but did only discover and accuse for transgressions, then God's mind in the Law should have been contrary to His mind revealed in the Promise: Hence <hi>Paul</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth this question unto himself to answer, <hi>Is the Law then against the Promises of God?</hi> 2. However Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks may labour to fasten such absurdities upon Truth, as if it were contrary to some other parts of God's mind revealed in Scripture; yet their bold allegations will be found alwayes false, and Truth to be ever most conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and never contrary to it self: for, so the Apostle sheweth of the Truth in hand; <hi>God forbid,</hi> saith he: 3. There are some sins (chiefly those that do most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly reflect upon any divine perfection, or attribute of God) the very first motions whereof, ought to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with abhorrency and detestation; and this either when a tentation to commit such sins is presented to us, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 9, 10. or, when the guilt of them, as already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, is intended to be unjustly fastned upon us: for, when <hi>Paul's</hi> adversaries would have charged him with making the Law to contradict the Promise, and so God to be changeable, and not consonant to Himself; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth this blasphemous charge with a <hi>God forbid;</hi> an


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44180:83"/>
expression frequently used by the Apostle to set out his high indignation against somewhat, wherewith his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or doctrine was charged, <hi>Rom. 3. 4. 6. Rom. 6. 2. Doct.</hi> 4. As these absurdities, wherewith the adversaries of Truth are ready to brand the Truth unjustly, do often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by direct and just consequence most directly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon that Error, which they themselves maintain: so, in order to the refutation of Error, (besides the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging of such Reasons and Scripture-Truths as do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly overthrow the Error) it is lawfull and also conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, to present those absurdities which do natively flow from it; that in these the absurdity of the Error it self may be seen, seing no absurd and false position can be drawn by just consequence from that which is a Truth: Thus the Apostle, refuting that error of Justification by Works, doth charge it with that absurdity which his adversaries did labour to fasten upon the contrary Truth, even of being contrary to the Covenant-promise, while he saith, <hi>If there had been a Law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the Law,</hi> and so the Promise had been abolished and made useless. 5. No man can attain to life eternal, being destitute of some righteousnesse, whereby he may be made righteous: for, according to the Apostle, <hi>If the Law could give life,</hi> to wit eternal life, it behoved also to have given righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse; <hi>verily righteousness should have been by the Law.</hi> 6. So exact and full is that righteousnesse that is required in order to life, (See ver. 10.) and so far short do all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind come of that righteousnesse in themselves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 23: that no works of our own, done in obedience to the Law, can amount to that righteousnesse: for, he speaketh of it as a great absurdity once to imagine, <hi>that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse should have been by the Law.</hi> 7. Whoever main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a life-procuring righteousnesse by Works, they do in effect abolish and destroy that Free-grace held forth in the Promise, in so far as they make the Promise uselesse and in vain, ascribing that to Works, which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effect of Grace in the Promise, and which cannot


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44180:84"/>
be effectuated by our imperfect Works; for when, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the strain of the argument, it would have been said, <hi>Verily</hi> the Law should have been contrary to the Promise, in its place, and as the equivalent of that, he saith, <hi>Verily righteousnesse should have been by the Law.</hi>

The Scripture, especially the Law of God in its strict commands, large accusations, and most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere threatnings, doth serve abundantly to convince all mankind to be heinous sinners, and under the drop of God's terrible curse for sin, and this so forcibly, that there is not the least wicket patent for him, whereby he may either deny his sin, or escape deserved wrath, by any thing which can be performed by himself: for, <hi>The Scripture,</hi> or, that Scripture, to wit, the Law especially, <hi>hath concluded all under sin,</hi> as in a most strict prison or dungeon; for, so the word beareth: and although by the Law here, be mainly and firstly meaned that legall dispensation of the Covenant of Grace, which stood in force during the time of the Old Testament, (See ver. 19. doct. 2.) that thereby this conviction might be the more effectually brought about; yet the pressing of the duties of the Moral Law, and inculcating the curse thereof up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those who are in an unrenewed estate, do serve to conclude all under sin yet, <hi>Luke 13. 3.

of their unrenewed faculties <hi>(Gen.</hi> 6. 5.) are altogether sinful, and most justly deserving God's wrath and curse: for, he saith, <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all</hi> (not only all men, but all things, to wit, all things proceeding from men) <hi>under sin.</hi> 4. So ignorant are men of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse revealed in the Gospel, and so averse are they from closing with it, when it is made in some measure known, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. So bent are they to establish their own righteousnesse, according to the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. that untill the Law of God convince them of their alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether sinfull and cursed estate by nature; yea, and that they can do nothing but sin, they will never be induced to quit all confidence in their own righteousnesse, and flee, by Faith in Jesus Christ, for obtaining of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and salvation, according to the tenour of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel and Promise: for, God did not only under the Old Testament, but also doth under the New <hi>(Act.</hi> 2. 37.) use that piece of divine artifice, <hi>to conclude all under sin, that the Promise</hi> (or, thing promised) <hi>by Faith in Jesus Christ may be given:</hi> the Promise is not given, because none will take it, untill that concluding under sin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede. 5. The Lord's design in pressing the duties, and thundring out the curses of the Law for disobedience, is meerly this, that sinners being hereby convinced of their cursed estate in themselves, and made desperate of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Heaven and Salvation by their own Works, may be in a manner prepared, and, as it were, necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, by Faith to imbrace that free-gift of Salvation held forth through Christ in the Promise: for, saith he, <hi>The Scripture hath concluded all men under sin;</hi> not of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to condemn us, but <hi>that the Promise by Faith of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ might be given unto them who believe.</hi> 6. The heavenly inheritance, and all the other blessings promised in the Covenant of Grace, do not belong promiscuously unto all whom the Law concludeth under sin, but only to those who by Faith do imbrace and close with them as they are offered in the Promise: for, saith he, <hi>That the Promise,</hi> (or, the thing promised) <hi>might be given to

                  <p>IN these words the Apostle answereth a fifth Objection, and doth more directly handle that point concerning the abrogation of the ceremonial Law; yea, of the whole Mosaical Dispensation, now, under the dayes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: The Adversaries might have objected, Seing the Law, or that legal Dispensation of the Covenant of Grace, was so usefull unto the ancient Church, and so subservient to the Promise, as is affirmed, ver. 22. Then why did <hi>Paul</hi> cry down the use of it, especially the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the ceremonial Law now? The Apostle answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by distinguishing times, and sheweth, that <hi>before Faith came,</hi> whereby he meaneth not the grace of saving Faith, (for, that was alwayes in the Church, <hi>Heb. 11. 4, &amp;c.)</hi> but either Christ, called <hi>Faith,</hi> because He is the object of Faith (in which sense He is called our hope, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 1.) or, the full manifestation of the Doctrine of Faith, which was about the time of Christ's death and


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44180:85"/>
ascension: he granteth (I say) that before that time, the use of the Law was first necessary to the Jews, because they were by the Law, as by a military guard, keeped, to wit chiefly, from being mixed with other Nations, whether in Religion or Policy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 14. Secondly, It was saving to them, in so far as it did shut up, conclude, and enclose them, as it were, in a prison, (for it's the same word, and that same purpose more fully expressed, which is ver. 22.) under sin and the curse due to sin, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might be in a manner prepared, and, as it were, necessitated to imbrace the Doctrine of Salvation by Faith in Jesus Christ, which was then but darkly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 11. and afterwards more clearly revealed, the full revelation whereof, they were by this mean, kept more intent upon, ver. 23. Which latter use of the Law, he il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrateth and concludeth, by shewing the Law, as a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogue or Schoolmaster, did with much rigor and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, govern and rule the Church then in her infancy and childhood, and thereby did lead the Elect unto Christ, that they might be justified by faith. The Apostle having thus shewed (ver. 23, 24.) that the <hi>Law,</hi> that is, the legal dispensation of the Covenant of Grace, was for good use to the ancient Church, denyeth that therefore the use of it should be continued now, when the doctrine of Faith is clearly manifested; yea, by the contrary, he sheweth it was then to be abrogated, and the Christian Church freed from the observation of it, because it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erced only the office of a Schoolmaster over children, and so can have no authority over the Church, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Believers now, ver. 25. which he proveth from this, That the Christian Church, and all of them, to wit Jew and Gentile, were like a son come to age, because of their Faith in Christ Jesus already come; and so was to be dealt with no longer as a childe under a School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master, ver. 26.</p>

Besides other differences betwixt the administration of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace under the Old Testament, and under the New, this was one, the old administration was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to the Jews, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19, 20. and to some of other Nations, who, forgetting their own People, <hi>(Psal.</hi> 45. 10,) joyned themselves to them; but the new is extended to all Nations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. for, this difference is here hinted at, while the Apostle (speaking of those who were under that old dispensation, ver. 23, 24.) speaketh of them in the first person, <hi>We were kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, &amp;c.

The frequent inculcating of the Moral Law and Promises of life upon their obedience, did convince them how far they were from that exact righteousnesse, which God required; and that therefore they behoved to seek for righteousnesse some-where else, which was inforced by the threatnings of the Law, shewing that otherwise they would perish. The Ceremonies, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and frequent Washings, did also tend to this, even to convince them of, and to keep their eye fixed upon their own filthinesse and deserved damnation, and to make them seek for righteousnesse, satisfaction to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked Justice, and the expiation of their sin, in that alone sacrifice of the death and bloud of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9, 10, 11. for, saith he, <hi>The Law was our Schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ.</hi> 5. The Godly, under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were justified by Faith, laying hold upon Christ for righteousnesse, even as we are now: for, saith he, <hi>The Law did bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From Vers. 25. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The proposing unto our selves to bring about a good, necessary and spiritual end, is not sufficient to justifie our use-making of whatsoever means, we may conceive to be, or sometimes have been approven of God, as conducible for that end, except those means have a present stamp of divine approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the using of them; God's end is to be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by His own means: for, though the bringing of us to Christ for righteousnesse be as necessary now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel, as it was under the Law, and though the pedagogy of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> was an approven mean


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44180:88"/>
for bringing about that end under the Old Testament; yet <hi>Paul</hi> will not grant, That therefore it should now be made use of in order to that end, because under the dayes of the Gospel, the ty of divine authority enjoyning the use-making of that Schoolmaster, is ceased; <hi>But after that Faith is come, we are no longer under a Schoolmaster,</hi> saith he; and therefore are not to subject our selves unto him. 2. Though the curse of the moral Law is to be denounced against all impenitent sinners in the Christian Church, that hereby they may be constrained to flee unto Christ for righteousnesse, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. and the precepts thereof are to be urged upon the Regenerate, as the rule of their obedience, <hi>Eph. 6. 1, &amp;c.</hi> and though the exact righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, required in the Law, doth serve as a glasse, wherein even the Renewed may see their manifold fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Rom. 7. 14, &amp;c.</hi> and so be necessitated to betake themselves daily to the bloud of sprinkling for pardon, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 25. (In which respects, the moral Law may be called a Schoolmaster, even to the christian Church, and a Schoolmaster to bring them to Christ) yet the christian Church is fully freed from that legal dispensation of the Covenant of Grace, which was added to the Covenant-promise upon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> which what it was, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, ver. 19. doct. 2. and ver. 24. doct. 3. <hi>For after that Faith is come, we are no more under this Schoolmaster,</hi> saith he.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 26. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Church of God under the New Testament, as to her outward state, is in a state of Sonship or Adoption, which noteth her freedom from that rigor and servitude, under which the ancient Church was through the outward legal dispensation of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, chap. 4. 3. and the truly godly have some peculiar dignity added in relation to the grace of Adoption over and above what Believers under the Old Testament had, in so far as the vail of that legal dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation being removed, the generality, at least, of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers now have more ready accesse to the Covenant-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and a clearer insight in, and knowledge of all those

priviledges, which belong unto them as the sons of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23, 24. for, taking what the Apostle saith of their being the children of God in both or either of those respects, his intended scope is brought about, which is to shew, That the christian Church is not under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagogy of that Mosaical dispensation, even <hi>for,</hi> or, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause ye are all the Children of God,</hi> saith he. 2. Though Faith in the Messiah to come, did entitle Believers under the Old Testament, to the dignity of Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Lord Almighty; yet Faith in Jesus Christ already come, doth adde some peculiar dignity of Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship upon the christian Church, and especially upon Believers in it, even that which is presently mentioned in the preceding Doctrine, the Lord having been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make the Churches full growth, and utmost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, (as to her priviledges, and outward state and measure of accesse) to tryst with His Son's coming in the flesh, that so His entry to the world might be more stately, as being accompanied with such a measure of royal munificence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 40. for, saith he, <hi>Ye are all the children of God by Faith in Jesus Christ,</hi> to wit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come.</p>

Objection yet more made use of by the false Apostles in behalf of Circumcision, which was not added upon mount <hi>Sinai</hi> unto the Promise, but given to <hi>Abraham</hi> with the Promise, as the initiatory seal of the Promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. whence, it seems, they argued, That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all that which was added upon mount Sinai, was now abrogated; yet Circumcision was to be kept in the Church, as that without which none could be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s seed, or an heir according to the Promise. The Apostle's Answer cometh in effect to this, That Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism into Christ, that is, which sealeth and signifieth our ingraffing into Christ, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 6. 4.) was substituted in the place of Circumcision, and sufficient for compassing all those ends, for which Circumcision was instituted; and that because they who are <hi>baptized into Christ, do put on Christ,</hi> and so are in a manner incorporate, and make one body with Him, as a man is incorporated with his garments, from which the word is borrowed, ver. 26. Which incorporation of the christian Church, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all the members thereof one in Christ, he sheweth is effectuated without any respect had to any difference of Nations, conditions worldly, or distinction of sexes, leaving them to gather, that Circumcision (which, by vertue of its institution, did serve for keeping up a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between Jew and Gentile, <hi>(Exod.</hi> 12. 48.) could have no influence upon this businesse, ver. 28. From all which he concludeth, Seing Baptism doth testifie and seal up Christ's interest in those who are baptized, as His and their union with Christ, who is the real Head of the blessed Race, through whom alone <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed were to be blessed, That therefore <hi>ipso facto,</hi> and without any more ado, they were <hi>Abraham</hi>'s seed, and apparent heirs of that heavenly inheritance, given unto <hi>Abraham</hi> by promise, and so, that there was no necessity, in order to this end, of joyning them to the blessed Nation by Circumcision, as the ancient Proselytes were, and, as the false Apostles alleaged, should yet be practised, ver. 29.</p>

From Vers. 27. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Though Circumcision the initiatory Seal, and leading Sacrament of the Covenant under the Old Testament, <hi>(Exod.</hi> 12. 48.) be now abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished with the rest of that ancient dispensation; yet, seing the Church of God, even under the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not wholly spiritual, but in part earthly and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 7. 14.) standing in need to be instructed and confirmed in spiritual Truths by things sensible and earthly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 12. it hath therefore seemed good unto God to enjoyn the celebration of some Sacraments in the christian Church unto the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19, 20. which are in signification more clear, and in use lesse painfull and burdensom; and particularly, He hath substituted Baptism in the place of Circumcision, which doth serve for all these spiritual uses now, which Circumcision did serve for then, to wit, all these uses which were of common concernment to the Church at all times, and not peculiar to the dispensation which then was: for, the Apostle, clearing how Circumcision was now abrogated, doth shew how Baptism doth it in all those necessary uses for which it did serve; <hi>For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.</hi> 2. Among other uses for which Baptism doth serve, this is the first and chief, to signifie and seal up our ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing into, and union with Christ: there is an external visible union, consisting in external covenanting, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious profession of christian Truths, either personally or parentally, which is sealed up to all visible Professors ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely; for, they are in Him externally, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 2. There is a real and saving union signified and sealed up unto all the Regenerate absolutely; for, they are in Him savingly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. and to all the Members of the visible Church conditionally, if so they come up to the termes which Scripture calleth for, as necessary in order to uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Him, to wit, saving Faith: for, this much the Apostle doth import, by saying, <hi>we are baptized into Christ,</hi> even that our ingraffing into Him is signified and sealed by Baptism. 3. Baptism doth also signifie and


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44180:90"/>
seal our putting on of Christ, to wit, by Faith; for, by Faith we make application of Christ unto our selves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 40. and Christ so applied, serveth for the same use to the soul, which garments do serve to the body; He covereth our loathsom nakednesse, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. and is also for an ornament unto us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 27. He communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth heat and warmnesse, even those sweet refreshing influences of His Spirit, for life and godlinesse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 2. and 2. 5, 6. And Christ is thus, and for these ends put on in Baptism; partly, because Baptism engageth all who are baptized, to put Him so on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. and partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those who are baptized inwardly by the Spirit, as well as outwardly by Water, do actually and really put Him on, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 21. As many as are baptized into Christ, have put on Christ;</hi> It's a metaphor taken from garments which men put on to cover, adorn, and keep themselves warm.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 28. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Though Christian Religion abolish not those civill distinctions, which are between Nation and Nation, Master and Servant, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. or the dignity of the one sex above the other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7, 8, 9. Yet it layeth no weight upon any of these as to the point of accesse unto Christ and use-making of Him. Whatever Nation, rank, or sex a person be of, it is all one in this matter; none are debarred from Christ, nor yet the more accepted by Him for any of these things; for, having spoken of putting on Christ, he subjoyneth, <hi>there is neither Jew nor Gentile, Greek, &amp;c.</hi> 2. After, and upon Christ's coming in the flesh, the door of Free-grace hath been much more enlarged beyond what it former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was; so that the Greek and Gentile have all restraints taken off, and a like ready accesse with the Jews to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ: for, the Apostle's main scope in this verse, is to shew, that there is no difference now between Jew and Greek; and by consequence, that Circumcision, which was one main part of the partition-wall betwixt them, was not any longer to stand in force; and what is spoken of the <hi>bond</hi> and <hi>free, male</hi> and <hi>female,</hi> seemeth


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44180:90"/>
to be added for illustration and confirmation of this Truth only, except he doth also hint, that those restraints which were upon bondmen, and the female sex, as to the enjoying of some priviledges under the Old Testament, <hi>(Gen. 17. 10. Lev.</hi> 22. 10.) were now also taken off; <hi>There is neither Jew nor Greek, bond nor free, male nor fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.</hi> 3. There is an union among all those who are baptized, whereby they make up, as it were, but one man, to wit, all visible Church-members of all Nations, of every condition, and of both sexes, make up one po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Body, having by divine appointment the same Laws, Government, the same kind of Office-bearers, and spiritual Courts, and enjoying the same priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 13, 14. And all real Believers make up one mystical and spiritual Body, as being animated, acted and ruled by one and the same Spirit of Jesus, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 8, 9. for, saith he, <hi>They are all one,</hi> or, one man. 4. The bond and ty of the Churches union, is Jesus Christ. And according to the nature of that union, which is between Him and them, whether external and by a profession only, or internal and by vertue of saving Faith also, So is the nature of that union which is among themselves, either external or political only, or internal and mystical also; and the more that any be united and keeped near to Christ, he will be at greater nearnesse unto these who are Christ's: for, having spoken of their putting on Christ, he subjoyneth, <hi>ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</hi>

                  <p>From Vers. 29. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. By vertue of our Baptism, and our putting on of Christ in Baptism, a right and interest in, and over us, doth accresse to Christ, so that we become in a peculiar manner His, seing in Baptism we enter an open and professed engagement to be wholly and only the Lord's: for, in place of resuming, <hi>If ye, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baptized into Christ, have put on Christ,</hi> (which was the foundation of the present inference laid down, ver. 27.) he resumeth, <hi>If ye be Christs,</hi> implying the one of these doth follow upon the other. 2. The Christian Church, or all who are given over unto Christ in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44180:91"/>
are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s seed, and heirs of the promised in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, to wit, with regard had to that distinction of seed, ver. 8. doct. 8. And hence it followeth, that the charter of this inheritance, or the Covenant betwixt God and His People, hath been alwayes for substance one and the same, and that the Church of the Old and New Testament are both one, even the self-same seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> differing in nothing further than a man of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect age, doth differ from himself being a childe, and that there is but one Faith, one Salvation, and one way of obtaining the same, under both Testaments: for, saith he, <hi>If ye be Christs, ye are Abrahams seed,</hi> speaking to the Christian Church. 3. Though all those fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be the same under both Testaments, yet there are some accidental differences, whereof one lyeth in the different wayes of incorporating persons unto that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed society to whom the heavenly inheritance doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain, which then was by being circumcized, in evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their subjecting themselves wholly to that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densom administration, under which the Church then was; But now it is sufficient to be baptized, and by so doing to subject our selves unto Christ: for, (in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the false Apostles, who still maintained that none could be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s seed, except they were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised, and would subject themselves to the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses)</hi> the Apostle affirmeth, <hi>If ye be Christs, then are ye Abraham's seed, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the first part of this Chapter, the Apostle doth further clear the Churche's freedom from that ancient Policy of the Jewish Church by the similitude of a Pupil, and his Tutors; which similitude is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ver. 1, 2. And applyed, first, to the Churches bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage under the Old Testament, ver. 3. and secondly, to her freedom from that bondage under the New, ver. 4, 5. whereof he giveth an evidence, to wit, God's bestowing upon them the Spirit of Adoption, ver. 6. and so conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the dispute, ver. 7.</p>
               <p>In the second part, he laboureth upon their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, first, by a sharp reproof for their defection, which he aggregeth, ver. 8, 9. and giveth some instances of it, ver. 10. and hinteth at the great hazard they were in because of it, ver. 11. Secondly, by a most affectionate insinuation, wherein he exhorteth them to be affectionate towards him, and sheweth how dearly he affected them, ver. 12. inforcing the former, and evidencing the latter, from his thankfull acknowledgement how affectionate they were once to him for the Truths sake, to ver. 17. And obviateth an objection taken from that intense af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which the false Apostles seemed to carry unto them, by shewing wherein their zeal and affection was defective, ver. 17. and the nature of true zeal, ver. 18. Giving evidences, that this true zeal and affection was in himself towards them, ver. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>In the third part, he confirmeth and illustrateth the whole preceding dispute by the history of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.

                  <p>THe Apostle (being yet further to clear the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches freedom from that legal external policy of the ancient Church, whereof he spake so much, chap. 3. ver. 19, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> doth use another similitude taken from a pupil, and his tutors and curators. And, first, having made a transition usual to him, when he is more fully to explicate any former purpose, (See chap. 5. 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50.) he setteth down the similitude in these verses to this purpose, That a childe though he be heir and owner of all his fathers inheritance in hope, and as to right, yet so long as he is a <hi>minor,</hi> and under age, he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth nothing from a servant in point of subjection, and as to free government and enjoyment of his rights and goods, ver. 1. and this because he himself is ruled, and his estate managed by tutors and curators; the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of which subjection, the Apostle sheweth is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily limited unto the time prescribed by the father, longer than which the heir is not to remain in that state of subjection to his tutors, ver. 2. There are indeed other limits of childrens minority prefixed by the Law, besides the Will of the father; but he mentioneth this, because it only doth quadrate to the present purpose, for which the similitude is made use of.</p>
                  <p>From this usual custom among men, approved of here by the Spirit of God, being considered in it self, and without respect had to that spiritual purpose unto which it is applied afterwards. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. So licentious is youth,


<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44180:92"/>
where there is no restraint, and so foolish, as being desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of experience, and more ruled by the inundation of impetuous passions than force of reason, That it is much conducing (both for a man's self, and for the publick good of the society among whom he liveth) he be first subjected unto others, and made to obey as a servant, (whereby in progresse of time he may attain some wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and experience) before he have absolute power to dispose of his own estate, and obtain dominion over others; otherwise it could not be so generally agreed unto by all parents, and in all nations: that <hi>the heir as long as he is a childe should differ nothing from a servant,</hi> which the Apostle speaketh of as an approven custom, and excepted against by none. 2. It is the duty of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as to provide a competent portion for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren whereupon they may live, when they themselves are dead and gone, so to do what in them lyeth to secure their portion for them; lest it be delapidated by their childrens folly, or any other way rendred uselesse unto them: for unto this end are tutors and curators provided by the father unto the childe; <hi>But he is under tutors and governors.</hi> 3. Though parents are not to give unto their children just cause of irritation, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 21. yet they ought not to please them to their hurt, but in some things must crosse their humour, to wit, especially when their so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tendeth evidently to their childrens good: for, though the heir, even when he is a childe, would affect liberty, and absolute dominion over his own estate; yet the wise parent must keep him <hi>under subjection to tutors and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.</hi> 4. It is no small mercy unto children when God doth prolong the life of parents untill they themselves at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to so much age and experience, as may enable them to manage their own affairs; seing otherwise their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and estate must come under the tuition, government, and reverence of others, who possibly may prove their unfriends: for, they must even be <hi>under tutors and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors.</hi> 5.

a worldly portion for their children to live upon, as they do not disoblige those with whom they have commerce; that so they may with some measure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence commit the tuition of their children and means to the care and oversight of others, even those whom they shall be necessitated to appoint for <hi>tutors and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors.</hi> 6.

special and supernatural gifts in the hearts of Believers, whereby they were enabled like little children to own and incall upon God as their Father; and this without any distinction of <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> which seemeth to be hinted at by the two epithets given to God, both signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the same thing, the one <hi>Abba,</hi> a Syriack word, which language was then commonly spoken among the Jews, the other a Greek word, rendred <hi>Father,</hi> which was most commonly used among the Gentiles: Now this of God's sending forth His Spirit under the New Testament, is not to be so understood, as if He had not been sent forth into the hearts of Believers under the Old Testament, but that He is now poured-out in a greater measure, <hi>Joel 2. 28.

Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Beleivers do attain to a larger insight in this excellent benefit of Adoption, and a greater measure of the fruits of it, there will be a proportionable measure of the Spirit's in-dwelling and manifesting of Himself in His gracious operations, especially in His assisting and furnishing for the duty of Prayer: for, he proveth they had received a clear insight in this priviledge of Adoption, and the more free use and fruition of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Spirit was more plentifully bestowed to dwell in their hearts; <hi>And because ye are sons,</hi> saith he, <hi>God hath sent forth, &amp;c.</hi> 7. Though the exercise of Faith, Love, Hope and other graces in the duty of Prayer, and at other occasions, doth flow from the renewed, soul, as the proper inward and vital cause of those actions, so that properly we, and not the Spirit of God, are said to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, repent, pray, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10. Yet, because the Spirit doth not only create, and preserve those gracious habits in the soul, <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 36. 26.) but also exciteth the soul to act, and assisteth it in acting according to them. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 13. without which actuating, exciting and assisting grace, habitual grace in us could do nothing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. - 5. Therefore is it, that the exercise of those gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is ascribed to the Spirit of God, as the external effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause thereof; for which reason, our affectionate and believing Prayers are ascribed here unto Him; <hi>God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son, crying, Abba.</hi> 8.

Our right to the heavenly inheritance, as also the possession of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which is begun here in the Kingdom of Grace, or, which shall be compleated hereafter in the Kingdom of Glory, doth follow upon our sonship and adoption; so that God, of rebels doth first make up sons, and then none can challenge Him of injustice for bestowing upon us the inheritance of children; <hi>And if a son, then an heir of God,</hi> saith he. 5. As none since the fall ever was, or shall be lifted up to that high dignity of being sons and daughters to the Lord Almighty, or could lay any just claim to Heaven and Glory as his inheritance, but by vertue of Christ's obedience and death, whereby all those high and precious priviledges, being formerly forfeited and lost, were again recovered: So, the actual exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ in the flesh, and the real payment of the price by Christ, did bring with it (God having so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed) a larger measure and higher degree of those priviledges to be bestowed upon Believers after that time, than was ordinarily enjoyed by Believers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: for, he is speaking here mainly of that higher degree of freedom, and of that more evident and clear fight of, and right to the inheritance, together with the fuller measure of its possession in the Graces of God's Spirit, which is proper to the dayes of the Gospel; and sheweth all this cometh <hi>through Christ,</hi> to wit, His actual incarnation, obedience and death.</p>

with a sad reproof for their turning again, and desiring to be in bondage, and under subjection to the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those Mosaical Elements, or Ceremonies, (See ver. 3.) which he calleth <hi>weak,</hi> as having never had any power in themselves to produce any spiritual effect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9. and now under the Gospel have not so much as any figurative or sacramental use, which formerly they had, as being shadows of Christ to come, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. he calleth them also <hi>beggerly</hi> and poor, as not being able to afford any solid consolation unto those who observed them: now the Apostle calleth their defection a <hi>turning again,</hi> and <hi>desiring to be again in bondage;</hi> not as if they had been ever under that yoke formerly (for, this were contrary to ver. 8.) but it was a going backward from that measure, towards which they had already advanced; and the word <hi>again,</hi> relateth to their act of turning, and desire of bondage, for they had been under bondage formerly, to wit, unto Idolatry, from which they were converted: But it doth not relate to the weak and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly elements under which they never had been, ver. 9.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 8. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. However Nature's light doth serve to make us know there is a God, and that He ought to be served, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. yet all the knowledge of God thereby attained, is nothing else but ignorance, in so far as it leaveth us destitute of the knowledge of God in Christ, without which there is no salvation, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. for, in this respect, these Galatians are said to have been ignorant of God, while they lived in gentilism, although even then they had some knowledge of God, as other Gentiles had, <hi>Rom. 1. 19. Howbeit, them when ye knew not God.</hi> 2. When people are destitute of that knowledge of God which the written Word affordeth, or though they have it, yet will not follow it, but give themselves up to be guided by those notions of a Deity with which the light of Nature doth furnish them, they cannot but miscarry far in their apprehensions of God, and in the nature of that worship which is due unto Him: for, the Galatians, following this guide, did worship plurality


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:44180:99"/>
of false gods, when they ought to have satisfied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with that one only true God, <hi>Mat. 4. 10. Ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.</hi> 3. Men are naturally inclined to feign some representation of the Godhead unto themselves by things which incur in the outward senses, whether Sun, Moon, Stars, Gold, Silver, Wood, or Stone, that hereby at first they may be only kept in remembrance of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 1. from which they do easily advance further to give divine worship unto those images and representations, and so <hi>do service unto those who by nature are no gods,</hi> as these Galatians did. 4. There is not any kind of religious worship or service, under any name whatsoever, to be given unto any creature, but to God only, as the giver of it would not commit idolatry: for here, the <hi>doing of service unto those who by nature are no gods,</hi> is condemned, and it is the same worship and service, as is clear to any who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the first language, which the Papists affirm may be given to Saints and Angels. 5. It is not unprofitable, but very necessary sometimes for converted Christians, to be put in remembrance of that sinfull and miserable case wherein they were before conversion; and this, as for other reasons, so, that hereby they may be made to prize, highly esteem, and be thankfull to that free-grace which shewed pity on them: for, so the Apostle mindeth them of the time when they <hi>knew not God.</hi> 6. The moe of outward engagements unto a sin or error by educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or former instruction, are lying upon a people or person, they are in some sense the more excusable, and, at least, to be pitied, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 30. and the fewer engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there be of that kind, they are the more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable, and the lesse to be pitied: for, he aggregeth the sin of those Galatians in hankering after the Jewish Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, from this, that <hi>then,</hi> or in the time of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches minority (spoken of, ver. 3.) they were not under that yoke, and so not engaged by education and former instruction to adhere unto them, as the Jews were; <hi>Not knowing God, they served them which by nature were no gods.</hi>

                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:44180:100"/>
From Vers. 9. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Such are the riches of mercy in God, that He doth sometimes convert and save the most debauched and gracelesse sinners; and therefore we are not to despair even of such: for, these Galatians, who did once serve idols, were afterwards made to <hi>know God,</hi> as the word signifieth, <hi>and were known of God.</hi> 2. People would labour to inform themselves in the knowledge of God according to the written Word, as they would remove an otherwise invincible bar stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the way of their conversion; for, God can neither be served, obeyed or trusted upon, except He be known: Hence the converted state of these Galatians, is set forth by their knowing of God; <hi>But now after ye have known God.</hi> 3. Then is God known aright and savingly, when He is known in Jesus Christ, according as He is held forth in the Gospel, without whom, God is a consuming fire, and in and through whom, He is well pleased, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. for then, and not while then, are the Galatians said to know God, when they knew Him in Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Gospel; <hi>But now after ye have known God.</hi> 4. So tender ought we to be of God's honour in the work of man's conversion, as that we maintain or affirm nothing which may, though but seemingly, ascribe the praise of that work, either in whole, or in part, to man's own free-will, industry and pains, or withdraw any part of it from the alone efficiency of Gods powerful and free grace, who worketh in us both to will and to do, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 13. Hence the Apostle, having spoken of their knowing God at their conversion, which might seem to attribute somewhat to themselves, he addeth by way of correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>or rather are known of God,</hi> ascribing thus the whole work of their conversion to God's preventing grace. 5. Sinners in an unconverted state, are such of whom God taketh no notice or knowledge, to wit, so, as to be familiar with them, or to communicate special and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving blessings upon them; as also the contrary is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to be the priviledge of true Converts, while he saith those Galatians, now converted, were known of


<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44180:100"/>
God, which implyeth, that before conversion they were not known of Him in the sense here meaned: <hi>Or rather are known of God.</hi> 6. The more of mercy hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a people or person, and particularly the greater measure of knowledge they have attained unto, their after declining is capable of the moe sad and weighty aggravations, but chiefly the scandalous failings of the truly Regenerate, are extreamly heinous: for, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth their <hi>knowing God,</hi> and <hi>being known of God,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to aggrege their apostasie and defection. 7. Holy zeal will teach a man to speak with so much contempt, as reason will afford him warrant for, of any thing which is so pleaded for, as to incroach upon the honour due to Christ, or upon any of His Offices, whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect hath been due, or yet is, to that thing otherwise: for, though the Levitical Ceremonies were once to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously observed, as a part of divine Worship leading to Christ, chap. 3. 24. and though they were even at this time, when the Apostle wrote, to be held, and were held in some esteem, the free use of them being permitted to the weak Jews untill they should have an honourable burial, <hi>Rom. 14. 3, &amp;c.</hi> and this justly, because they were once a divine Ordinance; yet when the false Apostles did urge them upon the Gentiles, whether as a part of necessary commanded Worship, thereby incroaching upon Christ's royal and legislative Power, and tying the conscience where He left it free, or as a part of their righteousnesse before God, incroaching thereby upon Christ's Priestly Office, whose obedience and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering is our only ransom and righteousnesse, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. the Apostle is bold to give them the name of <hi>weak and beggerly rudiments.</hi> 8. People may advance very far in the way of Christianity, and yet make a foul retreat af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the course of defection and apostasie; which contributeth nothing to that foul error of the total and final apostasie of the Saints, (See chap. 1. ver. 6. doct. 6.) for, these Galatians, after they were known of God, <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again to the weak and beggerly elements.</hi> 9. Though


<pb n="186" facs="tcp:44180:101"/>
Apostates and authors of defection pretend to never so much of reason to justifie their apostasie and declining, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 31. and 6. 1. Yet, upon an exact survey, all their reasons will appear to be meer pretences, and their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice so absurd and irrational, that men of composed spirits, and not demented as they are, cannot but wonder at it: for, the Apostle falleth upon their defection, not without admiration at their absurdity and folly, <hi>How turn ye again to the weak and beggerly elements?</hi> saith he. 10. As defection and apostasie is a voluntary sin, and usually floweth from an itching desire after new-fangled Errors, arising from a kind of loathing at old Truths, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. so, the more a man is carried with the full bensal of affection and desire towards a sin, he is the more guilty before God; for, their sin is aggreged from this, that they <hi>desired again to be in bondage:</hi> the word rendred <hi>desired,</hi> signifieth to will a thing earnestly and with great desire.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle, knowing that these Galatians were alienated in their affections from him, and fearing lest from his present severity and sharpnesse towards them, they should apprehend that he was alienated from them also, Therefore he setteth himself to cure both the


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44180:102"/>
certain evil, and feared mistake; and this by requesting them, as Brethren, that they would keep intimate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards him as to another self, or as if he had been themselves; for, so much doth the expression <hi>(be as I)</hi> bear; and assureth them that he was so affected towards them, even the same which he formerly was, and that his present severity did not flow from hatred, or a spirit of private revenge against them, seing they had never done any personal injury to him, to wit, but in so far as they had wronged Christ and Truth; and therefore lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it unto them to look upon him, as a man who was pleading the cause of Christ, and not venting any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate grudge of his own. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though the Servant of Jesus Christ must use severity in the way of reproof and rebuke towards those who are gone astray; yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause people are apt to conceive, that his so doing doth flow from an imbittered spirit, and so to slight both him and his rebukes, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. 7.) therefore he would in wisdom sometimes mix his severity with gentlenesse, and his rebukes with exhortations and intreaties, as looking not so much upon what their sin deserveth, as what is most convenient for gaining them to repentance: Hence the Apostle, having sufficiently rebuked them, cometh now to request and intreat; <hi>Brethren, I beseech you,</hi> saith he. 2. As Error above any other sin, doth estrange the person erring from any who oppose them in their way, though they were even their most faithfull Pastors: So it is the duty of Ministers not to be careless whether they have the affection of such or not, upon pretence that no cause of disrespect is given by them; but they are to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on upon their erring people, and beg their favour and affection, if it cannot be otherwayes gained; and this mainly for the people's profit, and that hereby they may be put in a capacity to do them good: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> apprehending that these erring Galatians were estranged from him in their affections, he beggeth their favour, while he saith, <hi>I beseech you, be as I am.</hi> 3. The mutual love and affection betwixt a People and a Pastor, ought


<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44180:103"/>
to be so intimate, as if they both were but one person, every one minding the good of another, as of themselves, constructing aright of the actions of another, as they would have others construct of their own, and rejoycing at the advantage, and grieving for the hurt of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as if it were their own; and this because Satan doth by all means labour to drive in some wedge of jealousie to rent them asunder, that so the Minister may be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse unto the People, and they a heart-break unto him: this intimacy of affection, is here intreated-for by <hi>Paul</hi> from the Galatians, <hi>Be as I am;</hi> and was made consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of by him towards them, <hi>for I am as ye are,</hi> saith he. 4. It is no small part of that divine wisdom required in a Minister, so to hate, and testifie against the sins of People, as not to relent in his respect to their persons; so to persecute their ill, as to remain tenderly affectionated towards their good: for, thus did <hi>Paul; I am as ye are,</hi> saith he. 5. As People are apt to apprehend that the zeal of a Minister against their sin, doth flow from a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of revenge and spight against their persons for some real or apprehended injury done unto him by them: So it is most base and sinfull for a Minister to intend and sharpen his zeal, even though against sin, from any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of that kind; and a thing, the very ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse suspicions whereof, he would labour to wipe off: for so doth <hi>Paul</hi> here, by shewing they had done him no wrong; and therefore it could not be in reason sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that in his sharp rebukes he was venting his spleen, or a spirit of private revenge; <hi>Ye have not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured me at all,</hi> saith he.</p>

In order to which, he declareth they were so far from doing him any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal injury, for which they might apprehend him to bear them at hatred, that upon the contrary, they had shown much love and reverence unto him; which he cleareth, 1. by bringing to their remembrance, how that when he came to preach the Gospel first unto them, while they were yet in paganism, he did preach <hi>through much infirmity of the flesh;</hi> whereby is meaned, not only his humble way of deportment in his whole Ministry without the shew of humane wisdom and authority, (as <hi>weaknesse</hi> or <hi>infirmity</hi> is taken, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. ver. 3. compared with ver. 1.) but also and mainly those many sufferings he did undergo from the enemies of the Gospel among them, which <hi>Paul</hi> calleth elsewhere his infirmities, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 10. and they are called <hi>of the flesh,</hi> because his <hi>flesh,</hi> or outward man, was most afflicted by them, the spirit, or inward man, being underpropped by God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44180:104"/>
him, though an afflicted persecuted man, with as much reverence and obedience, as if it had been preached by an Angel, or by Christ Himself in His own Person: this is all he meaneth by their <hi>receiving him as Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus;</hi> for, if they had given him the honour due unto Christ in other respects, he would not have made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it without detestation, (See <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 14.) This is ver. 14.

                  <p>From Vers. 13. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It seemeth good unto God to commit the heavenly treasure of the Gospel unto ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vessels, and to exercise those whom He imployeth to preach the Gospel, what, with the sense of their own infirmities from within, what, with heavie trouble from without; that so, while nothing appeareth in them to outward appearance, but what is subject to reproach and contempt, we may ascribe the glory of any good which is done by them, not to men, but to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. for, this is the ordinary lot of other Preachers, which <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth here was his, even that <hi>through infirmity of the flesh he preached</hi> unto them. 2. When the Gospel cometh first into a place, then especially doth Satan stir up all his malice, and all that interest which he hath in wicked men, for creating trouble unto those whom God imployeth in the preaching of it; if so he may give the Gospel a dash, at its very first entry: thus <hi>Paul preached the Gospel at first through infirmity of the flesh;</hi> whereby

                  <p>From Vers. 14. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. God's design in measuring out an hard lot and great opposition to those who are engaged in the work of the Ministry, is not to discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, but to try them, by making His grace in them shine the more clearly, the more they are put to exercise it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their hardships and straits: for, <hi>Paul</hi> calleth his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity</hi> or sufferings, his <hi>tentation</hi> or trial (See <hi>Iam. 1. 2. Luke</hi> 8. -13. and 22. 28.) <hi>and my tentation which was in my flesh.</hi> 2. As it is too ordinary for those who are at ease, to contemn, neglect, and be carelesse of the heavie afflictions and sufferings of others, chiefly of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Jesus Christ, as if they were wholly unconcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in what they suffer: So it speaketh much to the commendation of a People, when they lay to heart, and take notice of the sufferings of their faithfull Ministers,


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44180:105"/>
as if they were their own, and do sympathize with them under all their hardships: for, he commendeth the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians from this, that <hi>they despised not his tentation,</hi> or trial and affliction; the word signifieth, they did not set it at nought, as not worthy to be taken notice of, and so they have been duely affected with it. 3. So little love have men naturally to the Gospel, that they are ready to take occasion from any thing, to make them cast at it: even the necessary trials and afflictions, with which God seeth fit to exercise the Preachers of the Gospel, are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground for many to reject both the persons and doctrine of Ministers: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> commending these Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians for their not rejecting of him, because of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, sheweth the contrary sin to be very ordinary; <hi>Nor rejected, but received me,</hi> saith he. 4. It is high mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of commendation unto a people, when the outwardly base and contemptible condition of Ministers doth not diminish any thing of that due respect which they owe to the Message which they carry: for, these Galatians are commended from this, that notwithstanding of his <hi>tentation, they rejected not, but received him as an Angel of God.</hi> 5. The faithfull Ministers of Jesus Christ, are to be held in high estimation for their works sake; so that as (all due respect being given unto their persons, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17.) the doctrine of Truth preached by them may be received with as much faith and reverence, as if an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from Heaven, or Christ Himself were the Preacher of it; for, they are Ambassadors in Christ's place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. and the Word of God is alwayes truth and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be received, whoever do preach it, neither doth it borrow any intrinsick authority from the person of the Preacher: Hence the Galatians are commended, that in this respect they <hi>received Paul as an Angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</hi> See <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 15. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The onely thing which maketh a people happy, is to have the doctrine of the Gospel (which is the mean of our reconciliation with God in Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18.) preached among them, and


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:44180:105"/>
to receive this Doctrine, and the faithfull Preachers of it, with all due reverence, love and subjection. The injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of honour, riches, and abundance of outward peace, is no blessednesse, being compared with this, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. for, the Apostle speaketh of these Galatians while they were in that case, <hi>What,</hi> or, <hi>how great was then your bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse?</hi> 2. Injuries received afterwards will not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate the inward sense, or mar the outward acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of favours formerly received in a thankfull mind: for, though the Galatians had done no private injury to <hi>Paul,</hi> ver.—12. yet, in their defection from Truth, they had wronged him for the Truth's sake, and notwithstanding he proclaimeth those evidences of their love and respect, which he had received formerly both in the former verse, and more expresly here, while he saith, <hi>I bear you record, ye would have plucked out your eyes, &amp;c.</hi> 3. The love and reverence which People owe to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, ought not to be verbal, and in profession only, but real also, even such as may evidence it self in the hearty bestowing of any thing which may be for their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, or for advancing the Work of God in their hands: for, <hi>Paul</hi> proveth these <hi>Galatians</hi> had received him as they ought, from their readinesse to impart unto him all things necessary and possible for his encouragement; <hi>Ye received me,</hi> saith he, <hi>for I bear you record, ye would have plucked out your eyes.</hi> 4. Though, as is usually said, Charity begins at home, and we be commanded to love our neighbour only as our self, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 39. Yet there is a certain case, in which we must consider our neighbour, not only as a neighbour, but as a special instrument of God, and thus we are in some respects to love and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him unto our selves; and especially when he is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument imployed by God for the defence and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Gospel, we ought to be ready to forsake the dearest things we have in the world, though it were our own hands, eyes, feet; yea, and our very life, if so it may promote the Work of God in his hands: for, in this case, it is not our neighbour, but Christ and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:44180:106"/>
which we prefer unto our selves, according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37. Hence, because <hi>Paul</hi> was such an instrument, the Galatians are commended for their readinesse to <hi>pluck out their own eyes, and to give them to him.</hi> 5. The wisdom and goodnesse of God hath so provided, that the hands, eyes, and other members of our body, being cut off, or plucked out, cannot be serviceable, or usefull unto the body of any other, hereby preventing the cruelty and tyranny of the greater sort, who would make no scruple to mutilate the bodies of their inferiours, if those mutila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted members could serve for any use to themselves after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for, saith he, <hi>If it had been possible, they would have plucked out their own eyes,</hi> importing, it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, not simply to pluck them out, but that their eyes, being plucked out, could serve for the same use to him for which they did serve unto themselves.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle concludeth from what he hath said of their former kindnesse to him, that he was not now turned their enemy, nor estranged in his affection from them, (for, the interrogative hath the force of a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment denial) and that they had no reason to think so of him, this only excepted, that with much candor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity he had declared the Truth unto them, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Errors of the false Apostles; the absurdity of which reason, is also imported by the interrogative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. For Christians to entertain malice, or a spirit of private revenge one against another, as it is in any case sinfull; so when there hath been no personal injury offered, it is abominable; and hardly can it be conceived, that a man of conscience will be guilty of it: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having declared that they had done him no injury, but shown much love and reverence unto him, denyeth that there was any just reason, why they could so much as conceive that he was turned an

When men are once engaged in a sinfull course, and especially in the way of error, they are so dementate with it, that they can put no difference betwixt it and themselves; they have common friends and enemies; and whosoever is an enemy to it, is looked upon by them as an enemy to themselves: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> by telling the Truth in opposition to their Error, is looked upon as an enemy; <hi>Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the Truth?</hi> 3.

                  <p>THe Apostle, in further prosecution of the former pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, obviateth an objection, arising from that fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent zeal, or that intense love joyned with serious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to oppose, and a kind of indignation against any thing that might prove hurtfull unto them, which the false Apostles seemed to carry towards them, beyond what <hi>Paul</hi> did; so that yet they had reason to doubt of his affection to them. The Apostle answereth, It was true indeed that the false Apostles pretended great love to, and zeal for them, but their zeal was not of the right stamp, as not having that which is truly good for its object, to wit, the edification of those for whom they


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:44180:107"/>
seemed zealous, but rather their destruction, while all their zealous endeavours did tend to exclude them, and rent their affection from <hi>Paul</hi> himself, and other faithful Pastors. And again, as their zeal did deviate in the object, so also in the scope proposed, which was, not to gain these Galatians to Christ, but popular applause to themselves; and that <hi>Paul,</hi> and such as <hi>Paul</hi> was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cryed down, they alone might be doted upon with a blind kind of zeal and affection, ver. 17. but lest, by condemning their false zeal, he should have seemed to cry down all zeal, therefore he discovereth what true and praise-worthy zeal is, and this, as it seemeth, with an eye to his own practice, whose zeal towards those Galatians, first, was so ordered, that the thing whereunto his zeal for them did carry him, was in it self good, and for their good and edification. Secondly, it was constant, so that distance of place, which occasioned an alteration in them towards him, had not made him to alter towards them, ver. 18. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. See chap. 1. ver. 7. doct. 5. concerning his suppressing the name of the false Apostles, whereby he sheweth more of indignation towards them, nor he could have done by giving them any designation, though never so base; <hi>They zealously affect you.</hi> 2. Hereticall Preachers and Seducers will be exceedingly fervent and zealous for their erroneous opinions, and pretend much love and affection to the People of God, while they are about to make them imbrace their Errors: for, saith he, <hi>They,</hi> to wit, the false Apostles, <hi>zealously affect you.</hi> 3. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing which goeth under the name of zeal, or which truly hath much of zeal and fervency in it, whether for opinions, or persons, is not to be approven, there being so much of sinfull zeal which an hypocrite may have, and therefore is not to be valued or regarded; So doth the Apostle speak of their zeal, <hi>They zealously affect you, but not well.</hi> 4. There is a renting zeal, which carrieth the person wherein it is, with a violent fervor to rent the Church of Christ, and to create prejudices in the minds of people against their faithfull Pastors while they exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate

their good, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 10. and above measure ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grege their sins and infirmities; all such zeal is sinfull, and unworthy to be taken notice of: for, the Apostle proveth that their zeal was not good from this, that it carried them to rent those Galatians from <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Body of the Christian Church; <hi>They would exclude you.</hi> 5. There is a self-seeking zeal, when men, pretending much love to God and to the good of souls, are really hunting after the breath of applause to themselves, and that they alone may have greatest weight in peoples affections, all such zeal is also sinfull: for, he condemneth the zeal of the false Apostles, because their great design in what they did, was to make those Galatians <hi>zealously to affect them.</hi> 6. As the great design of false Teachers, and the upshot of all their most zealous and fervent endeavours, is, to gain credit among the people to their opinions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; So the usual method whereby they walk for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this end, is, first to alienate the minds of people from their own Pastors, that so they themselves may be looked upon as only worthy to have room in peoples affections; for, this was the method of the false Apostles, <hi>They would exclude you,</hi> to wit, from us, <hi>that you might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them,</hi> saith he. 7. The Ministers of Christ would so condemn the counterfeit of saving graces, which may be found in hypocrites, as that they do not in the least measure reflect upon the real graces of God's Spirit, which are found only in true Believers: for, <hi>Paul</hi> having condemned their false zeal, falleth immediately upon the commendation of true zeal; <hi>But it is good to be zealously affected alwayes in a good thing.</hi> 8. It is not enough that the thing which we do, be in it self good, except our affections be somewhat warmed with love to the duty, and stirred up with an holy indignation and revenge against any thing which would divert us from it: for, this is that zeal which is here commended, <hi>It is good to be zealously affected,</hi> saith he. 9. It is required in godly and approven zeal, first, that it be orderly, neither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nor upholding rents or schisms in the Church, and

betwixt the People of God and those who are over them in the Lord: for, the false ungodly zeal of the false Apostles, is condemned from this, that they <hi>would have excluded those Galatians from Paul.</hi> Secondly, that it be sincere, as aiming, not at base and selfish, but approved ends, such as God's glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. our own <hi>(Rev.</hi> 3. 19.) and our neighbours salvation, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 13. for, their zeal is condemned from this, that their great design in all they did, was to make the Galatians affect them.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,


<pb n="201" facs="tcp:44180:108"/>
his design in all his labour and pains, was, not so much to make them affect him (which was all that his adversaries sought after) as, to get the image of Christ (which being once wrought in them by the means of his Ministry, was now marred by their defection) again repared in them, and its lively lienaments drawn upon them: which expressions of his intire affection, are much sweetned by the affectionate stile of <hi>little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> given unto them; So that his whole discourse doth breath out no lesse affection than that of a tender mother towards her dear childe under some languishing disease or consumption, ver. 19. And thirdly, that he desired vehemently to be with them face to face, which was no great evidence of any hatred to them, especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the end of his desire, to wit, that being more fully acquainted with their case, he might accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his speaking to them, whether in meeknesse or severity, unto their temper; and that because, being now at a distance, he could not understand their temper so exactly, and therefore was somewhat perplexed, and in doubt how to deal with them. All which, do expresse to the life, how tender, constant, sincere, and well-ordered his affection and love was towards them, ver. 20.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 19. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. There ought to be such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity betwixt the heart and the tongue, that the tender and warm expressions of kindness uttered by our tongue, may be undoubted evidences of that real kindnesse and respect which is seated in the heart; otherwise fair words are but foul flatteries, abominable both to God and man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 14. for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth speak to these Galatians most affectionatly, as a mother to her dear children, wherein he would have them to read his very heart; <hi>My little children,</hi> saith he. 2. The Ministerial Calling, is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of no small labour and pains, partly, because of much labour and diligence which is required to fit a man for that imployment, and for every part of it, 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 13, 15. Act.</hi> 20. 20. and partly, because of many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles and persecutions which do usually attend


<pb n="202" facs="tcp:44180:109"/>
the faithfull discharging of it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 17. but mainly, because the object of that imployment is the charge of people, with relation to their spiritual and eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 13. -17-.) in which, as people are most apt to miscarry, so their miscarrying therein is most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable unto God and dangerous to themselves; and therefore the Minister, whose charge doth ly about those, and maketh conscience of his charge, cannot but be much exercised even to wearynesse, and the wasting of his natural spirits with a tide of contrary affections, as hopes and fears, joy and sorrow, desire and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> setteth forth the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his ministerial pains by the travel of a woman with childe; <hi>Of whom I travel in birth,</hi> saith he. 3. Though it be God only, who by His own almighty Power doth beget us to that new and spiritual life of Grace, <hi>Iam. 1. 18. 1 Cor.</hi> 3. -6. yet, He maketh use of called Ministers as the ordinary means and instruments, by whose ministery His Spirit doth effectually work, and bring about the conversion of sinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. and therefore the honour and title of being spiritual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers is conferred upon them; hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> not only calleth them his little children, but also saith, <hi>he did travel in birth with them,</hi> whereby he compareth himself to a woman in travel, and the work of the Ministry to the travel it self, by the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of children are born to God. 4. Though those who are once regenerated, cannot totally fall away from grace, so as to stand in need of a second regeneration (for, the seed of God abideth in them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9.) yet, they may so far fall away, as that the new man of Grace in them will be much marred, and all lively evidences of their regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ly under ground and in the dark, and so, as that to outward appearance there will be nothing of the life of God in them: for, though <hi>Paul</hi> saith not, he <hi>be got them again;</hi> yet, <hi>be did travel in birth with them again, that so Christ might be formed in them:</hi> which supposeth, that the Image of Christ in them was much darkened, the beauty


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:44180:109"/>
thereof marred, and their spiritual life and motion hid and hardly discernable, as the life and motion of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born childe in the womb. 5. The great end of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's pains, and that, which not being attained, he is not to cease, or to rest satisfied, is not so much his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneration, as to have a near conformity to Christ, and the draughts of His Image, consisting both in knowledge <hi>(Col.</hi> 3. 10.) and holinesse <hi>(Eph.</hi> 4. 24.) wrought in the hearts and lives of his hearers: for, this was aimed at by <hi>Paul; Until Christ be formed in you,</hi> saith he.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 20. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The presence of a Pastor with his Flock, is so necessary in order to the entertaining of mutual affection, and the suppression of prejudices when they are yet in the bud, and before they come to any great height, and in order to a Minister's better up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the peoples case and condition, and to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of suitable and seasonable remedies; that, (though a Minister may sometimes be necessarily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from his Flock, yet) he ought alwayes have a desire to be present with them, without neglecting any occasion, when it offereth, of returning to them; for, thus was it with <hi>Paul, I desire to be present with you.</hi> 2. A Minister ought to take notice, so far as is possible, of the several conditions and dispositions of his People; that hereby he may know, how to carry himself, and to speak to them in that way which he conceiveth will be most gaining upon every one, admonishing some, reproving others, comforting and instructing some, and sharply threatning others: for, this we conceive is meaned by <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>changing of his voice,</hi> in order to which, he <hi>desired to be present with them;</hi> that so knowing their case, he might the better fit his speech to their condition. 3. As the People of God are not all of one, but of different tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, some being more tractable, and some more obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, some more soft and easie to be wrought upon by the Word, and some more obdured, some more subject to heartlesse discouragements, and others to high and lofty unsobernesse of spirit; So that way of dealing in a


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:44180:110"/>
Minister which will be profitable for the one temper, will not be so for another: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> being ignorant of their present temper, <hi>stood in doubt of them,</hi> as fearing, if he did not fall upon a right way of dealing with them, he might do them more hurt than good. 4. Though a Minister may sometimes have reason to doubt what way to take with a people in order to their gaining, and be not a little perplexed, lest there be not successe answerable to his pains; yet he is not to give over, but must go on, doing what is likeliest, and depending upon God for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: so doth <hi>Paul</hi> here; for, though <hi>be stood in doubt of them,</hi> or was perplexed for them, yet he sendeth this Epistle to them.</p>

                  <p>IN the third part of the Chapter, the Apostle confirmeth and illustrateth the truth of the whole preceding dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation concerning our Justification by Faith, and not by Works, and the abolishing of the ancient legal Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the Covenant of Grace, and this by the history of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family, whereby he sheweth the Lord did prefigure not only the doing away of that ancient Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation under the dayes of the Gospel, but that also so many as did adhere unto it, (being considered as it was set in opposition to the Covenant of Grace, by those who sought to be justified by the works of the Law) were kept under the bondage of sin and wrath here, and at last should be banished from the face of God. And, on the other hand, that a more clear dispensation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace should succeed under the New Testament, and that those who, according to the tenour of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, did seek to be justified through Faith in Christ, should be the children of God, free from the bondage of Ceremonies and of God's wrath here, and possesse the heavenly inheritance hereafter.</p>
                  <p>In order to this, the Apostle first prefaceth in this vers.


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:44180:110"/>
by citing his adversaries and all others, who of their own accord, without and contrary to God's Command, did put themselves again under the yoke of the Mosaical Law, and sought to be justified by the Works thereof, (otherwise all Believers are under the Moral Law as the rule of their life, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 2.) he prefaceth (I say) by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all such to hear what the Law it self, or that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is a part of those five Books of <hi>Moses</hi> which are called the Law <hi>(Rom.</hi> 3. 21.) doth say to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: and withal he taxeth them indirectly for their not understanding the scope of the Law, and of the doctrine relating to it, notwithstanding of their pretending so much to the knowledge of it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Minister of Jesus Christ, is so far in the spirit of meeknesse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to the humours of those, who oppose themselves, in order to their gaining, as that he alwayes keep up his authority amongst and over them, as an Ambassador in Christ's stead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendence and tendernesse carried himself to them, as an affectionate mother, doth now carry the matter with more authority, citing and commanding them to hear a clear refutation of their error; <hi>Tell me,</hi> saith he. 2. So ignorant are all men naturally of that righteousnesse which is of God by Faith, that when it is offered they do what they can to reject it, and (such is their pride and madnesse) go about to establish their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse by Works, betaking themselves to stand or fall according to the sentence of the Law and Covenant of Works; for, the Galatians were thus mad, who, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the offer of Christ's righteousnesse in the Gospel, desired to be under the Law, to wit, so as to be dealt with by God according to the sentence of it. 3. The Doctrine of the written Law, is so far from giving any patrociny to that dangerous error of Justification by Works, That this error ariseth mainly from ignorance of the Law, and chiefly of that which is the scope of the Law, to wit, Christ for righteousnesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 4. for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth point at the reason of their so great desire to be under the


<pb n="206" facs="tcp:44180:111"/>
Law, even their not hearing the Law, so as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it; <hi>Do ye not hear the Law,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle, in the second place, propoundeth the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical history of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family, taken from, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16, and 21. chapters. The sum whereof is, that as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had two sons, to wit, <hi>Ishmael</hi> and <hi>Isaac,</hi> (he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so several others by <hi>Keturab, Gen.</hi> 25. 2. but these two are only mentioned, as being appointed by God to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figure the present purpose) the condition of which two sons did differ in two things, first, That the one, <hi>Ishmael,</hi> was born of a bond-woman or servant, to wit, <hi>Hagar, Gen.</hi> 16. 1. 15. and so was but as a servant himself, and not the heir, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 10. The other, <hi>Isaac,</hi> was born of a free-woman to wit, <hi>Sarah, (Gen.</hi> 21. 2, 3.) who had been never a servant, but mistris, and joynt in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the family with her husband, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Isaac</hi> himself was no servant, but a free-man, even the heir, ver. 22. A second difference did ly in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of their generation and birth; for, <hi>Ishmael</hi> was born <hi>after the flesh,</hi> or by the ordinary strength of nature, his mother <hi>Hagar</hi> being a young woman and fit for concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. 2. but <hi>Isaac</hi> was not conceived nor born from any such principle, <hi>Sarah</hi> his mother being ninety years old when she conceived, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. -17. and so, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the course of nature, unfit for conception, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11, 12. but he was born <hi>by promise,</hi> or by vertue of that promise made to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 16. and the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous operation of God, ver. 23.</p>
                  <p>From this history of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family, considered in it self, and leaving the mystery prefigured by it, to its own place. We <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The best of men are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, there having been some things even in the holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:44180:111"/>
which were not commended, but only tolerated by God, as a lesser evil for prevention of a greater. Such was their polygamy or marrying of moe wives than one, which though contrary to the first institution of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage <hi>(Mal.</hi> 2. 15. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 4, 5, 8.) yet was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by many of the Patriarchs, as not knowing, or at least not considering what sin was in it, being blinded, partly by the tyranny of common custom, and partly by that great desire which they had to multiply their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that if it were possible the Messias might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended of their line: Thus even <hi>Abraham</hi> had two wives, a <hi>bond-maid,</hi> and a <hi>free-woman.</hi> 2. The best of men are in no small hazard to be so far overpowered with tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to mis-belief under the delayed performance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Promises, and the want of all lawfull probable means for the performance of them, as to close with sinful means for bringing of it about, and to repute themselves free from guilt in so doing, as if a good and necessary end could commend a sinfull mean for attaining to it: for, <hi>Abraham,</hi> having a promise that the blessed Seed should come of him <hi>(Gen.</hi> 12. -3.) and having waited for a childe until <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife through age had lost all hopes of conception, is moved, at her desire, to go-in unto <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> his bond-maid, that he might obtain seed by her <hi>(Gen.</hi> 16. 1, 2.) rather than the Promise should ly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performed; <hi>The one by a bond-maid,</hi> saith he. 3. The Lord standeth not in need of our sinfull means for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about of His own gracious work towards us: for, after that <hi>Ishmael</hi> is sinfully begotten upon the handmaid, the Lord maketh <hi>Sarah</hi> conceive a son miraculously, in whom the Promise was to have its accomplishment; <hi>The other by a free-woman.</hi> 4. The Lord hath placed in the natures, as of beasts and birds, so of men and women, an ordinary power of generation and conception, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by one generation may succeed to another, until the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens be no more, and that men who cannot live any long space of time in their own persons, may in a kind perpetuate their life and memory in their posterity unto


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:44180:112"/>
all succeeding generations; Thus <hi>Ishmael was born after the flesh,</hi> or by the ordinary strength of nature. 5. As the power of God is engaged to give a being and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance unto every thing contained within the compasse of a Promise, <hi>Isa.</hi> 46. 11. So it doth accordingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, even when all ordinary means and second causes do fail, and become uselesse for bringing about the thing promised: for, a promise being made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>Sarah</hi> should have a childe, she conceiveth and beareth <hi>Isaac, not after the flesh,</hi> or according to the ordinary course of nature, but through vertue of that Promise; <hi>But he of the free-woman, was by promise,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>IN the third place, the Apostle expoundeth the mystery which was lurking under, and prefigured by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer history. In order to which he sheweth, that those things, or the Scripture presently cited is an Allegorie, that is, besides the literal historical sense of the words, God intended that the purpose contained in them should shadow forth the state of His Church in the following particulars, So that <hi>Abrahams</hi> two Wives did represent the two Covenants, to wit, the old Covenant, or the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace under the old Administration, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 8. 7.) which Covenant was greatly mistaken, and did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate unto a plain Covenant of Works, in the sense of many who did adhere unto it. 2. The new Covenant or the Covenant of Grace under the new Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8. The first of which Covenants he sheweth was prefigured by <hi>Agar</hi> the bond-woman; and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth it, 1. from the place where it was first given, to wit, upon mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> 2. From the like effect produced


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:44180:112"/>
by it with that of <hi>Agar,</hi> to wit, that as <hi>Hagar,</hi> so this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant especially as it was generally mistaken for a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, did beget children unto bondage, that is, they who adhered to that Covenant, so taken, were not thereby freed from their bondage to sin, Satan, and God's wrath (chap. 3. 10.) and were of a servile mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary disposition, as doing whatever they did in God's service, not from love, but slavish fear, and of purpose to merit Heaven by their good works, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 17. This is ver. 24. And, (having, as it were in a parenthesis, shewen the fitnesse of the former resemblance, because mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> where the old Covenant was first delivered, is also in God's providence called <hi>Agar</hi> by the Arabians) he describeth this Covenant thirdly, from those, who in the time of the Apostles did tenaciously adhere to it, by shewing that the earthly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> or the Jewish Church, not, as she was in her best times, but in that present age did <hi>answer,</hi> that is, as the Original doth bear, was in the same rank, or did keep a kind of harmony and concord with that Covenant, because that Church, and the members thereof, called here her children, did remain in a servile condition, which he shewed before, was the fruit of adhering unto this Covenant, as it was now adulterated and corrupted, ver. 25. Now, though the Spirit of God maketh use of the history of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s having two wives, to set forth a spiritual mystery, not condemning his fact; yet, this doth not justifie his poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamy, no more than injustice in stewards is justified by the parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 1. it being sufficient that the Word of God doth condemn polygamy elsewhere, <hi>Màl.</hi> 2. 15. and <hi>Mat. 19. 4, 5, 6. Doct.</hi> 1. Though there be only one genuine sense and meaning of every place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is sometimes expressed in proper <hi>(Gen.</hi> 1. 1.) sometimes in figurative and borrowed speeches, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 32. (otherwise, if Scripture had moe meanings than one, it should be ambiguous and doubtsom) yet this hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, but that the sense of Scripture may be somtimes not simple, but composed, so that there is one thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:44180:113"/>
immediately by the words, and another thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by the purpose comprehended in the words, and but mediately by the words themselves, as it is in types and allegories: for, this history did immediatly set forth the state of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family, and the state of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family did shadow forth the state of God's Church in the particulars afore-mentioned; <hi>Which things are an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legory,</hi> saith he. 2. Though the Spirit of God speaking in Scripture, giveth us expresse warrant to expound some places of Scripture, as holding forth, by way of type or allegory, some further purpose, than what the words do either in their proper or usual acception bear; yet it doth not follow hence, that we may without such war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant expound other Scriptures after the same manner, or hold forth our witty inventions of that kind, as a part of the meaning intended by the Spirit of God in those Scriptures: for, the Spirit of God expresly sheweth, that this Scripture, or, <hi>those things are an Allegory.</hi> 3. It is a very usual way of speaking in Scripture, whereby the name of the thing signified, is given to that which doth only signifie and represent that thing; So is it in the words of the institution of the Lord's Supper, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. -22. and so is it here, where the Apostle, speaking of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s two wives, saith, <hi>Those are the two Covenants;</hi> not that they were essentially such, but because they did represent and prefigure them. 4. Though the Covenant of Grace, entred by God with sinners in Christ, hath been but one for substance in all ages of the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8. yet, there hath been divers wayes of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrating it, one especially under the Old Testament, and another under the New: hence is it, that this one Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is held forth as differing from it self, and as if it were not one, but two; for, <hi>those are the two Covenants,</hi> saith he. 5. The Covenant of Grace, as it was dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed under the Old Testament, (because the Law, and the curse of the Law, was then much pressed, and the grace contained therein but darkly propounded) was therefore generally looked upon as a Covenant of Works, and

the most part did so rely upon it, and expect life from it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> for, the Apostle speaketh of the Covenant made on <hi>Sinai,</hi> in this sense, while he saith, <hi>it did gender unto bondage,</hi> to wit, as it was mistaken for a Covenant of Works; and how it is said in that sense to gender unto bondage, is cleared in the Exposition; <hi>The one from the mount Sinai, which gendreth unto bondage. 6. Hagar, Sarah's</hi> bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, did fitly represent and prefigure the Covenant of Grace, as it was delivered upon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> not only for the reasons contained in the Text, but also because as <hi>Hagar</hi> was once a second wife to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Ishmael</hi> her son for a while <hi>Abraham</hi>'s presumed heir, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 18. yet, after she began to contest with her mistris <hi>Sarah (Gen.</hi> 16. 4.) and her son to persecute <hi>Isaac</hi> the childe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, both mother and son were cast out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family, and deprived of all hope of any inheritance in the Land of promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 9, 10. So, the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> or the Covenant given by God upon mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> while it was rightly used as a Pedagogue leading to Christ, it did bring forth children to God, heirs of the heavenly inheritance, such were all sincere Believers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Testament; but when it was abused, and set up as a Covenant of Works in opposition to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, it did then bring forth children unto bondage, and those who did so adhere unto it, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under damnable slavery, and cut-off from Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. for, the Apostle, shewing that this Covenant was prefigured by <hi>Agar,</hi> doth hint at one reason which leadeth us to seek after moe; <hi>Which Covenant,</hi> saith he, <hi>is Agar: for Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia.</hi> 7. No Church or People hath Religion so firmly established, which in progresse of time may not make such apostasie from it, as that there will be a vast difference betwixt what they once were, and what they now are: for, such a Church was <hi>Jerusalem</hi> once, <hi>Psal.</hi> 76. 1. 2. but now her case was much altered; Therefore, saith he, this Covenant <hi>doth answer,</hi> or keepeth concord with <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> not which once was, but <hi>now is</hi> (importing there was a

Thirdly, by declaring who are the children of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or members of the true Church adhering to this Covenant, even all sincere Believers, whether Jews or Gentiles. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

A false declining; yea, an apostate Church may be, to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, much more owned of God, as to the multitude of followers, external beauty, outward prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and freedom from the crosse, than the true Church; So that none of those things are infallible marks of a true Church: for, the Jewish Synagogue, because of those things, seemed to have an husband, when the Christian Church was desolate; <hi>Than she that hath an husband.</hi> 5. The wise Lord hath thought it fit to make His Church, and real Believers in the Church, lyable, as to their outward condition mainly, to great variety and many changes, it being almost impossible that we who are of such changeable tempers our selves, should bear any one condition right for any long time together, and not miscarry one way or other under it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. -19. for, the Church, for that time barren and desolate, was to have many children; <hi>The desolate hath,</hi> or, as the words may also reade, shall have <hi>many children.</hi> 6. It is the duty of God's People to compose their affections, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those of joy and sorrow, suitably to God's various way of dealing with them: for, the Church, before barren, and therefore sad, is to change her sorrow into joy upon God's changing His way of dealing with her;


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44180:116"/>
                     <hi>Rejoyce thou barren: for the desolate hath many moe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> 7. The enlargement of Christ's Kingdom, and gaining of many sinners to God, together with the weakning of Satan's interest in the world, ought to be entertained with much joy: for, saith he, <hi>Rejoyce, break forth and cry: for the desolate hath many moe children than she that hath an husband.</hi> 8. So many are the discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Godly, and so many causes of grief, which are as heavy weights and strong bars to bear down and keep in their joy, That this duty of rejoycing is not easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come at, even when God in His gracious providence giveth reason for it: Hence the command is inculcated in several words, <hi>Rejoyce, cry, and break forth;</hi> which last, supposeth that many restraints from this duty are lying-on, which must be broken-through before the heart can attain to it.</p>

The sorest persecutions and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles which the Godly endure, do frequently come from those who are otherwise tyed unto them by most strict and nearest relations, of kinred, acquaintance, or such like; This being Satan's aim herein, that their sufferings may have so much the more of bitter gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood in them, as they are inflicted by such, from whom better things in reason might have been expected, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 12, 13. for, <hi>Isaac</hi> is persecuted by his brother <hi>Ishmael; But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him who was born after the Spirit.</hi> 3.

                  <p>HE comforteth them, secondly, from this, That the Jewish Synagogue, and those who adhered thereto, prefigured by <hi>Agar and Ishmael,</hi> should be cast out of the Church of God from the society of the Saints, and from the inheritance of life everlasting, according as was sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed forth by the like sentence of ejection from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s family past upon <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Ishmael,</hi> at first by <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rab, (Gen.</hi> 21. 10.) and authorized afterwards by God Himself, <hi>Gen. 21. 12.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:44180:118"/>
heresies, He will quit them at the last, by suffering them to make total apostasie from Him: for, the Jewish Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, though persecuting Truth, and maintaining Justification by Works, and several other Errors, was not yet cast off by God, but was to be rejected shortly after this, as is not obscurely hinted at by the Apostle while he citeth this Scripture, leaving the application of it unto themselves, <hi>Cast out the bond-woman and her son, &amp;c.</hi> 3. As it is no small disadvantage to Truth, and to those who do maintain it, when their persecuting adversaries do lurk under the mask of God's true Church, and are generally taken for such: So it is no lesse comfort when God taketh off that mask, and maketh it appear unto the world, that they are not the Church of God, but the Synagogue of Satan: for, the Apostle's scope, is, to comfort the Christian Church, that the Jewish Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, who for the time gave out her self and was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken for the true Church, and thereby procured no small authority to her erroneous doctrine and way, should shortly be cast out, and not have so much as the face of a Church; <hi>What saith the Scripture? Cast out the bond-woman.</hi> 4. There is no Salvation, nor any hope of Salvation unto any who are without the true Church: for, the Jewish Synagogue being once un-churched, her children, and those who adhered in all things to her, were debarred from the heavenly inheritance, as <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Ishmael</hi> once being cast out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> family, <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> was thereby debarred from having any part in the promised Land; <hi>Cast out the bond-woman and her son: for the son of the bond-woman shall not be heir, &amp;c.</hi> 5. The Doctrine of Justification by Works, when it's not only doctrinally maintained, but also practically walked in, doth exclude the maintainer of it from having any part in the Kingdom of Heaven: for, so much was prefigured by the son of the bond-woman, against whom a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is passed, that <hi>he shall not be heir with the son of the free-woman.</hi>

Which exhortation he presseth, 1. directly; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, first, Christ had purchased that liberty, ver. 1. Secondly, Circumcision did deprive the person circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised of all benefit by Christ, ver. 2. Thirdly, it engaged him to keep the whole Law, and so made his Salvation impossible, ver. 3. Fourthly, seeking after Justification by these Observances, was a renouncing of Christ, ver. 4. Fifthly, <hi>Paul,</hi> and other converted Jews, sought not to be justified by these, but by Faith, ver. 5. Sixthly, the Command enjoyning Circumcision, had now ceased, ver. 6. Next, he presseth the exhortation indirectly, first, by reproving them for their defection, ver. 7. and by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating two objections, ver. 8, 9. Secondly, by profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his hope of their recovery, ver. 10. Thirdly, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing a calumny spread of himself, as if he had preached Circumcision, ver. 11. Fourthly, by wishing the prime seducers were cut off, ver. 12.</p>
               <p>In the second part of the Chapter, he exhorteth them to use their liberty aright; for which he giveth two rules, 1. They would not give licence to their fleshly corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 2. They would serve one another by love, ver. 13. The latter of which he inforceth Because first, love is the compend of all duty, ver. 14. Secondly, dangerous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects would follow upon the want of it, ver. 15. and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth an help for reducing the first rule in practice, to wit, walking in the Spirit, ver. 16, 17, 18. And having cleared what it is to fulfill the lusts of the flesh, v. 19. 20, 21. and what to walk in the Spirit, from the respective

effects of both <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> ver. 22, 23. he useth one argument against fulfilling the lusts of the flesh; because they were engaged to crucifie them, ver. 24. and another, for walking in the Spirit, because they all pretended at least, to regeneration, and the first principles of a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life, ver. 25. and concludeth with a dehortation from ambition, provoking and envying one another, ver. 26.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle, first, exhorteth them stedfastly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, and against all contrary opposition, to maintain both in judgment and practice the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer doctrine of the Churches freedom, especially from the Levitical Ceremonies. Secondly, he dehorteth them from coming under that intolerable bondage, which did attend the making conscience of those ceremonial obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. and had some resemblance with that bondage of Idolatry, under which they formerly were, with relation to which, he saith, <hi>be not again intangled.</hi> See chap. 4. ver. 9. Thirdly, he inforceth the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more directly by six arguments, The first whereof, which is in this verse, is, Because Christ had purchased this freedom to the Church by His Bloud. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Then only is it seasonable to labour upon the affections of an erring people by exhortation and reproof, when suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient pains have been first taken to inform their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by strength of reason to convince them of their error: otherwayes exhortations, perswasions, and reproofs will prove but poor and weak arguments: for, <hi>Paul</hi> useth this method here, while having formerly gone about by Scripture and Reason to convince them of their Error, he doth now exhort them; <hi>Stand fast therefore, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Every man by nature is a bondslave, as being under the bondage of sin <hi>(Rom.</hi> 6. 17-) Satan <hi>(Eph.</hi> 1. -2.) the


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:44180:120"/>
curse of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. The Jews moreover were under bondage to the Ceremonial Law, the observing whereof was a bondage because of the great trouble, pain in the flesh and expence which did attend the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of it; and therefore it especially is meaned by the yoke of bondage in this place. See <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. for, while he saith, <hi>Christ hath made us free,</hi> he supposeth a foregoing-bondage. 3. Jesus Christ, by his obedience and death (chap. 4. 4, 5.) hath purchased freedom and liberty unto His Church; a liberty not to do evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1. nor from the yoke of new obedience, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. nor from the crosse, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. -34. nor yet from that due obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and reverence which inferiours ow to superiours, <hi>Col. 3. 22.

The consideration of the worth and price which Christ hath put upon our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and liberty in all the fore-mentioned particulars, even such as He hath given Himself for the purchase of it, ought to indear it unto us so much, as that contrary to all opposition, and to the utmost of our power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and upon all hazard whatsoever, we may with courage and constancy, in our places and stations, stand to the defence of it: for, so much doth the Apostle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn, saying, <hi>Stand fast therefore to the liberty, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ hath made us free.</hi> 5. Though civil liberty and freedom from bodily bondage be so much desired, that even before we be called to it, we are ready to break all bonds and aspire to be at it, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 8. Yet, so ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant are we of that worth, which is in spiritual liberty and freedom from spirituall bondage, that hardly can we be excited to seek after it, or made to stand to it when it is attained, but are in daily hazard to return to the


<pb n="225" facs="tcp:44180:120"/>
flesh-pots of <hi>Egypt,</hi> preferring our former bondage to our present liberty. Hence the Apostle findeth it necessary to inculcate this duty so much of <hi>standing to the liberty,</hi> and of <hi>not being intangled again with the yoke of bondage.</hi> 6. Multiplicity of external Rites and significant Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the matter of Worship, is not only a burden and yoke to the conscience, hard to be born, but also an intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling and insnaring yoke, especially when folk do place all their religion in these, so that when once the conscience hath stooped to take on this yoke, hardly can it again be shaken off, the truth whereof doth hold in Rites and Ceremonies, which are even appointed of God, but much more in those, which are appointed only by men: for, the Apostle calleth the Ceremonial Law a yoke, and such as would intangle them; <hi>Be not intangled again with the yoke of bondage;</hi> he alludeth to oxen whose necks are tyed to the yoke with cords, or somewhat else, that they may not shake it off.</p>

The reasons of which sentence, are, first, the holding up of Circumcision, and by consequence the whole bulk of that Mosaical Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, did say in effect that Christ was not yet come, seing all those were to be done away at His coming, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10.

A Minister of Jesus Christ ought not to satisfie himself in this, that, what he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth is pertinent and apposit to the present purpose, but would also endeavour, that those to whom he speaketh may with attention and faith receive it off his hand, In order to which, it is not inconvenient that all-alongs his discourse he labour to quicken their attention by spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king somewhat for that very end, especially when he is to utter any Truth of singular concernment, or from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving whereof he apprehendeth the hearers may be somewhat averse: for, such a truth is here delivered by <hi>Paul,</hi> and therefore he prefixes a note of attention to it; <hi>Behold,</hi> saith he. 2. A Minister ought to be so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the truth of his doctrine, and of his own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from Christ to deliver it, that although his doctrine be contradicted, and his authority undervalued, he may yet with boldnesse assert both the one and the other: for, though <hi>Paul</hi>'s Apostolick Authority was questioned, (See upon chap. 1. ver. 12.) and the Truth which he here holdeth forth much contradicted, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 2. Yet he opposeth his own Authority for the confirmation of this Truth against all who would oppose it; <hi>Behold, I Paul say unto you, if ye be circumcised.</hi> 3. That <hi>Paul,</hi> in this dispute, excludeth from Justification, not only works flowing from the strength of man's free-will, without grace, but also those which flow from a gracious root wrought in the heart by Christ, appeareth from this, that those against whom he disputeth professed faith in Christ, (and so could not maintain that the works of a natural man, destitute of Christ, did justifie) otherwayes, this had been no cogent argum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>t to refute their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>if they were circumcised, Christ should profit them nothing.</hi> 4. Many do professe Christ who shall receive no saving advantage by Him, especially they who rely upon any thing besides Him, or joyntly with Him,


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:44180:121"/>
as the meritorious cause of their salvation: for, saith he, <hi>If ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</hi>

                  <p>HEre is a third Argument, to which also <hi>Paul</hi> premit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his Apostolical Authority, seriously affirming, and by a publick profession confirming, (for so the word rendred <hi>testifie</hi> doth signifie) that whosoever now (Christ the substance being come) did observe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision (to wit, in the way wherein it was urged by the false Apostles, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 2.) he was thereby engaged to keep the whole Law, and this, the whole Ceremonial and Judicial Law, (Circumcision being the initiatory Sacrament engaging the Receiver to the whole Mosaical Pedagogie, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 48.) and the whole Moral Law, and that under the hazard of condemnation. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof, is, That no lesse than universal and perfect obedience to the Law in all its precepts is required unto this, that a man be justified by Works, <hi>Gal. 3. 10. Doct.</hi> 1. Of how much the nearer concernment unto the salvation of hearers any Truth is, the Minister of Christ ought so much the more to insist upon it, and with so much the greater seriousnesse and fervency to inculcate and presse it, as a matter of life and death; that people may know he believeth, and therefore speaketh, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently may be the more moved with what he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: for, <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of a Truth, the not-receiving whereof would have condemned those Galatians, he doth with much vehemency insist upon the pressing of it; <hi>I testifie again,</hi> saith he, <hi>to every man that is circumcised.</hi> 2. Because it is a matter of no small difficulty to get those reclaimed who are engaged in an evil course, <hi>Jer:</hi> 13. 23. therefore frequent testimonies would be given by Christ's Ministers against them in it; that hereby the guilty party may have the lesse of ease and peace in their way, and thereby, through God's blessing upon


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:44180:122"/>
His own mean be made to quit it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. And at least, the Lord's Servants may be the more exonered, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 19. and others of the Lord's People preserved from being infected with that sin, which they do so much and so frequently testifie against, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 20. for, in order to those ends. <hi>Paul</hi> (having once, and oftener, both in this Epistle, and by his preaching, doubtlesse, while he was with those Galatians, testified against this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous error of theirs) doth here give further testimony against it, while he saith, <hi>For I testifie again to every man.</hi> 3. It is wholly impossible for any meer man to keep the Law of God perfectly in this life, and to obtain salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by so doing, <hi>Paul</hi> taketh this for granted; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise this argument, that circumcision did engage them to keep the whole Law, under hazard of condemnation, had not been cogent; <hi>He is a debtor to do the whole Law.</hi> 4. Though Believers in Jesus Christ be not delivered from their obligation to the least duty which is required by any precept of the Moral Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 19. yet, they are not under that exact rigor and condemning power of the Law, whereby eternal wrath is denounced against the sinner for the meanest breach of the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. 26. for, while he speaketh of their being <hi>debtors to do the whole Law,</hi> as a sad terrifying consequence of their being circumcised, it must be understood not simply of their obligation to obedience, but of an obligation under the penalty of the Law's curse; and hereby it is imported that sincere Believers are not under this obligation, else the argument were of no force.</p>

                  <p>FOlloweth a fourth Argument, to wit, Whosoever did observe the Levitical Ceremonies as they were pressed by the false Apostles, or sought to be justified by their observing of them, they by so doing had renounced Christ, and all benefit to be had by Him, (for, the word


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:44180:122"/>
rendred <hi>Christ is become of no effect to you,</hi> signifieth, ye are made void of, and separated from Christ) and had fallen from the way and doctrine of Free-grace: for, <hi>Grace</hi> here seemeth to be taken for the doctrine of <hi>Grace,</hi> as <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. The reason of the consequence, is, that Grace and Works are not consistent in the justification of a sinner; if the one have any hand in it, the other hath none, <hi>Rom. 11. 6. Doct.</hi> 1. Those sad consequences mentioned here, and in the preceding verses, do not strike against the observing of Circumcision simply, and at all times and cases, (for, even at this very time the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance thereof was tolerated to the weak Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 6. and to some of the stronger sort also, as of a thing at that time indifferent to them, for eschewing the offence of the weak, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 3.) but as it was pressed by the false Apostles, even as the cause of a mans Justification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: for, to be <hi>circumcised,</hi> and <hi>to be justified by the Law,</hi> are equivalent phrases in the Apostle's meaning, as is clear from ver. 2, 3. compared with this; <hi>Whosoever of you are justified,</hi> or <hi>seek to be justified by the Law.</hi> 2. To make apostasie from Christ, and the Gospel once recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is of more dreadfull consequence, than the not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Him, or not reaping any profit by Him at all: for, having spoken (ver. 2.) of their receiving no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by Christ, as one bad consequence of their being circumcised, which was common to them with those who never professed the Name of Christ, he doth here mention their apostasie from Christ and Grace, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bad consequence, which he reserveth to the last place, as being more formidible than any of the former; Ye are become separate from Christ, <hi>ye are fallen from Grace.</hi> 3. The Apostle's consequence, whereby he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth, that they who seek Justification by Works, are fallen from Grace, doth no wayes prove that the truly Regenerate can really or totally fall from God's grace and favour: for, by <hi>Grace</hi> is meaned the doctrine of Grace. Besides, their falling from Grace is only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional, and suspended upon their seeking Justification

                  <p>HE addeth a fifth Reason, to wit, That <hi>Paul</hi> himself, and other Jews who before their conversion to the Christian Faith were circumcised, being now converted and taught by the holy Ghost, did renounce all confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their own works or carnal priviledges, whether Circumcision or any other, and did look for Heaven (called here <hi>Hope,</hi> because it is the object of our hope, as <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 13.) only by vertue of that righteousnesse of Jesus Christ which is laid hold upon by Faith. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The riches of a Believer, are not so much in possession, as in expectation and hope; <hi>We wait for the hope,</hi> or, for Heaven hoped for. 2. None have right to Heaven here, or shall enjoy it after this, who are wholly unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and destitute of all righteousnesse; for, it is called <hi>the hope of righteousnesse,</hi> as being attained unto by the Righteous only, and by vertue of their righteousnesse. 3. No personal righteousnesse of our own, doth entitle us to this blessed hope and heavenly inheritance, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. but only the righteousnesse of Christ imputed to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. and apprehended by Faith, which therefore is called here <hi>Righteousnesse through Faith.</hi> 4. It is only the inward efficacious teaching of God's Spirit, which can sufficiently instruct us in the knowledge of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteousnesse by Faith, and make us with secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and confidence venture our eternal well-being, and hope of Heaven upon it: for, saith he, <hi>We through the Spirit,</hi> or being taught by the Spirit of God, <hi>do wait for the hope of righteousness.</hi> 5. The experience and example of other exercised gracious Christians, ought to be of


<pb n="231" facs="tcp:44180:123"/>
great weight to incline our judgment and affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an assenting unto, and imbracing of those Truths, from which they have drawn spiritual consolation: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth reason, that they ought to receive the doctrine of Justification by Faith, because he himself, and other believing Jews did venture their salvation in that bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; <hi>For we wait for the hope of righteousnesse through Faith.</hi> 6. The example of none, though of never so much reputation in the Church, is to be followed as an absolute rule, but in so far only, as their practice is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proven by the Spirit of God speaking in Scripture, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 20. for, <hi>Paul,</hi> to make his example a sufficient rule for them to follow, sheweth he did nothing but as he was taught by the Spirit of God; <hi>For we through the Spirit wait,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>HEre is his sixth Reason, which militates not only against the observing of Circumcision, and those other Levitical Ceremonies, as a part of a mans righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse before God, but also against the necessity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving them at all; Because in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> or, in the state of the Church under the Gospel after Christ was manifested in the flesh, neither the observing of these things, nor the neglect of them, did commend a man to God, as acceptable service to Him; the service which He now requireth, being only a true lively Faith, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing it self to be such by the fruits of a new life, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the love of God and our neighbour, <hi>Rom. 13. 8.

high measure detestable, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 19. Yet, Christ being come in the flesh, who was the substance of all those shadows, <hi>(Col.</hi> 2. 17.) the command whereby they were enjoyned did cease, they remaining for a season chiefly to the Jews, and some of them also to the Gentiles, <hi>(Act.</hi> 15. 29.) in their own nature indifferent, so that the using or not using of them (except in the case of eschewing scandal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14 21. and of bearing testimony to the doctrine of christian liberty, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 3, 4.) did neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a man, nor make him guilty before God: for, saith he, <hi>In Jesus Christ, neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor Uncircumcision.</hi> 2. To impose the ty of a Command upon any thing as a necessary part of divine Worship, wherein the Word hath left us free, or to subject our selves to any such Command, is a receding from, and a betraying of that liberty which is purchased unto us by Christ: for, he maketh their receiving of Circumcision as a necessary part of Worship, a receding from this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; because now in the dayes of the Gospel there is no command from God to be circumcised: <hi>For in Jesus Christ</hi> (saith he) <hi>neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor Uncircumcision.</hi> 3. The ceremonial Law being abolished under the New Testament, Christians are not left desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of work, and idle: for, though <hi>in Jesus Christ, neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor Uncircumcision;</hi> yet, <hi>Faith, which worketh by love, availeth.</hi> 4. The sum of a Christian man's task now under the Gospel, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the great Command of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23. and of <hi>Love,</hi> or new obedience; for, Love is the fulfilling of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 10. neither is the use of the Sacraments, and of other pieces of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Worship hereby excluded; for they are helps of our Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. and a part of those duties of love which we owe to God, as being enjoyned by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Command: for, saith he, <hi>in Christ Jesus availeth Faith that worketh by love.</hi> 5. Though Faith only doth justifie, there being no other grace which concurreth with it in this work, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 16. Yet, Faith is not alone


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:44180:124"/>
in the heart, no not when it doth justifie; but is alwayes accompanied with the grace of Love to God and our neighbour: for, <hi>in Christ Jesus no Faith availeth any thing,</hi> or will be owned by Him as true and saving, but that <hi>which worketh by Love.</hi> 6. Though Faith and Love be alwayes conjoyned; yet, Faith, in order of nature, at least, hath the precedency; it being impossible that we can discharge any duty of Love to God, or our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, sincerely or acceptably, before we close with Christ for the acceptation of our persons by Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. and thereby draw covenanted furniture from Christ for through-bearing in our duty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. for, saith he, <hi>Faith worketh by Love,</hi> or is efficacious, and putteth forth its efficacy in Love, as the fruit thereof.</p>

                  <p>HE further presseth the former exhortation indirectly, by four Arguments, first, By commending them for their former forwardnesse in the imbracing of this now controverted Truth (which he calleth their <hi>running well,</hi> or, with a sort of beauty and comlinesse; for so much doth the word signifie) and shewing no satisfying rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son could be given for their present defection from it, and from walking according to it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A christian life is like to a course, or race, from Earth to Heaven by the way of Holinesse and all commanded duties, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the exercise of Faith and Love; and therefore we ought to carry our selves in this way, as those who run in a race (See <hi>Philip. 3. 13. Doct.</hi> 4.) for, the Apostle setteth forth their progresse in Christianity by a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor taken from Runners in a race; <hi>Ye did run well.</hi> 2. It is very ordinary for new Converts to be carried-on with a greater measure of affection and zeal, and to make swifter progresse in this christian course, than others, or they themselves afterwards, when they are of older stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; The newnesse of the thing, the first edge which is


<pb n="234" facs="tcp:44180:125"/>
upon their affections not yet blunted by change of cases, and multiplicity of duties, and Gods restraining for a time the violent assault of multiplied furious tentations, untill they be a little confirmed and engaged in his way, together with His affording a more plentifull measure of His sensible presence at first, than afterwards, do all contribute hereto: for, those Galatians at, and for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son after their first conversion, <hi>did run,</hi> and <hi>run well.</hi> 3. As those who once made good progresse in the wayes of God may afterward sit up, their after-carriage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no wayes answerable to their promising begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings: So, when it falleth thus out, it's matter of a sad regrate unto beholders, and of a deserved reproof unto the persons themselves: for, thus was it with those Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians, whose defection is matter of astonishment to <hi>Paul,</hi> and of a sad rebuke to them; <hi>Ye did run well, who did hinder you?</hi> 4. No satisfying reason can be given, for which any, who once did enter the way of truth and holinesse, should alter his course, take up an halt, or make defection from it, and thereby cause the wayes of God to be evil spoken of, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. for, <hi>Paul</hi>'s question, <hi>Who did hinder you?</hi> importeth that none in reason could have hindered them. 5. When people fall remisse and lazie in giving obedience to known Truth, they are upon the very brink &amp; precipice of defection unto contrary Error, and of apostasie from the very profession of Truth: for, therefore the Apostle doth challenge them for <hi>not obeying the Truth,</hi> though their apostasie from Truth be mainly intended; implying, that not obedience to Truth, and apostasie from it, are near of kin each to other. 6. The serious consideration of a mans former forwardnesse in the wayes of God, and how little reason can be given for his present backsliding and remissnesse, is a strong incitement to do the first works, and by future diligence to regain what he hath lost by his former negligence: for, the Apostle's scope, is, to incite towards a recovery of their lost liberty by the consideration of those two, <hi>Ye did run well, who did hinder you?</hi>

There is much perswasion and confidence, whereof God is not the author, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that, which taketh darknesse for light, and error for truth: this perswasion is not of God, or real, but a strong delusion, arising from arrogancy and self-conceit in the person erring (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2, 4. compared with ver. 6.) together with his strong engagements from credit, profit, or some other lust, to follow that error, which do blind the understanding, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. but especially from the powerfull working of Satan, who blindeth the minds of those who believe not the Truth, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 4. 2 Thess.</hi> 2. 9, 10. for, saith he, <hi>This perswasion cometh not of God.</hi> 3.

A Minister would so make known to people his charitable confidence of their recovery from sin and error, as he may not thereby give them ground to conceive that he is not much displeased with their sin, and so render them secure under it, as making a sleeping pillow of those his hopes: for, the Apostle, having shewen his charitable confidence towards the seduced people, doth evidence how dangerous their error was, notwithstanding, by denouncing Gods judgment against their prime seducers; <hi>But he that troubleth you, shall bear bis judgment,</hi> saith he. 6.

                  <p>HE presseth the exhortation, thirdly, by refuting a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, whereby, as it seemeth his adversaries would have made people believe, that <hi>Paul,</hi> by circumcising <hi>Timothy,</hi> to prevent the stumbling of the weak Jews <hi>(Act.</hi> 16. 3.) had declared himself to be of the same judgment with them in the present controversie. And he answereth, denying that he did urge Circumcision to be observed by the Gentiles at all, <hi>(Act.</hi> 21. 25.) nor yet by the Jews in the sense of his adversaries, and giveth two evidences of the truth of his denial; First, if he had preached Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, the Jews would not have persecuted him, as they constantly did. Secondly, they would not have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken offence at the preaching of the Gospel, or of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Christ crucified, which is here called the <hi>Crosse,</hi> or doctrine of the Crosse, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18. The truth of both which consequences lyeth in this, that the great reason why the Jews did persecute the Apostle, and were such enemies to his doctrine, was his preaching down of Circumcision, and the whole frame of that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient legal administration, under which they were born and educated, <hi>Act. 21. 28. Doct.</hi> 1. It is the ordinary lot of faithfull Ministers, to be subject unto slander and reproaches, not only in respect of their lives, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. but also in respect of their Ministry and Doctrine, as if they were Hereticks: for, even <hi>Paul</hi> is reported of as a preacher of Circumcision, which is supposed, while he saith, <hi>If I yet preach Circumcision.</hi> 2.

report of <hi>Paul,</hi> as is here supposed; <hi>If I yet preach Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision.</hi> 3. The faithfull Minister of Jesus Christ, though he be maliciously and basely reported of, ought not to render evil for evil unto those who have invented or entertained such reports, but to return love for their hatred, and good for their evil, labouring more to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himself, than to rub disgrace upon them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he shall heap coals of fire upon their head, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 20. for, so doth <hi>Paul,</hi> while he laboureth only to clear himself to those Galatians, among whom he was mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reported of giving them the affectionate stile of Brethren; <hi>And I, Brethren, if I yet preach Circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution?</hi> 4. While we labour to clear our selves from false imputations or calumnies, we had need to use much circumspection in declaring the matter of fact, lest we fail in any one circumstance and so be found lyars, while we go about to justifie our selves; for, <hi>Paul</hi> is thus circumspect while he denyeth not that he did cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise any (for he circumcised <hi>Timothy, Act.</hi> 16. 3.) or that he did ever preach Circumcision (for he did so while he was a Pharisee, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 13, 14.) but that he did preach the observing of it now as a thing necessary to salvation; <hi>If I yet preach Circumcision,</hi> saith he. 5. A faithfull Minister neither ought, nor will conceal any part of necessary Truth, which he is otherwise called to preach, though he certainly know, he will incur hazard, losse and persecution from men because of it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> knew he was persecuted by the Jews for his preaching against Circumcision, and yet he preacheth; <hi>Why do I yet suffer persecution?</hi> 6.

as if they were thereby freed from all obligation to serve God or man in any thing, and giveth two Rules to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them in the right use of their liberty, first, <hi>They would not use their liberty for an occasion to the flesh;</hi> where, by <hi>flesh</hi> is not meaned the substance of our fleshly bodies, but the power of sin and corruption which is in every man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 3. and is seated not only in our carnall fleshly appetite, but in all the powers of the soul, even the understanding <hi>(Rom.</hi> 8. 7.) and will, or rational ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, <hi>(Col.</hi> 2. -18.) not being excepted. So the sense of the Rule prescribed, is, That they would not take en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from this doctrine of Christian liberty to give licence unto the power of sin and corruption within them to break all bonds, and to fulfill its own lusts. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That they would <hi>by love serve one another;</hi> or, that notwithstanding of this purchased liberty, every one without exception of persons would from the fountain of love imploy himself in all the duties of love for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the good of his neighbour, and by consequence would straiten, or enlarge himself in the use of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, as might be most conducing to his neighbours spiritual edification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, 13, 15. 1 <hi>Cor. 8. 9. Doct.</hi> 1. There is not any one thing which ought to be more desired and endeavoured by an honest Minister, than that the People of God committed to his charge, do in some measure walk answerably to their christian cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and nothing ought to stir up his zeal and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more, than when they either actually walk, or are tempted to walk in a course contrary unto it: for, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they not only mar the fruits of the Gospel to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, (see ver. 4.) but also cause it to be evil spoken of by others, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 14. Hence is the Apostle's zeal so hot against the false Apostles, as that he wisheth them to be cut off, even because they tempted those Galatians to undergo a yoke of servitude contrary to that state of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, unto which they were called; <hi>For, Brethren, ye have been called unto liberty,</hi> saith he. 2. Such is the power and subtilty of inbred corruption, as that it perverteth


<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44180:130"/>
the nature even of those things which are best, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth occasion from them to do wickedly: for, there is hazard, lest occasion be taken by corrupt nature, even from the doctrine of christian liberty, to break all bonds, and to become licencious, as is supposed, while he saith, <hi>Only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh.</hi> 3. The Minister of Jesus Christ ought with great circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to guard and cautionate the Truth delivered by him, and especially such Truths, as not being sufficiently guarded may readily be mistaken, and made use of for the encouragement of corrupt nature in any vice or er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: for, such was this doctrine of christian liberty, and therfore the Apostle doth seasonably guard it, <hi>Only,</hi> saith he, <hi>use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh.</hi> 4. That our christian liberty purchased by Christ, may be used aright, it is required that we do not abuse it as an occasion of fleshly liberty, whether, first, by making those things indifferent and free, which God hath not made free, as the Gentiles did fornication, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. ver. 12, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Or, secondly, by the immoderate and excessive use of things in their own nature indifferent, as of meat, drink, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, which is frequently condemned, See <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 13. for, the Apostle prescribeth this as one rule for the right use-making of christian liberty; <hi>Only use not liberty for an occasion of the flesh.</hi> 5. It is not sufficient for the right use-making of christian liberty, that we do not from thence take occasion to sin our selves, but we must also labour carefully to guard, lest by the offensive and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet use of liberty we give offence, and minister oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of sin and stumbling unto others: for, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth this as a second rule, that in the use of their liberty they would <hi>by love serve one another,</hi> having an eye espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially upon their neighbours spiritual edification, <hi>Rom. 14. 13, 15, Doct.</hi> 6. This freedom and liberty purchased by Christ, doth not loose the ty of any necessary duty, which we are under, whether to God or man. The yoke of duty is no wayes repugnant unto, but very consistent with christian liberty: for, the Apostle, having at large


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:44180:131"/>
exhorted them to stand to this liberty, he subjoyneth, <hi>by love serve one another.</hi> 7. Though Christianity doth not abolish the civil distinction of masters and servants, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 5, 9. And though all Christians be in some respects the Lords free-men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 22. yet, they are all (even the greatest not being excepted) mutually servants one to another, in so far as being fellow-members of one body, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27.) they ought not to live unto themselves only, but to spend themselves in their respective imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the spiritual and civil advantage of the whole body, and of every particular member thereof, so far as their capacity and calling (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12, 13.) do reach: for, the Apostle enjoyneth unto all without exception, <hi>serve one another.</hi> 8. It is not sufficient we do those things which are in themselves materially good, or conducing to our neighbours profit and advantage, except what is done of that kind do flow from the fountain of christian love towards him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2, for, saith he, <hi>serve one another by love.</hi> 9. There is no duty so onerous in it self, or so far below us in our esteem, but the grace of love, being lively in the heart, will make us pleasantly stoop unto it, if it were even to serve the meanest person in the world: for, he commandeth all, even the greatest, to <hi>serve one another by love;</hi> importing, where love is not, this service will hardly be undergon, and that love will make it easie.</p>

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:44180:131"/>
sincerity as we do our selves: Now, love to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, is called the fulfilling of the Law, not as if love to God were not thereby commanded also, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37. but because love to our neighbour supposeth love to God, and floweth from it, as a stream from the fountain, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 1. and is an evidence of it, 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 21. Doct.</hi> 1. Though Believers in Jesus Christ be delivered from the condemning sentence of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. yet, not from the directing power thereof. The Law doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes remain a rule of our new obedience, though it cease from being a Judge either to justifie, or condemn us: for, the Apostle inforceth the duty of love from the authority of the Law, which doth enjoyn it; for, <hi>all the Law is fulfilled in one word, &amp;c.</hi> saith he. 2. Love to our neighbour is a most comprehensive duty, as comprising not only inward affection, but also outward action, and extending it self to all the duties both positive and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which are enjoyned by the whole second Table; (See <hi>Mat. 22. 39.) love thy neighbour as thy self.</hi> 3.

                  <p>HEre is a second argument, to inforce the exercise of mutual love, taken from some dangerous effects, which, doubtlesse, had already followed in part among those Galatians, occasioned by their debates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, and would yet follow more upon the want of love, to wit, first, Their bitter strifes, backbitings, rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and reproaches, set forth by the biting of wilde beasts; And, secondly, other real injuries, by fraud or violence, which seem to be pointed at, by <hi>devouring,</hi> which is more than biting: And lastly, as a consequence of the two former, a total vastation and consumption of the whole Church. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As it is a matter of no small difficulty to entertain love among the members of a Church, when they are divided in opinion and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about religious Truths; So where love groweth cold, Church-divisions have ordinarily sad and scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous effects, which argue little of a tender frame of heart in those who have them, even such as are here mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>biting, and devouring one another.</hi> 2. However a


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:44180:132"/>
sectarian spirit doth ordinarily pretend to much sobriety and meeknesse, especially when it first appeareth, and hath but few to give it any countenance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 18. yet, so soon as it hath gathered strength, and gained ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny followers, it hath been alwayes found most bitter and cruel: for, the effects of this renting schismatick spirit among those Galatians, were no lesse than <hi>biting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring one another.</hi> 3. In time of Church-divisions, though that party which is for truth and piety be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the most sober, <hi>Jude</hi> v. 20. 21. yet, considering that even they have much unmortified corruption apt to be provoked by the insolency of their schismatick adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries there is no small hazard, lest even they vent much of fleshly zeal and passion, and while they are defending Truth, become guilty of several miscarriages, and so be rendred much the worse of their contests and divisions: for, the sin which he doth partly reprove, and partly guard against, was mutual, and of both parties; <hi>If ye bite and devour one another,</hi> saith he. 4. When schism in a Church is not only maintained on the one hand with fleshly passion, strife, reproaches, and other real injuries, but when it is also oppugned upon the other hand, not so much with the sword of the Spirit the Word of Truth, as with the same fleshly and sinfull means, Then especially is schism the fore-runner and procuring cause of desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ruine to both parties, and to the whole Church; and this not only because of that hemous guilt which is in it, but also that stumbling-blocks are thereby multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, which cannot but prevail mightily to make men doubt of all Truth, and in end prove nulli-fidians: for, the Apostle holdeth this forth as the consequence of their biting and devouring one another, <hi>Take heed,</hi> saith he, <hi>lest ye be destroyed one of another.</hi> 5. As it is a matter of great difficulty to make men of credit and parts, being once engaged in their contentious debates, to project the consequences of their so doing further than the hoped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for victory against their contrary party, <hi>Act. 15. 37, &amp;c.</hi> So it were no small wisdom, before folk meddle with

As a Minister ought to point at some helps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the People for their better discharging of any difficult duty; So he ought to make it appear that those are helps indeed, and how they contribute for the more easie pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising of the duty pressed; otherwise they receive no encouragement thereby, neither to set about the duty, nor to make use of those helps in order to the duty: for, the Apostle having prescribed an help for keeping the <hi>flesh</hi> at under, doth here demonstrate clearly, that the thing prescribed doth really help, as appeareth from the scope. 2. As the regenerate man hath a renewed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Grace in all the faculties and powers of the soul, wrought in him by the Spirit of God; So he hath in all those some remainder of corruption yet unmortified, whereby his whole mind, will and affections are partly spiritual, partly carnal, both <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> are in him; <hi>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit,</hi> saith he. 3. None of those powers or principles in the regenerate man, are

dead, dull, or meerly passive, but both of them are work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and active; for, <hi>the flesh lusteth,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit lusteth,</hi> whereby is meaned, that both of them do sway and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the whole man to work in a way congruous to their respective natures, the one to good, and the other to evil. 4. The activity of these two active principles is in a flat opposition the one to the other; so that in one and the same man, and while he is about one and the same action, there is a conflict and battel betwixt these two contrary parties, <hi>Rom. 7. 19, 21. The flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.</hi> 5. As there is a mixture of both these principles in all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faculties of the regenerate man; So there is a mixture of their respective influence and efficacy in every action of his, whereby, though there be a prevalency of the one above the other in some actions; yet there is not one action to which both of them do not contribute somewhat: if not by a causal influence; yet by some measure of active resistance; <hi>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh.</hi> 6. Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that as the actions of the regenerate are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and free from a sinful mixture; So there is some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt his worst actions, and those same actions as gone about by the unregenerate man, even this, that the flesh doth not advance with a full gale, but meeteth with the contrary tyde of resistance from the Spirit in some degree: for, as the <hi>flesh lusteth against the Spirit,</hi> so <hi>the Spirit lusteth against the flesh: and ye cannot do the thing that ye would,</hi> saith he. 7. Though unregenerate men may have somewhat like to this spiritual combat, even a conflict sometimes betwixt the natural conscience, and rebellious affections, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 1. yet they have not this same very combat here spoken of, wherein one faculty is not carried against the other, but every faculty, as it is <hi>flesh,</hi> is carried against it self, as it is <hi>spirit;</hi> now that this combat is not in the unregenerate man, appeareth from this, that he is wholly <hi>flesh, Gen.</hi> 6. 5. and not at all <hi>spirit,</hi> And this combat is betwixt <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>spirit;</hi> for, <hi>the flesh

So that corruption in them is not so much irritated by the Law as in the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and by consequence the lusts of the flesh are not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, as was expressed, ver. 16. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate part, or new man of Grace, performeth the office of

guide and leader to the godly in all their actions which are truly spiritual, In so far as, first, it self is ruled by the Word, and to be tryed by the Word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 20. which Word alone is the external light and lanthorn to direct our steps, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 105. as the light of the Sun or candle is to the eye.

Thirdly, the same work of Grace, as the will and affections are thereby renewed, being actuated by the continual supply of exciting grace from the Spirit of the Lord, is a strengthening guide to all spiritual actions, by whose influence alone the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man (who as to any principle of nature and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will within himself, is not sufficient to think any thing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5.) is rendred able, and made actually to walk in the wayes of God. <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 13. for, while he saith, <hi>If ye be led by the Spirit,</hi> he supposeth the office of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and regenerate part is to guide and lead. 2. The natural man, so long as he remaineth in that state, is so much a slave to his sinful lusts, That those things which are appointed of God to curb and make them weaker, are so far from bringing about the end proposed, that his lusts are thereby inraged and made more violent: for, the Apostle (being to prove that those who are led by the Spirit do not fulfill the lusts of the flesh; which is laid down to be proved, ver. 16.) saith, <hi>such are not under the Law,</hi> to wit, the strict and rigid exaction of the Law; importing, that the rigidity of the Law, which of its own nature tendeth to restrain sin, and to make it weaker, is turned by the unregenerate man unto an occasion for the fulfilling of his lusts.</p>

Secondly, <hi>Fornication,</hi> or the sin of filthinesse betwixt parties both free from the yoke of marriage.

It is not sufficient that a Minister, having divided his hearers in two ranks, to wit, spiritual and carnal, or renewed and unrenewed, denounce eternal wrath to the latter, and promise God's favour and life eternal to the former; but it is also necessary, that he give evident and discrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting marks of both, and of the one from the other, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by every one may be in some measure enabled without mistake to judge of his own inward estate, and so to know whether the judgment denounced, or mercy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, be his allotted portion: for, the Apostle giveth such discriminating marks of <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> from their respective effects; <hi>The works of the flesh are manifest,</hi> saith he; and, ver. 22. <hi>the fruit of the Spirit is love.</hi> 2. As it is not sufficient for a Minister to condemn and reprove sin in the general, without condescending upon some particular instances and examples; because general do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is not so well understood, and especially in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of sin, it is looked upon almost by every hearer as if he himself were not concerned in it: So in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of instances and examples (because he cannot, neither were it convenient to enumerate all) such would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended upon as are best known, and most commonly practised among those to whom he preacheth: for the Apostle giveth such instances of the works of the flesh, as for the most part, the present defection, schism and distemper flowing from thence, which was among those Galatians, did carry them unto <hi>Idolatry, heresie, variance, strife, &amp;c.</hi> and, as it seemeth, all the rest have been but too commonly practised amongst them, as <hi>adultery, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Sin hath seated it self, not only in the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual appetite, but in the more noble faculties of the soul also, namely our understanding and will; so that the whole man is corrupted by nature, and altogether <hi>flesh;</hi>


                     <pb n="260" facs="tcp:44180:138"/>
for, the works of the <hi>flesh</hi> here enumerated are of three sorts, according to those three parts of corrupt flesh, or nature, to wit, our reason, will, and sensual appetite: So as some of them are seated in, and have their rise from each of those; the four first, <hi>Adultery, fornication, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse</hi> and <hi>wantonnesse,</hi> and the two last, belong to the sensual appetite, <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>heresie</hi> to blind and corrupt reason; <hi>Witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, envyings, murders,</hi> belong partly to the depraved will, and partly to the sensual appetite. 4. Not only are grosly scandalous evils, works of the flesh, excluding those who are guilty from the Kingdom of Heaven, such as <hi>Adultery, witchcraft, &amp;c.</hi> but also such sins, as being seated in the heart, do not break forth to the view of the world, of which sort are <hi>hatred, emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, envyings:</hi> for, even <hi>they that do such things shall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom of God.</hi> 5. There is no sin so grosse, as being against all piety, conscience, and the very light of nature it self, which people have not need to guard against, and Ministers to deter them from by the terrible denunciations of God's heavy judgement against those, who shall be found guilty of such like; And that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the seed of all sin is in every man, <hi>Rom. 3. 10, &amp;c.</hi> And there is no sin, into which a man given over of God will not fall, when he is tempted to it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10. 27. for, the Apostle thinketh it necessary to scar them even from <hi>Adultery, witchcraft</hi> and <hi>murder,</hi> by shewing that <hi>they who do such things shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> 6. That a Minister may bear down and suppresse sin amongst the people committed to his charge to any purpose, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary he inveigh by just and necessary reproof, not only against the grosse and external acts of sin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but also against the first motions and conception of those sins in the heart, and every thing which may prove an occasion of breaking forth in those grosser evils; for, the Apostle setteth forth the evil not only of <hi>Adultery, fornication</hi> and <hi>uncleannesse,</hi> but also of <hi>wantonnesse;</hi> not only of <hi>witchcraft,</hi> but also of <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>variance,</hi> which


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:44180:138"/>
often prove tentations unto <hi>witchcraft;</hi> and not only of <hi>murders,</hi> but also of <hi>wrath, envyings, emulations, strife:</hi> all which make way for <hi>murders.</hi> 7. Ministers are God's watchmen, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 17. and therefore are bound to give faithfull and timous warning unto every man of his spiritual hazard; lest otherwise the bloud of people be required at his hands: This made <hi>Paul</hi> often to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> 8. Though former warnings have not the expected successe; yet, the Minister of Christ, must not faint nor despair, as if there were no hope; but ought to renew his zeal, and reiterate those very same warnings and threatnings, as not knowing when the Lord may give the long, wished<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for blessing, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. Thus did <hi>Paul; Of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past.</hi> 9. As life eternal and the state of glory to be enjoyed after this, is a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> because there shall be an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der betwixt King and subject there, the one command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the other obeying, without any hazard of rebellion and faction, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. -10.

                  <p>THe Apostle, in like manner, for the better understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the more easie practising of the remedy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed against fleshly lusts, ver. 16. He giveth a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of some of those gracious vertues, and the exercise of them, which flow from the Spirit, or the root of Grace in the heart: And having called the former instances (ver. 19.) only <hi>works of the flesh,</hi> he designeth these by the name of <hi>fruits of the Spirit;</hi> because they are acceptable to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. -1. and profitable to the man himself, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6. as savoury and wholesom fruit, which the works of the flesh are not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21-. Next, he enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth nine of those fruits, not as if they were not moe, for there are many moe vertues than those, as knowledg, hope, patience, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 5, &amp;c.</hi> but, because those are vertues standing almost in direct opposition to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vices, and such as for the exercise thereof he wished chiefly among those Galatians; Which are, first, <hi>Love,</hi> or an holy affection whereby we love God for Himself, <hi>(Mat.</hi> 22. 37.) and our neighbour in, and for God, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 4. 21. Secondly, <hi>Joy,</hi> that holy affection of the soul, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting it self, and taking pleasure in those things, and in that measure which God alloweth.

Seventhly, <hi>Faith,</hi> whereby we conceive in this place is understood not so much justifying faith, and faith towards God, which is


<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44180:139"/>
the root and fountain of all those fruits, <hi>(ver. -6.)</hi> as faith and fidelity towards men, whereby from a renewed heart and for God's glory we speak nothing but truth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 25. and make conscience to perform whatsoever is undertaken by us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. -4. Eightly, <hi>Meeknesse,</hi> a vertue whereby we moderate anger, so as that we are not provoked but for just causes, and not more or longer provoked than the Word of God alloweth, whereby also we do speedily restrain and suppresse anger when it hath transgressed the just bounds, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 26. Ninthly, <hi>Temperance,</hi> or continency, whereby our fleshly appetite is kept within bounds, in seeking after honour, meat, drink, pleasure or riches. Lastly, The Apostle, having made this enumeration, that he may excite the Galatians to the practice of those vertues, he commendeth them from this, That the Law was not made against them or the practisers of them, either to condemn or accuse them. In which words, by a figure, or flowr of speech, more is to be understood than is spoken, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. -17. even that the Moral Law (concerning the standing whereof, as to its directing power, there was no controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Paul</hi> and his adversaries) doth expresly command and commend them, which could not be said of those ceremonial abstinences or performances, so much urged by the false Apostles. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is no way for gracious vertues, or the fruits of the Spirit to grow and thrive in our heart, unlesse the works of the flesh be set against, and in some measure mortified: these thistles and weeds must be plucked up, else they draw the sap and strength of the heart from the good grain: The Apostle's method pointeth at so much, while he enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them to mortifie the works of the flesh in the first place, and next commendeth unto them the fruits of the Spirit; <hi>But the fruit of the Spirit is Love, joy, peace, &amp;c.</hi> 2. It is not sufficient that we set about the work of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification and curbing of sin and vice, but must also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to have the heart replenished with the contrary gracious vertues; otherwise sin, being as it were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered,

may lurk for a season, but will afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and take strength, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 44, 45. for, the Apostle, having engaged them to mortifie the works of the flesh, doth now excite them to the exercise of gracious vertues; <hi>But the fruit of the Spirit is Love, joy, peace, &amp;c.</hi> 3. There is no vertue truly saving and acceptable to God, but that which floweth from the grace of regeneration. The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Heathen, how excellent soever they seemed to be, were but shadows of saving vertues, as not coming from a clean fountain, a gracious root in the heart, <hi>Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Besides, they were not done in faith, and so could not be acceptable to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. for, the Apostle calleth all those which are vertues indeed, the fruits and effects of the Spirit; <hi>But the fruit of the Spirit is Love, joy, peace,</hi> saith he. 4. If we compare the graces of God's Spirit with the works of the flesh, there will appear such a beauty in the one, such deformity in the other, such solid satisfaction and contentment in the one, and such disquietnesse and vexation of spirit in the other, that laying aside the difference which is betwixt them by reason of their original and event, those other considerations may serve abundantly to make us fall in love with the graces of God's Spirit, and abominate the works of the flesh: for, the works of the flesh, are <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, witchcraft, hatred, strife, envyings, murders; but the fruit of the Spirit, is Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, &amp;c.</hi> 5. We are to judge of persons and practices, by thinking well of them, or otherwise, not according to the common esteem in which they are among men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. but according to the esteem that God hath of them, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what the Word of God, which is the absolute rule of right and wrong, Truth and Error, doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce concerning them: for, <hi>Paul</hi> judgeth it sufficient to commend the practice of those vertues from this, that the Law of God did commend them, and approved of those who made conscience of them; <hi>Against such there is no Law,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle, in this Verse, addeth a new Argument to inforce the practice of that first Rule given, ver. 13. and cleared, ver. 19, 20, 21. to wit, that <hi>they should not give occasion to,</hi> or <hi>fulfill the lusts of the flesh;</hi> because those who are Christs, as they all professed themselves to be, have by vertue of Christ's death, crucified and put to death their fleshly corruption, with all its sinfull moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whether they be sinfull affections and passions, such as those, whereby the mans mind doth suffer, is troubled and afflicted, as malice, envie, anger, and the like; or whether they be sinful lusts, such as these which are stirred up by fleshly carnal baits and pleasures, as motions to intemperance, uncleannesse, and such like. Now those who are Christ's, are said to have crucified all those, because every one who professeth the Name of Christ, hath engaged himself by his profession and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant sealed in Baptism so to do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3, 4. and the truly Regenerate, besides this engagement by profession, have actually begun this work: so that though this body of corrupt flesh be in them; yet by His Spirit <hi>(Rom.</hi> 8. 13.) and by imitating His Crosse <hi>(Rom.</hi> 6. 6.) they are upon the work of mortifying it, suppressing the endeavours, and smothering the effects of it, <hi>Rom. 6. 12. Doct.</hi> 1. All they who are led by, and walk in the Spirit, or who are truly regenerate, and who are actually engaged in the work of mortifying their corrupt nature, are <hi>Christ's</hi> in a peculiar manner, to wit, by right of donation from the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. by right of emption or redemption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. and by right of resignation, all such having actually resigned themselves unto Christ, as a mansion for Him to dwell and walk in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. and in every thing to be guided by Him, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 6. for, the Apostle useth those expressions indifferently as being of equal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>Walk in the Spirit,</hi> ver. 16. and <hi>if ye be led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>


                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:44180:141"/>
ver. 18. and in this verse, <hi>they who are Christs, have crucified the flesh.</hi> 2. The work of mortification striketh at all sin, and spareth none, aswell pleasant sins, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fleshly lusts are satisfied, as other more vexatious evils, whereby the mind doth in a kind suffer, and is afflicted: for, speaking of this work, he saith, <hi>They that are Christs, have crucified the flesh,</hi> that is, the root of corruption, and then they have crucified all its branches, not only <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> or vexing passions, but also desirable <hi>lusts.</hi> 3. There is not any argument more moving or effectually exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto the work of mortification with a sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, than that which is taken from his engagement to it by profession, and the first beginnings thereof wrought in him already by the Spirit of God; for, this is the Apostles scope, that they would not walk in, or fulfill the lusts of the flesh, because all of them were engaged by profession to crucifie the flesh, and some had actually begun to do so already; <hi>They that are Christs, have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the flesh,</hi> saith he.</p>

first, and thereby to evidence, that as he doth not look on himself, as free from the yoke of duty no more than others; So he sincerely intendeth by his own practice to hold forth a real copie of that which he presseth upon others, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12. for, <hi>Paul</hi> directeth this exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himself as well as to them; <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit,</hi> saith he. 2. The Lord's method in bestowing grace upon gracelesse sinners, is first, to infuse the principles of a new life, or gracious habits and powers in the soul; and next, to actuate these powers, making them actually to do those works which are spiritually good: Spiritual motion and action presupposeth a principle of a spiritual life, as a thing previous unto, and different from it: for, saith he, <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</hi> 3. To walk in the Spirit, or to follow the conduct of God's Spirit, and of His gracious work in us, is a far other thing, than to cast by the rule of the Word, and to follow only whatever motions or impressions are set home with any forcible impulse upon our spirits, as if those were the motions of the Spirit of God, which may haply be motions of our own corrupt flesh, or suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Satan, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 11. This walking in the Spirit here exhorted unto, is walking orderly and by rule, even by the rule of God's Word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 20. for, so much doth the word in the Original import, which signifieth to <hi>walk orderly,</hi> by rule, by line, by measure, as Souldiers do march into the battel; <hi>Let us walk in the Spirit,</hi> saith he. 4. Though a man cannot passe sentence upon his state before God, whether it be good or bad, by some moe or fewer particular acts of his life, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 46. yet he may and ought to passe sentence upon it according to his way, and the ordinary strain of his life and conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A godlesse conversation argueth a carnal heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of all spiritual life, and a pious conversation doth argue a renewed heart, and a principle of spiritual life within: for, so much will the Apostle's reasoning bear, <hi>If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</hi>

In setting against any sin, we would look not only upon that sin alone, but also upon those other possibly lesse pleasant and baser sins, which of necessity do accompany it; that so our indignation may be heightned the more against it, as carrying with it a train of such attendants: for, here the Apostle, dehorting them from the desire of vain glory, that he may make them the more to detest it, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth forth the necessary dependance which two other vexations and base evils have upon it; <hi>Provoking one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, envying one another,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the first part of this Chapter, he presseth the exercise of mutual love, in two exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. And, first, he exhorteth them to endeavour the reclaiming of those who were fallen, ver. 1. and to bear patiently with the sinfull infirmities one of another; because, first, hereby they should obey the Command enjoyning mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual love, ver. 2. Secondly, self-conceit, which marreth the exercise of this duty, is but a self-deceiving, ver. 3. And therefore he prescribeth a remedy against that evil, to wit, self-searching; And inforceth it, because, first, they should attain to such gloriation as God alloweth of, ver. 4. And secondly, every man must give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of his own actions to God, ver. 5. In the second place, he exhorteth unto beneficence in the general, and especially towards their Ministers, ver. 6. And, having held forth God for a party unto those who neglect this duty, he doth presse it from the similitude of sowing and reaping, ver. 7. which he enlargeth, and applyeth to an harvest of death and corruption to be reaped by those who do evil, and of life eternal by those who do well, ver. 8. whence he inforceth perseverance in the study of beneficence, promising the expected fruit of their so doing in due time, ver. 9. and so concludeth the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, pressing upon them the use-making of the present opportunity, ver. 10.</p>
               <p>In the second part, he concludeth the Epistle; first, insinuating how much he loved them, ver. 11. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, insinuating that the false Apostles were not acted from love to them, but from hypocrisie, worldly policy, ver. 12. and from vain glory, ver. 13. Thirdly, he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth his own truly Christian carriage to those sins of the false Apostles, shewing he gloried only in the crosse of Christ, and that the world, and applause from men were undervalued by him, ver. 14. Of both which he


<pb n="271" facs="tcp:44180:143"/>
giveth two reasons, first, nothing worldly is accompted of by Christ, but the new creature only, ver. 15. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, glorying in Christ, and in the study of piety, and of the new creature, is the only rule, in walking according to which, there is peace, ver. 16. Fourthly, The Apostle (having discharged any to trouble him further, whether by their errors, or calumnies, seing the standing prints of his sufferings did abundantly refute both, ver. 17) saluteth them with his ordinary farewell-wish, ver. 18.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle, having (chap. 5. ver. 26.) dehorted from some vices which do wholly impede that service by love, which is enjoyned, chap. 5. 13. he doth in the first part of this Chapter, exhort them to several duties, in which the exercise of mutual love doth consist. And first, he speaketh to those who are <hi>spiritual,</hi> that is, such as had received a large measure of spiritual graces, whereby they were preserved from the subtil snares of sin and Satan, which had intrapped others; and who are called <hi>strong, Rom.</hi> 15. 1. and <hi>perfect,</hi> to wit, comparatively, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 15. Those he exhorteth to endeavour the reclaiming and restoring (both to the sense of God's pardoning grace, and to amendment of life) of all such who were <hi>overtaken,</hi> and as it were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consideratly and suddenly surprized with any sin (for, the active Verb of the word <hi>overtaken,</hi> in the Original, signifieth to do a thing preposterously and in hast, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 21.) And in order hereto, that in the use of all means undertaken for this end, whether of admonition, reproof, or necessary correction, they would exercise the grace of spiritual meeknesse, suppressing all fleshly passions, and revengefull affections. Which exhortation he inforceth by two arguments: the first whereof is laid down by


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:44180:144"/>
way of admonition in this Verse, that every man, even the best, while he dealeth with the faults of others, would enter in a deep consideration of his own frailty, and how easily under a tentation he may be surprized with the same, the like, or a greater sin. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though it be very ordinary for men to bear too much with sin both in themselves and others, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. -13. Yet there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sinfull extremity to be avoided, to wit, when under pretence of hatred to, or just indignation against the sins of others, we give them over as incorrigible, and cannot admonish, reprove, or in any thing carry our selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them in the spirit of meeknesse: for, saith the Apostle, <hi>If aman,</hi> or, as the word may also read by way of obviating an objection, <hi>Though a man be overtaken in a fault, restore such an one, &amp;c.</hi> which supposeth that some were apt to think themselves freed from the duty here commanded towards a person so overtaken; and the Apostle sheweth, that neverthelesse they were bound to restore him, and deal meekly with him, even though he were overtaken in a fault. 2. This sin of too much rigor and severity towards the sinful failings and escapes of others (though it pretend to zeal, <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 5. yet) hath its rise from pride and ambition; while the rigid critick, and lofty censurer of another mans faults doth not so much seek after his brother's amendment, as to beget in the minds of others a good opinion of himself, as if he were singular for holiness and hatred of sin above others: for, the connexion of the two Chapters doth shew that this sin here guarded against, hath some kind of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon vain-glory; <hi>Let us not be desirous of vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> chap. 5. 26. And, <hi>if a man be overtaken in a fault, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store him in the spirit of meeknesse.</hi> 3. The Minister of Jesus Christ would labour so to digest his exhortations unto duties, that his very expressions and convey of them being fitted to the purpose in hand, may be as so many forcible motives to bear-in that duty unto which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth: for, the Apostle, being here to inforce the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of love and meeknesse upon those Galatians in the


<pb n="273" facs="tcp:44180:144"/>
recovery of those who had fallen, calleth them <hi>Brethren,</hi> thereby expressing his love to them, and minding them of that love they ought to carry one to another, as being Brethren; and designeth the person to be restored by the common name of a <hi>man,</hi> thereby pointing at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon frailty of mankind, to shew his falling in sin is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be pitied, than made a wonder of; and withall transferreth the guilt of the sin in a great measure from the person himself to the subtilty of Satan and violence of the tentation by which he was surprized and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken; every one whereof doth doth serve as a motive unto that pity and meeknesse unto which he exhorteth; <hi>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault,</hi> saith he. 4. Though those who are so maliciously obstinate in sin, that lenity and meeknesse prevaileth nothing in order to their reclaiming, are to be used with more severity and rigor, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 21. Yet others, concerning whom we have not ground in charity so to judge, but rather that they are surprized by the violence of some prevalent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ought to be more gently dealt with: for, they are only such, whom the Apostle will have to be used with a spirit of meeknesse; <hi>If a man be overtaken in a fault, restore such an one, &amp;c.</hi> 5. So subtil and assiduous is Satan in tempting, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. So ready is corruption in us to close with a tentation so soon as it is presented, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. that if the childe of God be not all the more circumspect and diligent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 41. he cannot choose but be surprized, as it were unawares, by some one sin or other, and be thereby made to dishonour God, and to lay a stumbling-block before others: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth it as a thing incident unto all men to be thus sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized, while he saith, <hi>If a man be overtaken in a fault.</hi> 6. Though it be the duty of all men to endeavour the reclaiming of those who are lying under un-repented guiltinesse, (for the Command is given unto all, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17.) yet, the more holy men are, and the further they have advanced in the wayes of piety, they are the more obliged to go about this duty, chiefly, because they are


<pb n="274" facs="tcp:44180:145"/>
in a better capacity to discharge it; as being lesse tainted with sin than others, and so having more freedom to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove; as also being more knowing how to go wisely about that difficile duty, and more willing to perform it than others, whose knowledge and love to God's glory and their neighbours good, cometh short of theirs: for, the Apostle directeth this exhortation mainly to such as had received a greater measure of grace than others; <hi>Ye which are spiritual, restore such an one.</hi> 7. The greater store of graces and gifts a man hath received, he standeth the more obliged to lay out himself and all his receipts for the spiritual good and edification of others; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding alwayes he move in his own sphere, and transgress not the bounds of his calling, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4. for, <hi>Paul</hi> layeth this task of restoring the backsliden Christian chiefly upon those who had received a greater measure of grace and spiritual enduements than others; <hi>Ye which are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, restore such an one.</hi> 8. As scandalous sins, and erroneous opinions being fallen into by a childe of God, do mar that orderly frame of the inward man, which he did before enjoy, wasting the conscience and eating out the edge of all his former tendernesse, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. -11. So the person who hath fallen in such sins, doth ordinarily prove backward to be reclaimed, and very ticklish to be medled with by others for that end; as a man who hath a bone dis-joynted can hardly endure to have it touched: The word rendred <hi>restore such an one,</hi> doth bear so much, as signifying to set in joynt the dislocated members of the body, So that sin putteth the soul as it were out of joynt. 9. As it is the duty of all, and especially of those who are spiritual, to endeavour the reclaiming of any who are so fallen, by admonition <hi>(Mat.</hi> 18. 15.) reproof <hi>(Lev.</hi> 19. 17.) prayer to God on their behalf, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 14, 15. (all which, and other means in order to the same end, are to be gone about by private Christians by vertue of that ty which christian charity, and their mutual relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one to another, arising from their being members of one body, do lay on; and by publick Ministers and


<pb n="275" facs="tcp:44180:145"/>
Church-guides, by vertue of that authority wherewith Christ the King of the Church hath invested them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12.) So in the use of all these means, every one is to carry himself with much skill and tendernesse, if he would attain the proposed end: for, saith he, <hi>Ye who are spiritual, restore such an one,</hi> or, set him in joynt again; It is a phrase borrowed from Chirurgians, who, being to deal with a dis-joynted bone, will handle the same with skill and tendernesse. 10. The grace of meeknesse, whereby we moderate inordinate anger, and speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse revengeful passions, before they come to any great height, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, 26. as it is the work of Gods Spirit in us; so the exercise of it is most necessary towards those who are fallen, and that all the means we use in order to their reclaiming be seasoned therewith, as being in nothing transported with the fury of rage and passion, but only acted with zeal to God, love to the person fallen, and with sanctified reason; for, thereby we evidence we are seeking the recovery of our brother, and not insulting over him; we are labouring to help him, and not seeking to disgrace him: for, saith he, <hi>Restore such an one in the spirit of meeknesse,</hi> or, in meeknesse, whereof God's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is the author. 11. There is no man, no not the most spiritual, who can promise unto himself immunity from being set upon with strong tentations unto grosse and scandalous evils, or that he shall stand when he is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, if he be left of God under the tentation: for, he biddeth even the spiritual man consider himself, <hi>lest he also be tempted;</hi> whereby he holdeth forth not only a possibility that the spiritual man may be tempted, but also of his yeelding to the tentation, when it should be presented, otherwise the argument had not been of such strength to inforce upon him the exercise of meeknesse towards those who are overtaken in a fault. 12. As those who do most rigidly and uncharitably censure the faults of others, are usually greatest strangers to their own hearts, and very little sensible of their own infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: So the serious consideration of our own weaknesse,


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:44180:146"/>
and how the root of our neighbours sin, and of all other sin is in us <hi>(Rom.</hi> 3. v. 10, to 20.) how we stand by grace <hi>(Psal.</hi> 94. 18.) and how, if God would suffer the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter to break loose upon us, we should so much exceed the sins of others, as they exceed ours: The serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, I say, of all those, though it should not bind us wholly up from reproving sin in others; yet, it should cause us exceedingly to mix and temper our severity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their sin with the exercise of meeknesse, pity and compassion towards their person: for, the Apostle, to inforce the former exhortation of restoring their fallen brother in the spirit of meeknesse, doth enjoyn, <hi>consider thy self, lest thou also be tempted.</hi> 13. So prone are we to entertain good thoughts of our selves, that it is a matter of no small difficulty to make a man reflect upon himself, and enter upon a serious consideration of his own frailty and weaknesse, and of every other thing which may keep him low in his own eyes, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting over, or despising of others, as appeareth from <hi>Paul</hi>'s changing of the number: for, having said, <hi>Ye who are spiritual, restore, &amp;c.</hi> in the plural number; here he saith, <hi>considering thy self, lest thou also, &amp;c.</hi> in the singular; which he doth to give the greater force and sharper edge to his admonition, as knowing he was pressing a duty, which very hardly, and not without difficulty, would be obeyed.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle, first, enlargeth the former exhortation, both as to the persons exhorted (for now he exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not only those who are spiritual, but all of them) And also as to the duty exhorted unto, which is extended not only to an endeavour of reclaiming those who were overtaken in a fault, but also, to the tolerating and bearing patiently with the sins and infirmities of others, untill they be amended, and the sinner reclaimed: which


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:44180:146"/>
sins are designed by the name of a <hi>burden;</hi> partly, because some such sins are a burden and weight to the sinner himself, either by reason of his grief and sorrow for them, if he be a penitent, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. or by reason of that vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and trouble which some sins, as wrath, malice and envie, do bring to the natural spirits even of the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sinner, <hi>Job 5. 2. Prov.</hi> 14. 30. And partly, because some such sins, though not felt by the sinner himself, are yet heavy burdens unto those who converse with him, as his curiosity, back-biting, self-seeking, and such like, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 28. Secondly, he inforceth the exhortation, thus enlarged, by a second argument, to wit, That here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they did fulfill the Law, or command of mutual love, which he calleth the <hi>Law of Christ;</hi> not as if love to our neighbour had not been enjoyned before Christ came in the flesh; for, it is a prime piece of the Law of Nature, imprinted upon the heart of man at the Creation, and was renewed again by God Himself upon mount <hi>Sinai, 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 7. But because, first, Christ did renew this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, not only by freeing it from the false glosses and interpretations of Scribes and Pharisees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 23, &amp;c. but also by pressing it in its spiritual beauty and nature, having laid aside and abolished the external cover of Mosaical Ceremonies <hi>(Eph.</hi> 2. 15.) under which it was vailed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 9, 10. In which respect mainly it is here called the <hi>Law of Christ,</hi> in opposition to the false Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, who pressed so much the Mosaical Law of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. And, secondly, because Christ did presse this Law, so renewed, in a singular manner upon His fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, as a mark of true faith in Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 35. And thirdly, because Christ did fulfill this Law in His own person, and thereby left an example of it unto us, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 16. Doct.</hi> 1. As there are none free of sinful infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are burdensom sometimes to themselves, and frequently unto others: So we ought not to break the bond of common society, which we are otherwayes tyed unto, because of those: but are to persist in it, patiently bearing those infirmities which we cannot otherwayes


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:44180:147"/>
help: for, saith he, <hi>Bear ye one anothers burdens.</hi> 2. This duty of bearing with the infirmities of others, doth well consist with the use of such lawfull means as God hath prescribed, whether to the Magistrate for restraining sin, by punishing those who do evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. -4. or, to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and private Christians, in order to the sinner's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming by admonition, reproof, and such like: for, this duty of <hi>bearing one anothers burdens,</hi> must agree with, and cannot be contrary unto, that other duty prescribed, v. 1. which is to restore the sinner unto that state where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was, so far must we be from giving him counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or partaking with him in his sins. 3. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate frame of spirit, made evident by our meek and patient deportment towards those who are overtaken in a fault, without neglecting any duty we owe unto them, doth afford the guilty sinner no small ease under his weighty exercise, and tendeth much both to his preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from fainting under heartlesse discouragement (if his conscience be touched with the sense of his guilt) and to carry on the work of his conviction and amendment: (if he be yet going on securely in his sin) for, the Apostle, having exhorted to such a meek and patient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment towards those who are overtaken in a fault, he calleth it here a bearing of their burden, or an affording of help to them under it; <hi>Bear ye one anothers burdens.</hi> 4. There is no such evidence of love to our neighbour, as when it kytheth in our serious endeavours for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about his spiritual good, and in taking the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual condescending and affectionate way in order to his reclaiming from sin, together with our supporting of him, and sympathizing with him under his spirituall weights: for, the Apostle calleth this a fulfilling of the Law of Christ, or of mutual love, as if that Law did call for this only; <hi>And so fulfill the Law of Christ,</hi> saith he. 5. In what sense and measure the childe of God doth attain to evidence his love to his fallen brother by his serious endeavours to restore him unto the enjoyment of God's favour, and to an holy and blamelesse conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,


<pb n="279" facs="tcp:44180:147"/>
and by his bearing with him under his infirmities, in order to his recovery, in that same sense and measure he attaineth to fulfill the Law; whence it followeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is not able to do the former perfectly, and so as to come short in nothing for matter, or manner, <hi>(Iam.</hi> 3. 2.) but only sincerely, and without dissimulation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 9. therefore neither can he keep the Law perfectly, but only in sincerity, and in his honest aim and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 6. for, saith he, <hi>Bear ye one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and so fulfill the Law of Christ.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, in further prosecution of the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, doth fall upon the sin of self-conceit and arrogancy, which causeth men contemn others, and carry themselves with a kind of supercilious disdain towards such as are overtaken in a fault, contrary to what he had exhorted them unto, ver. 1, 2. And, first, he tacitly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them from this vice, by shewing the man who is puffed up with a conceit of his own enduements above others, and to the despising of others being compared with himself, doth deceive himself, and maketh his own mind to erre in passing judgment of himself (as the word doth signifie) and giveth a reason of this assertion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every man, even the best is nothing, as having no good in himself, and of himself, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. for which he ought to be puffed up, and to despise others because of their infirmities. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Then are duties pressed unto some good purpose by the Lord's Ministers upon His People, when a discovery is made of those lurking evils which do withhold from the practice of those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and pains are taken to set them upon the task of subduing such evils, if they would come speed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencious practice of the commanded duty: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having exhorted to restore those who are fallen, and to bear one anothers burden, he doth now disswade them


<pb n="280" facs="tcp:44180:148"/>
from the sin of self-conceit and arrogancy, as that which doth impede the practice of that duty; <hi>If a man think himself to be something,</hi> saith he. 2. As it is ordinary for men to conceit too highly of themselves, whether by apprehending those excellencies to be in themselves, which really are not, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 16. or, by overvaluing those excellencies, parts and other enjoyments, which they really have, above their just worth and esteem, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 3. or, by looking on them, not as receipts from the Lord, but only as they are their own, or the fruit of their own industry or purchase, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28. 4, 5. So, where this sin of self-conceit is fostered, it maketh the guilty person an insolent contemner of all others, a proud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulter over their infirmities; as taking occasion from those, to conceive so much the more highly of himself: for, this is the sin of a man's thinking himself to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which <hi>Paul</hi> supposeth to be a common evil, and speaketh against it, as that which maketh a man carry himself insolently towards others, especially those who are overtaken in a fault, as appeareth from the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>If a man think himself to be something.</hi> 3. Error in judgment hath sometimes its rise from some unmortified and raging lust in the heart and affections, the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency whereof doth byass the understanding, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse of time doth unperceivably incline it to assent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those opinions as Truths which may most gratifie those unmortified lusts: for, saith he, <hi>He who thinketh himself something, deceiveth himself,</hi> or, maketh his mind to erre; for so the word signifieth: importing hereby that those violent lusts of self-conceit, pride and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, did make them apprehend some real worth to be where there was none, whereby they might have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to feed upon. 4. For a man to be deceived by himself, is of more dangerous consequence than to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by any other, especially when a man deceiveth himself by having better thoughts of himself than there is ground or reason for; for hereby are men not only vainly puffed up by their fleshly mind, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. -18. but

also made to cry Peace, peace, when sudden destruction cometh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 22, 23. for, the Apostle insinuateth there is no small hazard in self-deceiving, while he maketh this alone a sufficient argument to disswade from self-conceit and arrogancy, even that he <hi>who thinketh himself to be something, deceiveth himself.</hi> 5. As every man considered in himself is nothing, being destitute of all good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18- yea, though he be considered in all his enduements both of Nature and Grace; yet he hath nothing for which he ought to conceit of himself, and despise others; for, what hath he which is not received? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. yea, and what he must be comptable for, how he doth imploy it? <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 48. So the serious conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this truth would be a singular engine to batter down those high mountains of self-conceit, which are ready to exalt themselves in a man's heart by reason of his apprehended or real excellencies, gifts or graces: for, <hi>Paul</hi> maketh use of this consideration to convince them how vain any high thoughts of that kind were; <hi>If any man seem to himself to be something, when he is nothing,</hi> saith he; which last sentence is spoken of all men generally, and serveth for an argument to prove that the self-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer, is a self-deceiver, seing every man is nothing.</p>

                  <p>SEcondly, The Apostle striketh at one root and cause of self-conceit and arrogancy, to wit, our comparing our selves with others who are worse than our selves (for, we may, and ought compare with those who are better than our selves, that so we may be humbled, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12. but this comparing with those whom we esteem worse than our selves, occasioneth self-conceit, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11.) Now <hi>Paul</hi> taketh them off this way, exhorting them to <hi>prove,</hi> and try their own work and carriage by the rule of Gods Word, without comparing it with the carriage of others (for, so they behoved to try the work of others also) and


<pb n="282" facs="tcp:44180:149"/>
that they would so prove their own work, as to approve it, and find matter of approbation in it, if it were to be found, (for, the Greek word rendred <hi>prove,</hi> signifieth also to approve, as <hi>Rom. 14. 22. 1 Cor.</hi> 16. 3.) Which exhortation is inforced by two reasons; first, Hereby they should find matter of such gloriation and boasting as God alloweth of, even in themselves alone, that is, in the testimony of a good conscience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. and should not need to borrow matter of boasting from the sins of others, which the Lord doth no wayes approve of, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 2-. Doct.</hi> 1. As a man who would set against a sin to purpose, and with successe, must search out, and set against every other sin which doth ordinarily prove an occasion of that sin which he intendeth to subdue and mortifie; So the Minister of Christ, in the reproof of sin, ought to point forth unto the Lord's People those things which are the fewel and occasion of such and such sins, and press upon them an abstinence even from those: for, the Apostle, having disswaded (ver. 3.) from self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit, doth here point at the occasion of that sin, even their comparing themselves with others, whom they judged worse than themselves, and disswadeth them from that also, while he saith, <hi>But let every man prove his own work.</hi> 2. As it is the duty of every man without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to reflect upon his own actions, and to take an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act trial of them by the touchstone of Gods Word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 9. not only if for the substance of the action they be commanded or warranted in His Word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. -13. but also if they be done in the right manner, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 18. that is, if they come from the root of a renewed heart, <hi>(Mat.</hi> 7. 18.) have their rise from right motives <hi>(Phil.</hi> 1. 15.) and be directed to the right end, God's glory in the first place (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 3.) or not: So he ought not to rest satisfied with a simple probation and trial of his actions, except he find them to be such after trial, as he may up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on just grounds approve them, and approve himself to God in them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. for, saith he, <hi>Let every one prove,</hi> and so, as he may safely approve, <hi>his own work,</hi> as


<pb n="283" facs="tcp:44180:149"/>
the word signifieth; and such a probation must be here meaned, otherwise the Apostle's consequence should not follow upon a mans proving his work, even that he shall have rejoycing in himself. 3. Though Civil Magistrates and Church-guides are to prove, even judicially, the work of others, who are committed to their charge, <hi>Rom. 13. -3,-4. Tit.</hi> 3. 10. and though private Christians are also bound to prove all things by a judgement of christian discretion, that so they may hold what is good, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 21. and be provoked unto love and good works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 23. but not, that they have whereat to carp, <hi>Psal.</hi> 56. 5, 6. or whereby to be lifted up with an high and vain conceit of themselves above others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. yet the great thing whereabout our most accurate and daily search and trial should be imployed, is, our own actions, and by proportion our own spiritual state, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. and frame of heart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 26. 2. Yea, those, and only those are to be the object of our trial, when the end proposed in our trial, is, to find out matter of boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the testimony of a good conscience, and from which we may conclude, that we are approved of God: for, this is the end of the trial here enjoyned; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith he, <hi>Let every man prove his own work.</hi> 4. This work of self-trying, and proving of our own work, being seriously and frequently gone about, would tend excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly not only to curb those lofty thoughts which we have of our selves, but also to divert from those uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, censorious and base thoughts which we have of others because of their infirmities and failings: for, the Apostle opposeth this duty as an antidote to that sin of self-conceit before reproved, and by consequence doth presse it as an help to that duty of tendernesse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion towards those who are overtaken in a fault, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, ver. 1, 2. <hi>But,</hi> saith he, <hi>let every man try his own work.</hi> 5. It is in some cases and respects lawful for men to glory and boast in themselves, or in the good things of God bestowed upon them, that is, not only to rejoyce because of them, but also to expresse their joy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.


<pb n="284" facs="tcp:44180:150"/>
and to expect approbation and applause from men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. providing they glory in them, as evidences of God's love to them, and so, as they may thereby assure their hearts before Him of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in His favour and good-will, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19. and as enduements fitting them to serve God, by promoting His glory in their own salvation, and their neighbours good, and in every other duty which they are bound to in their station, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. -10- and as they are fitting oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to incite themselves or others, to give that glory to God which is due, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 16. providing also that they glory in them (to wit, in so far as this gloriation importeth a seeking approbation to themselves) but spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. -16. and for the most part as of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and to maintain their uprightnesse before men, when it is unjustly called in question, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 11. Joh</hi> 27. 4, &amp;c. and that they be not puffed up with conceit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as if those good things did proceed from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves alone, and not from God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. and that the approbation which they expect, be not endeavoured as their furthest design, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 2. but as a mean of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them the more capable for promoting God's glory in their place and station, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 7. and most especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, providing that they glory not in those things, as if thereby they could merit the favour of God and eternal life; which boasting is condemned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2. In these respects, and with these limitations it is lawfull for men to glory in themselves: for, the Apostle speaketh of this way of glorying as an allowed consequence of a man's proving of his own work; <hi>Then,</hi> saith he, <hi>he shall have rejoycing</hi> (or boasting) <hi>in himself alone.</hi> 6. That a man may warrantably and upon good grounds thus rejoyce in the good things of God bestowed upon him, especially so, as thereby to assure his heart before God, it is not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that he compare himself with others, and find himself to be better than those, but he must try himself by the rule of God's Word, and after trial find himself approved by it; else his boasting is nought and vain,


<pb n="285" facs="tcp:44180:150"/>
even a deceiving of himself: for, the Apostle, speaking of this warrantable gloriation and boasting, affirmeth it to be the consequence of a man's <hi>proving his own work,</hi> and that it must be <hi>in himself,</hi> and <hi>not in another.</hi>

                  <p>HEre is a second argument, inforcing upon every man the duty of trying his own work rather than to be narrowly prying into the infirmities of others; because every man must bear his own burden, or give an account of his own actions to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 12. for, the Lord will passe sentence upon men whether by absolving or condemning them, not as they have been better or worse than others, but as they shall be found in themselves ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely considered, and without any respect had unto others, See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. -8. which doth not militate against the tenour of the Gospel, affirming that Believers shall be reckoned with by God, as they are clothed, not with their own righteousnesse, but with the unspotted righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Christ their Cautioner, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 9. for, it is evident from the scope, that the Apostle excludeth only the infirmities of other sinfull men, like unto our selves, from being the rule, according to which God will passe sentence, and not the righteousnesse of Christ appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by faith. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That a man may prove an happy interpreter of Scripture, and find out the mind of God's Spirit therein, it is necessary he do well understand the scope of the Spirit in that place, the sense whereof he intendeth to find out; the observing whereof will serve as a threed to conduct him in falling upon the genuine and literal meaning of the particular words &amp; sentences, and wil preserve him from making the Scripture in hand thwart or contradict any other part of sacred Truth, which without observing of the scope he may readily fall in: for, this verse seemeth at the first view, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict that direction given, ver. 2. but the sense of both being collected from the scope, that seeming contrariety


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:44180:151"/>
will evanish; for, by <hi>bearing one anothers burdens,</hi> ver. 2. must be meaned a bearing by way of sympathy, christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an for bearance, and diligent use of means for reclaiming the person fallen; for, that is it which the Apostle is pressing there, as appeareth from ver. 1. and in this sense every one ought to bear one anothers burdens: But by <hi>bearing our burden,</hi> in this verse, is meaned a bearing by giving an account to God for our own actions (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it should not be a cogent argument to inforce the exhortation propounded, ver. 4. <hi>Let every man prove his own work)</hi> and in this sense <hi>every man shall bear his own burden.</hi> 2. How light soever that mens sins do seem unto themselves when they are committed, yet they will be found not light, but heavy, when they come to reckon with God about them: for, the giving an account of our actions to God, goeth under the name of bearing a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>Every man shall bear his own burden.</hi> 3. So righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is God that He will call no man to an account for the sins of others, but only for his own, except he hath made those sins of others his own sins also, by not doing his duty to impede the committing of them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 18. or by following of, and walking in them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 5. compared with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 14, 17. or by not mourning to God for them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. for, saith he, <hi>Every man shall bear his own burden.</hi> 4. It were our wisdom fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to minde that great Accompt which we must give to God, and to busie our selves most in and about those things whereof He will crave an account of us: hence the Apostle maketh this a reason why men should be most imployed in proving their own work, and not in accurate prying into the carriage and infirmities of others; because it was their own work, whereof they behoved to give an account to God; <hi>For every man shall bear his own burden,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>IN the second place, the Apostle exhorteth them unto beneficence, which may be looked upon as another piece of that serving one another through love, enjoyned chap. 5. -13. and because love to the Word growing cold among those Galatians, by reason of their schism and the prevalency of error, it is probable that the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect which they did owe to their Ministers, was much decayed, except to such only as were of their own faction and way, Therefore, in the first place, he exhorteth unto beneficence towards their Ministers, directing his speech to those who were catechised, that is, taught familiarly by word of mouth, as when children are taught the first principles of Religion; for, so the word, rendred <hi>is taught,</hi> doth signifie: or, more generally (as the word is here rendred, and taken elsewhere, 1 <hi>Cor. 14. 19.

The Lord Christ hath appointed two distinct ranks and sorts of people to be in His visible Church, some who are to be taught, fed, ruled and watched over, such are all private Church-members; and some who are to be Teachers, Pastors, Guides and Watchmen over the Flock by vertue of their publick Office in the House of God, the honour whereof is not to be taken by any man unto himself, except he be called as <hi>Aaron, Heb.</hi> 5. 4. And <hi>are all Teachers,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 29. <hi>Let him that is taught, communicate unto him that teacheth.</hi> 2. As it was necessary that some should be Teachers in


<pb n="288" facs="tcp:44180:152"/>
the House of God; so the wisdom of God hath thought it fit, because of our weaknesse <hi>(Deut. 5. 23, &amp;c.)</hi> to teach us not by His own immediate Voice from Heaven, nor yet by glorious Angels, but by the Ministry of men like unto our selves, and those not usually of the greatest sort, but of such as stand in need of the peoples benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence for their worldly subsistance, and this that the glory of converting souls may be ascribed not unto creatures, but unto God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. for, so much is imported, while he saith, <hi>Let him that is taught, communicate unto him that teacheth.</hi> 3. As it is the duty of Christ's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to teach and instruct the Lord's People, not so much by their writings, as by vocal preaching and word of mouth; So the thing wherein they are to be instructed, is the knowledge not of humane writings, but of the Word of God contained in Scripture; there being no word or writing besides, which hath a promise of such a blessing to accompany it, as this Word hath (See <hi>Rom. 1. 17. 2 Tim. 3. 15, 17. Heb.</hi> 4. 12.) for, saith he, <hi>Let him that is taught</hi> (or instructed by word of mouth) <hi>in the Word,</hi> meaning the written Word of God. 4. Seing Christ's Ministers are to bestow themselves wholly in the work of the Ministry, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15. and not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with the affairs of this life, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. and seing they are the Lord's Instruments, by whom He conveyeth the richest blessings, even those which are spiritual, unto His People, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 11. Therefore the People of God among whom they spend their strength, are bound even by common equity to give them worldly maintenance, that they may neither be diverted from, nor discouraged in that most necessary and painfull work of watching over souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. for, saith he, <hi>Let him that is taught, communicate unto him that teacheth, in all good things.</hi> 5. This worldly maintenance, which people are bound to give unto their Ministers, though it should be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and such as may not through its abundance occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion pride, luxury and prodigality in their Ministers; yet it would be liberal, and creditable, even such as may

not only supply their pinching necessities, but also as thereby they may be sustained in a way creditable unto the Gospel whereof they are Ministers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. and may have wherewith to supply the necessities of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. -2. and to educate their children so, as afterwards they may sustain themselves, and be profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able members both of Church and Commonwealth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. for, he commandeth the people <hi>to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to their Ministers in all their temporal good things;</hi> he saith, <hi>in all,</hi> and therefore liberally, though not lavishly. 6. Though the Civil Magistrate be obliged to provide some set and publick allowance for upholding the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel and Ministry thereof; this way coming nearer to the order appointed by God for maintaining the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood under the Law, <hi>Numb. 35. 1, &amp;c.</hi> and being free of several inconveniences, which can hardly be avoided in the way of giving voluntary contribution by every one who heareth the Gospel, towards those who preach the same: yet, in case the Magistrate provide not such publick allowance for them, or, if turning persecuter, he take that which is already provided by the Law for that use from them, Then it is the duty of every one who is taught in the Word, to maintain their Preachers by libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral contribution out of their own means, so far as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for him that receiveth, and as he is able to spare who giveth: for, this was the case of the Church in <hi>Paul's</hi> time, being under persecuting Tyrants; And therefore he commandeth, <hi>Let him that is taught, communicate unto him that teacheth, in all good things.</hi> 7. The Churches maintenance is only due unto such Ministers as have abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to preach the Gospel, and are faithfull and diligent Labourers in the Word, according to those abilities wherewith they are endued; And therefore, though pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men are not hereby warranted to withdraw the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and allowed maintenance from their Ministers upon pretence that they are either not able, or not pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 2, 3. yet it concerneth those whom Christ hath intrusted to be Overseers of His House, to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

that such who are either really unfit, or unwilling to preach, be removed from their Charge, and not suffered to eat up the Churches maintenance, feeding themselves, and starving the souls of people committed to their charge: Therefore the Apostle, while he pleadeth for maintenance to a Minister, doth describe him from the actual exercise of his Calling, <hi>Let him communicate to him that teacheth.</hi>

the following 8. verse) so they might expect an answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reward, or punishment from the Lord, to wit, either here, or hereafter; for, thus is the same similitude ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, 2 <hi>Cor. 9. 6, 7, 8.

Neglecters of duty, and chiefly of expensive duties, such as is that of giving competent maintenance to the Ministry, are very quick and witty to find out pretexts and excuses to colour their sin, and so to siele the eyes of those whom they have to do with; and this all, that they may enjoy the profit of sin, and yet eschew the shame and imputation of it before men: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth here meet with such witty excuses, and with those who made use of them; <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked.</hi> 3.

The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which God hath freely promised unto the good works of His People, and more particularly unto their chearfull, liberal and christian beneficence, is not to be despaired of: nor yet the justly deserved judgment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against the wicked for their evil works, and chiefly for their nigardly withholding a part of what God hath given unto them from charitable and pious uses, is to be doubted of, though both of them be long deferred: for, both the promised reward and threatned judgment, are compared to the reaping of the harvest, which doth most certainly, though not immediately, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon the sowing of the seed; <hi>Whatsoever a man sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that shall be also reap.</hi> 8. As the faith of a reward to be freely given, according to the promise, unto our


<pb n="293" facs="tcp:44180:154"/>
works of charity and beneficence, is a strong encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to fruitfulnesse in works of that kind; So it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for Christians to have an eye to this reward, as a motive whereby to work up their backward hearts unto a willing complyance with expensive duties of that sort: providing, first, it be not looked at as a thing to be merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their good works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Nor, secondly, as the only or chief motive, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. for, the Apostle by this similitude doth minde them of the promised re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as an argument exciting them unto beneficence; <hi>Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall be also reap.</hi>

                  <p>VVHat the Apostle spoke generally concerning that proportion which shall be betwixt a man's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reward, and his present work, he doth now, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the same metaphor of sowing and reaping, make it more clear by distinguishing several sorts of sowers, seeds, grounds, and several sorts of harvests answerable to each of those: The plain meaning whereof, is, 1. That carnal and unregenerate men, who take no other care but to spend their wit, strength, time, and particularly their means upon the service of their own fleshly lusts, (such as are reckoned forth, chap. 5. 19, 20.) they shall at last reap no fruit thereby but <hi>corruption,</hi> that is, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal perdition (for, <hi>corruption</hi> is here opposed unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life) and this they shall reap from the flesh, that is, their own inbred corruption, which, with the sinfull effects thereof, is the true seed of death and perdition. And, secondly, that renewed and spirituall men, who imploy their whole life, study and labour, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly their worldly substance for advancing the works of the Spirit, whether in themselves or others, (such as are reckoned forth, chap. 5. 22.) and particularly, for upholding the Gospel and a painful Ministry, they shall


<pb n="294" facs="tcp:44180:155"/>
receive the reward of eternal life; and this from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that is, the grace of God in them, which is the true seed of eternity, not by way of merit, as destruction and corruption follow upon the flesh, but from God's mercy and free gift, as the Apostle doth in plain and proper terms put the difference, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. according to which this metaphorick allegory must be expounded, and may not be set in opposition to it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The whole world are comprized in one of two ranks: they are either sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the flesh, living in their unregenerate state, and in slavery to their lusts, whose end shall be perdition; or, they are sowing to the Spirit, truly regenerate, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying themselves for the advancing of things spiritual, whose end shall be eternal life; There is no neutral or midstate: for, <hi>Paul</hi> distinguisheth all in these two, <hi>He that soweth to his flesh,</hi> and <hi>he that soweth to the Spirit.</hi> 2. It may be frequently observed, that they who have not an heart to part with any thing of their temporall goods for God and pious uses, but plead present poverty, necessity and fear of future want, when God doth call them to any thing of that kind, are notwithstanding most profuse and lavish in spending their means to make provision for the flesh, and to uphold the beastly lusts thereof; for, he <hi>that soweth not to the Spirit, soweth to his flesh.</hi> 3. Though carnal men do think their own way the only wisest, while they spend their wit and substance for attaining present profit, pleasure and preferment, and do judge the way of the Godly, but meer folly, while they imploy their strength and means for things spiritual, and such as God's honour is mainly concerned in, and are not attended with an income of worldly advantage, but rather of losse and detriment; yet the end shall prove, that those who thought themselves only wise men and gainers, have been but meer fools and greatest losers, and that those others, whom they looked upon as mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and bad managers of their worldly affairs, have been the greatest gainers and wisest adventurers; for, he <hi>that soweth to his flesh, shall reap corruption; but he that


<pb n="295" facs="tcp:44180:155"/>
soweth to the Spirit, shall reap life everlasting.</hi> 4. The state of the wicked after death, is a state of corruption, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in though the substance of their soul and body shall not be annihilated, but shall be upheld unto all eternity by the mighty power of God in the midst of unutterable torments, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 44. yet all their glory, pleasure and gain wherein they placed their happinesse, and for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining whereof only, they spent their time and strength, <hi>(Psal.</hi> 49. 11.) shall then be consumed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. and they themselves made to languish and pine away under the wrath of an highly provoked and then unreconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able God, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 9. for, saith he, <hi>The wicked shall reap corruption,</hi> meaning their state after death. 5. The state of the Godly after death shall be a state of life, the life of Grace being then swallowed up and perfected in the life of Glory, which consisteth in perfect freedom from sin and misery, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 27. in unconceivable joys, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 11. and the full enjoying of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2. which happy state of theirs shall be eternal, they shall never weary nor yet be deprived of it: for, saith he, the Godly <hi>shall reap life everlasting.</hi> 6. Whatever sin a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth, it is most properly his own work, as flowing from the root of his own corrupt flesh; but the good which he doth, is not so properly his own as Gods, in so far as it floweth from the Spirit of God and habits of Grace, which were wrought in him by the self-same Spirit, <hi>Philip. 2. 13. Col.</hi> 3. 10. for, speaking of the <hi>flesh,</hi> he setteth it forth by the appropriating Pronoun <hi>his; He that soweth to</hi> his <hi>flesh;</hi> but not so, while he speaketh of the Spirit, <hi>He that soweth to The Spirit,</hi> not to his spirit.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle, from what he hath presently spoken of the reward of eternal life, attending those who sow in the Spirit, inferreth the former exhortation propounded, ver. 6. and enlargeth it, by recommending unto them,


<pb n="296" facs="tcp:44180:156"/>
according to the sense given of the former similitude, the study of good works, and especially of beneficency in the general, under the name of <hi>well-doing;</hi> whereby he meaneth not only the outward work, but also the doing of it in a right manner, <hi>Mat. 6. 1. &amp;c.</hi> and that they would persevere to the end in that study, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all contrary discouragements, without base and cowardly ceding unto them; and inforceth the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by putting it above all question, that they shall gather the fruit which God had promised, though not presently, yet in the <hi>due time,</hi> that is, the time which God doth judge most convenient; but withall, he addeth a condition of reaping in due time, required on their part, to wit, if they continued constant in well-doing, even the same unto which he had exhorted them in the former part of the verse. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As all men by nature are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly backward from entring the course of well-doing, and especially of exercising beneficency towards those whom God hath ordained to be objects of it, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 21, 22, 23. So, considering the many discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which occur to a man while he is in this course of beneficency, what from his own corruption, what from the unworthinesse, ingratitude and multitude of objects, and what from the coldrife disposition and bad example of others, who are equally if not more able, there is no small propensnesse in all to sit up in that course, and to give it over immediately, or soon after they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> supposeth such a propensity, and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth against it, while he saith, <hi>Let us not be weary of well-doing.</hi> 2. It is not enough that men do so far subject themselves to the authority of God speaking in His Word, as once to enter the way of obedience, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for a season, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 17- until possibly they attain to a name for piety, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. -1. or meet with some unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected discouragement or tentation, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. -17. But, they must also persist in their begun course so long as they have any being, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 33. for, saith he, <hi>Let us not be weary in well doing.</hi> 3. That Christians may eye


<pb n="297" facs="tcp:44180:156"/>
the promised reward, and with what provisions they may have their eye upon it, as a motive to obedience and peseverance; (See ver. 7. doct. 8.) for, the Spirit of God doth encourage them from this, <hi>that in due time they should reap.</hi> 4. Though God hath promised a rich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from free-grace unto His Peoples sincere and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling obedience; yet, He hath reserved the date and time for the actual bestowing of that reward unto Himself; So, that though it be long delayed, yet they have not ground to challenge Him for breach of promise, as sometimes even His dearest Saints under a violent tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have gone very near to do, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. -8. for, saith he, <hi>Ye shall reap,</hi> but when? not presently, but <hi>in the due</hi> and proper <hi>time,</hi> to wit, that which God doth judge to be such. 5. Though God, as said is, doth not limit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to a determinate time when He will make His Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple enjoy the wished-for fruits and comfort of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, expensive and long persisted-in obedience; yet the time made choice of by Him for His so doing, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this life, or immediatly after death, is alwayes the due and proper time, and hath a fitnesse in it in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, all circumstances being well considered, for the bestowing of that mercy beyond any other time: for, he saith, <hi>Ye shall reap in due,</hi> or proper <hi>time;</hi> the word ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>time,</hi> signifieth properly an opportune time, the very article or point of time which determineth the fittest op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for doing any businesse; and the epithet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, doth intend the signification, as if he had said, an <hi>opportune opportune time,</hi> or <hi>most opportùne time.</hi> 6. That a man may upon just grounds, and with confidence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the good thing offered and contained in a conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal promise, he must of necessity come up in his practice to that condition and qualification which is called-for in the promise; Hence the Apostle exhorteth them not to weary, because the promise of a reward includeth their not wearying as a condition; <hi>Ye shall reap, if ye faint not:</hi> where by <hi>fainting</hi> we must not understand every slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and remitting somewhat in our course; for, this

                  <p>HE doth yet again repeat, and so closeth the former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation unto beneficency, as a conclusion drawn from the former arguments; And first, he presseth the use-making of the present opportunity which they had of exercising this grace; which relateth, 1. mainly to the whole time of this life, as that, which being ended, all opportunity of doing good by those, who did ever untill then neglect to do good, doth end with it. And 2. to some parts of that time, in which there is more ready accesse unto duties of that kind, than at other times. And secondly, he sheweth the persons unto whom they should do good, first, to all men whomsoever; next and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially unto those, who, being conjoyned by the ty of one common Confession of Faith in Jesus Christ, are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of His Church, which is as it were His Houshold, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 14. Doct.</hi> 1. The Minister of Christ who would speak pertinently and edifyingly unto his hearers, must not hand-over-head deliver every Truth as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to his mind without any method, or dependance of purposes; but, having such a scope proposed unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to aim at, whether the illustration and confirmation of a truth, or the inforcing of a duty, or the reproving of sin, or confutation of error, he would digest in his mind, and accordingly deliver in preaching all his other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, so as it may be best subservient unto that scope, whether as illustrations, confirmations from Scripture and Reason, or as motives, helps, cautions, or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. Yea, and for the better help of peoples me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and better carrying along of their attention, with


<pb n="299" facs="tcp:44180:157"/>
the threed of his whole discourse, he would frequently inculcate and re-assume that which is principally inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him in his discourse, and to which all the other pieces of it are subservient: for, so doth the Apostle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, ver. 6. the inforcing of beneficency, as the scope he aimeth at, making all he hath said in the following verses one way or other subservient unto it, and doth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reiterate the exhortation it self, ver. 6. ver. 9. and here, <hi>As we have opportunity, let us do good.</hi> 2. The ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Jesus Christ should so presse the duties of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficency upon others, as not to exoner and keep themselves free from that duty, who ought to be examples unto the Lord's People, as in every duty, so chiefly in those of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficency, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 12. because People being more averse from such expensive duties than from any other, do more readily snatch at every thing which may excuse their neglect, and will judge no excuse more plausible than that even their Ministers do neglect all duties of that kind; therefore the Apostle, both in the former verse and in this, includeth himself in the exhortation; <hi>Let us not weary,</hi> and, <hi>let us do good,</hi> saith he. 3. As there are some fit opportunities offered unto us by the providence of God for doing our duty in any kind, and especially for this duty of beneficency, such as our meeting with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient objects, whose necessity calls for our help, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 7. and our being fitted with abilities to do them good, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 14. So because those opportunities are in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and being past, will not possibly return; therefore are we to look upon them, as a pressing call from the Lord to set about the duty, and ought without delay or foreslowing, close with that call: for, all this is imported by saying, <hi>As we have opportunity, let us do good,</hi> seing, as we shew, this opportunity relateth in part to some pieces of our time in this life, in which we have more ready ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to the duties of beneficency than at other times, and it hath the force of an argument to presse the duty, as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it will not alwayes last. 4. As all opportunities of this kind are confined within the narrow precinct of


<pb n="300" facs="tcp:44180:158"/>
this present life, there being no possibility of doing good in the way which we now do it, or, of being benificial unto others after this life, the time of repentance, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king sure our election by well-doing, of making our peace with God, is then past, and where the tree falleth there it lyeth, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 3. So, because the time of this life is uncertain <hi>(Iam.</hi> 4. 14.) therefore we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stir our selves in the use-making of the present time, as not knowing how soon our time may end, and all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of doing good come to an end with it: for, so much is imported in the words, as this opportunity doth hold out the whole time of this life, <hi>As,</hi> or, <hi>while we have opportunity, let us do good.</hi> 5. This duty of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency is to be extended unto all men, even our very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies nor excepted, as their necessity doth require, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 4, 5. and our own ability may furnish, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. and that because of Gods own example, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45. and the ty of one common nature betwixt them and us, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58. 7. for, saith he, <hi>Let us do good unto all men.</hi> 6. As the Church is God's family and houshold, whereof He himself is the head and master, <hi>(Eph.</hi> 3. 15.) His Ministers are stewards, to dispense the bread of life, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 1.) and particular Christians are members of this family, orderly conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and knit together by the profession of one common Faith in Christ Jesus; and therefore the Church is but a small number, a family, even an handfull in comparison of the world, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32. And being Christ's family, cannot but be cared and provided-for by Him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. So the members of this family are in a special manner obliged to love one another, and to evidence their love by being beneficial one to another under their necessities and straits (in which God doth suffer often even those of His own family to fall for their own good, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6.) and that as for other reasons, so because of that near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation under which they stand, as being children and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks of one family which is the Lord's: for, saith he, <hi>Do good especially unto them who are of the houshold of faith,</hi> the designation which he giveth them of one houshold


<pb n="301" facs="tcp:44180:158"/>
containing the force of an argument, 7. There is an order to be keeped in the exercise of our beneficency; And this, first, that it be exercised to those of our own family, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. Secondly, to our parents, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 4. Thirdly, to our kinred, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8-. And, fourthly, among strangers, unto those who professe the same Faith with us, and among those, to such who do evidence most the reality of their Faith by the fruits of a good life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 9, 10. And lastly, unto all men whosoever when occasion offereth: for, the Apostle doth expresse the two last links of this order, and thereby giveth ground for searching out the rest from other Scriptures; <hi>Do good unto all men, but especially to them which are of the houshold of faith;</hi> he saith, <hi>especially,</hi> because the comparison is among those who are strangers, and not under any rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of kinred to us.</p>

Though an external profession of Religion <hi>(Rom.</hi> 10. -10.) and the practice of such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal rites (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24.) and other ordinances of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship as God hath commanded, <hi>(Col.</hi> 3. 16.) are to be made conscience of; yet, when the practice of those external things is opposed to the inward substantial du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, the former being rested upon without the latter, <hi>(Mat.</hi> 15. 8.) or, when the practiser affecteth a vain shew, and to be reputed religious because of those things, much more than to be religious really and indeed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 16. this is the sin of hypocrisie loathsom both to God and man; and that especially when people affect a shew from the practice of those rites which are not commanded of God: for, this is condemned here in the false Apostles, that they desired to seem exceedingly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and to make a fair outward shew of Religion by observing such carnal rites as God had now abolished under the Gospel; <hi>As many as make a fair shew in the flesh,</hi> saith he. It is ordinarily observed, that the zeal of those who are carried away with the spirit of error themselves, and whose great work is to seduce others,


<pb n="304" facs="tcp:44180:160"/>
doth most run out upon the externals of Religion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by affecting a fair shew, and to be reputed as men sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular for piety and devotion; that so they may deceive the simple, who take all for gold that glistreth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. -18. So those Apostles <hi>desired to make a fair shew in the flesh.</hi> 3. An erring conscience is of great force, and mightily prevalent with erring persons to make them follow the dictates thereof; It being usual for such to pretend conscience as a reason why they cannot subject themselves to Truth, God in His holy Justice doth give them over to a spirit of delusion, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 11. and maketh conscience to be their snare, when it imbraceth darknesse for light, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 20. and uncessantly vexeth them untill they execute its most unreasonable, irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, unnatural and sometimes most blasphemous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Joh. 16. 2. Jer.</hi> 32. 35. for, the false Apostles did <hi>constrain them to be circumcised,</hi> mainly, because by teaching the absolute necessity of Circumcision to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>(Act.</hi> 15. 2.) they possessed their consciences with that erroneous opinion, and their consciences so misled, did constrain them to follow its dictates. 4. As perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution doth ordinarily follow upon the sincere preaching of the Gospel; So, when persecution for the Gospel wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hot, there are usually many found, who, to decline a suffering lot, do tamper with the persecuters of Truth, though not by total apostasie from Truth, yet by coming a great length in making shipwrack of faith and a good conscience, only to gratifie those who persecute the truth, and to break the edge of their rage and fury against themselves: who, notwithstanding, will labour to keep up their credit in the Church of God, as if they were acted from no such politick design, but from a principle of light and conscience: for, so those false Apostles <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained others to be circumcised,</hi> pretending conscience for their so doing, when their design was, <hi>only lest they should suffer persecution for the crosse of Christ.</hi> 5. Though He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and every one who are carried away with a spirit of error, pretend to conscience, as that which they desire


<pb n="305" facs="tcp:44180:160"/>
to follow, and dare not contradict in what they hold; yet very frequently such, especially they who are seducers of others, do but make a pretext and shelter of conscience to cover their pride, politick designs, love to ease in a troublesome time, pusillanimity of spirit, fear of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a desire of vain glory, by which they are acted more than from any principle of conscience: for, those false Apostles pretended to light and conscience, as the rule of what they did, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 2. and yet they did it only, saith <hi>Paul, lest they should suffer persecution for the crosse of Christ;</hi> and, ver. 13. <hi>That they may glory in your flesh.</hi> 6. However they who persecute others for Truth do also pretend to conscience, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 5. yet, they are often found to be men destitute of conscience, and more politick than conscientious, even in those things wherein they pretend most to conscience, in so far as they do dispense with some professors of Truth, if so they come but a little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and comply with them in some things on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though not in all things, as intending hereby to work them up to a greater length in progresse of time: for, so the persecuting Jews did not molest those Christians who were circumcised; though they did otherwise pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse faith in the Messiah already come, whom the Jews had crucified, as is clear from this, <hi>They constrain you to be circumcised; only, lest they should suffer persecution for the crosse of Christ.</hi> 7. As a desire to eschew a suffering lot and persecution even for Truth by all lawful means, is no wayes sinful, but commanded, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 23. and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 3. So, to dispense with the least jot of Truth, and to imbrace the smallest of Errors contrary to Truth, that hereby the greatest of sufferings might be es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed, is blame-worthy, and extreamly sinfull; seing the least of sins hath more of evil in it than the greatest of sufferings, Those are our affliction, but not our sin: for, the Apostle condemneth his adversaries, not that simply they had laboured to eschew persecution, but that they <hi>constrained others to be circumcised; only, lest they should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer persecution for the cross of Christ.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, first, maketh good his former charge against his adversaries, to wit, That they urged Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision not from zeal to the Law of God, and from conscience, but from a politick base design; because they made no conscience to keep the Law themselves, that is, neither the moral Law, which they transgressed daily by their wicked and licentious lives, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 18, 19. nor yet the ceremonial Law, the keeping whereof they urged so much upon others, but did usually and without chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge neglect it among themselves, and where they knew none were to publish it abroad, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 4. Secondly, he mentioneth the third principle from which they were acted in their so vehement urging of Circumcision upon others, even their ambition and desire of vain-glory, that they might have whereof to glory and boast in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Proselytes among the Gentiles, who received Circumcision in their flesh at their instigation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by did evidence that they were converted, or rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted unto Judaism. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

<pb n="307" facs="tcp:44180:161"/>
not because they believe, but for other base ends: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having charged his adversaries with hypocrisie in their so much urging of Circumcision, ver. 12, he giveth a reason for his so doing, to wit, their godlesse conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and carelesse neglect of those things which they so much pressed upon others; <hi>For neither they themselves who are circumcised, keep the Law.</hi> 2. The Word of God in the mouthes of His Servants, is quick and powerfull, and sharper than any two-edged sword, so as it entreth in upon a man's very soul and spirit, and maketh that difference appear which is betwixt his false (though fair) pretences, and his real (though foul) intentions, the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whereof lay lurking under the former; but this sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Word taketh off the visard, and maketh them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their foulest colours: for, the Word of God in <hi>Paul</hi>'s mouth, discovereth the secret foul intent even of the very hearts of his adversaries, having laid aside their fair pretexts; <hi>They desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh,</hi> saith he. 3. Where the spirit of schism and Church-renting hath once possessed a soul, it causeth the man in whom it is to refuse no pains, trouble, or toil, for gaining of many followers, and to look upon those whom he so gaineth as so many trophees of his victory, and speaking proofs of his unparalleled abilities and parts, wherewith he is so much taken up himself that he cannot dissemble his earnest desire to have all others ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with admirationat them also: for, those schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Church-renters (chap. 4. ver. 17.) did desire, yea (ver. 12.) <hi>constrained men to be circumcised, that they might glory in their flesh.</hi>

and vain-glory, which he hath shown to be in the false Apostles: And, first, in opposition to their vain-glory, mentioned, ver. -13. he declareth that the matter of his gloriation and boasting was only in the crosse of Christ, that is, the all sufficient, expiatory and satisfactory sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ upon the Crosse with the whole work of our Redemption, which is also hereby synecdochically understood, and rejecteth all other sorts of boasting, as a thing abominable; for, so much doth his usual expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>God forbid,</hi> import, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 4, 6, 31. and 6. 2. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he sheweth, in opposition to their hypocrisie and desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, that by Christ, or by His Crosse (for the article in the Greek language may relate to either) the <hi>world was crucified to him,</hi> that is, all that is in the world, and in so far as it is opposed to the Kingdom of Christ, as honour, riches, pomp, pleasure, the favour, fear, wrath, praise or dispraise of men, all were undervalued and despised by him, to wit, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of Christ and the excellency and worth of His sufferings, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 8. and hereby also he <hi>was crucified unto the world,</hi> that is, undervalued and despised by the men of this world; for, to <hi>be crucified</hi> in both sentences, signifieth the same thing, even to be contemptible and undervalued, as those were who died by that ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and cursed death upon the Crosse, <hi>Deut. 21. 23.

It is praise-worthy in a Minister, and advanceth much the conviction of those whose sins he reproveth, when his own carriage is so exemplary, as the holding forth of it may point out their duty, and wherein they come short of their duty: for, the Apostle, having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the sins of his adversaries, ver. 12, 13. doth here hold forth his own practice, wherein, as in a glasse, they and others might see their duty in opposition to those sins; <hi>But God forbid,</hi> saith he, <hi>that I should glory, &amp;c.</hi> 2.

Though it be lawfull in some cases for men to glory in the good things of God bestowed upon them (See ver. 4. doct. 5.) yet it is altogether unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; yea, no lesse than abominable, to glory in any thing, so as that we place our confidence in it, for making us accepted to, and righteous before God, but only the merit and satisfaction of Jesus Christ, the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof was upon the Crosse, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 30. for, in opposition to the false Apostles their boasting in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, as the meritorious cause of their Salvation, (See chap. 5. ver. 4. doct. 1.) doth the Apostle here say, <hi>God forbid that I should glory save in the Crosse of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> 4. A holy heart, which hath experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally tasted the worth that is in Christ, cannot easily think upon Him, and especially upon His Satisfaction and Sufferings, but it must be enlarged towards Him, and have high thoughts of that excellency and worth which is in Him, joyned with an earnest desire of a more

The crosse and sufferings of Christ effectually applyed by faith, have that much power and vertue in them, as to make all things worldly, even the very applause and glory of the world, contemptible unto, and to be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally abhorred by a sincere Believer, in so far as the power, terror, beauty, allurements, credit, pleasure, or profit of those things would interpose to mar that high esteem he ought to have of Christ's satisfaction and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or his right use-making of them, or his seeking after God's glory as the chief end of all his actions, and above all those things: for, in those respects, the world was crucified, or as a dead carrion to <hi>Paul,</hi> wherein he could take no pleasure, and this <hi>by Christ,</hi> and the vertue of His sufferings, and nothing else; <hi>By whom,</hi> or, <hi>by which crosse, the world is crucified unto me.</hi> 6. The more that high esteem of, and glorying in Jesus Christ doth grow in the heart of any, the more will our accompt of all things worldly, being compared with Him and opposed to Him, decay: And where esteem of those things is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the growing hand, that high accompt which ought to be had of Jesus Christ cannot but be decaying much; for, with <hi>Paul, I glory in the crosse of Christ</hi> and <hi>the world is crucified to me,</hi> did go together. 7. As a man truly godly, and renewed by the Spirit of Christ, and in so far as he is renewed, at least, cannot but be unsavoury unto, and vilipended by the world and wicked men in the world; So this also doth come from the death and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Christ, not indeed, as from a working cause,


<pb n="311" facs="tcp:44180:163"/>
(for, Christ by, His death doth work no such malicious disposition in wicked men towards His People) but as from an occasion; for, from those gracious effects flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Spirit of Christ, and wrought in those who are renewed, wicked men do take occasion to hate, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor, and to take no pleasure in them, no more than they were the dead carrions of some notorious malefactors put to a shamefull death by the hand of Justice; <hi>By whom,</hi> saith he, <hi>I am crucified unto the world.</hi>

upon others, but there is a fixt, determinate rule conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended upon by God for all, which no man may either add to, or take from: for, saith he, <hi>As many as walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this rule,</hi> meaning a determinate, fixed rule. The word in the original is borrowed from Architectors who try their work by rule and square: now, whatever is defective, and requireth addition; or superfluous, and requireth diminution, is not a perfect and just measure or rule. 2.

Yet, the grace of Faith in Jesus Christ, and repentance unto life, are a doctrinal sum of this rule, if we mean the Doctrine of Faith and Repentance; or, a practical sum, if we mean the graces themselves; there being no point of Truth taught, and no duty pressed in the whole Scripture which one way or other relateth not to one of these two: for, while he saith, <hi>As many as walk according to this rule,</hi> it is all one upon the matter, whether by the rule he mean the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contained in the whole Epistle, which is one and the same in substance with the rest of Scripture, or the graces of Faith in Christ, called (ver. 14.) <hi>glorying in the crosse of Christ,</hi> and of repentance unto life, called (ver. 15.) <hi>the new creature,</hi> although it be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, he mean the latter. 3.

And so many and subtil are those tentations which Satan setteth on foot to make us transgresse and flight this rule. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. -11. that there is great necessity of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection, accuracy and attention unto those who would rightly walk according to this rule: for, the word


<pb n="315" facs="tcp:44180:165"/>
rendred <hi>walk,</hi> signifieth to walk orderly, attentively, as Souldiers when they keep rank; <hi>As many as walk accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this rule.</hi> 5 Even those who walk according to this rule, are not so much freed from sin and misery, but they stand in need of mercy; yea, all their receipts do come in the way, not of merit, but of undeserved mercy; for, mercy relateth to sin, misery; and to them that <hi>walk according to this rule,</hi> there is a promise not only of peace, but also of mercy, and of peace flowing from mercy; <hi>Peace shall be upon them, and mercy,</hi> saith he. 6. As ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der walkers according to this rule may expect sufficient encouragement and reward, even in this life, and such as may counterballance all contrary discouragements and hardships which usually occur in that way; So their encouragements are not from the world, but from above, descending from Heaven, and therefore such as cannot be hindred by the malice of men: for, <hi>peace shall be upon them, and mercy,</hi> saith he; the word rendred, <hi>upon them,</hi> is emphatick, and importeth that those blessings fall down upon them from above. 7. It is not sufficient for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of Christ who would comfort and incourage weak Christians (who are otherwise apt to be discouraged through multitude of tentations in their Christian course, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 12.) that he find out, and apply such precious Promises as are pertinent to their case, but he must also endeavour their satisfaction in this, that they are in the number of those to whom such promises do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and who with God's allowance may lay hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and draw out that comfort which is contained in them, otherwise the discouraged person will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as presumption to apply any of those precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. -2. though otherwise he most gladly would: for, the Apostle sheweth, that those who walk according to this rule, and to whom he promiseth peace and mercy, are the Israel of God, to whom such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises were made and do appertain; <hi>And upon the Israel of God,</hi> saith he.</p>

When the mouthes of hereticks and slanderers cannot be stopped with reason and fair per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions, but rather they prove more insolent, it is the duty of those who have authority, wisely to make use of it, for putting them to silence: for, so doth <hi>Paul,</hi> having used abundance of reasons and perswasions already by his Apostolick Authority, command, <hi>From henceforth let no man trouble me.</hi> 3. As it is the lot of Christ's most eminent Servants to meet with base and disgracefull usage from raging persecuters, as if they were the basest of slaves, malefactors, and the verie off-scourings of men; So, whatever hard measure His Servants do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from such, the Lord Christ will look on it as done to Himself; He will own their sufferings, wounds, and akars of those wounds, as His own, and alloweth His suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Martyrs to look so upon them also, &amp; that because they are inflicted for the profession of His Name, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 14. and because of that strict union which is betwixt Christ and Believers, whereby He and they are only one mystical Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 23. for, <hi>Paul</hi> had received stripes and wounds, the marks whereof did afterwards remain in his flesh; the word signifieth the prints and marks of such stripes as slaves and malefactors used to be beaten with, and those he calleth the marks of Christ; <hi>I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</hi> 4.

Though wicked hereticks may suffer much before they renounce their erroneous opinions, So that a man's suffering for his opinion will not presently prove his opinion to be truth; yet when other strong arguments from Scripture and Reason are already made use of by a Preacher to confirm the truth of his Doctrine, this may adde weight to all his other arguments, and argue his sincererity and uprightnesse in the defence of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, even that with courage and constancy, and that frequently, he hath sealed the truth of it by his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: for, the Apostle, having already spoken sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in reason for the defence of his Doctrine against his adversaries, doth now make mention of his sufferings for the Truth as an additional argument to stop the mouths of those who did oppose his Doctrine, and question his sincerity in the defence of it; <hi>From henceforth let no man trouble me,</hi> saith he; <hi>for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the first part of this Chapter (after the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, ver. 1, 2.) the Apostle unfoldeth the grounds and causes of the salvation of sinners, ascribing all unto God's free grace in Christ: which he doth, first, generally, by way of thanksgiving unto God, ver. 3. Secondly, more particularly: and first, he treateth of the grounds, causes and means of salvation, as they were prepared in the eternal decree of election; which he describeth from those ends which God intended in that decree, as our sanctification, ver. 4. our adoption or glorification, ver. 5. and the glory of His grace, ver. 6. Next, as they were purchased by Christ in the work of redemption, ver. 7. And lastly, as they are applyed unto the Elect in their effectual calling, ver. 8. which is illustrated from the mean made use of for bringing it about, to wit, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing and publishing of the Gospel, ver. 9. and from the end intended by God in the use of this mean, even the gathering together in one of all the scattered Elect, ver. 10. And thirdly, he cleareth yet further the former doctrine concerning the freedom of God's grace through Christ in our salvation, by giving some instances of it, 1. In the believing Jews, ver. 11, 12. Next, in the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Gentiles, ver. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>In the second part of the Chapter, he doth indirectly incite them to constancy and progresse in the knowledge of this doctrine; first, by shewing how he blessed God, and prayed unto Him for them, ver. 15, 16. Secondly, by holding forth a short sum of his prayer unto God on their behalf, even that God would bestow a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of wisdom and saving knowledge upon them, ver. 17, 18—whereby they might know those good things, which they were to partake of in Heaven, ver. -18. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the working of Gods mighty power in, and towards Believers, ver. 19. Thirdly, by commending

this power of God unto them, from its mighty working in order to Christ's exaltation, ver. 20. which exalted state of Christ, he sheweth, doth include power and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over all creatures in general, ver. 21, 22-and over His Church in particular, ver. -22, 23.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle's scope being to establish those Ephesians in the sincere doctrine of the Gospel already received by them, and for this end to unfold the grounds and causes of their salvation, together with the freedom of God's grace in Christ, upon which salvation (with all its causes, and every step tending towards it) is founded, he doth first propound the grounds and causes in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and this not warshly, and in a coldrife manner, but with an open mouth, and a more enlarged heart, by way of thanksgiving to God, whom he describeth from his twofold relation to Christ, as being <hi>the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> for, the particle <hi>and,</hi> in this place, is not copulative of things different, but exegetick of one and the same thing, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 46.

Man, God is His Father by vertue of the personal union of the two natures in Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 32—. The reason of which his thanksgiving to God he sheweth to be Gods bestowing of real blessings upon Believers, and those not common or temporal only, but special and <hi>spiritual blessings,</hi> which tend to a spiritual and supernaturalend; and those not sparingly, but fully, and with an open hand, even <hi>all blessings,</hi> and this <hi>in heavenly places,</hi> that is, from Heaven His glorious Throne; or, because those spiritual blessings shall not be consummated and fully perfected, until Believers be in Heaven: all which bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, he sheweth are bestowed upon Believers <hi>in Christ,</hi> He, as our Head, Atturney and Advocate (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1.) having received those blessings in our name, and for our behoof, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 6. by whose merit also they are purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 5.

Yet it is our duty to blesse Him so, as that being convinced of that blessednesse, of those excellencies which are in Him, and favours which are bestowed upon us by Him, we do not only esteem highly of Him because of those, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 46. but also expresse this our high esteem, and that not only in words, whether by speaking to God Himself in the duty of prayer and praise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 1. or by speaking of Him, and to His commendation unto others, <hi>Psal. 34. 3, 4, &amp;c.</hi> but also and mainly in our life and actions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth here blesse the Lord; <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be God,</hi> saith he. 2. It is a looking to God with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect had to Jesus Christ, which inflameth the heart with such a mixture of love and admiration at His excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and worth, that it must of necessity break forth in


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44180:171"/>
blessing of Him: God considered without Christ being a consuming fire, to whom there can be no confident ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching by sinfull creatures, neither in the duties of prayer, nor of praise; but the vail of Christ's flesh doth break the beams of His terror, so that we may stedfastly behold His attributes and excellencies, rejoycing in them, and blessing Him for them: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> while he blesseth God, doth look upon Him through this vail; <hi>Blessed be God,</hi> and <hi>the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> 3. A holy soul, truly sensible of his lost condition by nature, and of God's mercy in his delivery from that wofull state, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not seriously think, or speak of that subject, but his heart must be inflamed with love to God; yea, and break forth in praises and thanksgiving to Him, when occasion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth: for, so doth <hi>Paul, Blessed be God who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings.</hi> 4. Though we are bound to blesse the Lord even for temporal favours, and things necessary for the life which now is, <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. 8. yet a renewed heart is most taken up with, and blesseth God most for spiritual blessings, and such as concern our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welbeing, those being not only most durable, <hi>Job.</hi> 6. 27. but also most discriminating betwixt the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and unregenerate, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 1. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. for, <hi>Paul</hi> blesseth God for these blessings; <hi>Who bath blessed us with all spiritual blessings.</hi> 5. God is the author and worker of all spiritual blessings in a special manner, in so far as He produceth them not by a general providence actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and concurring with natural principles and powers for producing of such and such effects, (as He is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor even of common blessings, health, riches, honour, and such like <hi>Psal.</hi> 75. 6, 7.) but by his special grace, whereby He createth in the heart (by nature, dead in sins and trespasses, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1.) a power to do good, <hi>Ezek,</hi> 36. 26. and actuateth that power, making it to work, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. for, the Apostle ascribeth the production of all spiritual blessings to God, while speaking of God he saith, <hi>Who hath blessed us with all spirituall blessings.</hi> 6. Though God, considered as Creator and merciful up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder

Spiritual blessings, to wit, those of them which are absolutely necessary to salvation and eternal blessednesse, are linked together, and cannot be separated: where God bestoweth one of those, He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth all, there being a necessary concatenation among them all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 30. so that they either co-exist, or at least in God's due time do follow one upon another, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> 1. 6. for, saith <hi>Paul, He hath, blessed us with all spiritual blessings.</hi> 8. Though there be some spiritual blessings, such as perfection in holinesse, and the full enjoying of God in glory, the possession whereof is not attained unto by Believers so long as they are here on earth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. yet, because of the Believer's undoubted right unto those blessings (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21, 22.) and God's unchangeable purpose to bestow them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 11. and because of the first fruits and earnest of those blessings already bestowed upon the Believer (See ver. 14.) and of Christ's having taken possession of those in the Believer's name, chap. 2. 6. he may be as much assured of his full enjoying of them, as if he had them already in hand: for, saith <hi>Paul, He hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings,</hi> as if all, none being excepted, were already enjoyed. 9. Spirituall blessings are of an heavenly rise and nature, there being no second cause upon earth, or among things created, which doth concur with God in bringing them to passe, as in the production of other natural effects: for, as the word is well rendred, <hi>in beavenly places,</hi> and better than <hi>in heavenly things;</hi> so it seemeth the bestowing of those

                  <p>THe Apostle, in the second place, treateth of those spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual blessings more particularly, and so doth branch forth at large that reason of his thanksgiving to God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently mentioned, and this in pursuance of the former scope, which is to shew, that salvation with all its causes do flow only from God's free grace in Christ; that so the Ephesians might be firmly rooted and confirmed in the faith of this Truth. And, first, he speaketh of those blessings as they were prepared and appointed for Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in God's eternal decree of Election and Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ver. 7. In this verse he sheweth, first, That these spiritual blessings are bestowed upon Believers in time, not by chance, or rashly, not from any worth in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, but according as God had fore-ordained in His decree of Election, whereby, <hi>before the foundation of the world,</hi> that is, from all eternity (See <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 24) He did choose some of mankind to eternal life <hi>(Mat.</hi> 25. 34.) passing by others, and did choose them <hi>in Christ,</hi> not as if Christ's death had moved God to love and elect; for, His electing love did move Him to give Christ for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 16. Neither did He choose them in Christ, as if they had been considered by God as already in Christ by faith, and that because of their faith thus fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen, they had been elected by Him; for, so faith should not be a fruit flowing from election, but a condition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>required in the person to be elected, which doth contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict this same very Scripture, affirming that all spiritual blessings (whereof faith is one) do flow from, and are bestowed according to the decree of Election: He did therefore choose them in Christ, as in Him, whom He did


<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44180:172"/>
in one and the self-same decree choose to be the Head of the Elect, and chief foundation-stone of all that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous building, His own House and Church, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 6. and by whom that glory, and all things tending to that glory unto which He did choose them, were to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased; that so (without doing injury to provoked ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice) they might be applied unto, and actually bestowed upon the Elect; for, so is this purpose more clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 9. Secondly, he illustrateth this decree of Election from the nearest end which God did design to be brought about by it, even the sanctification of the persons elected, whereby they should be rendred <hi>blameless</hi> before men, and sincere and upright before God, and that <hi>in love,</hi> to wit, in the duties of love to their neighbour, flowing from love to God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37, 39 by which love, as a touchstone, the soundnesse of their sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be tried. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As God from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath chosen some of mankind, and firmly decreed to bestow upon them eternal life, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32. so there are others whom He decreed not to save, but to condemn. In which latter decree, and much more in the former, God hath done nothing unjustly; seing as soveraign Lord over all the creatures He hath absolute dominion to dispose of them as He pleaseth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 19, 20, 21. and though sin in the reprobate was not the cause of God's decree of reprobation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11, 12, 13. yet it is the cause of the reprobates condemnation, so that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is just: for, saith he, <hi>He hath chosen us:</hi> which implyeth, some were not chosen, seing where all is taken there is no choice. 2. Though no man (except he who hath sinned that unpardonable sin, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. -32.) can certainly know he is a reprobate; there being no marks, except that alone, set down in Scripture, by which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation can be certainly known; Yet, the Elect may attain to the assured knowledge of their own election, seing God hath set down in Scripture, the marks and evidences of election, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. and hath promised to give His Spirit unto His own, whereby they may infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44180:173"/>
discern these marks, at least, at sometimes in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 12. for, although the Apostle doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce those Ephesians to be elected according to the judgement of charity only, which believeth the best of others, where nothing appears to the countrary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. yet, he behoved to have some undoubted perswasion of his own election, before he could warrantably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude himself to be elected, seing not charity, but certain knowledge is the principle from which a man ought to judge of himself, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. As He hath chosen us in Him,</hi> saith he. 3. Though the doctrine of Election and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation be such, as the unlearned and unstable are apt to wrest and stumble at to their own destruction, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. yet, it is not wholly to be suppressed and locked up in silence from the Lord's People, but would be soberly, and prudently sometimes propounded unto them; and that because of the many and great advantages which may be reaped, not only by the doctrine of election, such as the assurance of salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29, 30. strong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements unto holinesse, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. and courage under crosses of all sorts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 38, 39. but also by the doctrine of reprobation, as contributing much to promove the salvation of the Elect, by making them hate sin more, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 119, 120. and prize the kindnesse and good will of God more, which made choice of them, passing by others as good as they, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22, 23. for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle propoundeth this doctrine to the whole Church, and insisteth upon it, <hi>According as He hath chosen us in Him, &amp;c.</hi> 4. As electing love in God is of an old standing, even from all eternity, and therefore most free; there being nothing in the Elect, before they had a being, which might draw His love towards them: So the Lord can, and usually doth keep His purposes and thoughts for good to a people or person for a long time hid, before He do discover them, and make them known: for, He had set His love upon these believing Ephesians from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which yet lay hid from the beginning of the world, and did not kyth untill their effectual calling; <hi>He hath


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44180:173"/>
chosen us before the foundation of the world.</hi> 5. The Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoweth spiritual blessings in time, according to what He hath inacted in that His eternal decree of election before time; So that every elect soul shall most undoubtedly enjoy those blessings: And all of them (even Faith it self not being excepted) do flow from Election, and are bestowed upon the Elect, because they are elected unto them: for, saith he, <hi>God hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings, according as He hath chosen us in Him.</hi> 6. God did not choose or elect us, because we were holy, or because He did foresee we would be holy, but that we might be holy; so that neither fore-seen holinesse, good-works, nor fore-seen faith, were the causes of Election, but ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and fruits flowing from it: for, saith he, <hi>God hath chosen us that we should be holy.</hi> 7. God hath elected none to enjoy everlasting glory after this, but such as He hath chosen to be holy here: And therefore a man may safely and certainly conclude he hath been elected from all eternity, if he be sanctified and renewed by the Spirit of holinesse in time: and whatever assurance of Election is pretended unto by any who lead an unholy life, it is but a strong delusion, a vain presumption, and no well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded perswasion; for, <hi>He hath chosen us,</hi> as to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and glory, so also that <hi>we should be holy.</hi> 8. This real and saving holinesse, from which a man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his own Election, is joyned with an honest endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after such a conversation as is blamelesse and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto no just reproof from men: It is not only inward and in the heart, but outward also, and in the hand and tongue: for, saith he, <hi>He hath chosen us, that we should be holy and without blame,</hi> to wit, from men, as the word is taken, <hi>Luke 1. 6. 1 Tim. 3, 2. Doct.</hi> 9. Where this real and saving holinesse, the fruit of electing love, is, there will not only be a blamelesse conversation before men, but also sincerity of heart before God, which doth not imply perfection in holinesse, (for none should then be holy before Him in this life, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 46<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and singlenesse of spirit, opposit to a double heart


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44180:174"/>
and hypocrisie, even such ingenuity, as a man dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to God to judge of his honest endeavour after that in reality and in deed, which he pretendeth unto in the wayes of God; for, those words <hi>before Him,</hi> expresse such sincerity of heart, (See 2 <hi>King. 20. 3. Psal. 18. 23.) we should be holy before Him.</hi> 10. Sound holinesse and sincerity of heart, are most manifested in the duties of love to our neighbour, flowing from our love to God; for, external duties of Religion may be diligently follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even by hypocrites, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 11. And the inward sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial duties thereof are not so easily discerned, neither by others nor yet by our selves, as when they are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the painfull and conscientious practice of those duties, which love to our neighbour doth enjoyn: for, therefore doth the Apostle give an instance of this holinesse in <hi>love,</hi> rather than in any other duty; <hi>And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame before Him in love.</hi>

                  <p>IN this Verse, the Apostle doth first expresse Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal decree of Election, formerly mentioned by another word, to wit, <hi>Predestination,</hi> which setteth forth the same decree and purpose, together with its eternity and extent, not only to the end proposed by God, but to the whole progresse of convenient means, by which the end inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded was infallibly to be brought about. Secondly, he further describeth this decree of Election and Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from another end, which God designed to be brought about by it, even the <hi>Adoption of children by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ,</hi> to be bestowed upon the Elect: whereby is meaned not only that begun Adoption which Believers possesse here, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. and whereby they have a right to the heavenly inheritance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. but also and mainly that compleat and perfect Adoption, whereof the Elect shall partake hereafter, even the actual possession of


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44180:174"/>
their glorious inheritance: See the word so taken <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. He describeth it also from the causes moving God to elect any, or one more than another, which are set down, first, more briefly, <hi>to himself,</hi> it is better rendred <hi>in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:</hi> whereby are excluded all causes moving God to this act, without Himself. Secondly, more largely and expresly, to wit, God's absolute and soveraign will, swayed with favour and goodwill towards those whom He did choose. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. God hath not only decreed to set forth the glory of His mercy, by bestowing Heaven and Glory upon some of mankind, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 32. but, in that same wise and eternal counsel of His, He hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casten and accordingly decreed by what means and helps the person so elected may come to Heaven, and shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly obtain it. And therefore none can warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expect that this decree of Predestination will bring them to Salvation, if they live in the prophane neglect and contempt of those means which do lead unto it: for, the force and usual acception of the word <hi>predestinated,</hi> is extended to the means aswell as to the end; <hi>Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated us.</hi> 2. No not the Elect themselves are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to God by nature, they are not born sons, but made to be sons by grace and adoption, who before were heirs of hell and children of wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. -3. for, a childe by adoption is opposed to a childe by nature; men are not said to adopt their own children, but strangers, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus</hi> 2. 10.

Besides those other differences which are betwixt God's adopting of the Elect to be His own Children, and one man's adopting of another to be his son and heir, this is one; Men do adopt children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have none of their own, but God doth not adopt the Elect from any such indigence or want, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a natural Son of His own, even Jesus Christ the only begotten of the Father: for, the Apostle, having spoken of the Adoption of the Elect, doth presently make mention of Jesus Christ the Son of God by nature; <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ.</hi> 5. That any of those who are children of wrath by nature, are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to that excellent dignity of being Children by adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the most High, and of enjoying all the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned priviledges of children, it is through Jesus Christ the Mediator, in so far as He having purchased Heaven the inheritance of children by His own merit, He hath absolute right and title unto it to bestow it upon whom He pleaseth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. And having united the Elect by faith unto Himself, and thereby given them a right and interest in Himself, they not only become the sons of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. but are made heirs and co-heirs with Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. and so do enjoy a right to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance through Him: for, saith he, <hi>having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ.</hi> 6. As God hath in His eternal decree of Election firmly resolved and determined to bestow this high priviledge


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44180:175"/>
of Adoption upon the Elect, both begun Adoption here, and compleat Adoption, or the actual installing of them in Glory hereafter, and by consequence did decree to give them saving Faith also, seing Adoption floweth from it, and dependeth upon it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. So, whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever He hath decreed to lift up to this high dignity of sons, He hath decreed also to renew their nature, and to make them holy; that so their carriage may be suitable to their state and priviledges: for, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> (ver. 4.) <hi>He hath chosen us, that we should be holy;</hi> and here, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving predestinated us unto the adoption of children.</hi> 7. All was in God Himself, and nothing without Himself which moved Him to elect and choose those whom He did set His love upon; so that neither fore-seen works, or the right use of natural parts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 10. nor fore-seen faith, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 48. nor yet the merit of Christ, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 9. nor outward respects, such as nobility, wisdom, riches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26. yea, nothing present or to come in heaven or earth did move Him to choose any, or one more than another: for, saith he, <hi>God predestinated us in Himself;</hi> whereby are excluded all causes moving God to this act without Himself. 8. God hath absolute power and soveraign right to dispose as He will of all His creatures, even of reasonable creatures; and this not only in their tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, but also in their eternal concernments: which so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign will of His, is the supream sinlesse cause why God did elect some to glory; yea, and why He did passe by others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. for, the Apostle, condescending upon the reason why God did design some for grace here and glory hereafter, doth pitch upon this soveraign will of His; <hi>According to the good pleasure of His will.</hi> 9.

                  <p>THe Apostle (having already described the decree of Election from two of those ends which God propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed unto Himself to be brought about by it, to wit, the sanctification (ver. 4.) and glorification of the Elect, ver. 5.) doth here in further pursuance of the former scope, mentioned upon ver. 3. first, further describe this decree from a third and supream end which God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in designed most, which is, That as His grace, or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of His love toward the Elect, is glorious and praise-worthy in it self, and therefore called <hi>the glory of His Grace,</hi> or His glorious Grace, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of the Hebrew language: So it might be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be such, and set forth as such, especially by the Elect themselves. And, secondly, That he may clear how deservedly this Grace ought to be praised, having already showen that it was the fountain-cause of our Election before time, ver. 5. he doth now declare that this same grace and good-will in God, is the only cause why God doth in time manifest that His eternal love in the effects thereof, by making the Elect lovely, and fit to be accepted of by God as f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iends through Jesus Christ the beloved, and by accepting them both in their persons and actions, and being reconciled to them accordingly;


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44180:176"/>
for, the word signifieth both <hi>to make accepted,</hi> and <hi>to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. Doct.</hi> 1. That grace, free-favour and good-will which God doth manifest in saving of lost sinners, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together glorious, as having many and singular excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in it. It is an ancient grace, ver. 4. most free, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 4. omnipotent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 32. and a most liberal grace, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 11. and therefore a grace so glorious, that no created understanding can conceive, much lesse tongue can expresse those marvellous, ravishing, and transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent excellencies which are in it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 19. for, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it <hi>the glory of his grace,</hi> or his glorious grace. 2. It is the duty of all the Elect to praise, admire, and highly to esteem of this glorious grace, and to testifie this their high esteem of it both by word and work, in the whole strain of their life and conversation, This grace being so glorious and praise-worthy in it self, so rich and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial towards us, and this duty of praise being all which we can bestow, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 12, 13. and God doth call for from us in way of thankfulnesse for this His glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious grace, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 15. for, seing God in Election did propound to Himself the up-stirring of the Elect to <hi>praise the glory of his grace,</hi> it must needs be their duty to praise it. 3. This eternal decree of Election and Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is so contrived, that when it is made known, matter of praise to God's glorious grace is abundantly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in it: for, its rise is of grace, preventing all actual or fore-seen worth in those who are elected, (See ver. 4. doct. 6.) and all the midses, whereby the execution of this decree is carried-on to its utmost period, are also of grace, (See ver. 5. doct. 1.) So that all-alongs it brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth grace, and nothing but grace: for, <hi>He did choose us to the praise of the glory of his grace;</hi> and therefore matter of praise, for grace behoved to be manifested in His choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of us, when it is revealed, otherwise He should not have taken a convenient mean for bringing about the intended end. 4. That great and supream end, which God intended most to be brought about by this eternal decree of Election, (and to which the other two ends,

There ought to be a sweet concord and harmony betwixt a Ministers doctrine and practice, his hand and tongue would joyntly preach and presse the same Truth; for, so his doctrine shall have greater weight with hearers, when he doth commend and seal the truth of it by his own example and practice; Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> while he is pointing out the duty of the Elect to be the praising of God's glorious grace, he himself is practising this duty; for, as is clear from ver. 3. he is speaking all-alongs of this purpose by way of praise and thanksgiving to God. 6. Though the Elect from all eternity are loved by God with His love of benevolence, whereby he willed good unto them, and decreed to bestow good upon them, ver. 4. Yet there is a love of complacency, or delight in God, whereby He not only willeth good unto the persons so beloved, but accepteth of them, acquiesceth in them, as in His own children and friends reconciled to Him, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth Himself in His own graces bestowed upon them, in which respect the Elect, as being children of wrath by nature, are not from eternity beloved of God, nor accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of by Him; yea, not before they be effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and reconciled to God through faith in Jesus Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6-. for, <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of Gods making us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and lovely, or of His accepting us, as of an action done in time, <hi>Wherein He hath made us accepted in the Bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>

7. Whomsoever God hath elected before time, those He accepteth of, and is well pleased with in time, both in their persons and actions, if they be good, having first made them lovely and fit to be accepted of by Him: which He doth by working in them a conformity (both as to their state and actions) with the rule, according to which He doth accept; not the rule prescribed by the Law, which requireth no lesse than a perfect and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall righteousnesse in order to our acceptation by God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. but the rule prescribed by the Gospel, which admitteth the imputed righteousnesse of a cautioner in place of a perfect personal righteousnesse whereby our persons are accepted and made lovely to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 19. and of sincerity in our actions in place of perfection, whereby they are also accepted, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 6. for, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of the Elect, <hi>He hath made us accepted.</hi> 8. That same grace, free-favour and good-will, which moved God to elect us before time, moveth Him also to make us accepted, lovely and well-pleasing to Himself, and to accept of us in time; whence it followeth, that as the eternal decree of Election was most free, and in nothing dependent on our works; So that work of God, whereby He draweth souls out of nature, cloatheth them with Christ's righteousnesse, and bestoweth grace upon them, is wholly free also as to us, and cometh only from His most free grace without respect had to any worth of ours: for, saith he, <hi>Wherein,</hi> or, <hi>in which grace,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he spoke formerly as the fountain-cause of Election, <hi>He hath made us accepted.</hi> 9.

much beloved of the Father, That all the Elect being once effectually called, are made lovely and acceptable to God through Him; Neither doth God accept of the persons or actions of any, but through Him who is <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah our righteousnesse, Jer.</hi> 23. 6. and being laid hold upon by faith, we who are in our selves unrighteous, are made righteous, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. and the sinfull failings of our best actions hid and covered in Him; So that both our persons and actions are accepted: <hi>For he hath made us accepted in the Beloved.</hi> 11.

                  <p>THe Apostle (having already spoken of those spiritual blessings, mentioned ver. 3. as they were prepared, and appointed for Believers in God's eternal decree of Election) doth now speak of them, as they were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by Christ in that great and marvellous work of redemption, by shewing, first, That Jesus Christ hath given a ransom, even his own bloud, in satisfaction to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine justice for our wrongs, whence floweth our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from sin, Satan, and God's wrath, which is begun here, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. and shall be compleated hereafter at the last day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. Secondly, he explaineth this great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44180:178"/>
of redemption by <hi>the forgivenesse of our sins</hi> in justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which is an effect of redemption, as <hi>redemption</hi> is taken for the laying down of the price by Christ, and a principal part of redemption, as it speaketh our actual delivery and freedom through vertue of that price. Thirdly, he sheweth the impulsive cause which moved God to bestow such a benefit, even the riches of that same grace and free-favour in God formerly spoken of: By all which he carrieth on his main scope, which is, to confirm those Ephesians, that salvation and all the steps leading to it do flow from God's free-grace in Christ. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. All men, the Elect themselves not being excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are by nature under slavery and bondage to sin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 34. Satan, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. and to God's wrath, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. for, redemption presupposeth bondage; <hi>In whom we have redemption.</hi> 2. There was no delivery to be had from this bondage by prayer and intreaty, nor by exchange of prisoners, as in wars, nor yet by strong hand and meer force; but by paying of a price, not to Satan, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the Elect in slavery, as a rigid Tyrant, or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilesse Jaylor, from whom they are delivered by force, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. -14. but to God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 2. whose justice was wronged by the sins of the Elect, and therefore behoved to be satisfied: for, <hi>redemption,</hi> according to the force of the original word, is a delivery by ransom and price. 3. Jesus Christ is that Person by whom we have redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from the fore-mentioned slavery; this work by the counsel of the whole Trinity being put over upon Him, as one, who not only had right both of property to redeem the Elect being His creatures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 10. and of kinred, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 48. as being our brother, and of the same nature with us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2, 14-. but was also fitted to be our Redeemer, (a price, to wit, His humane nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put in his hands to lay down, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. -5.) and was able to redeem, as being also God, whereby His suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as man, became a ransom of infinit value, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. -28. for, by saying, <hi>In whom,</hi> or, in Christ <hi>we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> he saith, that we have it by Him. 4. We have


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44180:179" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this redemption not only by Christ, but also in him, which holdeth also in forgivenesse of sins; He being the common store-house, wherein the Elect have all their spiritual blessings treasured up, even before they take their spiritual being from Him, or get those blessings actually applied unto them, as <hi>Adam's</hi> posterity have their original guiltinesse, whence all actual transgressions flow, treasured up in Him, before they take their natural being from Him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. As also because this redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and the fruits of it are not actually applied to the Elect until they be in Christ, and by faith united to Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. for, saith he, <hi>In whom,</hi> meaning Christ, <hi>we have redemption and forgivenesse of sins.</hi> 5. The wrong done to infinit justice by our sin was so great, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing performed by Christ could be a sufficient ransom in order to our redemption, except he had crowned all his other actions and sufferings by laying down his life and undergoing a bloudy and violent death: for, <hi>We have redemption through his bloud,</hi> to wit, not as excluding his former obedience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18, 19. nor yet his other suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, especially his soul-sufferings, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 10. but as being the head-stone and compleating of all, <hi>Joh. 19. 30. Doct.</hi> 6. Sin is a debt, as being a wrong done against God, obliging the sinner to repair God in his honour, or otherwayes to underly the wrath of a provoked God for ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23-. for, the word <hi>forgivenesse,</hi> in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and as it is used in Scripture, is taken from those who are loosed out of a prison for debt; <hi>The forgivenesse of sins.</hi> 7. There is no delivery from this debt of sin, and obligation to wrath because of sin, but by pardon and forgivenesse. It is an infinit debt, and so cannot be satisfied by finit creatures: for, thus doth <hi>Paul</hi> expresse the way how the debt is removed, even <hi>by forgivenesse of sins.</hi> 8. Though the guilt of sin be removed by forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and therefore freely, as to us; yet, that sin might be thus freely forgiven with the good leave of provoked justice, forgivenesse of sin was purchased at a dear rate by Christ: for, as we have <hi>redemption through his bloud,</hi>


                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44180:179"/>
so also <hi>forgivenesse of sins.</hi> 9. Jesus Christ hath this rich treasure of forgivenesse of sins, which he hath bought by his bloud, laid up in himself; so that whensoever a sinner sensible of this weighty debt doth lay hold upon Christ by faith, and is thereby ingraffed in Him, his sins are freely pardoned, and his debt remitted: for, <hi>In him,</hi> saith he, <hi>we have forgivenesse of sins.</hi> 10. As that grace, favour and good-will, which God manifested in the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of sinners is a rich, copious and abundant grace: so nothing argueth the riches of this grace more, than that from it do flow such excellent effects, as, the giving of Christ the Son of God to redeem slaves and rebels, together with forgivenesse of sins; they being infinit wrongs, and there being many of them in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned sinner, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 12. And those not only ordinary infirmities, but sometimes also heinous transgressions, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 14. and yet free-grace pardoneth all, and this not only in one, but in all Believers, in all ages, and doth yet remain as full and overflowing in God, to pardon self-condemned sinners as ever; all which, doth argue no lesse than a copious, rich and abundant grace: for, the Apostle, speaking of grace with relation to those two, <hi>redemption</hi> and <hi>forgiveness,</hi> which flow from it, he calleth it a rich grace; <hi>According to the riches of his grace,</hi> saith he.</p>

Whosoever are elected from eternity, and for whomsoever Christ did give a ransom to provoked ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in the fulnesse of time, all such in God's due time have the effects of God's eternal love, and of the price payed by Christ applyed unto them, and wrought in them, even the saving graces of God's Spirit: for, upon those Ephesians, who were elected, ver. 4. and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ver. 7. did God bestow the gracious effects of his eternal love, by working saving grace in them; <hi>He hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence.</hi> 2. That those spiritual blessings which were prepared for us in Election and purchased in the work of Redemption, are applyed unto us, and we made actually to partake of them, It is the alone work of God in our effectual cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; there being not so much as either power or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in us, who by nature are dead in sins and trespasses, to accept of Christ, or of any thing purchased by him, untill God do quicken us: for, the Apostle, shewing how the Ephesians were made partakers of those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, he ascribeth this work wholly to God, making them but meer patients in it; <hi>He hath abounded towards us,</hi> or <hi>in us,</hi> as a full fountain runneth over and watereth the adjacent ground. 3.

So care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is God to maintain the interest of his free-grace in our salvation, as being the only supream and fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thereof; that he thinketh it not sufficient once to assert, in the general, that salvation and all the means and steps tending towards it, do flow from his free-grace, but that this be again and again inculcated, and (all the particular steps which lead to salvation being condescended upon) that his free-grace, favour and good will be held out as the fountain of each step in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: for, the Apostle doth so, and that by an heavenly and divine artifice, sliding down from one step to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from Election to Redemption, and from Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to effectual calling, and from effectual calling unto God's bestowing the outward mean of salvation, the Gospel; not only ascribing all to God's free-grace, but making grace the mid-link of the chain, whereby he joyneth the several parts of his discourse together; so, ver. 8. <hi>Wherein he abounded;</hi> and here, <hi>According to the good pleasure of his will,</hi> and <hi>which he purposed in himself,</hi> as having no cause without himself to set him on work. 6.

He might gather together in Christ all His own Elect (whether already glorified or yet upon earth) who before were separated from God, and one from another, and might make them <hi>one</hi> with God, being united with Christ their head by faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17-. and <hi>one</hi> among themselves, being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by love, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 14. Now, the Apostle affirmeth this gathering of all the Elect, was to be in the fulnesse of times: for, though many of them were already actually gathered and glorified, to wit, the things in Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time; yet the exhibition of that, by vertue whereof they were gathered, was at, and not before that time, to wit, the time of Christ's incarnation, obedience and sufferings, <hi>Heb. 9. 15. Doct.</hi> 1. All mankind by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and being considered in themselves, are under a fearfull dissipation and scattering: Sin hath rent and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated them from God, from man, and from the blessed Angels: for, <hi>gathering</hi> presupposeth a foregoing scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the word rendred <hi>gather together in one,</hi> being taken from a word which signifieth the head of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body, or a short sum of a sparse discourse, and so sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying here to gather together under one head, to wit, Christ, and unto one sum and body amongst themselves, it supposeth that they are separated from God, from


<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44180:183"/>
Christ, one from another, and from the Angels also: for, they were to be gathered into one body with those; <hi>That he might gather together in one, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The Lord hath not left all mankind in this wofull separation and scattered condition: but, as He hath firmly purposed and decreed from all eternity; so in time He setteth about to gather together some of scattered mankind, and to unite them to Himself, one to another, and to the blessed Angels: for, the word rendred <hi>to gather,</hi> implyeth a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering unto all these, as is said; <hi>And he hath purposed in himself,—that he might gather together in one.</hi> 3. The gathering together of the scattered Elect, and making of them one with God and among themselves, doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the choice of their own free-will, which could do no other but refuse to be gathered, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 37. and so Christ should not have seen of the travel of His soul and been satisfied, contrary to what is promised, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 11. But upon the fixed and unchangeable purpose of God, which engageth His Omnipotency to make them willing to be gathered, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3. and therefore they shall be infallibly gathered: for, the Apostle, as appears from the context, maketh this gathering depend on Gods purpose; <hi>He hath purposed in himself,—that he might ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther together in one.</hi> 4. It is only God, who by His om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power doth gather together the scattered Elect, and maketh them one with Himself, and with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Himself. We do so much love to wander, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 10. that we would live and die estranged from God, if the Lord by strong-hand did not reclaim us from our wandrings, for, saith <hi>Paul, He hath purposed in himself,—that he might gather together in one.</hi> 5. The preaching of the Gospel, and making known that blessed mysterie, is the mean which God maketh use of in this work of gathering the scattered Elect: because, though our actuall gathering be an act of Gods omnipotent power; yet, He dealeth with us as with rational creatures, by giving us an offer of His friendship, commanding us to accept of it as it is offered, and in the mean time sending


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44180:183"/>
forth his power with the command, whereby He maketh us to accept, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 14. for, as is clear from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, God's end intended in making known the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of his will, is, <hi>That he might gather together in one.</hi> 6. As God is the great Master of his own House and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which is the Church, to whom He dispenseth and distributeth all her mercies, comforts and crosses with no lesse; yea, with infinitly greater care, wisdom and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, than any man doth care, provide for, and govern his own family; So, among other things, He dispenseth and ordereth times and seasons for his Church, as not only having fixed in his eternal counsel the general pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of the Churches time, how long the Church should be in her state of infancy, how long under the bondage of the Law, and how long she shall continue in her more grown and perfect age under the Gospel; but also the time and season for bestowing of particular mercies, and inflicting corrections and chastisements: for, the word rendred <hi>dispensation,</hi> signifieth the way of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrating the affairs of the family by the master thereof, and the <hi>times</hi> come under those things, which are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrated by God; <hi>That in the dispensation of the fulnesse of times.</hi> 7. As every time chosen of God for bestowing of any mercy, is the full and fittest time for his bestowing of it; So the time of Christ's incarnation is in a speciall manner the full time, and fulnesse of time; and that not only because it was that full time which God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his decree, and, for reasons known to his own unsearchable wisdom, condescended upon as the most fitting time for that great work; but also, because all the fore-going prophecies, promises and types of the Messias, were fulfilled in those times, <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 27. and the will of God concerning man's salvation was then, and not till then fully revealed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. for, the Apostle calleth those times, <hi>the fulnesse of times; That in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the fulness of times.</hi> 8. Though the benefits purchased by Christ, and particularly that of effectuall calling, and gathering together unto God those whom


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44180:184"/>
sin did separate from Him, be intended for, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly doth light only upon few, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 14. Yet the Gospel, and Promise, by which Christ and the benefits purchased by Him are revealed, is drawn up in the most comprehensive expressions: And this of purpose, that none may hereby be excluded from laying hold upon that gracious offer, but such as do exclude themselves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. for, saith he, <hi>That he might gather together in one all things, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth:</hi> by which broad expressions are meaned only the Elect (for there is an universality and world even of those, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19.) and not all the creatures, not Devils or Reprobates, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9. yea, to speak properly, not yet the elect Angels, who being never separated from God by sin, cannot be gathered to him by Christ, though they may improperly and in some respects be said to be so; to wit, because of those advantages which they have by Christ, as that they are now most perfectly and inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably united with God, without hazard of being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 10. and have attained the knowledge of that wonderfull plot of Man's Salvation through Jesus Christ, which was a mysterie even to them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 10. and a greater measure of joy than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they had, upon Christ's converting and saving of lost sinners, <hi>Luke 15. 7, 10. Doct.</hi> 9 All who belong to God's purpose of Election, and who are, or shall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in Christ, are either in heaven or earth: <hi>Paul</hi> knew no purgatory, or third place for the souls of the Elect to go unto after death, to endure the temporal punishment due to their sin: for, he divideth those <hi>all things,</hi> which were to be gathered, into <hi>things in heaven,</hi> and <hi>things on earth.</hi> 10. There is an union betwixt the Saints departed now in heaven, and those who are yet alive upon the earth, so as they make up one mystical body under one head, Christ, to whom the Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted are united (though not by faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 10.) yet by sense, as we are united to Him by faith: and as they are united to Christ, so also one to another, and to us by


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44180:184"/>
love: for charity never faileth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. from which union there floweth a communion betwixt them and us, whereby they do pray for the Church in general, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 10. (though not for the particular conditions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of men upon earth, whereof they are ignorant, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 16.) and the Godly upon earth do in heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection converse with them in heaven, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 20. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring continually to be dissolved and to be with Christ, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 23. (though they are not to pray unto them, or give them religious worship, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 10.) for, saith he, <hi>That in the dispensation of the fulnesse of times, he might gather together in one, things in heaven, and things on earth.</hi> 11. Jesus Christ is that person, in, and by whom we are gathered together unto God by faith in Him, and to the Angels, and also among our selves by the grace of love; He having united the two dissentient parties, God and man, in His own Person, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. -23. and having sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied justice for that wrong which caused the rent, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 5. and working in us by His Spirit those graces of faith and love, whereby we are made one with God and among our selves, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. and having by His death taken away that wall of partition and enimity which was betwixt Jew and Gentile, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 14, 15, 16. it being also necessary that we be in Him by faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we be united to God through Him; for, the Apostle is so much delighted with this Truth himself, and would so gladly have it well known &amp; believed by others, that he doth inculcate it twice in this one vers. <hi>That he might gather together all things in Christ,</hi> and again <hi>even in Him.</hi>

doctrine, first, to the Jews, and next to the Gentiles: and hereby he doth yet further, and thirdly, inforce the fore-mentioned scope, while he sheweth in effect, that the prerogative of the Jews above the Gentiles made not grace the lesse free to them, and that nothing which the Gentiles could pretend to beyond the Jews, made it lesse free to them either And, first, he applyeth it unto the Jews, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> was one; and therefore he speaketh of them in the first person, <hi>We.</hi> And, first, he sheweth, that they, to wit, Believers among them (as is explained, ver. -12.) had, in Christ and by vertue of His merit and intercession, obtained an inheritance, to wit, of Heaven and Glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. and by consequence, all the fore-mentioned blessings which lead to it; and this not from their own merit or free choice, but freely, and as it were by lot, wherein least of man is seen: for, the word signifieth, <hi>to obtain an inheritance by lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, he sheweth the reason why they had obtained this inheritance, not their own worth; but because God had predestinated them to it in His unchangeable decree of Election: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all doth clear, that God did call them freely and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to His purpose to the enjoying of this inheritance, because He worketh all things according to his most wise and free purpose, and therefore this also, ver. 11. And, thirdly, he expresseth the end which the Lord proposed to Himself in calling them to enjoy this inheritance, even that thereby His glorious Attributes, manifested in that work might be acknowledged and praised, especially by them whom He had called; whom he describeth from this, that they were the first who trusted or hoped in Christ: for, as the Gospel was first preached among the Jews, <hi>Mat. 10. 6. Act.</hi> 13. 46. so, many among them did imbrace the Gospel, and were converted by it at the first, and before there were any considerable number of Converts among the Gentiles, ver. 12.</p>

As Believers are God's portion and part of the world, even the lot of His inheritance; so they do obtain from Him a lot and share in an inheritance incorruptible and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in Heaven for them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. for, the word, rendred <hi>we have obtained an inheritance,</hi> may either signifie, that they were taken for a lot and inheritance passively, or that they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a lot and inheritance actively. 3. Every Believer hath already obtained this glorious, excellent and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance, though not in personal compleat pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. yet, by right <hi>(Joh.</hi> 3. 16.) in begun possession <hi>(Joh.</hi> 17. 2, 3.) and by compleat possession in their head Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 6. for, the Apostle speaketh in the by past time, <hi>We have obtained an inheritance.</hi> 4.

Jesus Christ the Mediator is that person, in whom Believers have this heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance: as they have all their other spiritual blessings leading to heaven in Him; so also heaven it self, He hath purchased it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 12.

by faith, when it is offered in the promise, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 32. we must be in Him before we get a right to it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore He is the way to heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6. He hath taken possession of heaven in our name, as our Atturney, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 2, 3. for, saith he, <hi>In whom,</hi> which relateth to Christ, <hi>we have obtained an inheritance.</hi> 6. Those, who seem the worthiest people of any other, do come to heaven no other way than the most unworthy, that is, freely, and as it were by lot: for, he saith, <hi>We also,</hi> that is, even we Jews, who might seem to have somewhat whereon to rely in our selves, <hi>have obtained an inheritance freely.</hi> 7. As none come to heaven, but such as are from eternity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated to it by God; So all those things, whether they be mercies, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 50. 20.) or crosses, <hi>(Amos.</hi> 3. -6.) which come as it were by chance to us, or without our foresight, are well foreseen, and wisely ordered by God: for, he mentioneth Predestination, and God's purpose to bestow this inheritance, which came to them, as it were by lot, and without their foresight; <hi>We have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose.</hi> 8. The providence of God is extended to all things whatsomever, neither is there any thing which falleth not under His efficacious working: He not only gave a being unto all things created at the beginning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 1. but doth continue them in their being, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. and concurreth with all the second causes in their working, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 28. yet so, as God is not the author of sin: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, though the real action, to which sin adhereth, be from God, <hi>Joh</hi> 1. -21. yet, the deformity of that action, in so far as it is a transgression of the Law, seing it is not a real being, but a deficiency from being; no real effect, but a defect, Therefore it is not from God, but from the sinner only: for, saith he, speaking of God, <hi>Who worketh all things:</hi> which cannot be restricted to the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned blessings, but must be extended to all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, seing it is clear the Apostle doth argue from the general to the particular, <hi>He worketh all things</hi> so, and therefore those things also. 9. As God is an absolute


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44180:186"/>
worker, soveraign Lord of all His actions, and bound to give a reason unto none for what He doth, His will being His only rule by which He worketh; So His will is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes joyned with, and founded upon the light of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and wisdom; and therefore He can will nothing but what is equitable and just: for, the Apostle holdeth forth those two principles, from which God's working doth flow, infinit wisdom, pointed at in the word <hi>counsel,</hi> and absolute freedom and soveraignity over His actions, pointed at in the word <hi>will; Who worketh all things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the counsel of his will.</hi> 10. As God doth in time work all things; so from all eternity, by the most wise and holy counsel of his will, He hath ordained whatever cometh to passe: Yet so, as violence is not thereby offered to the will of the creatures, nor the liberty of second cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, especially of the wills of men and Angels, taken away, but rather established, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 23. and 4. 27, 28. for, saith he, <hi>Who worketh all things according to the counsel of his will,</hi> that is, as He hath most wisely and freely decreed. 11. Though counsel and advice be ascribed to God in his decrees and works, in so far as there is nothing wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or wrought by Him, but what is well, wisely and most righteously done; yet, we would advert, lest we attribute to God upon this ground any thing savouring of imperfection, as if He did consult or deliberate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning things to be done, as men do from ignorance, or doubtfulnesse of what is most convenient, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do, first, consult and advise about the best expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and then make choice accordingly; There is no such doubtfull inquisition, or previous deliberation in God in order to his working; His will alone is in stead of all counsel and deliberation, seing his most holy will hath all equity, wisdom and righteousnesse joyned with it, so that there is nothing more required to make an action be well, wisely and advisedly done, than that it be willed of God: for, the Apostle saith not, <hi>He worketh all things according to the will of his counsel,</hi> as if counsel and deliberation went before, and the choice of the will


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44180:187"/>
followed after; but, <hi>after the counsel of his will,</hi> shewing, that His willing of a thing to be done, is in place of all further consultation about it.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 12. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As God's giving grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gracelesse sinners, His drawing them out of nature to the state of grace, and bestowing the heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance upon them, is a work which setteth forth the glory of God's most excellent Attributes, of mercy, goodnesse, justice, power and beneficence, and giveth occasions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beholders to set forth his praise in all those, though the man himself upon whom this work is wrought, were silent, the very work should speak for it self; So it is the duty of those especially, whom God hath so dealt with, to take occasion from his gracious work in them to set forth the praises of Him, who hath called them out of darknesse to his marvellous light, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. -9. They are not alwayes to dwell upon complaints of themselves, but sometimes would mount up in the high thoughts of His commendation and praises: for, this is the end de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by God in calling them to obtain this inheritance, even <hi>that we should be to the praise of his glory:</hi> which words may be taken both passively, the praise of His glory was to be manifested in them, and actively they themselves were to set forth His praises. 2. The more early a man doth close with Christ and imbrace Him by faith, as He is offered in the Gospel, the lesse he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and delay his so doing, the more of praise to God's glorious Attributes is manifested in him, and the more of obligation doth ly upon him to set forth God's praises, who hath so early broken the yoke of his slavery to sin and Satan: for, their trusting, and first trusting in Christ before others, is spoken of as a mean conducing to His praise, and engaging them to it; <hi>That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.</hi> 3. That any do believe in Christ at all, and that some do believe in Him sooner, and others later, dependeth not upon any difference in the persons themselves, but upon God's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, counsel and good pleasure: for, their trusting,


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44180:187"/>
and first trusting before others, is subservient to the end, which was proposed by God, to wit, the praise of His glory. Now, the necessary means, and the end intended, do depend upon one and the same purpose, so that if God have decreed the end, He must also have decreed the means tending to that end; <hi>That we might be to his praise, who first trusted in Christ.</hi> 4. The Gospel, when it is preached to a People, though never so godlesse and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, will not want its own saving fruits among some of those to whom it is preached: God useth not to send His Gospel unto a People of purpose to harden all, and to make them inexcusable; but because there are some belonging unto the election of grace, who are to be converted by it: for, as the Gospel was to be preached first to the Jews, because of the promise made to the fathers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8. So when it was preached it wanted not fruits among them, though they were a People to be cast off, enemies unto all good, had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the Lord Jesus, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 15, 16. for, they were of those Jews <hi>who first trusted in Christ.</hi> 5. It is no small priviledge for any, wether person or people, to be trusters in Christ, before others, it is a matter of their commendation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. -5. it glorifieth God, in so far, as their example and experience may prove an encouraging motive unto others, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth with it several advantages: for, the sooner a man doth close with Christ, he will get that work done the more easily, he is the sooner freed from slavery to Satan and his own lusts, he is the sooner capacitated to do the more service to God, and his great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments are the sooner out of hazards: for, <hi>Paul</hi> maketh it a prerogative and priviledge, which the Jews had beyond the Gentiles, even <hi>that they first trusted</hi> or <hi>hoped in Christ.</hi>

                  <p>THe Aposte applyeth the former doctrine, in the second place, to the believing Gentiles in the person of those Ephesians, That hereby he may shew they were as much in the debt of God's free-grace for salvation, as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Jews. In order to which he holdeth forth, first, the benefit which they had received from Christ, even the same which he shew was bestowed upon the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jews, to wit, the heavenly inheritance, and all those other spiritual blessings which lead to it: for, as it is necessary that some word be added to the beginning of this verse for making good sense; so it seemeth the word, <hi>trusted,</hi> taken from the close of ver. 12. cannot be it: for, the word rendred there, <hi>first trusted,</hi> is but one in the Original, and cannot be applyed unto the Gentiles, as not being the first who trusted in Christ; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is safer, and more apposit also unto the Apostle's scope to repeat that word (which is <hi>v. 11.) have obtained an inheritance,</hi> especially seing he is applying here to the Gentiles, what he had applyed there to the Jews; the principal part whereof, and that upon which all the rest spoken of there doth depend, is their obtaining an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. Secondly, he setteth forth the mean whereby they obtained this excellent benefit, even their hearing of the doctrine of the Gospel, which he describeth from its excellent nature, as being the <hi>Word of Truth,</hi> and from that great good which it revealeth and offereth, even <hi>sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Thirdly, he mentioneth a work of God's holy Spirit upon their hearts after they had believed, which is here called <hi>sealing,</hi> by a metaphor taken from the use of

Seals and Signets among men, which are chiefly used for putting a difference betwixt true Writs, and those which are counterfeit; so that this work here called <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> did serve to evidence the truth and reality of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which might otherwise have been questioned, and particularly, with relation to the Apostle's present scope, it did serve to evidence the reality of their right to the glorious inheritance, the truths of the Gospel, and the sincerity of their closing with, and believing of, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: now the work of God's Spirit, which maketh all this evident, and therefore hath the name of <hi>sealing,</hi> is mainly His renewing and sanctifying work, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally His carrying-on of that work, whereby He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printeth the image of Himself, which is holinesse <hi>(Eph.</hi> 4. 24.) upon Believers, as an impression of the draughts and lineaments of the Seal, are by sealing put upon the thing sealed; so, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. -19. the grace of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and departing from evil is called a Seal, though those other works of God's Spirit in Believers, whereby He giveth them sense of His presence, comfort and joy unspeakable flowing from it, and full assurance, may be looked upon as lesse principal parts of this Seal. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (ver. 14.) by the metaphor of an <hi>earnest,</hi> which is used among Merchants for ratifying of their bargains, he sheweth a use, for which the bestowing of the holy Spirit upon them, and His sealing of them by His sanctifying grace, did serve, even to be an earnest of the heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, the full possession whereof being delayed until the last day, God gave unto them His holy Spirit with His saving graces, as an earnest, or some small begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and a part of that glory which shall then be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; that hereby He might assure them of their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the whole in due season. Fifthly, he sheweth the date and time how long they were to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the earnest, even untill <hi>the redemption of the purchased possession,</hi> that is, untill the day of judgment, at which time those who are purchased by the bloud of Christ, and are His possession and peculiar people, shall


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44180:189"/>
obtain compleat redemption and full delivery from sin and misery; In which sense redemption is taken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. And sixthly, he sheweth the end which God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unto Himself in all this, even the same which he mentioned formerly, ver. 12- to wit, <hi>the praise of His Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the benefit which those Gentiles received, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what is marked upon the parallel place, ver. 11-) <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Though it was the prerogative of the Jews above the Gentiles that Christ was first preached unto them, and accordingly some of them did first trust in Him, (See ver. -12.) yet God hath made both Jew and Gentile equally to partake of all other things, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of those which concern salvation it self, as of the means and way of attaining to it: for, the same Christ, the same free-gifted inheritance through Christ, and the same Gospel which was bestowed upon the Jews, are also bestowed upon the believing Gentiles; <hi>In whom ye also have obtained an inheritance,</hi> saith he. 2. It is a thing highly observable, and much to be taken notice of, that the Gentiles, who were profane dogs, <hi>(Mat.</hi> 15. 26.) not a people, <hi>(Deut.</hi> 32. 21.) without God, (chap. 2. ver. -12.) should be set down at the childrens table, and have full accesse to free-grace and salvation, and all spiritual blessings tending to salvation equally with the Jews, who were God's only People, separated to Him above all People, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5. to whom did pertain the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Glory, Covenants, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. for, <hi>Paul</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not speak of this without an <hi>also,</hi> which is a note of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggeration, and heightneth the purpose, as a thing very observable; <hi>In whom ye also have obtained an inheritance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the mean whereby they attained this excellent benefit, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The hearing of the Gospel, which supposeth the publick preaching of it, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 10. 14.) is the ordinary mean whereby faith is wrought, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently a right is conveyed unto the heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, in so far as the Gospel so preached doth not only propound and make known to the understanding the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44180:189"/>
of saving faith, which was before hid; but the Lord also, at, or after the hearing of this Gospel preached, doth work the grace of faith in the hearts of the Elect, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 14. for, saith he, <hi>Ye obtained an inheritance, after that ye heard the Word of Truth, the Gospel.</hi> 2. The Gospel is the Word of Truth, not only because it containeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth, (for, so the whole Scripture is the Word of Truth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. -9-) but also the Truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel are most excellent Truths, as being most remote from ordinary knowledge, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 17. most profitable to lost sinners, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11. and do manifest the praise of God's glorious Attributes <hi>(Luke</hi> 2. 14.) more than any other Truths: besides, the Gospel doth clearly hold forth the truth and substance of all these dark and legal shadows, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 17. for, by <hi>the Word of Truth</hi> he meaneth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, as he presently cleareth; <hi>After ye heard the Word of Truth, the Gospel of your salvation.</hi> 3. As the doctrine of Salvation is the doctrine of the Gospel, or glad-ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings to lost sinners; (for, the word rendred <hi>Gospel,</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a glad, or good message) So the doctrine of the Gospel is a doctrine of Salvation, as not only revealing Salvation, and a possible way for attaining to it, which the Law doth not, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 21. but also being the power of God to Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16-. and the mean which God doth blesse for making us imbrace by faith the offer of Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15. and for working all other saving graces in the Elect, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 6. for, the Apostle calleth this doctrine <hi>the Gospel,</hi> or glad tydings, <hi>of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 4. It is not sufficient to know that the Gospel is a doctrine of Salvation in general, or unto others only; but every one would labour, by the due application of the promises of the Gospel unto themselves, to find it a doctrine of Salvation to them in particular: for, <hi>Paul</hi> hinteth at so much, while he saith, not simply, <hi>the Gospel of Salvation,</hi> but <hi>of your Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the Spirit's work of <hi>sealing</hi> following upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As the Gospel preached, and heard, doth not profit unto Salvation, except it be believed; so


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44180:190"/>
the Truths of the Gospel, and Jesus Christ that good thing offered in those Truths, is that in the whole Word of God which saving faith doth chiefly close with, and rely upon, and is fully satisfied with: It findeth death in threatnings, a burden of work in precepts, but in Christ and the Gospel it findeth the way to Heaven made pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, even a way how the sinner may be saved and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine justice not wronged: for, the Apostle, having spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before of their hearing the Gospel, doth adde, <hi>In whom,</hi> to wit, Christ; the words may also read, <hi>In which,</hi> to wit, the Gospel, <hi>ye believed.</hi> 2. Though none can actually believe before the Spirit of God come to dwell in them, bringing alongs His royal train of habituall graces, and the habit of faith amongst the rest, unto the heart with Him; And therefore is He called the Spirit of Faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13-. yet, upon the actual exercising of the grace of Faith, the Spirit of God doth more fully manifest Himself to be dwelling in Believers, by His carrying-on the work of sanctification in them, for their greater comfort, and further strengthning of their faith: for, saith he, <hi>After ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit.</hi> 3. Whoever have rightly closed with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and Christ in the Gospel, by believing, will have the grace of sanctification and holinesse of life following upon their so doing, as also sometimes some measure of joy, peace and, sensible comfort: for, as I cleared, by the <hi>seal</hi> is meaned those graces; And <hi>after ye believed, ye were sealed,</hi> saith he. 4. Even real Believers have need of confirmation and sealing, as being oftimes exercised and tossed with several doubts and scruples, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth of the Gospel, and promise in general, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 24. and the reality of their own closing with, and interest in the Promise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 88. 14. for, therefore is it, that after those Ephesians had believed they were sealed, hereby to evidence the truth of the Gospel, and the sincerity of their believing the Gospel; <hi>After ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ye were sealed.</hi> 5. The Lord hath provided, and accordingly doth bestow sufficient means upon Believers


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44180:190"/>
whereby all their fore-mentioned doubts may be solved, and they abundantly satisfied; for, besides the writing of the Promise upon their hearts, and the outward seals of the Covenant of Grace, or Sacraments, which are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly dispensed by Christ's Ministers, there is an inward seal, to wit, the saving Graces of God's Spirit, together with growth and increase in those, imprinted by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God upon the hearts of Believers in order to their confirmation, although they sometimes cannot perfectly discern, nor exactly take up the draughts and lineaments of it; <hi>After ye believed, ye were sealed.</hi> 6. The saving graces of God's Spirit wrought in a Believer, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised by him in all sorts of holy duties, and especially growth in grace, is a most convincing evidence, not only that the Word of the Gospel, by which holinesse is wrought, is the undoubted Truth of God: for, this is the witnesse by water, spoken of, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 8. there being no other thing but the Truth of God able to produce such strange and supernatural effects as those; but also it serveth to evidence the reality of the man's interest in the promise, and of his right to the heavenly inheritance, in whom those saving graces and the fruits of holinesse are, seing holinesse of life is the inseparable effect of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith and interest in the promise, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 9. for, by the <hi>Seal</hi> is meaned mainly the graces of sanctification, and, as was shewn, they get that name: because, as Seals do confirm publick Writs, and make them appear to be authentick; so the saving and sanctifying graces of the Spirit do confirm to those, in whom they are, the Truth of the Gospel, and the sincerity of their faith in Christ; <hi>In whom after ye believed, ye were sealed.</hi> 7. Our doubts and scruples, whether concerning the truth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise in general, or our own particular interest in the Promise, ought not in reason make us suspend our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Christ and the Promise, untill we first be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and sanctified, and so receive sufficient confirmation; but on the contrary, we are, first, to set our Seal to God's Truth, by believing and venturing our salvation upon it,


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44180:191"/>
and then we may expect next to have God setting His Seal upon our heart in order to our confirmation: for, that is the order here set down; <hi>In whom after ye believed, ye were sealed.</hi> 8. The sanctifying of our natures, and adorning of our hearts with saving graces, together with any confirmation in the truth of the Promise, or of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular interest in the Promise which Believers receive from these, is the work of God's Spirit only: for, it is ascribed to Him here, and with relation thereto He is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the holy Spirit,</hi> not only because He is essentially holy, and very holinesse it self, but also the author of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and of all saving graces in Believers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. and <hi>the Spirit of promise,</hi> not only, because He was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to be abundantly poured-out upon Believers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Testament, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 16. but also His office is to seal and confirm by His gracious operations the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the Gospel to Believers, <hi>Rom. 8. 16. Ye were sealed,</hi> saith he, <hi>with the holy Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From that use, for which the holy Spirit with his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving graces was bestowed upon them, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As the Spirit of God is a person subsisting, and not a created gift or grace; so this holy Spirit doth not only bestow His gifts and graces upon Believers, but also cometh Himself unto them, and dwelleth in them: In so far, as though He be not personally united with them, as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature is with the humane in Christ; yet He is not only with them in his essence and being, as He is present every-where, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 24. nor yet in respect of His work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a general providence only, as He is present even with wicked men; for, in Him they live, move and have their being, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 28. but He resideth in them, as in his own Temple by his special and saving opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby He not only bestoweth upon them the habits of all saving graces at their first conversion, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 25, 26. but doth also by his immediate, strong and special influence daily preserve those graces in life, <hi>(Joh.</hi> 10. 28, 29.) actuate them, <hi>(Philip.</hi> 2. 13.) and ordinarily maketh them to grow, <hi>(Hos.</hi> 14. 5.) for, whereas the

word <hi>Spirit</hi> in the former verse is in the neuter gender<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he repeats it here by a masculine relative (which would be better rendred <hi>who</hi> than <hi>which)</hi> to shew that the Spirit is a person subsisting: <hi>Which Spirit,</hi> he saith, <hi>is given us for an earnest of our inheritance.</hi> 2. Heaven and glory is the only portion and inheritance of Believers; all their enjoyments earthly, though never so great, being but mean, fading in themselves, and lyable to spoyling and vastation from others, so that this inheritance, which is incorruptible, fadeth not away, and is reserved in the heavens (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.) is only worthy to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as their inheritance: for, the Apostle calleth it <hi>our inheritance,</hi> by way of excellency; <hi>Which is the earnest of our inheritance.</hi> 3. As the right unto this inheritance is made-over unto Believers, upon their resigning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to God by faith, in way of covenant and paction, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 3. So the Lord hath thought it convenient not to give them the possession of it presently upon their right, but to delay it for a season, that in the mean time they may exercise their hope in longing after it, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 23. And God may get glory from the heirs of heaven here upon earth, and among earthly men, by being the means of salvation unto some, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 16. and of conviction and just condemnation unto others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. for, the metaphor of an <hi>earnest,</hi> used among Merchants, when the sum covenanted is not presently given, doth bear so much; <hi>Who is the earnest of our inheritance.</hi> 4. As even Believers are apt to doubt, if ever the covenanted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance shall be bestowed and actually enjoyed by them; So the Lord is most willing to do all which in reason can be required, for removing all doubts of that kind; and more particularly He giveth them an earnest, or a part of this covenanted inheritance in hand, to assure them of his purpose to bestow the whole in due time: for, the metaphor of an <hi>earnest</hi> doth bear this also, the end of giving an earnest being to assure the receiver of the giver's honest purpose to perform all that he hath promised, which otherwise might be called in question;


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44180:192"/>
                     <hi>Who is the earnest of our inheritance.</hi> 5. The Spirit of the Lord sealing Believers, and those saving graces of the Spirit, which he worketh in sealing, do serve for the same uses in relation to the Covenant of Grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in heaven and glory is promised to Believers, for which an earnest doth serve in a civil bargain: for, as the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest is a part of the sum, and usually but a small part, and yet may assure the receiver of his obtaining the whole; So the Spirit and His work of grace received here, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun glory, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. and though but a small part of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12, 13. yet the smallest measure of grace may assure the man who hath it, of his obtaining the full pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of glory in the day of the Lord Jesus, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 6. hence the Apostle calleth the Spirit with his graces <hi>this earnest; Who is the earnest of our inheritance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the time how long the use of this earnest was to continue, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As real Believers are Christs posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in whom He dwelleth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. and whom He manureth and maketh fruitfull, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. -2. So He hath purchased them, to wit, by paying a price to provoked justice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. and by force from Satan their old possessor and master, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. and purchased them for this end, that He might possesse them: for, speaking of Believers, he calleth them <hi>a purchased possession.</hi> 2. Though the redemption and delivery of Believers be already begun, and their bonds loosed in part, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. yet their compleat redemption is but to come, to wit, from sin at death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. -23. and from misery, not untill the last day; then, and not while then shall their bodies be raised up in glory, and their redemption be full and compleat, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. for, the Apostle speaketh of their redemption as of a thing yet to come; <hi>Untill the redemption of the purchased possession.</hi> 3. As this earnest, even the holy Spirit with His graces, being once given, cannot totally be lost; So, if this day of redemption were once come, there shall be no further use of an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest: the covenanted inheritance will then be fully pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, and consequently no place left for fears or doubts


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44180:192"/>
about the obtaining of it; for, he saith, the Spirit was to be an earnest untill the redemption, and so He must continue with them untill then, but was not to serve for an earnest any longer; <hi>Who is the earnest untill the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the purchased possession.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, in the second part of the Chapter, taking occasion from what he heard of those Ephesians, breaketh forth in thanksgiving and prayer to God for them, whereby he prosecuteth his main scope: in so far, as that by every sentence, and word almost, he doth breath forth the high esteem which he had of God's free grace in Christ, and thereby doth confirm their faith; besides that while he prayeth for their perseverance, and growth in the faith and knowledge of saving truths, he doth indirectly, at least, excite them to persevere and make progresse in the same.</p>
                  <p>And, first, having shewn the good report which was brought unto him of those spiritual graces, which were eminent in them (whereof he instanceth two, which are the sum and compend of all the rest, and doth illustrate them from their principal object, faith in Jesus Christ and love to all the Saints) ver. 15. he maketh known unto them what was his exercise upon their behalf, even that (being incited by the consideration of these spiritual blessings bestowed by God upon them, and mentioned, ver. 13, 14. and by the report which he had of them, ver. 15.) he made conscience to continue in the duties of thanksgiving and prayer to God for them, ver. 16.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 15. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is not sufficient that Christs Ministers do presse duties upon the Lords People,


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44180:193"/>
having convincedly cleared unto their consciences the equity which is in those duties; but they must also hold forth unto them a copie of that obedience, which they so much presse, by their own example and practice: for, so the Apostle, having abundantly cleared, ver. 13, 14. that the Lord's converting and sealing of those Ephesians did call upon them to praise the glory of His grace, he himself doth here put hand to this work; <hi>Wherefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>I cease not to give thanks for you.</hi> 2. It is a great encouragement to blesse the Lord, and to pray unto Him in behalf of those who are making conscience of these duties for themselves: for, while he saith, <hi>I also give thanks,</hi> he supposeth they were doing the like, and that he was encouraged from thence. 3. Grace is like a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oyntment, whose savour cannot be hid: the report of it, where it is in life, will spread, and make his name, who hath it, savoury unto such, as are truly gracious themselves: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> though at a great distance being now at <hi>Rome, heard of their faith in Jesus Christ,</hi> and <hi>love to all the Saints.</hi> 4. It is the duty of Christians to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reporting and speaking of the grace of God and good which is in others; providing it be wisely done, that is, first, sparingly, and so as not to place all our own Religion in speaking of the Religion of others. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, not rashly, or without such grounds in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whom we commend, as charity at least may rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thirdly, impartially, and not factiously crying up some, and decrying others, who are equally deserving, <hi>Jude</hi> -16. for, Paul's <hi>hearing of their faith and love,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, that some had reported to him of that good which was in them. 5. Even in the best Churches in those primitive times, who were most commended by the Apostles, every one had not faith, and so is it yet; All are not <hi>Israel</hi> who are of <hi>Israel, Rom.</hi> 9. 6. for, the word rendred <hi>their faith,</hi> in the Original, is, <hi>the faith which is among you;</hi> he could not say positively that all of them had faith, but faith was among them. 6. Saving faith is an excellent fruit of the Gospel preached among a


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44180:193"/>
People, without which the Word cannot profit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2. and by which we are united to Christ, and have right to all the spiritual blessings purchased by Christ, who is the chief object of faith, whom it doth apprehend, as He is offered in the Promise: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth mention their faith in Jesus Christ as an excellent praise-worthy fruit of the Gospel, for which he blesseth God; <hi>After I heard of your faith in Jesus Christ,</hi> saith he. 7. The grace of love to our neighbour, with the duties thereof flowing from love to God in the first place, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 12.) is an excellent praise-worthy fruit of the Gospel preached among a People, especially, when the Saints have most of this love as resembling God most. And when their love is laid forth upon Saints, as they are Saints, and for the reality or appearance of God in them, and not for other by-respects only, or mainly; and in a word, when it is extended unto all Saints: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth mention their love to the Saints and to all Saints, as another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent praise-worthy fruit of the Gospel, for which he blesseth God; <hi>After I heard of your love unto all the Saints.</hi> 8. As the graces of faith in Christ, and love to the Saints, are alwayes conjoyned, they being in a manner the two legs of a Christian, without any one whereof he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk, and the other is but dead and withered, <hi>I am.</hi> 2. 17. so faith in its exercise hath the precedency of love, faith being the fountain from which the streams of love do flow; in so far, as faith laying hold upon God's love in Christ, inflameth the heart with love to God; which love to God consisteth in keeping of His Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 3. and the chief of God's Commands, next unto love to Himself, is, that we love our brother, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 21. for, the Apostle here, as elsewhere, <hi>Col. 1. 4. 1 Thess.</hi> 1. 4. conjoyneth these two graces, and giveth faith the precedency; <hi>After I heard of your faith in Christ Jesus,</hi> and <hi>love to all the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From Vers. 16. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As the duties, both of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and prayer, ought to be made conscience of by Christians; so the practice of these two duties do well

together: for, each of them doth contribute for the help of another; in so far, as thanksgiving to God for favours received, doth notably tend to suppresse that fretting, quarrelling, impatient humour, which often venteth it self against God in our prayers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 7. compared with 10, 11. and the exercise of prayer doth elevate the heart somewhat towards God, and so in some measure warm the affections with love to God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 1. and thus disposeth much for the duty of thanksgiving: for, the Apostle maketh conscience of both those duties, and that joyntly; <hi>I cease not to give thanks in my prayers.</hi> 2. It is not sufficient for Christians once to begin well, and break off fair in the practice of those duties; but they must continue in them; there being always abiding reasons both for thanksgiving and prayer; and, when there is a lazy falling off from the practice of them for a time, it is usually found a task of greater difficulty to begin of new, than it was at first: for, the Apostle saith, <hi>I cease not to give thanks in my prayers:</hi> he <hi>ceased not,</hi> to wit, so far as his other necessary imployments and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his calling did permit: for, what we do frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and alwayes when occasion offereth, we are said to do it without ceasing. 3. The Ministers of Jesus Christ especially, ought not to be puffed up with any successe, which the Lord is pleased to give unto their labours, or sacrifice to their own drag or net, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 13. but would ascribe the praise thereof to God, who alone maketh His People to profit, <hi>Isa.</hi> 48. 17. for, <hi>Paul,</hi> hearing of their faith and love, <hi>ceased not to give thanks for them to God.</hi> 4. As it is the duty of one Christian to pray for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and especially of a Minister for his Flock; So our prayers for others will avail little, except we be daily making conscience of praying to God for our selves: for, saith <hi>Paul, I make mention of you in my prayers:</hi> he had his own ordinary prayers for himself, wherein he did remember them. 5.

                  <p>THe Apostle, in the second place, giveth a short sum of his prayer unto God for them. And, first, he descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth God the Father, unto whom he prayeth, to be <hi>the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> to wit, as Christ is man, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 10. as He is our Mediator, <hi>Psal.</hi> 40. 8. and with relation to that Covenant of Redemption betwixt God and Christ as mediator, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 13.

And lastly, He is the object of all glory, to whom all glory is due from the creatures, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 1. Secondly, he sheweth what he sought in prayer, even <hi>wisdom,</hi> or a further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of that wisdom and saving knowledge of divine mysteries, whereof the Spirit of God is the author, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ver. 8. together with a clearer insight in Scripture where those mysteries are revealed by the same Spirit. Which <hi>wisdom</hi> he sheweth, doth mainly consist in the saving, believing, and operative <hi>knowledge of Him,</hi> that is, of Jesus Christ, ver. 17. And having more clearly expressed what he meaneth by this Spirit of wisdom, even the removing of the natural blindnesse of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, and enduing them with a clear discerning in the things of God, ver. 17- he doth illustrate it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from those ends, for the attainment whereof he would have this wisdom bestowed, as shall be cleared afterwards. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The more painfull and laborious that others, whether Ministers, parents, friends


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44180:195"/>
or neighbours, are for bringing about our salvation and spiritual good, we ought to be so much the more excited to painfulnesse and diligence about the same thing our selves; else their pains will not only do us no good, but also much hurt, the Lord usually judicially plaguing the man, whom every one would have doing well, only himself will not: for, the Apostle sheweth that he prayed, and what he prayed for from God unto them, not to gain applause from them; (for that is condemned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 5.) but that he might excite them unto prayer for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to endeavour after those things which he sought; <hi>Making mention of you in my prayers, that God may give you, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Though we are not of necessity to stint our selves unto a set form of words in prayer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. yet, we would have set purposes condescended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a certain scope to aim at in prayer, so as we may be able to give an accompt of what we pray for, whether in behalf of our selves, or of others; otherwise we can neither expect, nor observe the return of our prayers: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> setting down the sum of his prayer, sheweth he took notice of those things which he prayed for; even <hi>that God may give unto you the Spirit of wisdom,</hi> saith he. 3. Our prayers would be directed unto God only, and neither to glorified Saints, who are ignorant of us, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 16. nor yet to the Angels, who (though they be near unto us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 10. yet) know not the secrets of hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 10. and so are unfit to receive our prayers; besides that there is no warrant in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for praying unto any such, but to God alone: hence the Apostle directeth his prayer unto God, Even, <hi>that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ may give unto you.</hi> 4. We ought to draw near to God, especially in the duties of prayer, whether for our selves or others, with confidence and reverence (the one not marring the other) and in order hereto we are so to conceive of God, and expresse such conceptions of ours concerning Him, as may most strengthen our faith in the expectation of what we seek, and may strike our hearts with reverence towards God,


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44180:195"/>
from whom we seek: for, those epithets which <hi>Paul</hi> giveth unto God, do tend to strengthen his faith, while he calleth Him <hi>the God of our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> and to breed deep reverence in his own heart towards God, while he calleth Him, <hi>the Father of glory,</hi> or <hi>glorious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> 5. That we may have accesse unto God with boldnesse through Christ in prayer, it is necessary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new that act of faith wherby we apply and appropriate Christ unto our selves, that so being made one with Christ <hi>(Eph.</hi> 3. 17.) we may be looked upon by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as clothed with His righteousness, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both our persons and imperfect prayers shall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of by God through Him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4. for, <hi>Paul,</hi> whose practice here is a directory for prayer, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Christ to himself as his own Christ; <hi>The God of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> 6. It is necessary also in order to the same end, that in closing with Christ we do not part or divide Him, but appropriate to our selves the fulnesse of all those perfections which are in Him; this being an evidence of the sincerity of our closing with Him, and no lesse than whole Christ being necessary to cover all those imperfections, to bear us up under all those discouragements, to help us under all those infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which we are incompassed with in our approaches to God: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth appropriate Christ to himself under such titles as hold forth His compleat fulnesse, to wit, <hi>of Lord,</hi> which implyeth His power and soveraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity over all things for the Believers good, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 9. 10, 11. Of <hi>Jesus,</hi> which signifieth a Saviour, and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth His great work and errand to the world to save sinners, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 21. And of <hi>Christ,</hi> which signifieth annointed, and so pointeth at His threefold Office unto which He was annointed and furnished in order to that work, <hi>Psal. 45. 7. The God of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> 7. As <hi>wisdom,</hi> or the saving knowledge of divine mysteries, is necessary unto a Christian; So, even those who are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called, and have a good measure of this grace already, ought not to sit down upon the measure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44180:196"/>
but would constantly aspire after more of it, as being yet ignorant of many things, and not sufficiently rooted in the knowledge of those things, which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready know, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. for, while <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth for a greater measure of wisdom unto those Ephesians, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom God had already abounded in all wisdom, ver. 8. he doth indirectly excite them to endeavour to grow in this grace; <hi>May give unto you the Spirit of wisdom.</hi> 8. The wisdom and knowledge which Christians are to seek after, is not at all that carnal wisdom, which is eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 15. nor yet chiefly that naturall wisdom, or knowledge of the hid mysteries of nature, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1. 17, 18. nor yet that wisdom or knowledge of divine mysteries, which is only a gift, and floweth from a common influence of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. -1-. but that whereof the Spirit of God by His special operation and influence is author and worker, and is more than a gift, even the grace of wisdom, which is not acquired by our own industry and pains only, nor yet puffeth up, neither is it weak and coldrife, not warming the heart with love to the thing known, as the gift of wisdom is: but this grace of wisdom cometh from above, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 17. by the use of other lawfull means, <hi>Prov. 2. 1, &amp;c.</hi> and must be sought from above, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 5. It humbleth the man who hath it, <hi>Job</hi> 42. 3, 5, 6. it is operative upon the heart, and worketh love unto the thing known, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 10. for, the Apostle prayeth, <hi>that God would give them the Spirit of wisdom,</hi> that is, whereof the Spirit of God is author by His spiritual grace. 9. Spiritual things, the object of this heavenly wisdom and knowledge, are not, for the most part, conclusions drawn from natures light; but are revealed and made known by the Spirit of God, to wit, either in an extraordinary, immediate way, without the help of humane means unto the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 5. or, in an ordinary and mediate way by the help of Scripture, and blessing of God upon the pains of publick Teachers, and such other means as He hath appointed for attaining to the mind of God revealed in


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44180:196"/>
Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 15, &amp;c.</hi> for, joyntly with the Spirit of wisdom he seeketh <hi>the Spirit of revelation,</hi> implying, that this wisdom cannot be had without revelation. 10. The sum of all saving wisdom, is, to know Christ, and what Scripture speaketh of Him as a compleat Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator; and so to know Him, as that we acknowledge Him; which speaketh somewhat more than our simple knowing of Him, even a knowing of Him as our own, and with special application to our selves, and so, as we give due honour, respect and reverence unto Him: for, though we are said to know even strangers, and those whom we contemn and despise; yet we are not in strict phrase of speech said to acknowledge any, but these of near relations, or whom we prosecute with that respect and honour which is due unto them, as the servant is said to acknowledge his master. Now, <hi>Paul</hi> giveth this as the sum and compend of saving wisdom, while he saith, <hi>In the knowledge of Him,</hi> to wit, of Christ, or, <hi>in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of Him,</hi> as it is in the Original. 11. It is not sufficient for attaining this grace of wisdom, or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving knowledge of divine truths, that those truths be plainly revealed by the Spirit of God in Scripture; there must be also a removal of that natural darknesse and blindnesse which is in our understandings, whereby we may be enabled to take up that which is revealed, even as to the beholding of colours by the outward sense, there must not only be an outward light to make the object conspicuous, but also the faculty of seeing in the eye: a blind man cannot see at noon-day, nor yet the sharpest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted at midnight. Thus for the taking up of things heavenly, the Apostle prayeth both for a <hi>Spirit of revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to make those truths conspicuous, and for a new power of discerning in the understanding, that they might be able to take up the truth so revealed: <hi>The eyes of your understanding being enlightened.</hi> 12. The natural faculties of the soul are not destroyed in conversion, so as if from that time forward the renewed man did nothing, and the Spirit of God residing in him did all things: no,


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44180:197"/>
they are only renewed by the implanting of new graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habits and dispositions in them, so that our wit, will and affections being renewed, quickened and wrought upon by the Spirit of God, do also themselves work, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. -12. for, <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth not that their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing might be destroyed but enlightened; <hi>The eyes of your understanding being enlightened.</hi>

                  <p>HEre is one of those ends, for attaining whereof, the Apostle would have this wisdom bestowed upon them, even that they might know those good things, which they were to partake of in Heaven: which are, first, summarly propounded under the name of <hi>hope,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken here for the object of hope, or things hoped-for, as <hi>Rom. 8. -24-.

Doct.</hi> 1. As effectuall inward calling, whereby we are made a willing people in the day of God's power <hi>(Psal.</hi> 110. 3.) is only Christ's work by His Spirit upon the hearts of the Elect, making them to give hearty obedience to the outward call by the mouth of His Ministers; So by this work he openeth unto them a large door of hope, and calleth them, who were before without hope, to partake of an excellent and glorious inheritance, which is here called <hi>hope,</hi> or the thing hoped-for, and the <hi>hope of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> they being called to the enjoyment of it, which calling is also called <hi>His,</hi> to wit, God's, or Christ's, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is His work; <hi>What is the hope of His calling.</hi>

2. Though those who are effectually called, do receive some part of that happinesse, unto which they are called, presently, and in hand, to wit, those excellent benefits of justification, adoption and sanctification, and such others as do either accompany, or flow from those in this life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. yet, the great and chief part of it is not given then in present possession, but reserved in the heavens for them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. so that they have it only in hope: for, therefore is it called <hi>the hope of their calling,</hi> a thing only hoped-for. 3. Though those excellent things, which are not yet possessed, but only hoped-for by Believers, are known in part and in general, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. -2. even so far, as the knowledge which we have of them is sufficient to terminate our hope; (otherwise if they were wholly unknown they could not be hoped-for) yet so excellent are those things in themselves, and therefore remote from our knowledge, and so much are we taken up with trifles and childish toyes, that even true Believers, and they who know most, and have their thoughts most exercised about them, are in a great part ignorant of them: they neither know them fully, nor particularly, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 4. So that heaven and glory will be found another kind of thing, than ever entred in the heart of man to think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or look after, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 9. for, he prayeth, that even the called Ephesians <hi>might know what is the hope of His calling,</hi> implying that they were yet in a great part ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it. 4. That measure of knowledge which may be attained here of those excellent things hoped-for, should be carefully endeavoured and diligently sought after by Believers, as being of great concernment to make them seek after these things being so known, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 14. to sweeten the bitternesse of their crosse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them with matter for sweet meditation upon heaven and things heavenly, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 20. and to make them more vehemently long and desire after the actual posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those things, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 23. for, <hi>Paul's</hi> praying for wisdom, that they <hi>may know the hope of His calling,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth, that much more themselves ought to seek after


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44180:198"/>
the knowledge of it. 5. As those excellent things which are now hoped-for, and really to be enjoyed in the other life, are of the nature of an inheritance, which is not purchased by us, but freely bestowed upon us; so they are properly Christ's inheritance, who hath proper right to it, as being the natural Son of God, and by vertue of His own purchase; but the right which we have is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us through Him, In whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the adoption of children, and so are made heirs and co-heirs with Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. for, the Apostle, explaining what those things hoped-for are, calleth them an inhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

It is also a glorious inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, there being nothing there but what is glorious: The sight shall be glorious; for, we shall see God, as we are seen, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. the place shall be glorious, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4. the company glorious, all the glorified Saints and Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23. our souls and bodies shall be glorious, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 21. and our daily exercise shall be glorious, even to give glory unto God for ever and ever, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. 9, 10. for, therefore it is called <hi>the glory of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi> or, <hi>his glorious inheritance.</hi> 8. Though sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and holinesse do not merit this heavenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, seing it cometh to us freely, and as it were by lot; (as the word signifieth) yet none have present right to it, nor yet shall have possession of it afterwards, but only the Saints, even they who are renewed and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently holy: Without holinesse none shall see God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. -14. for, he saith, <hi>it is an inheritance in the Saints,</hi> that is, whereof only Saints are possessors. 9.

The power which God exerces in converting and carrying-on the work of grace to glory in the Elect, is not only great, but exceedeth all contrary power which might impede that work; so, that there is no power in the devil, the world, in sin, nor death, which this power doth not overcome; yea, nor any impotency in the Elect themselves, which this greatnesse of power will not help and strengthen: for, he calleth it <hi>the exceeding greatnesse of His power.</hi> 4.

Those only are most fit to speak of God's powerful and gracious working in hearts, who have found somewhat of that work in themselves: such will speak both more confidently, and more throughly of this work, there being somewhat of God's work in hearts, which cannot be so fully attained by meer reading or hearing, except experience serve as a commentary to understand what is read and heard, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 8. for, therefore, saith he, not, <hi>towards those</hi> who believe, but <hi>Us who believe,</hi> including himself, to shew he spoke of this power, not as a stranger to it, but from experience, that they might believe him the rather. 7. This mighty power of God in its working towards Believers, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended unto all times, without restriction unto any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of time, either by-past, present, or to come: It hath wrought in their first conversion, and bringing them to believing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. it doth work by preserving them in the state of grace, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 32. by actuating their graces in them, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 13. and making them to grow, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16. and shall continue with them alwaies working until their graces be perfected, and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly glorified, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 6. for, he expresseth no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of time wherein it worketh, only that it doth work; <hi>And what is the exceeding greatnesse of His power to us-ward who believe.</hi> 8. God's omnipotent and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious power, which belongeth unto Him naturally and essentially as He is God, is not only the fountain and principle from whence His powerfull operation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Believers doth flow, but also the rule according to which He doth work; so that He is not only omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, who worketh, but also He worketh omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently,


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44180:200"/>
and therefore irresistibly: for, saith he, <hi>The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of His power to us-ward who believe,</hi> is, <hi>according to the working of his mighty power.</hi> 9. Even those who are Believers, in whom this mighty power hath already wrought, may be in a great measure ignorant of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatnesse of it: they are destitute even of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional knowledge of it in a great part, because of the mysteriousnesse of the subject, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. and their little acquaintance with the Word, which revealeth the way of God's working in souls, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. and 88. but chiefly of experimental knowledge; there being much to be wrought in them by His mighty power, whereof they can have no experience as yet, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 21. there being much also already wrought in them, and they know it not, but doubt of it, <hi>Job</hi> 9. 11. for, though it be a mighty working power; yet it hath a meek, sweet, <hi>(Phal.</hi> 110. 3.) secret, <hi>(Cant.</hi> 5. 4.) and therefore a not easie discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable work; Thus those believing Ephesians were in a great part ignorant of this power, else to what purpose did the Apostle pray that <hi>they might know what is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greatnesse of his power?</hi> 10. The experimentall knowledge chiefly of God's way of working in, and towards Believers, is to be carefully sought after, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great concernment to make us thankfull to God for His gracious working in us where it is known and felt, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 8, 9, &amp;c. as also in order to our own comfort arising from that our knowledge, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 7. and to strengthen our faith and hope in God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 4. for, while <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth for the knowledge of this mighty working power to them, he teacheth them to seek after this knowledge themselves; <hi>That ye may know what is the exceeding greatnesse of his power.</hi> 11. This experimental knowledge of God's power, is an eminent part of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wisdom, and of our knowing and acknowledging of Christ aright: for, he prayeth, that <hi>they may know what is the exceeding greatnesse of his power,</hi> as one end or part of that spiritual wisdom, which consisteth in the knowledge or acknowledgment of Him, spoken of, ver. -17.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle, in the third branch of this second part of the Chapter, taking occasion from what he spoke of the exceeding greatnesse of God's power in Believers, ver. 19. falleth out upon a commendation, and more large explication of that mighty power, taken from one of its admirable effects towards Christ, in exalting Him from His low condition, whereby he doth yet prosecute his main scope; for, what greater confirmation could be given unto their faith in Christ, than the making known unto them, how highly exalted Christ is, and that the same divine power, which exalted Him, had wrought, was working, and would continue to work in them, untill all those glorious things, which they had now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in hope, should be actually bestowed upon them? And, first, that he may commend and clear that mighty Power, according to which God did work in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Ephesians, he doth briefly propound two things, which were wrought by it towards the exaltation of Christ; first His resurrection from the dead; Secondly, His being set at the right hand of God in heavenly places, whereby is set forth that high glory and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which after Christ's resurrection and ascension was put upon Christ, as God-man, far surpassing the glory of all things created, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 9. together with that high power and authority, which the same Christ God-man hath obtained over all things to dispose of them for the Churches good, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 22. which glory and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Christ is only visible in the Heavens, and therfore it is said to be <hi>in heavenly places;</hi> because Christ's humane nature, through which His Deity doth shine and manifest it self, is only in Heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the effects of this His power and authority may be and are perceived elsewhere, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 33. And that


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44180:201"/>
this is intended to be held forth by Christ's sitting at the Father's right hand, is clear, not only from the places presently cited, and the Apostle's own explication, which he subjoyneth in the verses following, but also from the phrase it self, which cannot be proper; seing God hath neither right nor left hand properly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24. and so must be a metaphor borrowed from Kings and Princes, who do set those at their right hand, whom they highly honour, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 19. or, place in any office of chief authority and trust, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 21. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As our Lord Jesus was once among the dead; So He did rise again from death, (See upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. ver. 1. doct. 7.) for, saith he, <hi>When He raised Him from the dead.</hi> 2. The raising of Christ from the dead, as it was the Father's work; So, considering what an eminent person Christ was, and how low He was brought, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8. and what a height of honour He was exalted unto, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> 2. 9. 10. and that He did sustain our person in dying (the iniquities of us all being laid upon Him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 6.) and in rising again from death, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 5, 6. All those, I say, being considered, this work of raising Christ, was an effect of God's extraordinary and mighty power: for, as he ascribeth the raising of Christ to the Father, which doth not contradict those Scriptures which affirm Christ to have risen by His own power, <hi>John.</hi> 2. 19. and 10. 17. because it is one and the same power which is in both Father and Son, they being one only God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7. So he doth ascribe it to the working of His mighty power, spoken of, vers. -19. and related unto in this, while he saith, <hi>Which,</hi> or <hi>according to which He wrought in Christ, when He raised Him from the dead.</hi> 3. The self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same omnipotent power, which wrought in, and towards Christ's exaltation in all the steps of it, is engaged for working grace, and carrying-on the work of grace in Believers, and for performing unto Believers whatever they have ground to hope-for from His Word: and therefore we may look upon the severall effects and proofs of this power towards Christ, as so many pledges,


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44180:201"/>
that God will against all opposition perform whatever He hath undertaken to us: for, He maketh that power, whereby He worketh in Believers, and whereby He rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Christ from the dead, to flow from one and the same fountain and principle in God, and the one to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the other, while he saith, <hi>According to the working of His mighty power, which He wrought in Christ.</hi> 4. This high honour and soveraign power, signified by sitting at the Father's right hand, was put upon Christ, not before, but after His humiliation and resurrection from the dead; for, then in His humane nature He did receive dominion and honour, which He never had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till then, as man; and, though being considered as God, cloathed only with His own divine Majestie, He was from all eternity equal in power and glory with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and holy Ghost, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 6. yet He did not reign as God incarnate, and cloathed with our flesh, untill then, having hid His divine glory, so that very little of it did appear under the infirmities of the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from His incarnation untill then, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 7, 8. but then He did manifest His divine glory, absolute power and authority in a way incomprehensible by us, in and through the vail of His glorified flesh: for, the Apostle sheweth those things were done in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, while he saith, <hi>When He raised Him from the dead, and set Him at His own right hand.</hi> 5. Although the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane nature in Christ are not confounded, but remain distinct both in their essence and operations, each nature doing that which is proper unto it self, <hi>Heb. 9. 14. 1 Pet.</hi> 3. 18. yet, so near and strict is that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall union of the two natures in Christ, that those things, which are proper only unto the one nature, are ascribed unto, and spoken of the whole person: for here, though this high honour and trust put upon Christ, was in some things verified only in the divine nature, in so far as it speaketh His manifestation of His divine glory and exercising His divine authority, as God incarnate, in, and through the humane nature: And though in some


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44180:202"/>
things it was verified only in the humane nature, in so far as it speaketh His obtaining of glory and power from the Father, which before He had not; yet, the whole of it is ascribed unto the whole person of Christ God-man, while he saith, <hi>And made Him to sit at His own right hand.</hi> 6. Though Christ as Mediator be exalted to such high honour and authority, as no meer creature is capable of; yet, so far is His humane nature from being made hereby omnipotent, omnipresent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently equal with God, That even whole Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as Mediator, is inferior and lesse than the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. -28. as having received all this honour and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18. and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating His Kingdom in the Father's Name, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22. which He is also to render up unto the Father, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. for, not only do the Scriptures cited, but also the phrase here used, prove so much, seing those whom the King setteth at his right hand do hold their dignity and trust from him, and must be comptable unto him; <hi>And set Him at His own right hand.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, in the second place, insisteth upon that second effect of God's mighty power, and explaineth what he meaned by the Father's setting of Christ at His own right hand, even, that which we formerly shewed, to wit, that transcendent glory and dignity, with full power and soveraignity which was put upon Him. And first, he speaketh of that general power and eminency, which He hath over and above all the creatures, by shewing that He is exalted in glory, not only above, but far above the glory of all creatures whatsoever, whether <hi>principality, power, might,</hi> or <hi>dominion,</hi> under which is comprehended every thing that is excellent among the


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44180:202"/>
creatures, whether in Heaven, Earth, or Hell; for, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times good Angels are expressed by those titles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 10. sometimes bad Angels, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. and sometimes Civil powers, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 1. And lest any might apprehend some dignity besides, not comprehended under any of these four, he addeth a general clause, comprising <hi>every name,</hi> that is, all things excellent or famous, and worthy to be so named; as famous men are called men of <hi>Name;</hi> So that he hereby sheweth no creature can enter in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with Christ in glory, dignity and worth: and withall he extendeth this glory put upon Christ in its duration, not only unto this world, but that which is to come, and shall never have an end, ver. 21. And that he may exalt Christ yet further, he sheweth, that He is not only above all creatures in glory, but also in dominion and soveraignity, the Father having placed all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in a state of lowest subjection unto Him, even <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der His feet,</hi> to be disposed of as He seeth fit.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 21. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The glory and splendor of things created hath some aptnesse in it, if it be not rightly looked on, or rather we are apt to take occasion from it to hide and undervalue the glory and excellency of Jesus Christ; for otherwise the Apostle would not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour so much to set Him high up above them, and His glory above theirs; <hi>Far above all principality and power.</hi> 2. Though Scripture give some ground to affirm, that there are different degrees and dignities among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 13. and 12. 1. yet, what are their different orders, offices and dignities, Scripture doth nowhere determine: neither is there any ground for us to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine from this place: for, as we shew, the Apostle's scope is under those titles, and the general clause sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, to lay aside, not only Angels, but all civil powers, and all created dignity whatsoever from competing with Christ in the point of power, excellency and worth; <hi>Far above all principality, and power, and might, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and every name that is named.</hi> 3. Even the humane nature of Christ, and His glorified body by vertue of


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44180:203"/>
that unspeakable union which is betwixt the two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Christ in one person, is lifted up so high in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the glory of Kings and Emperors, of Sun, Moon and Stars, of the souls of just men made perfect; yea, and of glorious Angels, is nothing to it, and lesse than the light of a candle being compared with the Sun in his brightnesse: for, he is speaking here of that glory, which Christ hath by sitting at the right hand of God, which, as to some pieces of it, doth belong to Christ, as man; and of it he affirmeth, that it is <hi>far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named.</hi> 4. As we do then only think aright of that high glory put upon Christ, when we look on it as match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and not only above, but far, and infinitly far above all that glory, which can be found in all, or any of the creatures; So the holding forth of Christ in his glory by the Lord's Servants, is a point of great concernment for the good of God's People, to make all created glory wax dim and bulklesse, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18. to draw their hearts up after and towards Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 10. to hearten them against those discouragements they usually meet with in doing service to Him, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 55, 56. and to make them more reverent in their approaches to Him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25. for therefore doth <hi>Paul</hi> so much labour as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well satisfie himself, in setting forth that high glory wherein Christ is, while he saith, <hi>He is above,</hi> and <hi>far above;</hi> and then enumerateth four comprehensive par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and addeth a general clause comprising all things, and preferreth Christ unto all; <hi>Far above all principality and power, &amp;c.</hi> 5. As there is a world to come, when this is gone, wherein shall dwell righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13.

                  <p>THe Apostle, having spoken of Christ's glory and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity in general over all the creatures, doth next hold forth His special dominion and soveraignity over the Church, by shewing, that Christ, <hi>over</hi> or <hi>above all,</hi> that is, in a special manner, is given by the Father to be the Churches head; which is a metaphor taken from the natural body, to which he compareth Christ and his Church. And, first, he sheweth that Christ doth answer to the head: which implyeth an eminency in Him above the Church, His Body <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. together with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and power over His Church to rule and govern her, both visibly by His own Officers, dispensing the Word and Censures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 4, and inwardly, by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full operation of his Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13. 14.

And it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth a strict union betwixt Him and His Church, as is betwixt the head and members in the natural body: the tye of which union, as to the Church visible (which is His visible, political and ministerial body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16, 17.) is the bond of the Covenant of Grace, wherein they are externally, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 5. together with a professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith in Christ, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. But as to the invisible Church of real Believers, they are as to the inward man, animated and enlivened with that same Spirit, which was poured-forth on Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. they have also faith in Him, and love to Him, wrought by His Spirit in them, <hi>Col. 1. 4. Eph.</hi> 6. 24. and hereby they are united most strictly to Him. And, lastly, the metaphor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth communication of influence from Christ to the Church, to wit, an influence of common gifts from His


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44180:204"/>
Spirit to the visible Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 7, &amp;c. and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of spirituall life, motion, and of saving grace to the invisible Church of Believers, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. even as the head is above, and ruleth the body, is of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the body, hath all the inward and outward senses with memory and understanding seated in it for guiding the body, is united to the body, and conveyeth influence for motion and sense unto the body. And, secondly, ver. 23. he sheweth that the Church answereth to the rest of the body under the head, and is called Christ's body, to wit, not His natural, but mystical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: which implyeth not only the Churches union with Christ, but union and order also among the members themselves, together with diversity of gifts and functions, as there are several members in the natural body. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. It implyeth also their receiving influence for life and motion from Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. and the duty of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and obedience due unto Him as head, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 24. He sheweth also the high honour which is put upon the Church by being Christ's body, even, that hereby they become Christ's fulnesse, not as if Believers did adde any personal perfection to Him, who is infinit in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, unto whom nothing can be added; Only, they are members of that mystical body, unto which He of grace hath undertaken the relation of head, so, that the Church is the fulnesse, not of personall, but of mystical Christ, as both head and members of that mystical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are comprehended under that name <hi>Christ.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. and therefore, lest any should think that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression did imply any want of perfection in Christ to be supplyed by the Church, the Apostle sheweth, that Christ, as God-man, Mediator, filleth the <hi>all</hi> of His body the Church (for, the purpose in hand requireth this <hi>all</hi> to be so astricted) upon whom He bestoweth a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, partly of gifts, and partly of graces, a fulnesse answerable to the present state of childhood and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, wherein we live here on earth; as the Romans are said to be full of goodnesse and knowledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44180:205"/>
14 So, that Christ is so far from borrowing any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection from His Church, that all her perfections are but drops falling from that Ocean and fulnesse of grace which is in Him, <hi>Joh. 1. 16. Doct.</hi> 1. As Jesus Christ is the Father's gift unto the Church; A gift which is offered unto all within the Church, <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 16. though not received by all, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 11. but by real Believers, who, by receiving Him, obtain a right unto Him, <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 36. with 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 11, 12. and to all those excellent saving priviledges, which were purchased by Him, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 12. So, whoever would receive this gift aright, must receive Him as their head, to quicken them, to rule them, and to be reverenced by them: for, <hi>He gave Him to be head to the Church.</hi> 2. The power and superiority, which Christ hath over His Church, chiefly, the invisible Church of reall Believers, as head, is of another kind than that which He hath over all other creatures besides, as being more intimate, amiable, and in a manner more native and natural, and accompanied with willing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in His Church, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3-. even as the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority which the King's head hath over his own body, or his royal consort, being compared with that which he hath over his subjects, or rather his subdued enemies: for, <hi>He gave Him to be head over all to the Church: Over all,</hi> that is, in a singular and eminent manner above the domination which He hath over all other creatures. 3. None in any sense can be an head to the Church, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom the Church in that same sense is not a body; so, that if the Church be not the Pope's body, the Pope cannot be the Churches head: for, there is a reciprocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the head and body in this purpose, as Christ is the Churches head, so the Church is His body; <hi>He gave Him to be head to the Church, which is His body.</hi> 4. None can draw comfort from those sweet relations of head, husband, king, &amp;c. which Christ hath taken upon Him towards His Church, but they who stand under a correspondent relation towards Him, as being His body, spouse, and subjects, and who make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44180:205"/>
of such duties as each of these relations do bind un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: for, as Christ is an head to the Church, so the Church is His body; <hi>Which is His body,</hi> saith he. 5. As Christ by taking upon Himself those relations towards His Church, which are found amongst men, doth stand obliged unto those duties, which men are bound to by vertue of such relations, <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. 1, &amp;c. So the Lord's People are allowed, and commanded to search unto the duties and priviledges following upon such relations among men, and from thence to learn what to expect from Christ by vertue of that relation, and what honour and priviledges they do enjoy by standing under that relation to Christ: for, from this, that Christ and the Church stand under the relation of head and body, the Apostle inferreth that the Church hath this priviledge of being Christ's fulnesse, even, as the shoulders, arms, breast, belly, legs, and thighes, are the fulnesse of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body, so that mystical Christ made up of head and members, is not compleat and full without the Church, or the least Believer in the Church; <hi>Which is His body, the fulnesse of Him,</hi> saith he. 6. In searching forth the grounds of these similitudes or relations, taken from amongst men, whereby Christ setteth forth to our capacity what He himself is to His People, we would carefully guard, lest by pressing them too far, we ascribe any thing to Christ which is not according to the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of Faith, or in any measure dishonourable to Him: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having stretched-forth that similitude of the head and body so far as to infer thence, that the Church is the fulnesse of mystical Christ, he carefully guardeth against a mistake, whereby people might think, that then some perfection were wanting in Christ to be supplyed by His Church, while he saith, that <hi>Christ filleth all in all.</hi> 7. As even Believers in themselves are empty creatures till they be filled, being destitute of all good which they may call their own, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. and unable to help themselves, if it were but with one right thought, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. So there is a supply to the full of all their empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44180:206"/>
in Christ, who is made of God unto them, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, righteousnesse, sanctification, and redemption, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 1. 30. and communicateth largely and to the full of His own fulnesse, unto such as are sensible of their own emptinesse, <hi>Joh. 1. 16. Psal.</hi> 81. -10. for, <hi>He filleth all in all.</hi> 8. Before that Christ do thus supply our emptiness out of His own fulness, He must first be in us, and united to us by faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. for, He is <hi>in all</hi> whom He filleth; <hi>He filleth all in all.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II.</head>
               <p>IN the first part of this Chapter, the Apostle doth commend the doctrine of salvation by free-grace, first, from the consideration of that misery, under which, not only the Ephesians and other Gentiles were before conversion; as being spiritually dead, ver. 1, following the corrupt custom of the world, and Satan's suggestions, v. 2. but even the Jews also, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved to their own corrupt lusts, v. 3. Secondly, from the consideration of that delivery from sin and misery, which was common to them both. And, first, he mentioneth the first fountain and internal impulsive cause of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, to wit, God's free-grace, ver. 4. Secondly, the several branches of it, as their quickning in the way of grace, ver. 5. the resurrection of their bodies, and their glorification in heaven, ver. 6. Thirdly, the final cause of this delivery, to wit, the manifesting of God's rich grace, ver. 7. And, fourthly, he cleareth, and proveth they were saved only by grace, by removing all other things inconsistent with grace from having influence upon our salvation: And that, first, generally, ver. 8. and then particularly, their good works: because, first, otherwise they should have had matter of gloriation in themselves, as to this purpose, the contrary whereof is intended by God, ver. 9. Secondly, power to do good

works was given them in regeneration; So that though they be necessary, yet they are not meritorious, ver. 10.</p>
               <p>In the second part of the Chapter, he maketh a more particular application of the former purpose unto the Ephesians, and in them to all the Gentiles. And, first, he layeth forth that misery, which was in a great part peculiar unto them, as they were Gentiles; and this both more generally, ver. 11. and more particularly in five several branches, ver. 12. Secondly, he declareth their present happy estate of nearness to God and His Church through Christ, briefly, ver. 13. and explaineth more fully that Christ was the peace-maker, and in order to His making peace had abolished the ceremonial Law, ver. 14, 15- and sheweth a twofold necessity of Christ's so doing, both for uniting of Jew and Gentile in one Church, ver. -15. And for reconciling both of them to God, ver. 16. Thirdly, he sheweth that this benefit of nearnesse was published, and actually communicated unto them by the preaching of the Gospel, ver. 17, which he proveth from the accesse which both Jew and Gentile had to God, ver. 18. And lastly, he concludeth from what is said, that the Ephesians were now in a blessed state, comparing the whole Church to a city, a family, ver. 19. and to a stately edifice founded upon Christ, ver. 20, 21. And shewing they were a part of this building, ver. 22.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle (being yet further, to establish those Ephesians in the doctrine of salvation by free grace in Christ, and for this end, to set forth the happinesse of that estate, in which free grace had placed them) sheweth the misery of their former estate before conversion, even that they were dead not naturally, but spiritually; there being nothing of that spiritual life in them which consisteth in the union of the soul with


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44180:207"/>
God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. and in a vertue and power of the soul, flowing from this union, to do those things which are spiritually good, and acceptable unto God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 5. even as the natural life consisteth in the union of the soul with the body, whereby the man is inabled to move, speak, and do such other actions as are competent to that life, so that their spiritual deadnesse doth speak a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from God, <hi>Psal</hi> 53. 3. and total inability to do any thing which is spiritually good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8 7. The efficient and formall cause of which death he sheweth to have been their <hi>sins and trespasses:</hi> whereby under two words used indifferently in Scripture to expresse one and the same thing, and both of them in the plural number, is set forth the multitude of sins under which they lay in this their dead condition, as their original sin, their actual sins, sins of omission, commission, and especially their manifold idolatries, which are chiefly pointed at, as those sins, wherein, not only the Ephesians, but the world in general did wallow before Christ came in the flesh, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 29, 30. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is not sufficient that the Servants of Jesus Christ do only preach privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and hold-forth unto Believers that happy estate unto which they are lifted-up through Christ; It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary also, that joyntly herewith, they be calling them to minde their wofull, miserable and lost estate by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that, the one being set foregainst the other, both may more clearly appear in their own colours, and that those dangerous rocks of growing vain because of what they now are (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.) and of turning discouraged and diffident, because of what they once were <hi>(Psal.</hi> 25. 7.) may be eschewed: for, the Apostle, in the preceeding chapter, having spoken much of those high priviledges unto which the Ephesians were advanced by Christ, he doth here minde them of that miserable state wherein God found them; <hi>And you who were dead in sins and trespasses.</hi> 2. There is nothing contributeth more to commend the doctrine of free grace to peoples consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and so to commend it, as to make them closely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here

Believers in Jesus Christ are not to look upon their lost and miserable estate by nature separately, and apart from, but joyntly with, God's free grace and mercy, which hath delivered them from that misery; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the thoughts of sin and misery may, if God should give way, swallow them up, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 4, 5. Hence is it the Apostle hath so contrived his discourse here, that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alongs, while he speaketh of their misery in the first three verses, the mind of the Reader is kept in suspense without coming to the perfect close of a sentence, untill God's mercy in their delivery from this misery be mentioned, ver. 5. for, the Original hath not these words, <hi>he hath quickened,</hi> in this verse: but the Translators have taken them from ver. 5. to make up the sense, without suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reader so long untill he should find them in their own proper place; <hi>And you who were dead, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Every man by nature, and before conversion, is dead, not <hi>to sin,</hi> (for that is proper to the Regenerate only. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 2. where the grammatical construction is the same in the Original with that which is here; only the sense is much different) but <hi>in sin,</hi> whereby he is wholly deprived of all ability and power to convert himself, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 16. or to do any thing which is spiritually good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. for, while he saith, the Ephesians were dead in sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God did quicken them, he speaketh of a thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44180:208"/>
to them with others, and therefore he reckoneth himself and the other believing Jews with them, ver. 3. <hi>And you who were dead in sins.</hi> 5. As the fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of this spiritual death was <hi>Adam's</hi> sin, in whom all have sinned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12. through the merit of whose sin imputed to us, we are deprived of original righteousness, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. and a perverse inclination unto all evil hath come in its place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. So every mans own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular actual sins do lay him lower under this state of death, and make his delivery from it more difficult, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. for, saith he, <hi>Ye were dead in sins and trespasses:</hi> under which are comprehended, as we shew, both their original and actual sins.</p>

                  <p>HE proveth they were thus dead in sins and trespasses from their walking in, and making a daily trade of sin, without striving against it, or any through remorse for it: which wofull walk of theirs he doth illustrate from two guides, which they followed, and by which they were carried-on, and incouraged in their sinfull course. The first was, the universal corrupt <hi>course</hi> and custom <hi>of the world</hi> (that is of wicked men in the world, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 14.) in all ages, which had become a Law for them to walk by; The second guide was Satan, who is here called a <hi>prince;</hi> not only, because there being a number of those unclean spirits, they are joyned as one politick body among themselves under one, who is as prince and head of the rest, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 24. and 25. 41. but also and mainly, because of that power which all the Devils, and chiefly their head and prince, have over wicked men in the world, <hi>Joh. 14. 30. 2 Cor.</hi> 4 4. even over the <hi>children of disobedience,</hi> which princely power of his, is described from the place, where by God's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

he doth exercise it, to wit, the region of the air; he doth exercise it also in the earth, and hell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. and therefore these must not be here excluded, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther included, as being below the region of the air. It is described also from the subjects of his kingdom, to wit, those, who are not only so obstinate in evil, that they cannot be perswaded by any means to relinquish it (as the word in the Original, rendred <hi>disobedience,</hi> implyeth) but also are judicially given over to disobedience, and fully under the power of it, which is expressed, while they are called <hi>children of disobedience,</hi> according to the custom of the holy language, whereby those, who are fully given over, and under the power of any vice, are said to be the children of that vice, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 4. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which obstinat sinners the Apostle affirmeth that the spirit of Satan did uncessantly and without intermission work most powerfully in them, by driving them unto all manner of evil without any stay or hinderance. See <hi>Joh. 8. 41, 44. Doct.</hi> 1. The depth of man's naturall misery is so great, that even the renewed Children of God cannot reach it at one view, nor be sufficiently convinced of it, until the Word of the Lord do frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inculcate and lay it forth in its wofull parcels, yea, and bear-in upon them the truth of it by most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing reasons, taken from their own sense and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: for, the Apostle, speaking to the converted Ephesians, seeth a necessity, not only to declare in the general that they had been dead in sins and trespasses, but also to prove it was so, and to point-forth that wofull death at large in this verse; <hi>Wherein in time past ye walked, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Though even the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate have a body of sin and death dwelling in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. and do sometimes actually fall in sin, yea, even very grosse sins, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 4. and 12. 9. yet they do not walk in sin, that is, sin is not to the Child of God, as the way to the travellor, so as to make it his daily trade and imployment, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 1. or, to sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reluctancy flowing from a spirituall principle


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44180:209"/>
against that which he knoweth to be sin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. And so, as to walk after sin, by making sin, and suggestions to sin his guide, whom he doth willingly follow, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. -1. although sin may conquer, and carry him as an unwilling captive, <hi>Rom. 7. -14. &amp;c.</hi> for, <hi>Paul</hi> maketh their walking in sin an argument to prove that they were dead in sin, and therefore it cannot fall upon the Regenerate; <hi>Wherein in time past ye walked.</hi> 3. Such is the power of converting grace, that it causes men change their former way and course, though they have been never so much rooted in it, and habituated to it: for, while he saith, <hi>Wherein in time past ye walked,</hi> he implyeth there was a change wrought, and that they did not so walk in the time present. 4. While Scripture affirmeth that Christ hath taken away the sins of the world, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. -29. and is a propitiation for the sins of the whole world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 2. it is no cogent argument to prove, that Christ hath died for all and every one in the world; seing the word <hi>world</hi> doth not alwayes, when mentioned in Scripture, comprize all who are in the world, but must be astricted to the universality of some certain kind of people in the world, as the nature of the purpose in hand will bear: for, here the <hi>world,</hi> whose course the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Ephesians did follow, must be the <hi>world</hi> of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed men only, and cannot be extended so, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the godly and renewed, who were also in the world; <hi>Ye walked according to the course of this world.</hi> 5. The Lord is so far from being moved with the merit or worth of those, whom He doth convert, to bestow converting grace upon them, rather than on others, whom He leaveth in their unconverted state, that He maketh this grace of His to fall upon such as are in no respect better than those whom He passeth by: for, those Ephesians before conversion <hi>walked according to the course of this world,</hi> that is, they were behind with none in sin and wickednesse. 6. As the generall corrupt custom and example of those with whom we live, or who have lived in the former ages of the world before us, is a strong


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44180:209"/>
incitement and sufficient excuse in the minds of many to follow the multitude in doing evil without further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; So it argueth a man to be yet in an unrenewed estate, when he maketh the example of others the highest rule, according to which he walketh, and laboureth to conform himself unto it more than to the will of God: for, the Apostle sheweth the general custom and course of the world, was the rule by which they walked, and an encouragement to them in their walk, and maketh this an argument to prove they were then dead in sins and trespasses; <hi>Wherein</hi> (saith he) <hi>in time past ye walked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the course of this world.</hi> 7. All men in their unrenewed state, are very slaves to Satan, whose wofull motions and suggestions they follow, and whom they resemble and imitate in their sin and wickednesse: for, so much is implyed, while he saith, <hi>They walked according to the prince of the power of the air,</hi> that is, the Devil. 8. Though the Devils and fallen Angels have alwayes an hell, horror and torment in their conscience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. yet they are not alwayes in hell, that place of torment, which is prepared for Devils and Reprobates, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41. they are also present in the earth and air, and there through divine permission have no small power, even so great, as they are able to move the elements, bring down fire upon earth, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 16. raise storms, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 19. to smite mens bodies with several diseases, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 7. yea, and to take away the lives of men <hi>(Job</hi> 1. 19.) and beasts, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 13. which power of theirs in its exercise, is alwayes over-ruled and limited by God, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 12. and 2. 6. in so far, as His most holy and over-ruling providence doth thereby bring about His own design and purpose, which is either to execute deserved judgment upon the wicked, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 13, 17. or, to exercise and try the godly, <hi>Job 1. 12, &amp;c.</hi> for, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is called <hi>Prince of the power of the air,</hi> that is, who hath power in the air. 9. As the Devils are of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual nature and substance, and cannot be seen by bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily eyes, but when they appear cloathed with bodies,

which belong not naturally unto them, but for a time are assumed by them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. 14. So, the way by which Satan doth impart his temptations unto us, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes sensible, but often unperceivable by the outward senses; he doth most certainly tempt to sin, and yet the tempted sinner perceiveth him not: for, as this spiritual and unperceivable way of tempting doth follow upon his spirituall and immateriall substance; So also the words, rendred <hi>the spirit which worketh,</hi> may relate either to his nature, as being spiritual, or to his way of working, while he tempteth, to wit, by way of inspiration and a kind of breathing; the words may be so constructed as to bear either, though the first be mainly intended; <hi>The spirit that now worketh,</hi> or, <hi>his spirit now working.</hi> 10. Though there have been, and yet are some fair flourishes of prais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy vertues and actions seemingly good in men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renewed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. yet every unrenewed man, and chiefly those who are come to age and understanding, are very slaves to sin, and so addicted to the actual ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, though not of all and every sin in particular (for, that were impossible) yet of some one idol or other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their pleasure, profit, or credit; that they cannot but go on in the service of it, without all possibility of being reclaimed by any created strength: for, so much is implyed, while unregenerate men are called <hi>children of disobedience,</hi> that is, men addicted and given over to disobedience, so that they cannot be perswaded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish it. 11. Satan's way of working in, and with obstinate godlesse sinners, is most efficacious and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: he cannot indeed work any change upon the will, by creating new principles or habits in it, which before were not, as God doth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. but, he can not only tempt to sin, by propounding aluring baits and objects to the outward senses, or inward fansie, which he may do to any man, whether good or bad, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 2. but also, when God judicially giveth over a sinner unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, withdrawing even His restraining grace from him, Then doth Satan multiply his temptations without any


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44180:210"/>
intermission, useth the utmost of created endeavours, whereby and through God's up-giving the sinner for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned, and because of the seed and root of all sin, which is in the sinner by nature, there is no sort of wickednesse, unto the acting whereof Satan will not get him willingly driven and carried: for, saith he, <hi>The spirit which now</hi> (that is, even in the mean time, constantly, and without intermitting the shortest moment, or <hi>now) work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the children of disobedience;</hi> the word doth signifie to work with pith and efficacy. 12. Though even the godly are not free from being tempted by Satan; yea, nor yet from yeelding sometimes to his temptations, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21. 1, 2. yet, he doth not work efficaciously in them, and so, as is described in the former Doctrine: for, he astricteth this way of Satans working to unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men; <hi>The spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience.</hi>

being excepted, <hi>Rom. 8. 7. Col.</hi> 2. -18. for, so is the word <hi>flesh</hi> usually taken in the New Testament, <hi>Joh. 3. 6. Gal.</hi> 5. 13, 16. Now, all corruption and sin, even that which is in the mind, is called <hi>flesh;</hi> because it is conveyed by fleshly generation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 6. the fleshly members of the body are the instruments whereby all is executed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19. and every sin draweth the man from God to things earthly and fleshly. Secondly, he subdivideth this inbred corruption of their natures into two heads, first, the <hi>flesh,</hi> particularly so called, whereby, as it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from flesh before mentioned, and opposed to the <hi>mind</hi> spoken of afterwards, must be meaned that corruption, which is seated in the inferiour part of the soul, to wit, the sensual appetite; and next, the <hi>mind,</hi> whereby is meaned the most noble faculties of the soul, to wit, the will and understanding, in so far as they are also corrupted. Concerning both which he affirmeth, that even the Jews in their unconverted state were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling their wills and desires; by which <hi>desires</hi> of the flesh, as they are distinguished from the lusts of the flesh formerly mentioned, are meaned their deliberate and fixed resolution to follow those lusts and suggestions of corrupt flesh, which accordingly he sheweth they did fulfill and accomplish to the utmost. And, thirdly, he pointeth at the root and fountain-cause of this their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable slavery and subjection to sin in the lusts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires therof, even their natural sin and misery, whereby they were from nature, that is, from their very cradle, birth and conception, <hi>children of wrath,</hi> as being by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their original sin lyable to the stroke of God's eternal wrath, and as much lyable to it as the Gentiles were. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is not any piece of a Minister's task wherein he hath more need of a spirit of wisdom and impartiality, than when he is about the reproof of sin, and the discovery of peoples vilenesse by reason of their wickednesse; lest, if herein he respect persons, those whom he reflects upon most, be irritate, as concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themselves to be unequally dealt with, and lest


<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44180:211"/>
others, to whom he doth apply that convincing doctrine, neither so directly, nor with such an edge and vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, be puft up in their own conceit above others: for, the Apostle holdeth-forth the rest of what he hath to speak upon this subject of mans misery by nature, in the person of the Jews; lest either the Gentiles had been irritated, or the Jews puffed up; <hi>Among whom we all also bad our conversation.</hi> 2. Whatever differences may be among unregenerate men as to things civil, externals in Religion, or the particular sins unto which they are inslaved; yet all of them are alike vile in God's sight, children of disobedience, in whom Satan ruleth and worketh; in so far as they are all walking in the lusts of the flesh following inbred corruption as their guide, and obeying it in some one or other of its lusts: for, though there was neither civil commerce, nor religious fellowship betwixt the Jews and Gentiles, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 9. though the Jews had many external religious priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which the Gentiles did want, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4, 5. and though some both of Jews and Gentiles were not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved to such vile and fleshly lusts, as others were, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. -6. yet <hi>Paul</hi> pronounces of himself and all of them, that they were children of disobedience because one way or other they followed the lusts of the flesh; <hi>Among whom also we all had our conversation in the lusts of the flesh.</hi> 3. They, who in their unconverted estate have led a blamelesse life before the world (and therefore have thought their condition abundantly good, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 7-) will, when converting grace cometh, see themselves to have been as vile and wretched as any. They will not only see, that nothing they did was truly good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, as not being done in saith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6-. but also that the root of all sin was in them, budding out without any check or restraint, except from respect to self-interest, credit, pleasure or advantage, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 5. and that the more blamelesse they were before the world, spiritual pride did abound the more, <hi>Philip.</hi>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44180:212"/>
life, even in his unrenewed estate, was blamelesse, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. -6. being now converted, affirmeth of himself as well as of others, <hi>Among whom also we all in time past bad our conversation in the lusts of the flesh.</hi> 4. As the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man is powerfully tempted by Satan, and strongly encouraged by the common custome and example of others to sin against the Lord; So there is a corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture within him, which maketh him readily entertain those external incitements, yea, and which would make him do mischief, though there were not a devil to tempt, nor any evil example to be followed; and therefore none of those allurements and temptations to sin from without, though never so strong, doth excuse the sinner; seing they are no more ready to tempt than corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in him is willing to be tempted: for, the Apostle, having spoken of two guides of a natural man's sinfull course, which are without him, the custom of the world, and Satan's suggestions, ver. 2. he addeth here a third, which is within him, and as forward as any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; <hi>We,</hi> saith he, <hi>had our conversation in the lusts of the flesh.</hi> 5. The whole man, both soul and body, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with sin by nature, so that not only the sensual part, but even his will and understanding are corrupted by it, there being not only ignorance, but also mistakes of God and good in the understanding, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 23. a crooked perversnesse and aversnesse from that which is spiritually good, in the will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. for, <hi>Paul</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth even the <hi>mind,</hi> to wit, as it is corrupted, to be a part of <hi>flesh: fulfilling the desires of the flesh, and of the mind.</hi> 6. There are several degrees of sin, whereof, as the latter doth carry sin a step further on towards the height, than the former; so the former maketh way for the latter: for, first, there is <hi>flesh,</hi> or the very inbred corruption of our natures. Secondly, <hi>Lusts of the flesh,</hi> these are the first motions of inbred corruption towards unlawfull objects, and such as go before deliberation and advice, and are forbidden, in so far as they relate to our neighbour, in the tenth Command. Thirdly, the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,</hi>


                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:44180:212"/>
or wills of the flesh, which are somewhat more, even the hearts through-consent to the sinfull motion, and a fixed resolution to act it after deliberation and advice, and is that kind of lust spoken-of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 28. And, lastly, the <hi>fulfilling</hi> those wills and desires of the flesh, that is, the actual committing of sin so resolved upon. 7. Every unregenerate man, come to age and discretion, is a slave to sin in all the fore-mentioned degrees; for, <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth here of himself, the Jews and Gentiles before conversion, that not only <hi>flesh</hi> was in them, which did lust after unlawfull objects, but that those lusts did come the length of fixed resolutions and desires, yea, and that they did fulfill and accomplish them: for, though civilians do not fulfill the lusts of the fleshly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; yet they fulfill the desires of the mind by their pride, vanity of spirit, self-seeking and such like; <hi>We all had our conversation in the lusts of the flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh, and of the mind.</hi> 8. As all men are guilty of original sin by nature, and from the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their conception, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 5. and therefore, in the course of divine justice, liable to the stroke of God's vindictive wrath and anger, and this by nature also; So the misery of unregenerate men is never sufficiently seen, untill it be traced up to this bitter root and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, even the sin and misery wherein they were born: for, his saying they were children of wrath by nature, implyeth they were also sinners by nature; seing wrath doth alwayes follow upon sin, and this he reserveth last, as that which was the root, fountain and head-stone of all their misery; <hi>And were by nature the children of wrath.</hi> 9. Though those, who are borne within the visible Church, have a right to Church-priviledges even from their birth, and by nature, which others have not (See <hi>Gal. 2. Ver. 15. Doct.</hi> 1.) yet all men, whether born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or without the Church, are alike by nature, as to the point of original sin inherent in all, and the desert of God's wrath following upon that sin, which wrath is due to all: for, saith he, speaking of the Jews, <hi>We were


<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44180:213"/>
by nature the children of wrath, even as others,</hi> by which <hi>others</hi> he meaneth the unchurched Gentiles.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle, having already set forth that miserable state, wherein both Jew and Gentile were by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and before conversion, he doth in the second place hold forth their delivery from that wofull state, and that in such a lively, ravishing and comprehensive strain of speech, as might not only inform their judgments, but also work upon their affections to imbrace and adhere unto those truths which he here delivereth, according to his intended scope. And, first, (ver. 4.) he declareth God to have been the prime author and efficient cause of their delivery, whom he calleth <hi>rich in mercy,</hi> to shew that He was acted herein, not from their worth, but His own abundant mercy, which attribute of mercy doth speak His favour and good-will, with relation to His Peoples miserie. And withall, he sheweth that it was only His great and ancient love towards them, which set His mercy on work in order to their delivery.</p>
                  <p>Next (vers. 5.) having resumed what he spoke of their miserable case, ver. 1. (but so, as he applyeth what was there spoken of the Gentiles only, unto himself and the other Jews, according to what was held forth, ver. 3.) he propoundeth the first branch of their delivery, to wit, <hi>God's quickning of them together with Christ,</hi> whereby is meaned the Lord's work of regeneration, and bestowing upon them a spiritual life of grace, in opposition to that spiritual death formerly spoken of, together with all those benefits which accompany and flow from regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in this life. And they are said to have been quickned with Christ, though not in their own persons, (for they were so quickned a long time after Christ's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44180:213"/>
in their effectual calling) but they were then quickned in their head and atturney Jesus Christ, whose quickning after death was a sure pledge that they, every one in his own time, should be quickned also, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20. and that the vertue purchased by Christs death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. and to be applyed unto them by Him, who is now alive, and liveth for evermore for that end, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. And therefore the Apostle expresseth Gods bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this spiritual life upon them, by His quickning them with Christ. And before he mention the other pieces of their delivery, he doth in the close of this vers. ascribe the whole work of their salvation to Gods free grace, which is the same in effect with His mercy and love spoken of, ver. 4. Only it further expresseth the freedom of those, in opposition to any merit or worth in the persons to be saved, which might procure their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Ministers of Christ would not only inculcate the doctrine of sin and misery, but, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving insisted so much upon this subject as may serve to bring down that high conceit which people naturally have of their own righteousnesse, and to convince them of their need of Jesus Christ a Saviour, Then is it ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for them to open up the riches of Gods free grace and good will, to save the vilest of sinners, and what He hath freely done for bringing about salvation to their hand: for, the Apostle, having set forth unto the life the natural misery of those Ephesians, doth now open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up the rich treasures of Gods free grace in Christ; <hi>But God who is rich in mercy.</hi> 2. The Lords Ministers when they fall upon this subject of Gods delivering lost sinners from their natural state of sin and misery through Christ, they would labour to speak to it so fully, affectionatly, sensibly, and with such life and power, as that they may not only inform the understandings of the Lords People in those truths, but also inflame their affections with love to them, and admiration at the wisdom, mercy, goodnesse and other attributes of God manifested in this work: for, so doth the Apostle speak of this purpose,


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44180:214"/>
not simply by saying God hath quickned us, but <hi>God who is rich in mercy, according to His great love,</hi> and so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the two following verses. 3. There is nothing contributeth more to inable a Minister to speak to the commendation of God's free grace in the salvation of sinners with that fulnesse, sense, life and affection, as he ought, than a deep insight in his own misery, and the great need which he himself doth stand in of God's mercy: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> in the third verse fore-going, doth shew how sensible he was of the depth and breadth of his own misery; hence he doth here speak so fully and movingly to the present purpose; <hi>But God who is rich in mercy, &amp;c.</hi> 4. The quickning of sinners, and drawing them out of nature unto grace is only God's work, there being no lesse required for bringing this about, than om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent creating power; See ver. 10. And there being not only no principle left in man, who is by nature dead in sins and trespasses, whereby he might work or concur with God in working towards his own quickning, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 16. but also much to oppose and resist it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. So that in the first instant of his conversion, and untill a new heart be given him, and the seeds and habits of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving graces infused in him, he is wholly passive, as to any actual influence upon the effect which is wrought, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. for, <hi>Paul</hi> here, condescending upon the cause of their quickning, doth pitch, not upon their own free will in whole, or in part, but upon God only, while he saith, <hi>But God who is rich in mercy—hath quickned us.</hi> 5. This attribute of mercy in God, whereby without any grief or perturbation of mind, (which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth men in the exercise of mercy) he hath a propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and inclination to do good to the sinfull and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, so far as His wisdom seeth convenient, is the only thing in opposition unto all that is in a mans self, which moveth God to quicken and bestow grace upon dead and gracelesse sinners: for, the Apostle, speaking of God's quickning of those Ephesians, describeth Him from His mercy, to shew it was not their worth, but His


<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44180:214"/>
own mercy, which moved Him to quicken them; <hi>But God who is rich in mercy—hath quickned us.</hi> 6. As God is rich and overflowing in the exercise of this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of <hi>mercy,</hi> which will appear, if we consider that there is no creature towards which He doth not exercise His mercy, <hi>Psal.</hi> 104. 24. and that mercy is exercised, not only without, but also often contrary to the deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of those upon whom it is exercised, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 21, 22. so there is nothing wherein God doth more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the riches and abundance of His mercy, than in the work of quickning dead sinners, and of carrying-on the work of grace in them, untill it be perfected in glory. The misery <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 16. 3, &amp;c.) and bad deservings of the object, <hi>(Jer.</hi> 14. 7.) the great good things which are bestowed upon those miserable objects, <hi>(Luke</hi> 12. 32.) the course taken for satisfying divine justice, that so those good things might be, without wronging of justice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed, <hi>(Joh.</hi> 3. 16.) and the multitude of sins, which mercy covereth in those objects, not only before their conversion, <hi>(Isa.</hi> 55. 7.) but also after it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 16. All these, and many considerations besides these, do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest God to be rich in mercy in quickning of dead sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; <hi>But God who is rich in mercy—hath quickned us.</hi> 7. The highest cause which moveth God to manifest this His rich and special mercy upon any of lost man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and from mercy to quicken them, and bestow His saving graces on them, was His love towards them: which is no other than His will and resolution to impart those good things unto them, together with His hearty acquiescence in the thing, as that wherewith He is well pleased. He did it because He would do it, resolved to do it, and had pleasure in the doing of it: for, saith he, <hi>God who is rich in mercy, for His great love—hath quickned us.</hi> 8. As God's love towards those whom He converteth doth not begin when they are converted, but is of a more ancient, even an eternal rise, chap. 1. 4. So it is not an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, but a great love wherewith He loveth them. The infinit distance betwixt Him and them <hi>(Psal.</hi> 8. 4.) His


<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44180:215"/>
loving them when they were yet enemies, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 5. 8.) the great things bestowed by His love <hi>(Rom.</hi> 5. 6, 7, 8.) and His unchangeablenesse in His love,, even notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of great provocations to the contrary, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 33. All these, and many besides these, do abundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that this love is a great, wonderfull, and match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse love: for, saith he, <hi>For His great love, wherewith He loved us</hi> 9. The Lord hath love to the Elect, even when they are children of wrath, and liable in the course of justice to the stroke of His vindictive anger: for, although God could not, with safety of His own justice, bestow Heaven upon them, when they were actually such; yet nothing hindereth, why He might not love them being such, that is, have a will and fixed resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even when they were liable unto wrath, to bestow Heaven upon them, having first from that same love given His own Son to deliver them from that state of wrath; that so what eternal love had resolved to give them, might be actually bestowed upon them, without doing injury to divine justice: for, ver. 3. he sheweth they were children of wrath, and here, that God loved them, and both these before He quickned them; <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with He loved us,</hi> saith he, even in the by-past time. 10. The doctrine of our natural misery, and spirituall death through sin, is a lesson most necessary to be learned, which we have no great pleasure to learn, and which we are prone to forget, as to a deep and lively impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it, even when it is learned: for, the Apostle's repeating this doctrine, almost in the same words, by which he had expressed it, ver. 1. doth hint at all these; <hi>Even when we were dead in sins,</hi> saith he. 11. There is no application of the doctrine of God's mercy in order to our delivery from sin and misery, except the doctrine of sin and misery be first applied and taken with: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> being to apply God's mercy in quickning sinners, unto himself and his country-men the believing Jews, he doth first apply the doctrine of natural sin and misery unto them, while he doth now speak of himself and the


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44180:215"/>
Jews also, whereas (ver. 1.) he spoke of the Gentiles only, as appeareth by the change of the person; <hi>Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickned us.</hi> 12. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a man be before his conversion, as to the point of civility and right use of his natural parts; yet, he is looked upon by God when He cometh to quicken him, as one dead in sins, who can neither help himself, nor merit help at God's hand: for, therfore doth the Apostle assert that they were dead in sins immediatly before, yea, and in the act of God's quickning of them, while he saith, <hi>Even when we were dead in sins, He hath quickned us.</hi> 13. The state of grace, which sinners, dead by nature, are brought unto at their conversion, and wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue untill death, is a state of life; the sentence of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death which they were liable unto (ver. -3.) being taken off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. there being also new principles and powers infused in them at their effectuall calling, whereby they are enabled to do those actions of a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26, 27. which powers are also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually actuated and excited to their work by renewed influence from the Spirit of God, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 13. and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied oftimes in their actings with assurance of God's love <hi>(Rom.</hi> 8. 16.) peace of conscience <hi>(Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2.) and joy unspeakable and full of glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. whereby also they have not only a right unto <hi>(Joh.</hi> 3. 16.) but also the first fruits and begun possession of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. for, the Apostle expresseth God's bringing them to, and continuing them in the state of grace by His quickning of them; <hi>hath quickned us,</hi> saith he. 14. Though love and mercy in God do set Him on work to quicken dead sinners; yet this work cannot be brought about or accomplished without the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Christ's merit and intercession, who behoved to satisfie divine justice, and thereby acquire unto us those things which love and mercy had prepared for us, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 5. seing they were all lost in <hi>Adam, Rom.</hi> 5. 15, 16. and who, being now exalted, doth also apply them to us, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. for, notwithstanding of what was said


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44180:216"/>
(ver. 4.) of God's mercy and love, as the inward impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive causes moving God to quicken them; yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle here sheweth, that their actual quickning had a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary dependance upon Christ's merit and mediation, while he saith, <hi>He hath quickned us together with Christ.</hi> 15. That Jesus Christ behoved of necessity to strike-in with His merit and mediation, hereby to acquire and apply saving grace and salvation unto us, doth in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinder, but that notwithstanding our compleat salvation, from the first step unto the last, doth wholly flow from God's free grace; seing it was of grace that the Father did send the Son to die for us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. It was of grace that the Son did undertake, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 12, 13. And it is no lesse grace, that what He did or suffered should be accepted in our name, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25. So that all is of grace and free good-will, as to us: for, the Apostle, having pointed at the necessity of Christ's me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, in order to their quickning, doth presently adde, as in a parenthesis, <hi>by grace are ye saved.</hi> 16. There is an infallible connexion betwixt converting grace and salvation; so that all those, who are now converted and quickned, shall be undoubtedly saved: for, what the Apostle calleth <hi>quickned</hi> in the former part of the verse, he calleth <hi>saved</hi> in the close, so that he taketh the one for the other; <hi>He hath quickned us—By grace are ye saved.</hi>

And the Spirit of God doth choose to set forth their future resurrection and glorification, by shewing these are already accomplished in Christ their Head, rather than by saying, God shall raise them up and glorifie them, that he may with one and the same labour point out the dependencie which their resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and glorification have upon Christs, as the effect upon the cause, the thing promised upon the pledge thereof, as also the undoubted certainty that those shall come to passe, a certainty greater than that of a simple prediction and promise, even such certainty, as the giving of a pledge, and holding forth of an effectuall and necessary cause do give for performance of the thing promised; for, Christs resurrection is both a pledge, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 20.) and cause of our resurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 11. which holdeth also in His glorification.</p>

And in the close of the verse, he sheweth wherein that convincing evidence doth lye, by giving a short comprehensive sum of all he hath spoken from the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, even in God's <hi>kindnesse,</hi> that is, all those effects for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned of His mercy, love and free grace, flowing from His good, gentle and bountifull disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this, <hi>towards them,</hi> whose misery was formerly described; and <hi>through Christ,</hi> as the purchaser and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plier of all those. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44180:218"/>
in so far as those instances and examples do speak, not only that mercy and grace may be had, but that it hath been attained unto, and by those, who in all respects did judge themselves, and were really as unworthy of it, as unable to lay hold upon it in the mean time, and to make good use of it afterwards, as we do judge our selves; so that the yce is broken, and the foord ridden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us: for, the Apostle sheweth, that God gave such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of mercy and grace in those primitive Christians, that he <hi>might shew forth,</hi> as it were, by demonstration and evidence, <hi>the exceeding riches of His grace,</hi> and this in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the encouragement of others to venture their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon that same grace, as we shew in the Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. 3.

                  <p>THe Apostle, Fourthly, While he giveth a reason of what is said, ver. 7. (as appeareth by the causall particle, <hi>for)</hi> doth sum up all which hath been spoken from ver. 4. in this one comprehensive proposition, that their compleat salvation, from the first step unto the last, did flow from Gods grace and favour (for, by <hi>grace</hi> here must be meaned Gods free favour and grace in him, not the effects of this grace, good works, or grace inherent in us; for those are expresly excluded, ver. 9.) and withall, that they were so saved by grace, as faith was not excluded; This grace of faith being the hand, or instrument, whereby we lay hold upon, and apply to our selves Jesus Christ, and His righteousnesse of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered freely in the Gospel, in order to our salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. And, Secondly, Because the establishing of them in this truth, is his main scope through the whole first part of the Epistle, therefore he doth here, not only explain in what sense salvation doth flow from grace, but also doth expresly confirm it by arguments, First, by removing all things in generall, which could be called theirs, whether prerogative, priviledge, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall or acquired worth, from being the meritorious procuring cause of their salvation, or of any part of it; the truth whereof is more than evident from what is said of their spirituall death in sins and trespasses, ver. 1, 2, 3. and therefore he needeth not bring any new argument to prove it. Secondly, by asserting from that same ground, that their salvation was Gods gift, and therefore it behoved to be free, and of grace, else it could not be a gift. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though the ascribing of salvation unto works, is not wholly inconsistent with, and destructive of Gods grace from having any influence upon salvation, seing <hi>Adam's</hi> salvation, even according to the tenor of the Covenant of works, had


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44180:219"/>
been also of grace in some respect, it being of grace that God did enter any Covenant with man at all, and of grace also that He did accept, even of mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience so, as upon his performance of it to make him sure of eternall life; yet the ascribing of salvation, or any part of it unto the merit or worth of works, doth obscure, and is inconsistent with that exceeding riches of grace, which God intendeth to set forth by that way of salvation, which is propounded in the Covenant of Grace: for, the Apostle being here to prove, that Gods way of saving those Ephesians, was a fit mean to set forth the exceeding riches of His grace, giveth this for a reason, even that their salvation did flow only from grace, and from nothing in themselves, nor any work of theirs, So that if it did not flow only from grace, and from nothing in themselves, it could not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate those exceeding riches of His grace: for, saith he, <hi>ye are saved by grace, and that not of your selves; not of works.</hi> 2. Whatever differences may be among seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall persons in other things; yet all come of <hi>Adam</hi> by ordinary generation, are equall, as in their common misery by nature; so in the way of their delivery from that misery by free grace through a Redeemer, there being no other name under Heaven given among men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we can be saved, but the name of Jesus, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. for, therefore doth the Apostle so frequently change the person in this first part of the Chapter, while he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times speaketh of the Ephesians and Gentiles alone in the second person, as, ver. 1. sometimes of himself, and of the Jews with them in the first person, as ver. 5, 6. not, as if some part of the purpose did belong only to the one alone, and some part of it unto both joyntly: for in one and the same purpose he changeth the person, as while he giveth a reason in this verse, of what he spoke ver. 7. but rather to shew, that the purpose here insisted on, which is mans misery by nature, and their delivery from that misery by free grace and Christ, doth belong equally to Jew and Gentile: and therefore he


<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44180:220"/>
standeth not much to which of them he doth speak; for <hi>by grace are ye saved,</hi> saith he. 3. As Believers are in some sense already saved, not only because they have salvation begun in their new birth, which is a passing from death unto life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. but also they have compleat salvation in right and title, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3. 21, 22. and in the earnest of it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 14. So, the whole work of their salvation, from its first step in regeneration unto its last step in their glorification, doth intirely flow from Gods free grace, and from none of their worth: for, he saith, <hi>ye are saved,</hi> in the time bypast, and ascribeth it to grace, <hi>by grace ye are saved.</hi> 4. The maintaining of the interest of free grace in our salvation, as being the alone impulsive cause thereof, in opposition to our worth, is a thing that the Spirit of the Lord is very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of, the glory of His free grace being all which He seeketh after in our salvation, chap. 1. 6. and a thing, which men do naturally encline to intrench upon, and to rob Him of, either in whole or in part, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. for, therefore doth the Apostle so frequently shew the dependance which salvation hath upon Gods mercy, love and free grace, ver. 4. -5. and here, <hi>by grace are ye saved.</hi> 5. Free grace, and faith do well agree in the bringing about our salvation: neither is salvation the lesse of free grace, that it is also of faith; seing faith is not only a fruit of Gods grace in us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 29. but also and mainly, because faith doth not justifie, or save us for any worth in it self, or as it is a work, (for, all works are excluded, ver. 9.) but for the worth of its object, Jesus Christ, and of His righteousnesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. -19. which faith apprehendeth, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 9. for, the Apostle ascribeth their salvation both to grace and faith; <hi>ye are saved. by grace through faith.</hi> 6. Though Gods free grace, favour and goodwill doth freely bestow that sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon the Elect, which Christ by His merit hath purchased; yet the Wisdom of God hath thought it fitting, that this salvation shall not be actually bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, untill the person to be saved, do lay hold by faith


<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44180:220"/>
upon the offer of salvation in the Gospel, and of Christs righteousnesse, whereby salvation is acquired, that so the heirs of glory may not only have a right to heaven by faith, before they come to the actuall possession of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. but also be made meet to partake of that heavenly inheritance, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. their natures being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, when the habit of faith is wrought in them by God, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. 17. and their hearts also being puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the exercise of that grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. for, saith he, <hi>by grace are ye saved through faith.</hi> 7. The ascrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of salvation to Gods free grace, though it doth not exclude Christs merit, and the act of faith, as imbracing the righteousnesse of Christ (See <hi>Doct.</hi> 5.) Yet it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth all things in our selves, whether dignity of our natures, the enjoyment of civil, or ecclesiastick privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, nobility of discent, all our common, or more speciall gifts and induements, whether of nature or grace, from having any meritorious, or causall influence in bestowing, either a right to salvation, or the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> opposeth these two, <hi>by grace are ye saved and that not of your selves.</hi> 8. As heaven and salvation are Gods gift; so they are such a gift, as is freely given by God, who is not induced thereto by any thing in the person to whom it is given, whether sense of benefit already received, or hope of any benefit to be received from Him in time coming, which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth the bestowing of gifts among men; salvation is indeed a gift, but not such a gift: for, it is a gift with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all rise from any thing in our selves; <hi>And that not of your selves, it is the gift of God,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>HE further explaineth in what sense their salvation did come from free grace, and proveth it by other two arguments, which do also confirm the two former. The first, taken from the removeall of those things in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular from having any meritorious, or causall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence


<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44180:221"/>
upon their salvation, which all men have a kind of naturall propension to rely upon for salvation; to wit, their works, and those even their good works; for, so doth he explain himself, ver. 10. whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that they were saved of grace, and not of themselves. The second is taken from the end aimed at by God in contriving the plot of lost mans salvation, to wit, that all ground of gloriation might be taken away from man, as being, in the meanest respect, a saviour to himself, and that all the glory might be ascribed compleatly unto God in Christ: (See, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30, 31.) which end could not have been obtained, except they had been saved by grace, and not of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though the word <hi>grace,</hi> in Scripture, be somtimes taken for the saving graces of Gods Spirit in us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. yet, when salvation is ascribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods grace, we are alwayes to understand <hi>grace</hi> in God, that is, His free favour and goodwill, and not <hi>grace</hi> inherent in us, or good works, the exercise of that grace: for, the Apostle establisheth grace, ascribing our salvation to it, and excludeth grace inherent and good works, which were inconsistent, if they were the self same thing; <hi>Not of works,</hi> saith he. 2. The salvation of Believers doth so much flow from free grace, as that all works of theirs, even their good works, are thereby excluded from having any meritorious influence upon it: for, even our best works are imperfect, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6-they are a debt, which we owe unto God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 10. the power and activity whereby we do them, is given of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. and therefore we can me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit nothing, and least of all salvation by them at Gods hand; Thus the Apostle explaineth how we are saved by grace, even so as to exclude all works; <hi>Not of works,</hi> saith he. 3. Though a man may boast and glory of the good things which God hath given him, in some respects, (See upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. ver. 4. doct. 5.) Yet the way wherein salvation is conveyed unto sinners, is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, that no ground is left for man to boast in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44180:221"/>
for any thing, which his wisdom, goodnesse, power, or worth do contribute for bringing of his own salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about, either in part or in whole: From the first step thereof, election, unto the last, his glorification, man and his worth are still depressed, and God and His free grace alwayes exalted; for, the Apostle shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this was the end God did aim at, even <hi>least any man should boast.</hi> 4. In so far as works, even good works have place in the matter of mans salvation, so far hath man mater of boasting, and ascribing the glory of his salvation to himself, and holding back the glory of it from God: for, although good works do come wholly from the Spirit of God, in so far as they are good; yet they are our works, in so far as they are wrought by us, being now renewed and enabled to work by influence from God; and therefore heaven and salvation should in that case be given unto us for the vertue and worth of somewhat which is ours; for, <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth that works, even good works, which <hi>we are created unto in Christ Jesus,</hi> ver. 10. are excluded from having any causall influence upon salvation; <hi>lest any man should boast,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, if works were not excluded, man should have ground of boasting.

                  <p>LEst the Apostle, by commending grace and excluding works from being the cause of their salvation, should have seemed to justle out works, and an holy life, as altogether unnecessary; Therefore, in this verse he sheweth that the study of good works is of absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity required in those who are to be saved; because all such, whether Jew or Gentile, (for, he speaketh in the first person, including himself and the believing Jews) are Gods <hi>workmanship,</hi> that is, renewed, and made over again by Gods createing power through the


<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44180:222"/>
interveening mediation of Christ Jesus, and this of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; that they may make conscience of good works: yea, and further, God, who had predestinated them to heaven, had also decreed and prepared good works for them, as the way wherein they behoved of necessity to walk in their journey to heaven: which as it proveth the undeniable necessity of good works; so it also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that they neither were, nor could be saved by works; because the power whereby they did good works, did follow upon their regeneration, and was given them freely by God. As also, God had prepared good works, that they should walk towards heaven in them, but not to merit heaven by them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are Gods workmanship, not only by naturall creation, but supernaturall renovation; they are not only once made, but made over again; not by having the substance of their soul and naturall powers thereof destroyed, and new ones, substantially different from those, substituted in their place, but by having the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious qualities, which were in those, subdued and weakened, and contrary graces and vertues implanted in their stead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 22, 23, 24. for, saith <hi>Paul, we are His workmanship:</hi> the word signifieth a thing of His making, whereby he meaneth, not Gods first making of them as men, but His making of them over again as renewed men, which appeareth from what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, His creating them in Christ, and unto good works. 2. As the making of sinners over again and new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is only Gods work; So the power, whereby He so maketh us, is no lesse than creating power, much like unto that power whereby in the beginning He made some things of nothing, and some things of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existing matter, but such as was wholly unfit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed for those things to be made of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. 22. considering, that in this great and mighty work of God He maketh those, who were wholly indisposed to good, and averse from it, <hi>(Psal.</hi> 81. 11.) yea perverse resisters of all motions towards that which is godly and holy,

Believers are made new creatures, not to live idlely, or to work wickedly, but that they may in the whole course of their life make conscience of good works: which are not only works of charity, or duties of immediate worship, but every duty, whether of worship, <hi>(Act.</hi> 10. -2.) or of our callings <hi>(Act.</hi> 9. 36. 39.) whether to God, or man, or to our selves, <hi>(Tit.</hi> 2. 12.) which is warranted in the Word as lawfull, or commanded as necessary, <hi>(Mic.</hi> 6. 8.) gone about by a man regenerate, and in Christ, <hi>(Mat.</hi> 7. 17, 18.) by vertue of influence from the Spirit of Christ, <hi>(Phil.</hi> 2. 13.) for Gods glory, as the main end of the worker, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31.) and with due respect had to all necessary circumstances, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.-3 every duty of that kind, so gone about, is a good work, which <hi>Paul</hi> saith <hi>they were created unto in Christ Jesus,</hi> even <hi>unto good works.</hi> 5. Though many actions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men are materially good, and very usefull both for themselves and others, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14. yet no unregenerate man can do any work, which is spiritually good and acceptable to God: even their good works are but shining sins, as being destitute of a great part of these necessary requisites unto a good work, mentioned in the former Doctrine: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that a man must be a new creature and Gods workmanship, before he can do a good work; for, <hi>we are,</hi> saith he, <hi>Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works.</hi> 6. Though good works be not necessary to merit or


<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44180:223"/>
purchase salvation; yet are they necessary unto those who are justified and saved, in severall respects, not only as they are the necessary fruit and end of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and as they are the way which leadeth to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (their necessity in both which respects is grounded upon the present Scripture) but they are necessary also, as evidences of our right to salvation, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. as a guard to preserve peace with our own consciences, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. as evidences of our thankfulnesse to God and Christ, who hath freely saved us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. and for the edification of others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 16. for, the Apostle's scope is to prove, that as we are not saved by works, so that good works are necessary in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects; <hi>We are created unto good works, which He hath fore-ordained, that we should walk in them.</hi> 7. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are like unto those who walk in a journey from one place unto another, through a streight and beaten way which lyeth betwixt, in so far as they advance from sin <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 18. 31.) to heaven, <hi>(Phil.</hi> 3. 14.) in the way of holinesse and good works: for, the word rendered <hi>to walk,</hi> whereby he expresseth what should be the daily exercise of a renewed man, is a metaphore taken from those who travell in a journey, and he maketh the way wherein they walk to be <hi>good works; which God hath before ordained, that we should walk in them.</hi> 8. The Lord hath prepared, and made ready good works, as a beaten path, wherein His renewed people may walk without any discourageing or perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difficulty, in so far, as He not only hath ordained in His eternall and unchangeable decree, that they shall make conscience of good works, which seemeth to be mainly meaned by His <hi>fore-ordaining of good works</hi> here spoken of, but He doth also hold forth the rule of good works in His Word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 9. and by examples also, which make the rule more easie to be followed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. He reneweth their wills, and furnisheth them with inward power and ability to do these works, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27. and exciteth and actuateth that power by His


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44180:223"/>
renewed influence, thereby making it to work, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 13. In all which respects, good works may be said to be prepared by God, as the word, rendred <hi>fore-ordained,</hi> may also read; <hi>which God hath fore-ordained,</hi> or <hi>prepared, that we should walk in them.</hi>

                  <p>HEre beginneth the second part of the Chapter, where the Apostle, for the further establishment of those Ephesians in the Doctrine of salvation through free grace in Christ, doth more largely insist upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer purpose contained in the first part of the Chapter, with a more particular application of it to the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians, and in them to all the Gentiles. And, first, (by exhorting them to remember their former misery, while they were in Gentilisme) he giveth; in this and the following verse, a most lively description of their then miserable state, as first, that they were <hi>in the flesh,</hi> that is, the flesh of their foreskine not being cut off by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, they were not only destituted of that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but also of all other soul-saving ordinances of Gods Worship, unto the enjoying whereof, circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion gave a right and entrance, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 44. Secondly, This their miserable estate was matter also of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; the Jews making their want of Circumcision a continuall upcast unto them, which he hinteth at, by shewing that the carnall Jews, who were only circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in the flesh by the hands of men, but not in their hearts by the Spirit of God, did not cease to reproach the converted Christian Gentiles with uncircumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even at that present time, when circumcision and the rest of those Leviticall ordinances were now abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Even Believers having attained to the sense of Gods mercy in Christ, are very prone to forget


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44180:224"/>
that wo and misery, which they were under, before their delivery from it: for, the watchword here given to those Ephesians, supposeth so much; <hi>Wherefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,</hi> saith he. 2. Those who are converted, ought frequently to remember, and call to mind their sin and misery, under which they were before God shew them mercy, though not to take pleasure in the remembrance of it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 19. 21. nor to despair of, or question Gods mercy in order to their delivery from it: <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 18. yet, that hereby they may be provoked to pity towards others, who are yet in that state, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 2, 3. to greater fruitfulnesse in good works for the time to come, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 19. and to magnifie the riches of Gods mercy in their delivery from that wofull state, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. 14. and that they may be kept humble under their present enjoyments, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 43. for, therefore doth the Apostle exhort those Ephesians to remember their former sin and misery; <hi>Wherefore remember,</hi> saith he, <hi>that in times past ye were.</hi> 3. Christians, in order to the more effectual bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about of the forementioned ends, ought not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that sin and misery, which was common unto them with others, but also, and chiefly would search out, and call to mind wherein their sin and misery did exceed the sin and misery of others: for, <hi>Paul</hi> biddeth them here remember that misery, which in a great part was peculiar unto themselves as Gentiles, and which they had more than the Jews; <hi>Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh.</hi> 4. The considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods rich grace through Jesus Christ, whereby alone He carrieth on the salvation of lost sinners in all its steps, may be a great encouragement, and a strong argument to inforce this duty of searching out and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to mind our matchlesse sin and misery: and that because this rich grace hath not only a remedy for all our sin and misery in it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 20. but also it is most perceived and felt in its sweet and lively effects, when the soul is most affected with the sense of its own vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 21, 22. for, the Apostle, having spoken


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44180:224"/>
of Gods rich grace, whereby we are saved through faith in Christ, he inferreth as a conclusion thence, <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh.</hi> 5. Though it is now under the New Testament no more, but much lesse miserable to be born a Gentile, than to be born a Jew, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. Yet, to have been born a Gentile, and not of <hi>Abrahams</hi> race, was once, to wit, before Christ came in the flesh, a sad and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable lot: for, when he is calling to mind their former misery, he biddeth them <hi>remember that they were in time past Gentiles.</hi> 6. Those, who are born without the bounds of the Church, and live not under the drop of divine Ordinances, are in a poor and wofull case, as being not only under wrath, and destitute of any actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all interest in the blessing (which piece of misery is common to them with all the unregenerate, whether within or without the visible Church. See ver. -2.) but destitute also of all those means, whereby the blessing useth to be conveyed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15. so that their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is not in an ordinary way possible: for, while he is calling to mind their former misery, he biddeth them <hi>remember they were Gentiles in the flesh,</hi> that is, destitute of Circumcision the leading ordinance, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destitute of all Ordinances, having no part nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Gods Church neither outwardly, nor spiritually, as he explaineth himself, ver. 12. 7. As the contemning, even of outward Ordinances, is no small sin before God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 17. with 24. So it is matter of just shame and reproach before men, which did hold especially in the contempt of Circumcision un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Old Testament; it being then a seal of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. the outward badge of the Lords people, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14. and a leading Ordinance, giving right and entrance to the enjoyment of all other Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 44. and it doth no lesse hold in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism under the New Testament, seing the Sacraments of the New Testament are of as much worth, as the Sacraments of the Old; and Baptism serveth for the


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44180:225"/>
same ends now, which are presently mentioned to have been the uses, for which Circumcision did serve then: for, although <hi>Paul</hi> doth only mention expresly, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision was unjustly cast up to the Christian Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles by the carnall and hypocriticall Jews in the present time wherein he wrote, yet hereby he would have them to remember how this was matter of just reproach and upcast unto them, even from the godly Jews in former times, when Circumcision stood in force, and that this disgrace and reproach, was a part of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer misery, (See 1 <hi>Sam. 17. 26, 36.) who are called un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision, &amp;c.</hi> 8. There are two things in every Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to wit, an outward action upon the outward man by the outward instrument, and an inward action upon the inward man by the hand and Spirit of God; for, so was it in Circumcision, the outward action be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here expressed by <hi>Circumcision in the flesh made with hands,</hi> which implieth there was another inward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, spoken of <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11. 9. There are not a few with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the visible Church, who rest upon the outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on done by man in the Sacrament, as if that alone were sufficient, and do not seek after that which God doth inwardly work upon the heart: And so do use Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as sorcerers do their charms and spels, where the bare rehearsing of some set form of words, with such a composed strain of outward carriage and gesture, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon for the producing of wonderfull effects: for, of this sort were those who are here called <hi>the Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the flesh made by hands,</hi> that is, such who rested upon the outward action, and sought after no more but it. 10. They have very frequently least of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in reality and effect, who are most puft up with the conceit of their own Religion, and make greatest noise about things least necessary in Religion, or which are in themselves indifferent, as if the greatest stresse of Religion did ly in those: for, those, who boasted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of their Religion and Circumcision against the uncircumcised Gentiles, and did place their whole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44180:225"/>
in Circumcision, and the rest of those mosaicall Ordinances now abolished, were <hi>the Circumcision in the flesh made with hands,</hi> that is, such as had only the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form of Religion, but not the life and power of it. 11. As it is a great reproach to be despisers of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; So it is but a poor credit for people to have Ordinances, if they rest upon the outside of them, not labouring to have life and power conveyed from God through them: for, Ordinances, so rested upon, as they will increase peoples judgement afterwards, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 22. So they prove a fearfull snare in the mean time, in so far as they are usually relied upon for salvation, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and occasion is taken from them to neglect all other duty both to God and man, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 10. for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth here speak of it as a thing disgracefull; <hi>who are called,</hi> saith he, <hi>Circumcision in the flesh made with hands.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, thirdly, doth here branch forth their misery at that time when they were unconverted Gentiles, in five particulars. First, They were <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ,</hi> as being not only without all saving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all interest in Christ, which was common to them with all the unregenerate, whether without, or within the visible Church, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. but also without an offer of Christ in the Ministery of the Gospel, as they were Gentiles, without the bounds of the visible Church, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 20. Secondly, They were <hi>aliens from the common-wealth of Israel,</hi> having no union or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, neither with the invisible Church of true Believers, which was common to them with all the unregenerate, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>8. nor yet with the visible Church of Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, which was in those times among the people of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Deut.</hi> 32. 8. And this latter alienation was peculiar


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44180:226"/>
to them, as they were unchurched Gentiles, <hi>Psal.</hi> 76. 1. Thirdly, They were <hi>strangers to the covenants of promise,</hi> that is, the Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Adam</hi> after the fall <hi>(Gen.</hi> 3. 15.) and afterwards frequently renewed with <hi>Abraham, Gen. 17. 7. Isaac, Gen. 26. 3. Iacob Gen.</hi> 28. 13, 14. with <hi>Israel</hi> upon mount Sinai, <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 7. and in the plains of <hi>Moab, Deut. 29. 1. &amp;c.</hi> and with <hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 23. 5. And therefore it is called <hi>Covenants</hi> in the plurall number, though it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one and the same Covenant in substance; the substantiall sum thereof being alwayes comprised in that one comprehensive and fountain-promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. -15. or <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. - 3. which seemeth to be here pointed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at by the word, <hi>promise</hi> in the singular number; of which promise, all the following promises, made to <hi>Abraham, David</hi> and the rest, were but branches, or more full explanations. Now, they are said to have been strangers to this Covenant, not only, because they had no actuall interest in the saving blessings of remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sins, grace here, and glory hereafter, which were promised in that Covenant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8. (and this was common to them, with all the unregenerate, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 16, 17.) But also they had not so much as this Covenant revealed unto them, neither that it was, nor of what kind, or upon what conditions it was; neither had they an offer of it by the publick Ministery of the Word, and so were not within the very outward bond of it, neither had any right to the externall priviledges of this Covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 7, 8. which estrangement was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar unto them, as they were unchurched Gentiles, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 10, 11, 12. Fourthly, They were <hi>without hope,</hi> not only without that saving grace of hope, which floweth from faith laying hold upon the Covenant of promise, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. and sustaineth the heart in the patient and well-grounded expectation of the thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised and believed, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 8. and this was also common to them with all the unregenerate, <hi>Job</hi> 8. 13, 14. But also, they were in a condition so hopelesse, that their


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44180:226"/>
salvation was not in an ordinary way possible, as being wholly destituted of those means, whereby God doth ordinarily convert and save sinners, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 20. and this was peculiar unto them as they were unchurched Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. Fifthly. They were <hi>without God,</hi> or atheists, not as if they had been deprived of all sense of a Deity, (for they worshipped false gods, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 12, 13.) nor yet, as if they had been without the reach and care of Gods over-ruling and all-upholding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. but they were without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 8. or, though they had some confused knowledge, even of the true God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. yet He was not their reconciled God in Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. neither did they give Him that worship and glory, which is due unto God, and was prescribed by Him in His Word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21, 22. And lastly, He addeth, that they were without God <hi>in the world:</hi> which words, <hi>in the world,</hi> may be looked upon, as a generall clause relating to all the particular branches of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery before mentioned. And he seemeth hereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discend, what that bypast time was, wherein all that he hath spoken was verified in them, to wit, when they were in the world, that is, without the Church, as the world is frequently taken in opposition to Gods Church, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 19. and 17, 14. and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the truely regenerate in the Church, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. -19. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As those who are converted, would frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call to mind that sin and misery under which they were when God did call them (See <hi>vers. 11. Doct.</hi> 2.) so because an abstract view of sin and misery in the general, doth not much affect the heart, therefore they ought to branch forth and call to mind their misery in its se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall heads and parcels, that so they may be the more affected with it: for, the Apostle, having exhorted them to remember their former misery, he doth not only give them a general view of it, ver. 11. but here doth branch it forth in five particulars, which they were to remember; <hi>That at that time ye were without Christ, &amp;c.</hi> 2. For a


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44180:227"/>
man to be without an offer of Christ, yea to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a reall interest in Christ, though there be never so frequent offers of Him, is a dolefull, sad and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous case; for, to want a reall and saving interest in Christ, is to want life, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 12.) light, <hi>(Joh.</hi> 1. 4, 5.) strength, <hi>(Joh.</hi> 15. -5.) liberty, <hi>(Joh.</hi> 8. 36.) and acceptation with God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 17. And to have a saving interest in Christ, doth make a man truly happy, what ever be his misery otherwise: for, he maketh this the first branch of their misery, and that which virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally compriseth all the rest, even that <hi>at that time they were without Christ.</hi> 3. Though Christ from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity had a right unto, and interest in the Elect, they being given over unto Him in the Covenant of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 39. yet they never have, nor can plead any interest in Him, or in those saving benefits, which were purchased by Him, untill they be effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and do actually believe in Him; for, though God from all eternity had chosen in Christ those who were truly Godly among the Ephesians, cap. 1. 4. yet untill their effectuall calling, they were without Christ, as <hi>without Christ</hi> did speak their not having an actuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Him; <hi>That at that time ye were without Christ.</hi> 4. Though Jesus Christ was not so clearly manifested unto the Jewish Church, as He now is under the Gospel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 14. yet, they were not then altogether without Christ, they had Him revealed unto them, though but darkly in the Word, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. and in their daily sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, which were types and shadows of Him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17. yea, and the Godly then had reall interest by faith in Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 56. and in those saving benefits, which then were to be, and now are actually purchased by Him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. for, the Gentiles are here said, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Jews, to have been <hi>at that time without Christ;</hi> whereby it is implyed, that the Jewish Church was not without Him. 5. It is no small happinesse for men and women to have union and communion with the Church of Christ; It is even an happinesse in its


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44180:227"/>
own kind, and comparatively to be members of His visible Church; for, thereby we partake of all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges thereof, which are Gods speciall care and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>Isa.</hi> 4. 5, 6. protection, and preservation in all ages, notwithstanding the opposition of all enemies, <hi>Isa.</hi> 31. 4, 5. the enjoyment of the ordinary means of salvation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19. and the externall communion of the Saints by partaking of the same ordinances, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. and the mutuall gifts one of another, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 11. together with the offers of Christ and salvation upon such terms as they are proponed in the Gospel, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 38. But it is much more happinesse to be members of the invisible Church of Believers; for thereby we do partake of all the saving benefits and special priviledges thereof: which are union with Christ, as her head and Husband, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 23. 30. communion with Him in all the saving fruits of His Redemption, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating either to grace here, or glory hereafter, chap. 1. 3. together with that communion, which Believers have among themselves, in their mutuall partaking of the gifts and graces one of another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 25, 26. And to be deprived of all union and communion with Christs Church, is a wofull, sad, and miserable case: for, <hi>Paul</hi> maketh this the second branch of their misery, that they were <hi>aliens from the commonwealth of Israel.</hi> 6. So strait and nigh is that union betwixt Christ and His Church, that separation from, or union with the one, inferreth separation from, or union with the other: and in the same respect and degree, wherein men are separated from, or united with Christ, they are in some answerable respect and degree separated from, or united with His Church: for, the Apostle conjoyneth these two, as of equall extent; <hi>Ye were without Christ, as being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel.</hi> 7. As the Lord hath been graciously pleased to transact with man about that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which he oweth unto God, as his soveraign Lord and Creator, in the way of Covenant, or mutuall paction and agreement; wherein, for his better encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44180:228"/>
to discharge the duty required of him, the Lord doth assure him of a rich reward, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. So, the Covenant which God hath entered with fallen man, is a Covenant of promise, wherein the thing promised is freely given, and not for any worth in him to whom it is given: for, as his affirming that the Gentiles were strangers to the Covenants of promise, implyeth that the Church was no stranger to the Covenant, but that God did deal with them by way of Covenant; so the word <hi>promise</hi> in the Originall, signifieth a free promise, where the thing promised is freely bestowed; <hi>And stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Covenants of promise.</hi> 8. For men to live and die without an offer of the Covenant of grace made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them to be entered by them, is a wofull, sad, and dangerous case; for hereby they are not only deprived of all the priviledges of the visible Church, mentioned, <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. to which the tender of this gracious Covenant unto a people, and their professed subjection to it, doth give right, (the Covenant being the Churches Chartor, whereby she holdeth all these priviledges, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. with 39.) but their salvation in that case is also rendered in an ordinary way impossible, there being not so much as an offer of it, nor a making known unto them the terms and conditions whereupon salvation may be had: yea, and further, to be without an actuall interest and right to the saving blessings of that gracious Covenant, arising from the grace of saving faith, laying hold upon those blessings, and the offer of them in the Covenant, is a case in some respects no lesse lamentable, sad, and dangerous (which is the case of all who are unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, even though they be members of the visible Church, and so within the outward bond of the Covenant, and do enjoy the common blessings thereof, <hi>(Rom. 9. 4. Matth.</hi> 20. -16.) for, such are not only destitute of an claim and title to any of those spirituall blessings, which are offered in the rich and precious promises of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33, 34. and 32. 39, 40. but also shall have no advocate to plead for them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 23. are


<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44180:228"/>
bound to fulfill the whole Law, else they can never be saved, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 3. and have no strength allowed upon them for the fulfilling of it but their own, (for they are without Christ) must stand and fall at Gods tribunall, according to that dreadfull and terrible sentence of the Covenant of works, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. yea, it shall go worse with them in the great day, than with those who never heard the Gospel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 22. So that the case of such is most miserable: for, the Apostle maketh this the third branch of their misery, even that <hi>they were stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Covenants of promise,</hi> without all title or interest either to the outward priviledges, or saving blessings of that Covenant. 9. As those, who are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the offer of Christ in the Gospel, without the bounds of the visible Church, and the external bond of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, are in a case altogether hopelesse; their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation being in an ordinary way altogether impossible: So all unregenerate men, even those who are within the Church, and have no real interest in Christ, or the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving benefits of the Covenant of grace, by the grace of faith, and have no union or communion with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Church of sound Believers, all such are desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of the true and saving grace of hope for heaven and salvation, and those other good things promised in the Word, even that hope which is grounded upon the Word, <hi>(Psal.</hi> 119. 49.) and the mercies of God, <hi>(Psal.</hi> 147. 11.) and not upon our own performances, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22. and beareth up the heart under all discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 81. yea, and setteth the man who hath it upon the task of purifying his own heart, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. -3. All unregenerate men are destituted of this hope, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever false hopes, blind confidence, and daring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption they may entertain in their hearts, <hi>Deut</hi> 29. 19. for, the Apostle, having affirmed of those Ephesians, that at that time they were without Christ, &amp;c. he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth they were also <hi>without hope,</hi> that is, their salvation was in an ordinary way hopelesse, to wit, as they were without the offer of Christ, and the Doctrine of


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44180:229"/>
the Covenant, and they were destitute of the grace of hope, as being without actuall interest in Christ by faith, &amp;c. and unregenerate; <hi>having no hope.</hi> 10. To be wholly destitute of this true and saving grace of hope, is a most wofull, dangerous, and lamentable case: for hereby men do live in continuall hazard of spirituall shipwrack, being destitute of the anchor of their soul, <hi>Heh.</hi> 6. 19. hereby they are exposed to deadly blows from sin, Satan and worldly discouragements, being destitute of their helmet, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 17. hereby they want a necessary spur and incitement to diligence in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. yea, and hereby they cannot choose but die either in stupid senslesnesse, <hi>Job</hi> 21. 13. or in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate diffidence, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13. for, he maketh this the fourth branch of their misery, that they had no hope, which includeth mainly their wanting the grace of hope; <hi>having no hope,</hi> saith he. 11. There is no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, as we ought, or énjoying of Him, except we know Him in Christ, and come to Him by Christ: for, the Apostle maketh their being without Christ, and their being without God, to go together; <hi>And without God in the world,</hi> saith he. 12. As not only profane avowed Atheists are without God, but those also, who do not know the true God, and give not to Him that trust, love, fear and joy, above what they give unto any other thing else, and who do not labour to have Him made their own God; So to be thus without God, is a wofull, sad, and lamentable case, even the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of all that misery which any creature can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: for hereby God remaineth their enemy, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. All the creatures are against them, <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 18. and they themselves are under the drop of Gods eternall wrath and vengeance: (See, ver. -2.) for, the Apostle affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth here of those Ephesians, that before their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion they were without God, though even then they had some knowledge of the true God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19. and he mentioneth this in the last place, as the sum and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of all their misery, even <hi>that they were without God in the world.</hi>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. But now in Christ Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off, are made nigh by the bloud of Christ.</head>
                  <p>HEre beginneth the second branch of the second part of the Chapter, wherein is set forth the present happy estate of those Ephesians, together with the way how, and by whom this happy lot was purchased for them. And, first, he briefly propoundeth that blessed change which had befallen them, in so far as they, who were before <hi>afar off,</hi> to wit, from Christ, His Church, His Covenant, saving hope, and from God Himself, not through local distance, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. -27. but through want of saving interest, union and communion with God, with Christ and His Church by faith, hope, love, or professed subjection to Gods Law and Ordinances, as was explained, ver. 12. they, even they, were <hi>now made nigh</hi> to God, to Christ and His Church in the same sense. And withall he briefly sheweth, not only the way how all things requisit to that blessed change were purchased for them, to wit, by the merit of Christ's death upon the Crosse, which was the accomplishment of all His other sufferings and obedience, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 30. but also, how those things so purchased, were actually bestowed upon them, and applyed unto them, to wit, by their being in Christ, and by vertue of their union with Him.</p>
                  <p>Now as their distance, and severall pieces of their former misery did belong unto them in two respects; First, as they were without the visible Church; Secondly, as they were men unregenerate, in which respect, their misery was common to them with all the unregenerate, whether without, or within the Church, as was cleared, ver. 12. So what is here, and in the verses following spoken of their delivery, and present happy state, is in many things, at least, applicable, not only to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward state, as being a great many of them truely rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, justified and sanctified, and therefore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers


<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44180:230"/>
of the invisible Church of Believers; but also by proportion to their outward state, as being members of Christs visible Church, whereby they enjoyed many rich priviledges, (See ver. 12. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5.) And those also purchased by Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. 11. and conveyed to the visible Church, and every Church-member by reason of their visible and political union with him. <hi>Job.</hi> 15. 2. neither is Scripture hereby rendred ambiguous or doubtsome, as signifying two diverse things; for, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we look to the priviledges of true Believers, or of visible Church-members (the priviledges of the latter being the enjoyment of those blessings in the offer of the Gospel, and a living under such means and ordinances by which God useth to convey those blessings, the actual possessing of which, or present right unto which, are the priviledges of reall Believers) or if we look to that which giveth them a right, each one to their respective priviledges, to wit, the grace of faith, and a mysticall and saving union with Christ upon the part of real Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and a profession of the doctrine of faith, either personally or parentally, and an external and politicall union with Christ upon the part of visible Church-members. I say, which of those be looked unto, we will find so much of likenesse and proportion betwixt what belongeth to the visible Church, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the invisible, that both may safely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ambiguity be taken up as intended by the Spirit of God to be expressed in one and the same Scripture; though the one more principally, and the other secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily, and as it were by proportion. As for example here, seing the nighnesse and happinesse, which visible Church-members enjoy, is only comparative, and with respect had to the greater misery of those who are wholly without the Church; and that it is but a misery and distance, being compared with that state of nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and happinesse which the truely Regenerate are brought unto; Therefore I conceive, that what is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of the delivery and blessed state, here spoken of,


<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44180:230"/>
was verified mainly and fully in the Regenerate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Church of Believers among them, and but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally only and in part in the visible Church of professors: and therefore I shall only collect such do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines as arise from it, being so considered.</p>
                  <p>Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The more nigh the consideration of our miserable and happy state be set together in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition the one to the other before the eye of the soul, it commendeth and sweetneth our happy state through grace the more: for, the Apostle's scope being to set forth the happinesse of that state, wherein free grace had placed them, he compriseth all their misery in one word, <hi>They were sometimes far off,</hi> and all their happinesse in another, <hi>they were now made nigh;</hi> And so giveth a joynt view of them both at once. 2. The People of God are not so to remember by past sin and misery, as to make them question the fruits of Gods mercy already received, or to despair of receiving more in time to come: for, having exhorted them (ver. 11.) to remember their former misery, in the first place, he exhorteth them here to remember that happy estate wherein mercy had placed them in the next; <hi>But now—ye are made nigh.</hi> 3. As it is the duty of Converts fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to remember their former sin and misery: (See Vers. 11. Doct. 2.) So also to call to minde, and confidently avow that gracious change which free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace hath wrought upon them in their conversion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as misbelief is ready to call it in question, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. -10- So the remembrance and avowing of it, is most profitable, in order to our own comfort against the sense of bypast or present sin and misery, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our incitement to the duty of walking suitably, chap. 4. 1. and to our incouragement against the fear of all imaginary difficulties, which may occur in our way to heaven and glory, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 6. and in order to our thankfulnesse unto God for His so rich mercy mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in our delivery, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. for, the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them to remember this in the second place, <hi>That


<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44180:231"/>
ye who were sometimes far off, are now made nigh.</hi> 4. As converting grace falleth often upon those who are most gracelesse, and at greatest distance from God, from Christ and His Church; So it bringeth those, upon whom it falleth, into a state of nearnesse to all those, because of these many nigh relations, under which they stand to God; as of servants, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. of friends, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. and sons, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. and to Christ, as of His Spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 8. members, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 30. bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 2. 11. And because of these sweet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences for the life and comfort of grace, which they receive daily from Him, as the members from the head, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 19. because of that near accesse, which they have unto God in Christ, both as to their state and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; whereof ver. 19. And because of that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and communion, which they have with the invisible Church of Believers, the congregation of the first-born (See <hi>Vers. 12. Doct.</hi> 5.) for, with relation mainly to this gracious change, which was wrought upon reall Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers among them in their regeneration, he saith, <hi>But now, yee, who sometimes were far off, are made nigh.</hi> 5. As this excellent state of nearnesse to God and His Church, wherein the truely regenerate do stand, and all those excellent privileges which flow from it, were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased for the Elect by no lesse price than the bloud of Christ, whose bloud was the bloud of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. -28. and therefore of infinit value; So none of those are actually bestowed upon, and applied unto the Elect, untill they be united to Christ, and in Him by saving faith, as the branches are in the root, from which they draw sap and nourishment: for, saith he, <hi>in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus ye are made nigh by the bloud of Christ;</hi> they were in Christ by faith, before they attained that state of near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which was purchased by His bloud.</p>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 14. For He is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us: 15. Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of Commandments, contained in Ordinances—</head>
                  <p>THe Apostle being, next, more largely to explain and prove what he hath briefly asserted, that the Gentiles were made nigh to God and His Church by the bloud of Christ, doth, first, confirm it by an argument taken from Christ's Priestly office, according to which He is not only the Mediator for peace, and peace-maker be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, and among men themselves; but He is also <hi>our peace,</hi> as being the propitiatory sacrifice, and having purchased this peace with His own bloud, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 5. and so the very cause and reason of this peace, is in Himself, and nothing extrinsicall to Himself. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he doth prove that Christ was their peace, by the effect produced by Him, and the matter of working this effect. The effect it self, is, that where before the Jews and Gentiles were irrecoverably separated by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their different Religion and religious Rites, He had now united them in one and the same Church, which is said to have been then done, because it was in part done: for, the rejecting of <hi>Israel,</hi> is only in part, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. -25- but the full accomplishment of it shall be when all <hi>Israel,</hi> and the fulnesse of the Gentiles, shall be called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. -25, 26- The manner of working this effect, is set down in three phrases, all signifying one thing, though different in regard of diverse considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. First, <hi>He broke down the middle wall of partition,</hi> whereby, as he explaineth himself in the following verse, is meaned the ceremonial Law, and it is called the <hi>middle wall of partition,</hi> or of a hedge and stone-wall (for, the Original signifieth both) with an eye, questionlesse, to to the wall, which was in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple between the court of the People and of the Gentiles, which hindered all manner of passage, sight, or communication betwixt


<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44180:232"/>
them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 42. 20. So the meaning is, that in order to this union He did abolish the legall ceremonies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Jews were distinguished from the Gentiles, as two houses, by a mid-wall going betwixt them, or as an inclosed Garden is separated from an out-field, by an hedge or dyke of rough stones, ver. 14. Secondly, He did <hi>abolish the enmity:</hi> by which, <hi>enmity</hi> is meaned the same ceremoniall Law, and that chiefly because it was the occasion of a perpetuall standing strife betwixt Jew and Gentile, while the Jew reproached the Gentile with uncircumcision and neglect of Gods worship, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 28. the Gentile again reproached the Jew with circumcision, and the rest of these Legall rites, which they judged unreasonable, irreligious and absurd, <hi>Esth.</hi> 3. 8. although those ceremoniall rites may be also called <hi>enmity</hi> with relation to God, in so far as the practising of them by the Jews was a real testimony and confession of their own guilt, and the enmity which was betwixt them and God. See <hi>Collos.</hi> 2. 14. And His withholding them from the Gentiles, was an evidence of His displeasure, and enmity against them, <hi>Ps.</hi> 147. 20. and here the Apostle expresseth the way, how Christ did abolish that enmity, or these ceremoniall rites, to wit, in <hi>His own flesh,</hi> that is, by His death, which He suffered in His flesh, or humane nature, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. -18- Thirdly, he expoundeth what he meant by the <hi>mid-wall</hi> and the <hi>enmity,</hi> which Christ abolished, even <hi>the Law of Commandments in ordinances.</hi> The first of which words, is more general, to wit, <hi>the Law,</hi> as comprehending, according to the custom of the Hebrew language, all Doctrine revealed to the Church, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 7. and this is astricted by the second word, which is more speciall, to wit, <hi>Commandments,</hi> signifying that Doctrine only, which commandeth what should be done, and forbiddeth what should not be done; and both those are astricted by the third, which is yet more special, to wit, <hi>Ordinances,</hi> whereby are meaned those Commandments only, which did relate to Gods exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44180:232"/>
worship, and were prescribed by God, as so many types and shadows of Christ to come, and of those good things which were purchased by Him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 9, 10. So that the Law and Commandments were only abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, as to that part of them which was contained in those Ordinances, ver. 15-.</p>
                  <p>From ver. 14. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Every man by nature in himself, and without Christ, is at war and enmity with God, with His Church, and chiefly those in the Church who are truely regenerate: he cannot be subject unto the Law of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. And, as therefore he hateth the Law-giver, and those who yeeld obedience to His Laws; So he is under the Law-givers curse, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. for, while the Apostle speaketh of making those Ephesians nigh to God and His Church by Christ, he saith, <hi>Christ was their peace:</hi> which implyeth that their distance from those consisted in hatred of, and enimity against them; <hi>for he is our peace,</hi> saith he. 2. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity chiefly, which is between God and fallen man, was irreconciliable, and impossible to be removed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Jesus Christ that great high Priest and Prince of Peace had shed His bloud and suffered death, by the merit whereof, as He hath given satisfaction to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. So by the efficacy and vertue thereof He subdueth that rebellious disposition against God, which naturally is in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. and maketh us accept the offer of friendship and reconciliation with God, and yeeld our selves servants to righteousnesse un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to holinesse, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 31. and so upon both hands He maketh peace: for, saith he, <hi>He is our peace,</hi> to wit, <hi>by His bloud,</hi> spoken of in the preceeding verse. 3. The uniting of both Jew and Gentile in one Church, is a branch of that peace which Christ hath purchased with His bloud: And that not only, because their actuall union was, according as God in His wise counsel had decreed, to follow upon Christs death, and not to go before it (See upon <hi>Gal. 3. vers. 14. Doct.</hi> 4.) but also in order to this union, the Law of ceremonies behoved


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44180:233"/>
to be abolished, See <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. and this called for Christs death; See <hi>vers. 15. Doct.</hi> 4. for, the Apostle having asserted that Christ was their peace by His bloud, he giveth this as an instance, or effect of His so being, <hi>Who hath made both one.</hi> 4. From the Apostles design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ceremoniall Law by a metaphor taken from houses divided by a mid-wall, or from an orchard, garden or inclosure, separated from the out-field, by a dyke or wall of rough stones, We learn, several things relating to the nature, use and duration of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law, which are the grounds of the similitude. And, first, as a wall is builded by the owner of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure, So the ceremonial Law was of Gods own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, who only had power to choose what part of the world He thought fit, to be an inclosure for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 8. and to appoint these means and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, whereby He would have them inclosed and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from others, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 40. Secondly, as a rough wall is made up of so many hard unpolished stones, not covered over with lime or plaister; So the ceremoniall Law consisted of many Ordinances, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 10. and those very difficult to be obeyed, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable yoke, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. Thirdly, as a wall or hedge incloseth a peece of ground for the owners special use, (which therefore is more painfully manured) and separateth that inclosure from the out-field which lyeth about it; So the ceremoniall Law did serve to inclose the people of Israel, as the Lords own garden and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, for bringing forth fruit unto Himself, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 7. and to separate them from all the world besides, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 7, 8. as being a worship wholly different from, and contrary unto the superstitious rites and worship used among the Gentiles, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 2. and containing strict injunctions unto the Jews to avoid all conformity with the Gentiles in their garments, <hi>Num.</hi> 15. 38. cutting of their hair, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19 27. and such like. Fourthly, as a rough wall is but weak and ruinous, as not being built with ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or morter, to make it strong, and therefore but to


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44180:233"/>
endure for a season, untill the owner think fit to enlarge his inclosure, and take-in more of the open field; So the ceremoniall Law was not to last for ever, but only for a time, untill Christ should come in the flesh, and take in the Gentiles within the inclosure of His Church, who were before an open field, not possessed, nor ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nured by Him, after which there was no further use of the mid-wall; <hi>And hath broken down the mid-wall of partition between us,</hi> saith he, meaning the ceremoniall Law. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. So long as the ceremoniall Law did stand in force and vigour, the Jews and Gentiles could not be united into one Church: for, seing by that Law the chief parts of Gods worship were astricted to the Temple at Jerusalem, therefore, though scattered pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes of the neighbouring Nations did joyn themselves to the Church of the Jews, and in some measure ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the way of Worship then enjoyned, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 27. yet there was a physicall impossibility for the generality of many Nations far remote from Jerusalem, to have served God according to the prescript of Worship, which then was: besides, there was such an habituate, and, as it were, an naturall antipathy transmitted from one generation unto another among the Gentiles against the ceremoniall worship; that there was little lesse than a morall impossibility of bringing up the body of the Gentiles unto a cordiall joyning with the Jews in it: for, the Apostle sheweth the ceremoniall Law behoved to be abrogated, in order to an union betwixt these two, while he saith, <hi>Who hath made both one, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down the middle-wall of partition between us.</hi> 6. Whoever would make peace betwixt God and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or betwixt himself and others, he ought seriously to think upon those things which stand in the way of peace, and set about the removall of them, if it be in his power, and chiefly those evils in himself, of pride, vain-glory, self-seeking, and a contentious disposition, which are great obstructions in the way of peace, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 3, 4. else, what ever be his pretences for peace, he is


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44180:234"/>
no real follower of it: for, Christ, intending to make peace betwixt Jew and Gentile, did take away what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might have impeded it; <hi>He even broke down the middle wall of partition between them.</hi>

                  <p>From ver. 15- <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As Gods people in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Him, ought to be highly incensed against, and averse from any voluntary intire fellowship with those who neglect and contemn the Ordinances of Worship prescribed by God in His Word; So those who are without the Church, yea and all unregenerate men do look upon the ordinances of Gods Worship, as base, ridiculous and contemptible, and carry a kind of hatred and disdain to all such as make conscience of them: for, so the ancient Worship, prescribed in the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law, was the occasion of hatred and enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Gentile, who contemned it, and the Jew, who made conscience of it. And therefore is here called the <hi>enmity; having abolished the enmity.</hi> 2. As the morall Law contained in the Ten Commandments, was no part of that mid-wall of partition between Jew and Gentile; seing some of the draughts and lineaments of that Law are upon the hearts of all by nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. So there was no necessity to abrogate this Law at Christs death in order to the uniting of Jew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile; neither was it at all abolished: for, the Law abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, was <hi>the Law,</hi> not simply, but <hi>the Law of Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and these not all, but such Commandments as were <hi>contained in Ordinances,</hi> to wit, the ceremoniall Law, as we shew in the Exposition; <hi>Even the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances,</hi> saith he. 3. As God only hath power and liberty to prescribe what manner of Worship He will be served by; So He did once give a most observable evidence of this His power and liberty, by changing that externall way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which was prescribed by Himself under the Old Testament, unto another under the New, although the internals of His Worship, to wit, the graces of faith, love, hope, joy in God, do remain the same in both;

                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 37, 39. for, He <hi>did abolish the Law of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments contained in Ordinances,</hi> even all the ancient Worship consisting in rites and ceremonies, sensible and fleshly observations, which God did then prescribe, not as simply delighted in them, but as accomodating Himself to the childish condition of the Church in those times, and hath now appointed a more spirituall way of Worship, as more suitable to the grown age of the Church, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 21. 23. See further the reasons why the ceremoniall-Law was abolished, and concerning that state of indifferency, wherein the practice of it was left for a time, upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. ver. 3. <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. and ver. 4. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. 4. It was Christs sufferings and death, which put an end to the Law of ceremonies, and made the binding power thereof to cease: for, seing His sufferings were the body and substance of all those shadows, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did nor could evanish untill Christ had suffered, but then they did; it being impossible that a shadow, and the body, whereof it is a shadow, can consist in one and the same place; <hi>Having abolished in His flesh the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, thirdly, for further clearing of what he spoke, ver. 13. that the Gentiles were made nigh to God and His Church in the bloud of Christ, holdeth forth two ends, which Christ proposed to be brought about in His abolishing the ceremoniall Law. First, that He might by a manner of new creation make of those two Nations, of Jew and Gentile, being firmly united to Himself as to their head, one people and Church, here called <hi>one new man,</hi> to shew the intimacy of that union, as also the way how they were united, not by bringing any one of them to the fashions and


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44180:235"/>
customes of the other; for, so they should have been made <hi>one old man,</hi> but by bringing both off that way of worship whereon they were: the Gentile, both from the substance and external manner of their worship, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been wholly idolatrous, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 8. The Jew, only from the external manner of their worship, consisting in fleshly and sensible rites and observations, whereby He made them one new Church, with new Ordinances of divine worship, even such as the Church now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth under the Gospel: and so he concludeth the vers. by shewing that Christ did hereby accomplish what he had spoken of Him, ver. 13, and 14-. Even that He had made peace betwixt the two Nations, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Gentiles nigh to the Church by His own bloud: this is ver. -15. The second end why Christ did abolish the ceremonial Law, was, that He might reconcile both Jew and Gentile, being so united among themselves in one body, unto a provoked God; which He did by the sacrifice of His own soul and body upon the crosse, by the means whereof he did destroy that enmity which was betwixt God and man, aswell the sin of the Elect both in its guilt <hi>(Rom.</hi> 8. 1.) and power, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 6. which was the ground and cause of that enmity, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 2. as the ceremoniall Law, which was an evidence of it. See upon ver. 15-. This is the sum of ver. 16.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. -15. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Union in the Church of Christ, is a thing which ought to be prized by us highly, and sought after earnestly; and so much, as there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our power which we ought not to bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and dispense with for the acquiring and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of it: for, so much was it prized by Christ, that He gave his own life to procure it, and did beat down all His own Ordinances which stood in the way of it; <hi>He even abolished in His flesh the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances, for to make, of twain, one new man.</hi> 2. There are no divisions more hardly curable, than those which are about the Religion and Worship of


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44180:235"/>
God, in so far as they engage, not only the credit but also the consciences of the divided parties: hence one party, so engaged, doth pursue what they maintain, as that wherein Gods honour and their own salvation are most nearly concerned, and doth look upon the other party, as an adversary in so far at least, to both of those: for, the Apostle, speaking of Christs uniting the Jew and Gentile in one Church and Religion, maketh use of a word which sheweth this was a task of no small diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, even such, that no lesse than creating power was required to it, while he saith, <hi>for to make in Himself,</hi> (the word signifieth <hi>to creat in Himself) of twain, one new man.</hi> 3. So strict and near is that conjunction and union which is especially among true believers in the Church, that all of them, how far soever dispersed through the world, do yet make up but one man and one body; as being all, whatever be their other differences, most strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united, as members unto one head, Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. and animated, as to the inward man, by the same Spirit of God, residing and acting in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. for, the Apostle sheweth, that all of them, whether Jew or Gentile, were made, not only one people, one nation, one family, but one new man; <hi>For to make, of twain, one new man.</hi> 4. As the essentiall unity of the invisible Church, without which the Church could not be a Church, doth of necessity depend upon, and flow from that union, which every particular member hath with Christ, as Head; seing the grace of love (whereby they are knit one to another, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 14) doth flow from faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. -6. whereby they are united to Him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. So, the more our union with Christ is improved unto the keeping of constant communion and fellowship with Him, the more will be attained unto of harmonious walking among our selves, suitable unto that essentiall union which is in the Church of Christ: for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle maketh the conjunction of Jews and Gentiles in one Church, to depend upon Christ's uniting of them to himself; <hi>For to make in Himself, of twain, one new man,</hi> saith


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44180:236"/>
he. 5. The peace which ought to be, and which Christ calleth for in His Church, is not a simple cessation from open strife, which may take place, even when there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth a root of bitternesse in peoples spirits, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 21. but it is such an harmonious walking together in all things as floweth from the nearest conjunction of hearts, and the total removal of all former bitternesse of spirits: for, the peace which Christ did make betwixt Jew and Gentile, did follow upon His abolishing the enmity, and making them one man; <hi>so making peace,</hi> saith he.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 16. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Union and peace with men, even with good men, is to little purpose, except there be peace and friendship with God also: for, the Apostle sheweth, that Christ, in abolishing the ceremonial Law, did design not only the conjunction of the Church among themselves, but their reconciliation with God also, and the former in subordination to the latter; <hi>And that He might reconcile both unto God, in one body.</hi> 2. As all mankind have fallen from that state of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with God, wherein they once were before the fall, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 29. So, the repairing of this wofull breach, and making up of friendship betwixt God and the Elect, was Christ's great businesse in the world; for effectua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting whereof, whatever He did or suffered, was in some one way or other subservient: for, the Apostle sheweth He suffered in the flesh, abolished the ceremonial Law, united the two Nations, <hi>that He might reconcile both unto God in one body.</hi> The word rendred <hi>reconcile,</hi> signifieth the making up of old friendship. 3. Though the believing Jews under the Old Testament, were reconciled unto God, even while the ceremonial Law stood in force, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 4. Yet the price, by vertue whereof they were reconciled, could not be actually payed, to wit, Christ's death and sufferings, except the ceremonial Law had presently evanished, (See Ver. 15- Doct. 4.) neither could Jew and Gentile be united together in one body, and so reconciled to God, while that Law was in force and binding. See Vers. 14. Doct. 5. Therefore, and in


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44180:236"/>
those respects, it was necessary for Christ to abolish the ceremonial Law that He might reconcile both Jew and Gentile unto God: for, so saith <hi>Paul, He abolished the Law of Commandments in Ordinances—that He might recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile both unto God in one body.</hi> 4. There can be no recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation betwixt God and us, except we be united by faith to Christ, and to the body of all Believers in Him; So that none can be one with God who are not of the mysticall body of His Church: yea, and in so far will the sense and sweet effects of reconciliation with God be interrupted and obstructed, as persons reconciled do give way unto divisions, rents and strifes among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: for, the Gentiles and Jews, being in one body with Christ and His Church, come to be reconciled unto God; <hi>That He might reconcile both unto God, in one body,</hi> that is, being united among themselves in one body under Christ the head, as is affirmed, vers. 15. 5. As Jesus Christ did interpose as mediator and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker to reconcile God and us; So He behoved, in order unto this end, to bear the chastisment of our peace, and to lay down His life by a shamefull, painfull and cursed death; that so, the justice of God being fully satisfied for our wrong, we might enjoy God's peace and favour with life: for, he sheweth the mean of their reconciliation, was the crosse of Christ, not the material tree or matter of the crosse, but Christ's sufferings and death upon the crosse; <hi>That He might reconcile both unto God in one body by the crosse.</hi> 6. Christ in suffering Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be overcome by death, did fully destroy sin, death, the ceremonial Law, and every other thing which could impede the reconciliation of the Elect with God, He, having thereby brought-in the substance of all those legal shadows, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 17. satisfied the justice of God, and purchased grace and strength, which afterwards He was to convey unto all Believers for mortifying and subduing the body of sin and death in them, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 31. for saith <hi>Paul, He hath slain the enmity thereby,</hi> that is, by the crosse, and His death upon the crosse; So that by being slain, He slew the enmity betwixt God and us.</p>

And, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he sheweth to whom he did publish it, first, to the Gentiles who were far off, (See <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39) being compared with the Jews; as being without the bounds of the visible Church. Now, Christ preached to the Gentiles, not immediately and in His own person, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 24. except to some few, who were first-fruits of the rest, <hi>Mat. 8. 5, &amp;c.</hi> and 15. 28. but mediately and by the ministery of His Apostles, and their successors, the Ministers of the Gospel, whom He sent unto them to preach, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28 19, whose Ministery He doth alwayes accompany by His Spirit, to the conviction of some, and conversion of others; and therefore He himself is said to preach in them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. Next, to the Jews, who are said here to be nigh, because they were within the visible Church, and therefore (though many of them, being simply considered, were far from God; yet) they were nigh, being compared with the Gentiles, as living under the drop of the means of grace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.

Though we did commit the wrong which occasioned the enmity betwixt God and us, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 21. yet, not only the first motion, but the full prosecution and through compleating of the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, cometh from God through Christ, in so far as Christ did not only upon the crosse satisfie for our wrong, but also maketh an offer of friendship so pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased, in the ministry of the Word: yea, and bringeth us to a closing with the terms upon which it is offered, <hi>Joh. 6. 44.

So the publishing of this doctrine of peace, is the gladdest ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings which ever sounded in the ears of lost sinners: for, the Apostle, speaking of Christs preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, saith, <hi>He came and preached peace:</hi> the word ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>preached,</hi> doth signifie (and accordingly is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated, <hi>Rom. 10. 15.) to bring glad tydings.</hi> 4.

                     <hi>accesse,</hi> hath an allusion to the courts of Princes, where petitioners are admitted unto accesse to their Prince, even in the very presence-chamber. Concerning which accesse, he sheweth, first, that it is through Christ, He having removed all those obstructions and impediments which might have marred it. And, secondly, that it is by the one Spirit of God, who doth create, preserve, quicken, and actuate those graces, in the exercise where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they obtained accesse unto God. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. One main fruit and evidence of reconciliation is accesse unto God, whereby reconciled souls have not only li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to approach unto God in the enjoyment of all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Ordinances, (which accesse is the priviledge of all within the visible Church, whether they be reconciled or not, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19.) but also freedom, and liberty of spirit to approach unto God in the exercise of all their saving graces, by which they do enjoy communion with God, and especially in the confident, bold and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent exercising of their faith, both as to the change of their state in justification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. and as to their sanctification, and all the duties thereof, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 13. which accesse to God, is chiefly attained in the duties of prayer and praise, as having God for their direct and immediate object. This is that accesse, which in some measure floweth from peace and reconciliation with God, and is an evidence of it: for, the Apostle proveth, that the Gospel was effectually preached in order to their peace and reconciliation, because they had accesse to God; <hi>We both have accesse to the Father.</hi> 2. There can be no accesse, or familiar approaching unto God by sinners, who are not in Jesus Christ, and come not to God through Him; seing God is a consuming fire unto such, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 29. Their sins having divided betwixt Him and them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 2. and so closed up all accesse unto God, untill Jesus Christ do apply unto them the merit of His death, whereby He blotteth out their sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. and bringeth them unto a state of favour with God, and so maketh a patent door for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse

Christ is the only Mediator betwixt God and man, by whom alone we have accesse and liberty to approach unto God in the exercise of our graces, whether in the duty of prayer, or any other way, and not by the mediation of Saints or Angels: for, saith he, <hi>through him we have an access,</hi> or manuduction <hi>to the father.</hi> 4. This accesse, and approaching unto God, is not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call by passing from one place to another; especially seing there is no place, wherein accesse to God may not be had, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 21. 23. but it is spirituall, consisting in the motion of the heart towards God, in the exercise of saving and spirituall graces: for, so much is implied, while this accesse is ascribed unto the Spirit, as the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient thereof; <hi>We have an accesse by the spirit.</hi> 5. It is not sufficient, in order to our accesse unto God, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions be removed, and a door made patent by Christs merit and intercession, through which we may enter; but, such is partly our impotency, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. -5. and partly our aversnesse from making use of the offered opportunity, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 17, 18, &amp;c. that except the Spirit of God do cause us enter, by creating spirituall graces in us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. by actuating, and exciting those graces, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16. and especially by helping our infirmities in prayer, and stirring up a vehement flame of holy and ardent affections, which may serve, as wings, to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate our spirits to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. Except, I say, the Spirit of the Lord did thus, we could not otherwise have any accesse unto God: for, he saith, <hi>through him we have an accesse by one spirit.</hi> 6.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44180:239"/>
to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace; there being nothing, that marreth accesse to God, and fellowship with Him more, than imbittered spirits, and division of heart among the people of God, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 13. 11. for, therefore doth the Apostle mention the one Spirit of God, to shew, that the Spirit doth unite those among themselves, upon whom this rich blessing of accesse is bestowed; <hi>We both have an accesse by one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> 7. As there are three distinct persons in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, the Father, Son, and Spirit; So the enjoying of the Father, is the highest happinesse, which can be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and in which the soul doth rest content, when it is attained; the Son again is the way, by which we come to the Father; and the Spirit our guide, which causeth us enter this way, and go alongs in it: all which is clearly hinted at here; <hi>through Him,</hi> that is, Christ, <hi>we have an accesse by one Spirit to the Father.</hi>

porch thereof, and having her own answerable privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, which are in some measure proportionall to those of the invisible Church; yet, seing (as was shewed formerly upon the exposition of ver 13.) those excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things, here spoken of, are not fully, and to their outmost perfection verified in any, but in the invisible Church and the truly regenerate, the members thereof; Therefore I shal open up the mind of the Spirit of God, as aiming mainly at those, and give the meaning of those excellent things here mentioned, as they apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain chiefly to such, in the mean time, leaving it unto the judicious Reader to gather from what is said, how, and in what respects they are applicable unto the visible Church. And so that we may enter the exposition of the words, The Apostle setteth forth their present happy condition, first, negatively, by shewing what they were not, neither <hi>strangers nor forreigners,</hi> whereby with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion to those, who are not free-men of an Incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or City, but either <hi>strangers</hi> (that is, such who have neither the freedom of the City, nor a place of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation in it, but have their residence far from it,) or <hi>forreigners,</hi> (that is, such, who though they have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence in the City, yet are not free-men, but sojourners for a season,) he sheweth that the second branch of their former misery, spoken of, ver. 12. which includeth all the rest (even their being aliens from the commonwealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> deprived of all union and communion, either with the invisible or visible Church) was now removed. Secondly, he setteth forth their present blessed condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion positively, under three similitudes, whereof two are in this verse. In the first, he compareth the whole Church, and especially the invisible Church of true Believers unto a City, and sheweth that those believing Ephesians had a right unto all the priviledges, and immunities of that city, the chief whereof are freedom from Gods curse, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 3. and a right unto eternal life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. -5. And this they had equally with all the other citizens and free members of that


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44180:240"/>
City; for, the chiefest Saints were but their <hi>fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.</hi> In the second similitude, he compareth the same Church unto an houshold, or family, and calleth it Gods houshold, affirming, that all of those believing Ephesians did belong to this houshold. So that he doth hereby expresse a greater degree of nearnesse to, and communion with, God and His Church, which they had attained unto, than was set forth by the former si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude; there being a straiter ty of familiarity and friendship between the members of one family among themselves, and with the master of the house, than is between the members of one city, whether among themselves, and with their Magistrates and Rulers. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. So apt are even good men to be exalted above measure with the excellent things of God bestowed upon them, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. 7. that it is not safe at any time to think upon those things, except our former misery and vilenesse be joyntly thought upon also, that so we may be keeped humble: for, the Apostle, while he is of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to set forth their excellent priviledges, doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurely present their former misery unto their view also, by saying, <hi>ye are no more strangers and forreigners,</hi> which implieth they were once so. 2. As it is not an easie matter to convince sinners of their lost and miserable estate by nature; So it is no lesse difficulty, when they are once made truely sensible of sin and misery, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them throughly of these riches which are in Gods mercy, and of that blessed estate which they are brought unto by Gods free grace in Christ: for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle findeth it necessary, not only to assert there was a gracious change wrought in them, ver. 13. but also in the following verses to shew forth all the causes of this most blessed change, from which he doth here by an undeniable consequence lay down this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: <hi>Now therefore ye are no more strangers and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners.</hi> 3. That we may highly prize, and think aright of Gods mercy in Christ manifested to Believers, we would look upon it, both in the privative and positive


<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44180:241"/>
effects thereof, both in those evils of sin and misery, which He delivereth from, and those saving blessings, whether relating to grace here, or glory hereafter, which He doth confer and bestow: for, so doth the Apostle here set forth the rich effects of Gods grace towards those Ephesians, both negatively and positively; <hi>ye are no more strangers, but fellow-citizens.</hi> 4. Though Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers be strangers in the world, as to their outward condition; some having no certain place of abode, but driven from their own habitations, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. and all of them being disposed to look upon earth as a strange countrie, and the contentments thereof as uncertain, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, and therefore not their own, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 14. Yet they are not strangers unto, but citizens of that city, not made with hands, even the blessed society of the Saints, in which they live, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 20. unto whose privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges they have a right, and shall at last be brought to the full possession of all its outmost blessings and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities in heaven, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 2. 3. for, it is in this respect he faith, <hi>ye are no more strangers, and forreigners.</hi> 5. The state and priviledges of Gods Church consisting of all true Believers, are such, as fitly may be represented by some great Incorporation or City, which is a society of people joyned together under one Magistracy, ruled by the same Laws, enjoying the same common priviledges and immunities, and strongly defended by walls and bulwarks: In like manner all Believers are united under Christ their supream Magistrate and Head, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. -21. living under one common Law, the will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Scripture, which is also written in their hearts by that one Law-giver, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. enjoying one and the same common priviledges, (not only accesse to divine Ordinances, but) of Justification, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 8. 30.) Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>(Eph.</hi> 1. 5.) Sanctification, <hi>(Eph.</hi> 5. 26.) peace of conscience, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 5. 1.) and a right to heaven, the inheritance of the Saints, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. and all of them having Gods special protection, <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 1. yea, and salvation for walls and bulwarks, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 1. for, this


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44180:241"/>
similitude, whereby the Church is compared to a city, is implyed, while it is said, <hi>Ye are fellow-citizens with the Saints.</hi> 6. Though those, who are federally holy, and externally Saints, (See upon <hi>Philip. 1. ver. 1. doct.</hi> 5.) are members of this City, as it speaketh a society of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible professors, <hi>Psal.</hi> 48. 8. yet only those, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herently holy, their natures being renewed, the seeds of saving grace implanted and growing up unto good works, only such, I say, are free members of this City, as it speaketh the society of the Church invisible, who enjoy immunity from Gods wrath and curse, with an actual right unto eternal life: for, that the Saints only are free members of this City, is implyed, while he saith, <hi>Fellow-citizens with the Saints.</hi> 7. Whatever differences are among Believers, as to their worldly condition, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 5, 9. their severall functions in the Church visible, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. and their different degrees of gifts and graces, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. Yet, all of them do enjoy an equall right to all those saving blessings of the Covenant of Grace, the Charter of this Incorporation, <hi>(Isa.</hi> 56. 4.) which are of absolute necessity to the life of grace here, or of glory hereafter, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 11. and without which none can be a free Burgesse of this City: for, he maketh the believing Ephesians <hi>fellow-citizens with the Saints,</hi> even the chiefest of them, as having the same right with them unto all such immunities and priviledges. 8. As the whole society of the invisible Church chiefly is Gods own great houshold and family in a peculiar manner, and is therefore admitted to a most near and intimate communion with Him, such as a man hath with his own domesticks, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 20. yea, and is in a speciall way provided and cared for by Him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. So, whenever a man is reconciled to God by the bloud of Jesus Christ, he becometh a member of this holy and blessed family, and enjoyeth all the priviledges thereof, whereof this is one, in which it differeth from other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, that in this houshold there are no mercenary ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but all the domesticks are sons and heirs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.


<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44180:242"/>
12. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 24. for, by the houshold of God he meaneth the catholick Church, affirming that those Ephesians upon their reconciliation with God became members of it; <hi>And of the houshold of God,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>IN the third similitude he compareth the Church unto an edifice or stately building, and sheweth that those Ephesians were a part of it. Which similitude doth hold forth a further degree of nearnesse to, and communion with God and His Church, than the former; in so far as the stones of an edifice are most strictly joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, both with the foundation and amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: and herein he doth, doubtlesse, allude to <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, which did prefigure the Church of the truly Regenerate.</p>
                  <p>And, first, that he may with greater clearnesse set forth this their happy condition, he doth describe this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, stately, and, in several things, admirable edifice from four things. First, in this verse, from its foundation, or that which doth support the weight of the building, which he calleth the <hi>foundation of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;</hi> whereby is not meaned, that the Prophets and Apostles in their own persons are the foundation of the Church; for, they are built, as lively stones, with the rest of the Elect, upon the foundation, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 8, 9. And therefore we must hereby understand the foundation, which was laid by them as wise master-builders under God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9. 10. to wit, the Doctrine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apostles, or rather Jesus Christ the sum and scope of their Doctrine, <hi>Rom. 10. 4. 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 2. as the Apostle expoundeth himself, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 11. and is clear from <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 16. to which place he doth here allude, and which is also more plainly set forth in the close of this same verse, where the Apostle proveth, that they


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44180:242"/>
were built upon that foundation; because Christ is that corner-stone, spoken of, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 16. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. 22. So that the foundation and corner-stone must be both one in this place, seing he inferreth the one from the other, only with this difference, that Christ is not only the lowest corner-stone, which lyeth under the whole building, and is a part of the foundation, to which corner-stone He is compared, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28. 16. but He is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the highest, to which He is compared, <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. 22. Yea, and such a corner-stone as reacheth all alongs the angle from the foundation to the top of the building, binding the two walls of the Church together, which are the two Nations of Jews and Gentiles: for, the word in the Originall signifieth the <hi>extream corner-stone,</hi> that is, both the highest and the lowest, and consequently compriseth all which ly between those two extreams: neither doth the word imply, that there are any other subordinate, or secundary foundations, or corner-stones, seing the word is better rendered <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream corner</hi> than <hi>chief. Doct.</hi> 1. Those excellent privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges bestowed upon Believers, consisting in, and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from union and communion with Christ and His Church, are of such a spirituall, sublime and divine nature; and we are so carnall, dull and slow of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, that there are no proper significant words, whereby to expresse them so as we may understand them: for, therefore is it, that the Spirit of God doth speak of them to us in our own language, and taketh similitudes from things earthly to set them forth, that so we may, at least, understand somewhat of them, as here he maketh use of a similitude taken from a stately building for that end; <hi>And are built upon the foundation.</hi> 2. So excellent and full are those priviledges, and so compleat is that happinesse, which is enjoyed by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that not any one similitude, taken from earthly things, can fully, or in any measure satisfyingly set them forth: for, therefore is it, that the Spirit of God doth multiply similitudes to this purpose, that what is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44180:243"/>
in one, may be supplied by another; as here, having set forth the happy state of Believers from the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, first of a city, next of a family, ver. 19. he doth in this verse add a third similitude, taken from an edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; <hi>And are built upon the foundation,</hi> saith he. 3. So steadable is Jesus Christ unto Believers, and of such uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal use, in order to their being built up in one temple unto God, that there is not any one piece of a building, by which His steadable usefulnesse can be sufficiently represented. He is not only the foundation-stone, who, being the first stone which was laid in the building, <hi>(Rev.</hi> 13. 8.) doth support this whole spirituall edifice, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. who was brought so low by His suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and dayly in the preaching of the Gospel, that the meanest Believer may be rolled upon Him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. and upon whom the weights of all Believers great and small do hing, <hi>Isa.</hi> 22. 24. but He is also the corner-stone, who reacheth from the foundation to the top of this spirituall edifice, and joyneth Jew and Gentile, the two walls of the Church, together in one, (see ver. 15.) yea, and all particular Believers are united in Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. -22, 23. who breaketh the violent blasts of all those storms, which would otherwise over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the edifice, <hi>Isa.</hi> 25. 4. and use to beat most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently upon the corners of buildings, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 19. who also is the choice of the stones of the building, (as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-stones use to be, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 26.) as being of more durable substance, even the great and mighty God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 6. and is in His humane nature adorned and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished with a variety and fulnesse of created graces above His fellows, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 7. as corner-stones are more curiously ingraven and wrought than the rest of the building, <hi>Psal.</hi> 144. 12. in whose stability and strength, the strength of the whole spirituall edifice <hi>(Matth.</hi> 16. 18.) and of every lively stone thereof doth consist, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 28. as the strength of an artificiall building consisteth in the goodnesse of the foundation and corners, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 24, 25. for, the Apostle, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44180:243"/>
of this spirituall edifice, giveth unto Christ the place both of foundation and corner, while he saith, <hi>Ye are built upon the foundation of the Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief</hi> (or <hi>extream) corner-stone.</hi> 4. That any man be a part of this spirituall edifice, and do par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of all those glorious priviledges which flow from union and communion with God and His Church, and are enjoyed by all the lively stones of this building, he must be built upon Christ the foundation, taking band upon Him by the cement of lively faith: for, the Apostle, shewing that those Ephesians were a part of this spirituall building, saith they were built on Christ; <hi>And are built upon the foundation.</hi> 5. There is no closing with, &amp; taking band upon Christ aright as a foundation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, or rock for salvation, except He be conceived and accepted of, as He is revealed and offered in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old and New Testament; for, He is called the <hi>foundation of the Prophets and Apostles,</hi> to wit, whom they set forth and placed as a foundation in the Church by their Doctrine and Writings. 6. Though God Himself be the principall author and builder of this spirituall edifice, <hi>Isa. 28. 16. 1 Corinth.</hi> 3. 6. Yet, He imployeth His called Ministers and Servants, as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under Him, for carrying on this work, among whom He did make speciall use of the Prophets and Apostles for laying the foundation, in so far, as they first did reveal and preach Jesus Christ, and commit to writing such truths concerning Him, as are necessary for salvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 31. while other ordinary Ministers are imployed in the preaching of Jesus Christ, as He is revealed in Scripture, to build up the Elect upon the foundation, which was laid by them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. for, he calleth Christ the <hi>foundation of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> that is, whom they placed in the Church by their Doctrine and Writings, by which He maketh them to differ from ordinary Ministers; <hi>And are built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles.</hi> 7. There is a sweet harmony and full agreement between the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine


<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44180:244"/>
and Writings of the Prophets and Apostles: as in all other things; so especially, in holding forth Jesus Christ for a foundation and rock of salvation unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; the latter having taught and written nothing, but what was partly prefigured in types, and partly foretold in prophesies by the former, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 22, 23. for, <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, that the same foundation, Christ, was laid by both, while he saith, <hi>Built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles.</hi> 8. How little ground the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists have from this, or any other Scripture, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously to teach, that the Pope is the foundation of the universal Church visible, in whose voice and sentence the faith of all Believers ought to be determined and built, appeareth not only from the meaning of the words asserted in the exposition, but also from this, that all the Apostles are spoken of, as having equal influence upon this foundation, so that <hi>Peter,</hi> whose successor the Pope doth plead himself to be, had no privilege in this above the rest; for, he saith, <hi>Ye are built upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Prophets and Apostles.</hi> 9. Though men are easily moved to combine together in ill, <hi>Psal.</hi> 83. 3. as being naturally inclined to it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. yet, such is the antipathy of every man by nature unto that which is truely good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 12. and unto all other men in that which is good; that nothing lesse was required for uniting all the Elect among themselves, so, as to make them joyntly endeavour the bringing about of Gods glory in their own salvation, than that Jesus Christ should interpose as an arbiter with power, causing the parties at variance to be at peace and become a center, wherein all those scattered lines might meet, and a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, wherein the severall walls and stones of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are conjoyned: for, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> it was necessary, in order to this union, that <hi>Jesus Christ himself should be the extream corner-stone.</hi>

                  <p>THis stately edifice is described, secondly, from the artificiall and altogether divine structure, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, of all its parts, which is the beauty of any building. This orderly frame and curious structure of the Church, consisteth in these two. First, That the whole edifice, and all its parts are firmly joyned <hi>in him,</hi> that is, in Christ the foundation, to wit, by faith; their life being framed according to His prescript and example, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. and their faith imbracing Him, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as He is held forth in the Word, without addition or diminution, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 6. even as the whole frame of a materiall building is made conform to the foundation. Next, That all the parts of this edifice are strongly joyned together among themselves by the grace of love, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 14. and orderly situate, every one acting towards the good of another in their severall stations, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. 25. 26. in so far, as they are regenerate, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are parts of this building, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. -5- even as all the parts of a materiall building have a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious correspondency one to another, and thereby are fitly framed together. This edifice is described, thirdly, from its perpetuall increase and growth, flowing also from Christ the foundation: which growth is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, not only with respect to the whole body of the Church, which groweth by the addition of new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, <hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 3. but also, and mainly to every member in particular, which do increase and grow in gifts and graces, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. And lastly, it is described from the end intended in rearing up this stately growing edifice, even to be an holy temple unto God, wherein He may manifest His presence, and be perpetually served and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified as it was in <hi>Solomons</hi> temple, <hi>Psal. 132. 13. Doct.</hi> 1. Jesus Christ doth differ from the foundation of all other buildings in this, that the whole building, and every


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44180:245"/>
stone of it doth take immediate band upon the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all Believers being most intimately joyned to Him by faith, and not by the interveening mediation of others, as it is in materiall buildings: for, the Apostle sheweth, that all the building (no part thereof being excepted) is in Him, while he saith, <hi>In whom all the building.</hi> 2. As there is a strict conjunction, and a kind of proportion between Believers and Christ, as also among themselves, even such, as is branched forth in the exposition of this verse; so a great part of the strength and beauty of the Church, and of all its parts, consisteth in this conjunction and proportion; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more uncomely than for a Believer to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned unto Christ, either in his faith, or practice, and to other Believers in his coldrife affection to them, or his not acting orderly in his station for their good: for, the Apostle describeth this spirituall edifice from its divine structure and curious joyning of all its parts, as that, wherein a great part of its beauty and strength doth consist; <hi>In whom all the building fitly framed together.</hi> 3. As this spirituall edifice doth differ from other build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that not only the whole edifice, but also all the parts of it (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.) are indued with life; a life, which is wholly spirituall, and floweth from their union with Christ the foundation; So this life of theirs, is, for the time but imperfect, their spiritual graces having not as yet attained that fulnesse and strength which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: for, the Apostle, while he ascribeth a spiritual growth to all the building, doth imply both those, seing growth supponeth life, and want of just stature and perfection; <hi>In whom all the building groweth.</hi> 4. As growth in grace, is a priviledge which appertaineth to all the parts of this spirituall building who are yet on earth; so this growth of theirs, doth flow from their union and communion with Christ; and the more their union with Him be improved to the dayly extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of a renewed influence from Him, they cannot choose but thrive the better in this their spiritual growth:


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44180:245"/>
for, the Apostle ascribeth growth to all this building, and growth from their being in Christ, and vertue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Him; <hi>In whom all the building groweth,</hi> and <hi>in the Lord:</hi> which words, it seemeth, are added, to shew, that not only the first beginnings, but also the continued progresse and increase of grace do flow from the Lord Christ. 5. As growth of grace in every particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; So the increase of the Church in generall, by the addition of new converts, doth flow, not from created might, or power, <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. 6. but from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Jesus Christ, who, having the nations given Him for an inheritance, <hi>(Psal.</hi> 2. 8.) will in despight of all opposition, inlarge the bounds of His dominion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till He attain the full possession of all to whom He hath a right: for, this growth is to be understood also with respect to the whole body, by the addition of new mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; In which respect also the Apostle here saith, <hi>It groweth in the Lord.</hi> 6. As all Believers joyntly, and each Believer a part, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19.) are a temple for the Lord, wherein He doth manifest His speciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and wherein He will be worshipped, by offering up spirituall sacrifices of prayer, praises and all the duties of new obedience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. So, that they may be a temple indeed for this holy God, they must be much in the study of holinesse, as in that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh His house, <hi>Psal.</hi> 93. 5. for, the Apostle sheweth that this whole building groweth up to be a temple for God, and an holy temple; <hi>All the building groweth unto an holy temple.</hi> 7. The more that Believers do endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to grow in grace, without resting upon any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, they may expect the more of Gods speciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to be manifested in them, as in His own temple: for, it is the growing of this building mainly, which maketh it fit to be a temple for God; <hi>All the building groweth unto an holy temple.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle doth now, in the next and last place, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply what he hath said of this spirituall edifice, and of the Churches happy estate under that similitude unto those believing Ephesians in particular, by shewing, that even they were built up together with all other sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Believers upon Jesus Christ the foundation, and for this end, that they might be a place of habitation, where God might dwell, as manifesting His speciall presence in them, by the saving operations of His holy Spirit. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That our faith may be saving, and our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort solid, it is necessary, not only that we know and believe those excellent priviledges which belong to the Church of God in generall: But we must also, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the due order, make application of them unto our selves in particular: for, <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth so much, while, having set forth the happy estate of all Believers in generall, he maketh application thereof unto those Ephesians in particular; <hi>In whom also you are builded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> saith he. 2. That this particular application may be made in due order, it is necessary, that in the first place we make application of Christ unto our selves, laying hold upon Him by faith; that so being in Him, we may have right unto all those saving priviledges, which are purchased by Him: for, the Apostle sheweth this was the order, wherein those priviledges were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto the believing Ephesians; they were first united to Christ, and so had accesse unto all the rest which follow; <hi>In whom also you are builded together for an habitation of God.</hi> 3. That we may rightly apply Christ unto our selves, it is necessary that we lay hold upon Him in order to all those ends, for which He is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Gospel, even to those which imply an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon us of duty, both unto other Believers and unto God: for, those Ephesians were so united to


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44180:246"/>
Christ by faith; that, as a consequence thereof, they were also united one to another, and to all Believers by love, and made an habitation for God; <hi>In whom you are builded together, for an habitation of God.</hi> 4. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ doth differ from the foundations of other buildings in this, that every particular Believer is not only laid upon Him, and supported by Him, as it is in materiall buildings; but they are also indented in Him, and hid, as it were, in the clifts of that rock by saving faith; so that the foundation covereth the whole build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and serveth for a refuge from the storm, and a shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow from the heat, <hi>Isa.</hi> 25. 4. for, he saith not, <hi>upon whom,</hi> but <hi>in whom you also are builded.</hi> 5. As all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, how far so ever removed by large distance, are yet most strictly tied and joyned together; So, by taking band with Christ the foundation, they are fastened one to another, even as the stones of a building: for, he saith, <hi>In whom you are builded together:</hi> union among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves did follow upon their being <hi>in Him.</hi> 6. The more deeply engaged that any have been before conversion in Sathan's service and the slavery of their lusts, their after conversion, and being builded upon Christ for an habitation to God, is the rarer priviledge, the more to be admired and highly esteemed of; for, he saith not simply, <hi>in whom you are builded,</hi> but <hi>in whom you also:</hi> which highteneth the purpose, as a thing wonderfull, and hardly credible, the apostle having an eye doubtlesse to their former slavery unto Satan and their own lusts, spoken of, ver. 2, 3. 7. So inseparable is that union, and connexion among the Persons of the blessed Trinity, that the presence and indwelling of one is sufficient to prove the indwelling of all: for, they are an habitation to God the Father and Son, because the Spirit did dwell in them and sanctifie them; <hi>An habitation of God through the Spirit.</hi> 8. Though all the external actions of the God-head do belong to all the Persons of the blessed Trinity; Yet some of those actions are usually ascribed unto one, more than the rest, according as they carry


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44180:247"/>
some proportion and likenesse to the personall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of each person: for, the sanctification of Believers (in regard of which effect God is said to dwell in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, seing He thereby doth manifest His speciall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in them) is here ascribed unto the Spirit, while those Ephesians are said to be <hi>an habitation unto God through the Spirit.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>IN the first part of this Chapter (which beginneth ver. 2.) the Apostle setteth forth the dignity of his Apostolick Office towards the Gentiles, with his calling to it, and qualifications for it. And, first, he propoundeth the matter briefly, that this office was committed to him, vers. 2. Next, he doth more largely illustrate it. First, by shewing his qualification and furniture for this Office, to wit, his knowledge and insight in the mysterie of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, which He was to preach: for proof whereof, he appealeth to what he had written in the two former Chapters, ver. 3, 4. and having called the Gospel a <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,</hi> he sheweth the reason why he did so, to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was not so known of old, as now under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, ver. 5. and giveth a brief sum of this mysterie, as to that part of it which was most controverted, to wit, the calling of the Gentiles to the free enjoyment of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-priviledges, ver. 6. Next, by shewing his call from God, and authority to dispense this furniture: where he taketh occasion to extol and magnifie his Office, and the grace of God, which called him to it, from eight distinct considerations. First, from the gifts wherewith he was furnished to discharge it. Secondly, from the powerfull assistance of Gods Spirit, which wrought in him and by him in the discharging of it, ver. 7. Thirdly, from his own unworthinesse, who was intrusted with it.


<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44180:247"/>
Fourthly, from the excellency of the subject matter, which he was to set forth, even <hi>the unsearchable riches of Christ,</hi> ver. 8. Fifthly, from the great benefit, which by his conscientious discharging thereof was to accresce unto men, even their more clear understanding of that mysterie, ver. 9. Sixthly, from the same benefit, which did thereby redound to the glorified Angels, ver. 10. Seventhly, from the eternity of Gods purpose to intrust him in that office, for bringing about the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned ends, ver. 11. And lastly, from three excellent priviledges, <hi>boldnesse, accesse, confidence</hi> whereof Believers did partake by the means of his Ministery; as being thereby brought to Christ, in whom they enjoyed all those, ver. 12. From all which grounds he dehorteth them from fainting, notwithstanding of his present sad sufferings in discharging so honourable an employment, ver. 13.</p>
               <p>In the second part of the Chapter, he doth indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly incite them to persevere, and make progresse in the experimentall knowledge of, and in communion with Christ, by giving a sum of his fervent prayers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for them to that purpose. The occasion of which prayer, is, ver. 1. his gesture in prayer, and to whom he did pray, to wit, God, described from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Christ and the Church, are, ver. 14. 15. The particulars prayed for, are, 1. Their strengthening in the inward man by the Spirit, ver. 16. 2. Christs inhabiting their heart by faith, ver. 17-. 3. Their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall knowledge and comprehension of Christs boundlesse love, flowing from their firm adhering to the love of God in Christ by faith, ver. -17, 18, 19- 4. Their full replenishing with the perfection of all graces in glory, ver. -19. The conclusion of his prayer containeth a description of God, taken from His al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power to do above our petitions and concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ver. 20. and a thanksgiving unto God so described, and upon that ground, ver. 21.</p>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 1. FOr this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles.</head>
                  <p>THis verse belongeth to the purpose contained in the second part of the Chapter, which, being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun here, is interrupted untill ver. 14. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof shall be shown, ver. 2. In the mean time he doth here declare the occasion of his following prayer to God on their behalf to have been, even that, which he hath but presently spoken concerning them, to wit, their being already builded upon Christ by faith, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all true Believers; for, the words, <hi>for this cause,</hi> relate to the close of the preceeding Chapter. And withall, that his praying to God so fervently for them may have the more weight, in order to their up-stirring to endeavour after that which he prayeth for, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth himself, who is to pray for them, from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent captivity and bonds, under which he was at <hi>Rome</hi> for the truth of Christ, and for the behoof and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gentiles: (of whom these Ephesians were a part) for, <hi>Paul</hi> being intrusted, in a peculiar manner, to be the Apostle and Doctor of the Gentiles, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 7. it followeth, that all his sufferings, in discharge of that trust, were for their sake. Besides, that the nearest cause of his sufferings from the Jews, his chief adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, was his carrying of the Gospel unto the Gentiles, <hi>Act. 22, 21, 22. Doct.</hi> 1. The pains of Ministers with, and for the Lords people, are so far from being at an end, when people are brought to Christ and built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Him by faith, that even their being brought this length, doth lay a new tye upon their Ministers, both to deal with God on their behalf, and to labour with themselves so much the more earnestly, that, not only they do not losse those things which are already wrought, 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> ver. 8. but also they may make progresse answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vnto their fair beginnings; lest otherwise they mar their own comfort, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 12. make the name of God


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44180:248"/>
to be evil spoken of, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. and thereby draw down sore corrections upon themselves, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 10. for, the Apostle his praying so fervently upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and thereby stirring them up to endeavour after that themselves, which he did pray for, was occasioned by their being built upon Christ for an habitation unto God; <hi>for this cause,</hi> saith he, <hi>I Paul—do bow my knees,</hi> as it followeth, ver. 14. which closeth up the sentence begun here. 2. Such powerfull influence hath God upon hearts, that He can make those, who for the time are cruel persecuters of truth, prove afterwards famous Martyrs, and sufferers for it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> was once a bloudy persecuter, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. -13. but is now a famous sufferer; <hi>I Paul, the prisoner,</hi> saith he, or, as it is in the Original, <hi>that prisoner,</hi> implying he was no ordinary, but a noted sufferer; his sufferings being in a manner singular, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, &amp;c. 3. Sufferings for Christ and truth are so far from being cause of just reproach to those who suffer, from others, or from being matter of shame and blushing to themselves, That they are rather a glory unto them, yea, and sometimes will be gloried in by them, as that, wherein their chiefest honour standeth: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> after the example of Kings and Nobles, who design themselves by their most honourable stiles, doth, in place of all, take this one, of a prisoner for Truth, unto himself; <hi>I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ.</hi> 4. So far ought people be from stumbling at truth, because of the oppressed and suffering lot of those who preach it, that even their sufferings for truth should make their pains the more acceptable, and adde a weight unto the Word of truth in their mouth: for, <hi>Paul</hi> describeth himself from his present suffering lot, that both his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and pains might have the more weight and efficacy with them; I <hi>Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ.</hi> 5. The Lord doth sometimes give so far way to the rage of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuters, as that the choisest instruments for carrying on His work may be, for a season, restrained in their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and so laid aside as uselesse, even in a time


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44180:249"/>
when there is greatest need of their pains and diligence: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> an eminent instrument, (1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15. 10.) was at such a time cast in prison; I <hi>Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ.</hi> 6. No afflictions or sufferings do loose a Pastor from his duty towards the Lords people, over whom he is set: But when he is restrained in his liberty from Preaching to them, he ought even then endeavour their edification by writting to them, and praying for them: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> being a prisoner, doth yet write to those Ephesians, and pray for them; I <hi>Paul, the prisoner—do bow my knees.</hi> 7. A prisoner for Christ and truth, hath this advantage beyond all other prisoners in ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wars, he is a prisoner, not so much to those who persecute him, as to Jesus Christ, his own Lord and Generall: and that not only, because he suffereth in His quarrell, but also he remaineth still in His custody, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 21. and at His disposall, who over-ruleth the rage of enemies so as that they cannot do the meanest prisoner of His any further hurt than seemeth good unto Him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 17. for, in both those respects, <hi>Paul</hi> doth call himself Christs prisoner; he was imprisoned for His sake, and at, and during His overruling will and pleasure; I <hi>Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ.</hi> 8. The Lord doth so out-wit His enemies, as their very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining and imprisoning His servants, doth, contrary to their intention, tend to the furtherance of the Gospel; all their sufferings of that sort being real confirmations of the truth preached by them, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. -17. and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing examples for others to imitate, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 10. for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, that his sufferings were for the Gentiles, though not for their redemption, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. -13- yet for their good and edification in the mentioned respects; I <hi>Paul, the prisoner-for you Gentiles.</hi> 9. This may exceedingly sweeten the sharpest sufferings of Gods servants, when they consider, they suffer nothing but what is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured out unto them by their Lord Christ; that their sufferings are not for evil doing, but for Him and His truth who suffered for them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. and that


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44180:249"/>
not only their own salvation, but the salvation also of others, is some one way or other advanced by their sufferings: for, <hi>Pauls</hi> sufferings are sweetned from this, that he was the <hi>prisoner of Jesus Christ,</hi> and <hi>for the Gentiles.</hi>

                  <p>HEre beginneth the first part of the Chapter, wherein the Apostle, by way of digression, setteth forth the dignity of his Apostolick Office towards the Gentiles; that thereby he may, not only guard them from stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at his sufferings, as is clear from ver. 13. but also give a reason of what he presently said, ver. 1. that he was <hi>a prisoner for them,</hi> to wit, because he had his Office from God towards them: for, lest they had doubted of the truth of that assertion, he presently breaketh off the former sentence in the very entry, without putting a close to it, untill ver. 14. as judging it more safe to keep them a little in suspense, and ignorant of that which he began to speak of, than to leave them with a doubt about the truth of any thing which he had already spoken; seing ignorance of things, not yet revealed, is not so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous as misbelief of those truths which was revealed and known.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, in the first branch of the first part of the Chapter, contained in this verse, the Apostle doth briefly declare, that the Apostolick Office of dispensing and ministerial distributing the doctrine of free grace and salvation contained in the Gospel, here (called the <hi>grace of God,</hi> as, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11.) was committed unto him with relation chiefly to the Gentiles, and particularly, to those Ephesians. See upon <hi>Col.</hi> 1. ver. 25. doct. 3. And as to the truth of this assertion, he appealeth to their own knowledge and conscience, if they had not heard it, and were not sufficiently instructed in it: for, the conditionall particle <hi>if,</hi> implyeth not any doubt of the


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44180:250"/>
thing, but rather his great confidence, that they nei ther could nor would contradict it, seing it was a thing publickly known from the history of his conversion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 22, 23. and doubtlesse also from his own preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing while he was among them, <hi>Act. 19. 10. Doct.</hi> 1. Where a Minister is called, and sent by God unto a People, not only his Sermons, but also his actions and carriage, yea, his very sufferings in the discharge of his Calling, are blessed of God to be powerfull preachings for the good and edification ofthose among them, whom God intendeth good for: for, <hi>Paul</hi> proveth he was a prisoner for the Gentiles, or that his imprisonment and sufferings did contribute for their good and edification, because he was called of God to dispense the Gospel unto them; <hi>If ye have heard of the dispensation—which is given me to you-ward.</hi> 2. The ministerial Office is not a lordly dominion, but a stewardship, whereby the Lord himself, who is great Master of that family, (ver. 15.) which is His House and Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. doth intrust some to break and divide the bread of life unto the rest: which therefore they must do with that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of faithfulnesse (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2.) and wisdom <hi>(Mat.</hi> 24. 45.) as they may be answerable unto Him who hath intrusted them; for, he calleth the ministerial Office intrusted to him, <hi>the dispensation,</hi> which signifieth the ordering of things belonging to the family so as may be most for its behoof: and being applyed unto God, with relation to His Church, it signifieth a most absolute power to dispose of those things as He pleaseth, (so is it taken, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 25.) but being applyed unto His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, as it is here, it signifieth only a subordinate mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial power, for which the person intrusted must be countable, such as is the office of a steward in great families. See 1 <hi>Cor. 4. 1, 2. If ye have heard of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation of the grace, &amp;c.</hi> 3. The great thing which Ministers are to dispense and distribute unto the Lords family, is the doctrine of Salvation through free grace. They are indeed to dispense threatnings also, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44180:250"/>
the terror of Gods wrath, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 12. Only their great design in all should be, that people may be thereby fitted to imbrace the offer of grace and salvation in the Gospel: for, the Apostle calleth that which he was to dispense, <hi>the grace of God,</hi> to wit the doctrine of grace; <hi>The dispensation of the grace of God.</hi> 4. The Lords People ought carefully to lay up and remember what they hear of the Lords Word from, or of His dealing with, His Servants; that so they may make use of it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when God calleth them to it: and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they would not forget what may convincingly clear unto their consciences a Ministers calling, and his being sent from God unto them; whereby his doctrine, life, and sufferings may have the greater weight with them: for, <hi>Paul</hi> supposeth they did perfectly remember what they heard of his calling to the Gentiles, and therefore doth appeal to their testimony, while he saith, <hi>If ye have heard of the dispensation, &amp;c.</hi> 5. As there is no lesse concredited unto called Ministers by God to hold forth unto the Lords People, than the doctrine of Salvation through free grace, the greatest of all trusts; So whatever is committed or given by God unto them, is not for themselves alone, but for the good of those also unto whom they are sent; and therefore God doth usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deal the better with Ministers for the Peoples sake: for, the relative, <hi>which,</hi> doth relate to the antecedent, <hi>grace,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>This grace,</hi> or, the doctrine of the Gospel, <hi>is given me to you-ward.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, being (in the second branch of the first part of the Chapter to ver. 13.) more largely to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate what he did but briefly assert, ver. 2. to wit, that the Apostolick office of dispensing the Gospel to the


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44180:251"/>
Gentiles was committed unto him, doth, first, shew, to ver. 7. that he was sufficiently furnished by God with knowledge and insight in the Doctrine of the Gospel concredited to him. And in those two verses he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, not only the nature of this Doctrine, that it is a <hi>mysterie,</hi> or sacred secret; but also, that it was made known unto him by God, together with the manner how he came to the knowledge of it, to wit, by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary revelation from God, and not by ordinary means, as is more clearly expressed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 12. and for proof of his knowledge and insight in this mysterie, he referreth them to what he hath written succinctly of it in the two former Chapters, in which he hath, by a most divine and ravishing strain, set forth the grounds, causes and means of salvation, and made application of all both to Jew and Gentile, which is the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive sum of this mysterie, ver. 3. from which two preceeding Chapters, being diligently perpended, and read by them, he doubteth not, but they should find he had not arrogantly, and without ground ascribed to himself a great measure of knowledge and insight in that mysterie, which he calleth <hi>the mysterie of Christ;</hi> because Christ is the chief subject of the Gospel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2. and the very mysterie of that mysterie, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. This is contained, ver. 4.</p>

That the Gospel is a mysterie, and in what respects it is so, see chap. 1. ver. 9. doct. 1. <hi>He made known unto me the mysterie.</hi> 3. The Lord doth usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally manifest Himself, more or lesse, unto His Servants, according to the nature, weight and difficulty of those


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44180:251"/>
imployments unto which He doth call them: for, He maketh Himself manifest to <hi>Paul</hi> by extraordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, because he was to serve Him in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary embassage, as an Apostle; <hi>How that by revelation He made known unto me.</hi> 4. As Christ's Ministers may sometimes in sobriety speak to the commendation of their own knowledge, and of their other ministerial abilities, to wit, when they are necessitated to assert and avow their calling from God; So it is most safe to speak no further to that purpose, than they have formerly given some proof of, in discharge of their calling, to which they may appeal, as an undeniable confirmation of what they affirm; lest otherwise their bare assertion be taken for vain vaunting and arrogant boasting: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> being called to speak of his own knowledge and abilities, as an evidence of his calling from God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth them to that proof, which he had given thereof in his former writings, while he saith, <hi>As I wrote afore in few words.</hi> 5. The Doctrine of salvation revealed unto, and Preached by the Apostles, is contained in their writings, and therefore there is no necessity of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written traditions: for, the Apostle, proving that this mysterie was revealed to him, he doth not refer them to what he had preached unto them for the space of two years, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 10. but to his writings, which had been no adequate proof, except he had written the sum of all which was revealed unto him, at least, of so much as was necessary for them to know; <hi>As I wrote afore in few words.</hi> 6. The Spirit of God speaking in Scripture, hath comprised large and comprehensive purpose, even the whole plot of mans salvation, and the sum of mans duty, in a small bulk and few words; as knowing that reading much would be but wearisomenesse to the flesh, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. -12. and intending that the gift of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and exponing Scripture, should have place in the Church, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. 8. for, <hi>Paul,</hi> the pen-man of the Spirit of God, giveth a comprehensive sum of the whole Gospel in the two first Chapters, with relation

to which, he saith here, <hi>I wrote afore in few words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From ver. 4. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The brevity of Scripture, and comprehensive largenesse of the purpose contained in it, do not occasion any such obscurity in Scripture, but by diligent reading the mind of God therein may be found out and understood: for, notwithstanding, <hi>Paul</hi> hath shown he had comprehended that whole mysterie in few words; yet, saith he, <hi>Whereby when you read, ye may understand.</hi> 2. The Word of God therefore ought to be frequently read, and diligently perused by all the Lords people; this being one mean, and second to none (except publick preaching, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15.) which the Lord doth blesse, as for other ends, So for attaining to know and understand the purpose and subject-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contained in the Word: for, <hi>Paul</hi> supponeth it was their duty to read what he had written, and sheweth by reading they should <hi>understand his knowledge in the mysterie.</hi> 3. Even private Christians, through diligent reading of Scripture, may attain to such a measure of knowledge and understanding, as may enable them to judge of the abilities, gifts and doctrine of Ministers: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking even to private Christians amongst those Ephesians, saith, <hi>Wherby, when ye read, ye may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand my knowledge in the mysterie of Christ.</hi> 4. Though private Christians are not to sist themselves as publick judges of the doctrine of Ministers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 32. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should they delight much in venting their private judgement, especially their carping censures, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. -19- yet they are not as stupid blocks, without triall and examination, to receive what-ever the Minister saith; but ought to passe a private judgment of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon what they hear, whether it be truth or error, right or wrong, in so far, at least, as may regulate their own practice in choosing, or refusing what they hear, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 21. for, <hi>Paul</hi> alloweth unto those Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians to passe such a judgement upon his own doctrine and abilities; <hi>Ye may understand my knowledge in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of Christ.</hi>

The children of men are naturally ignorant of Gospel-truths, and know no further of them, than God is pleased to reveal and make known unto them: for, the Apostle sheweth, that the sons of men were passive, as to the measure of light which was attained unto of those truths; <hi>Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed.</hi> 2. The Lord in bestowing grace and the saving knowledge of Himself, doth act as a most free agent, not constrained by any necessity, so, that He dispenseth grace to whom He will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 18. to some more sparingly, and to others more liberally, whether we compare times with times, or

persons with persons in one and the same time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. -3. for, He hath revealed the saving knowledg of this mysterie now under the Gospel in a greater measure than he did formerly; <hi>Which in other ages was not made known, as is now revealed,</hi> saith he. 3. Neither the Doctrine of salvation through free grace by Christ, nor Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to call the Gentiles to partake of this salvation equally with the Jews, was altogether unknown to the ancient Church before Christ came; there being seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall manifestations of the former in the Covenant of Grace, as it was first revealed unto <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. and after renewed with <hi>Abraham, Gen. 17. 7. David, 2 Sam.</hi> 23. 5. and commented upon by the Prophets, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 3, &amp;c. and many full prophesies also of the latter, which the Apostles themselves did make use of to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the calling of the Gentiles, as <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 47. cited from <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 6. and <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 15. cited from <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 11: for, the Apostle doth not simply deny that the former ages had any knowledge of this mysterie at all, but comparatively; <hi>It was not in other ages made known, as it is now revealed.</hi> But, fourthly, neither the Doctrine of salvation, nor yet the calling of the Gentiles were so fully, or clearly revealed under the Old Testament, as they are now under the New; both of them being but sparingly spoken to then, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 17. and what was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for the most part, wrapped up in a vail of types and shadowes, so that they could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13. The latter, to wit, the calling of the Gentiles, being only then fore-told, and prophesied of; and therefore could not be so distinctly, solidly and satisfyingly known, as now when it is accomplished: Besides that the time when, and the manner how it was to be accomplished, and particularly, that the Gentiles should have accesse unto the Church without an entrance by the door of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision. Those (I say) were either not at all, or but very sparingly revealed, so that even the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, after Christs ascension, did doubt and hesitate


<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44180:253"/>
much about the truth of this mysterie, untill it was more fully revealed, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 10, &amp;c. for, saith <hi>Paul, Which in other ages was not made known, as it is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</hi> 5. As Christs servants may be sometimes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to speak unto the commendation of their own receipts from God; So Christian sobriety will teach them to be so far from disparaging, or undervaluing the receipts of others, to render themselves thereby the more esteemed of, That they will endeavour to have others, who are equally deserving, to partake with them in that deserved esteem, which they challenge unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having begun to speak (ver. 3.) of that knowledge of this mysterie, which was revealed unto himself, doth here affirm the same of all the Apostles and Prophets; <hi>As it is now revealed unto the Apostles and Prophets.</hi> 6. Though God might easily communicate the knowledge of Himself unto all, whom he intendeth to save in a way extraordinary, immediately and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of second means, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. ver. 3, 4. yet, He hath rather chosen to communicate His mind so, unto some few only, who have, some of them, at least, at His appointment (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. -21.) set down in sacred Writ what they themselves did immediately receive from God, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 1. by which means the knowledge of God may, in an ordinary way, be conveyed unto others, <hi>Job.</hi> 20. 31. The Lord hereby preventing Satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, who would otherwise have obtruded upon people his own delusions, in place of immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations from God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. 21. and trying the obedience of His people, if they will subject themselves unto His will and word in the mouth of His Servants, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 40. as also gently sparing their infirmity and weaknesse, who could not, one among a thousand, carry aright those extraordinary manifestations of God unto their spirits, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. for, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie was <hi>revealed by the Spirit,</hi> to wit, immediately, not unto all, but to <hi>His holy Apostles and Prophets.</hi> 7. As all the Lords Ministers ought to be inherently holy, not

only because of the precept enjoyning so much in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner unto Ministers, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 8. but also for the more successefull discharging of their office; seing the secret of the Lord is with them who fear Him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 14. and the lips of the righteous feed many, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 21. and as all the extraordinary Office-bearers (for what is revealed, <hi>Judas</hi> alone excepted) and Pen-men of holy Scripture, were really sanctified and holy; So inherent holinesse, without a peculiar illumination of the Spirit of God, superadded for that end, is not sufficient for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving clear light and insight in Gospel-mysteries: for, He giveth the Apostles and Prophets the epithet of <hi>boly,</hi> to shew they themselves were so, and all Ministers ought to be so; and yet this mysterie behoved to be <hi>revealed</hi> unto them <hi>by the Spirit,</hi> even <hi>to the holy Apostles and Prophets.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle doth here give a brief sum of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, which was revealed unto him, as to that part of it, at least, which was most controverted, to wit, that the Pagan Gentiles were now called to enjoy, and real Believers among them actually did enjoy most excellent priviledges. As, first, of being joynt-heirs of the heavenly inheritance with the Believers of the Jewish Nation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 29. and with Christ Himself, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. Secondly, of being incorporated with the Church of God in one mysticall body, whereof Christ is the Head. See, upon <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. -22, 23. And, thirdly, of partaking with the believing Jews of the Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promise made by God to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. so that they were now within the bond of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. He declareth also, that all those pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges were purchased for them, and freely bestowed upon them by Christ, and by vertue of their being in


<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44180:254"/>
Him by faith, in whom they had equal interest with the believing Jews themselves; and that they were brought to this happy estate by the alone-preaching of the Gospel, and by faith in it, without the ceremoniall Law and Circumcision. All which were mysteries to the ancient Church. See upon ver. 5. <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Hence, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. There is a necessary concatenation among those three, to wit, a right to heaven, union with Christ's mysticall body, and saving interest in the Covenant of Grace. The enjoying of any one whereof, implyeth the other two: and if one of those be wanting, the rest are wanting also: for, the Apostle speaketh of them, as mutually depending one upon another; <hi>That the Gentiles should be fellow-heirs, &amp;c.</hi> 2. As every renewed childe of God is an heir of the heavenly inheritance; So the multitude of heirs doth not lessen the inheritance, nor make the priviledge of being an heir of heaven the lesse glorious; yea, it addeth unto the glory of it: for, he placeth a great part of their priviledge in this, not simply, that they were heirs, but <hi>fellow-heirs.</hi> 3. It is a great and glorious priviledge to be a part of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall body, whereof Christ is Head; and that because of the strict union, which such have with Christ (See, ver. 17.) and with all Believers in Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. -15. and because of that influence of life and spirit, which, being in Christ without measure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. -34. is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto them, every one in his own measure; <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 16. as also because of their interest in all the common priviledges of that body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 30. and in the gifts and graces of every member thereof, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22. for, <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of this, as an excellent priviledge bestowed on the Gentiles under the new Testament, even <hi>that they should be of the same body.</hi> 4. It is a priviledge no lesse great and glorious, to have saving interest in the Covenant of Grace and the promises thereof; for, thereby we have accesse to both the former priviledges; and all the saving blessings of that Covenant, comprised in the many large precious, and comprehensive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises


<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44180:255"/>
thereof, do become ours: for, the Apostle speaketh of this, as of another excellent priviledge bestowed upon the Gentiles, even, <hi>that they should be partakers of His promise.</hi> 5. As Jesus Christ hath purchased all those glorious priviledges and saving blessings, to which the people of God can lay any claim, or interest; So there is no actuall enjoyment of any part of His pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, except by those who are savingly in Christ, and united to Him by faith: for, this expression, <hi>in Christ,</hi> speaketh both that those things were purchased by Him, and were enjoyed by their being in Him; <hi>partakers of His promise in Christ.</hi> 6. The Gospel (especially when it is preached by a sent Minister, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15.) is a powerfull mean, through Gods blessing, for gaining ground upon most desperate sinners, and for prevailing with them to close by faith with Christ, as He is offered; by vertue whereof their state is changed, and they made holy, happy and blessed: for, the Gentiles, whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate case in time past was set forth, Chap. 2. 12. are now made <hi>fellow-heirs of one body, partakers of His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise in Christ,</hi> or being united to Him, and this all <hi>by the Gospel.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, having in the preceeding verses declared how he had attained a large measure of knowledge and insight in the mysterie of the Gospel, doth now (in further enlargement of what he did but briefly assert, ver. 2.) shew, that he was called by God to undergo the Apostolick Office of dispensing that mysterie, and doth joyntly extol and magnifie his Office, from eight distinct considerations, to ver. 13.</p>
                  <p>And in this verse, having asserted his calling from God to be a Minister of the Gospel unto the Gentiles, he doth magnifie this his Office, as also make it appear,


<pb n="175" facs="tcp:44180:255"/>
that he was called to it, first, from the gifts both ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and extraordinary, which he was furnished with in the discharging of it. And, secondly, from the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full assistance of Gods Spirit, enabling him to exercise those gifts, notwithstanding of many difficulties, and giving admirable successe to his Ministery both far and near, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 19, 20. All which, to wit, his calling, gifts, and divine assistance, he doth ascribe to Gods grace and free favour. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The very Apostolick Office it self, was no lordly dominion, or place of honour and ease; but a laborious ministery and service, wherein the person intrusted, was to bestir himself to the utmost of his activity and diligence, for the honour of Christ and good of His Church: for, the word rendred <hi>Minister,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> here taketh unto himself, doth signifie a painfull, vehement labour, as those who make hast in travell, raising the dust by their celerity and speed; <hi>Whereof I was made a Minister,</hi> saith he. 2. It is not sufficient warrant for any to meddle with the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Office, that he hath competent gifts fitting him for it, except he have also ministerial power and authority conveyed unto him, either immediately by God, as it was in the calling of the Apostles, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1. or, mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to that order which God hath established in His Church, as is in the calling of ordinary Ministers, <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. for, <hi>Paul</hi> distinguisheth these two, his being sufficiently furnished with the knowledge of the Gospel, whereof he spoke from ver. 3. and his authority and power to preach the Gospel unto others, of which he speaketh here, while he saith, <hi>whereof I was made a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.</hi> 3. Though ability and gifts be not that which maketh a man a called Minister, as said is; yet when men, being otherwise orderly called, are competently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with gifts and enduements, and are accompanied with the influence of Gods blessing upon the exercise of their parts, it is a speaking evidence and confirmation of their calling from God, not only unto themselves, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so unto others who would otherwise possibly doubt of it:


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44180:256"/>
for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not only magnifie his office, but also make it evident that he was called to it from these two, while he saith, <hi>I am made a Minister according to the gift bestowed on me,</hi> and <hi>by,</hi> or, as it is in the Original, <hi>according to the effectual working of His power.</hi> 4. As it is required to make a man a Minister, that he be endued with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent abilities and gifts for that imployment; So it is no lesse requisit that God do concur with him; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he cannot exercise his gift, and make use of it for the good of others, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. or, though he exercise it, yet all his utmost endeavours will be fruitlesse and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out successe among the people, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth besides the gift which he received of grace. God did also concur with him; <hi>According to the gift of the grace of God, by the effectuall working of His power.</hi> 5. Though the Lord give competency of gifts unto all whom He calleth, yet He giveth not unto all one and the same gift, or in the same measure; but to some a greater, to others a lesser, as He hath more or lesse to do with them: for, as <hi>Paul</hi> was singularly imployed; so he had a singular gift, and therefore he saith, <hi>the gift of the grace given to me,</hi> thereby implying there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what singular in his gift. 6. So great and many are those difficulties which Ministers have often to wrestle with, what from without, and what from within, before they can attain to freedom and boldnesse in exercising their ministerial gift, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 13, 14. So difficult is it also to gain ground upon hearts by the ministry of the Word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. -4, 5. that no lesse is required, either for the one or the other, than the power of God, His working power, and working effectually with a kind of pith and energie: for, <hi>Paul's</hi> necessity called for no lesse, even <hi>the effectual working of His power.</hi> 7. As it is no small grace and favour from God for any to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ministerial Calling, and competently furnished with gifts and parts for that imployment, and to have their labours blessed with successe in gaining many souls to God; So a gracious Minister will be ready


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44180:256"/>
at all occasions to acknowledge grace in all these, ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing all to Gods favour, and His powerfull working in him, and by him, and not to his own dignity, diligence, or parts: for, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> here; <hi>Whereof I was made a Minister, according to the gift of the grace of God.</hi>

As all Saints are not of one standing and size, but some greater, some lesser and some lesse than the least, except themselves; So it is no small honour and dignity to be among the least of Saints, and to have a work of saving grace, though but in the meanest degree; seing even the meanest of Saints have a choise room in Gods

The Lord in deepest wisdom doth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bestow the rarest gifts and graces upon such, as by reason of their former wickednesse, are most conscious to themselves of their own unworthinesse: yea, and sometimes will employ them in most eminent pieces of His service, as knowing such have somewhat to keep them humble, and make them ascribe the glory of what they do unto God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 9, 10. whereas others would readily take the glory unto themselves, being puffed up with their gifts and successe, and so should fall in the condemnation of the devil, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6. for, God's dealing with <hi>Paul,</hi> in giving him such excellent gifts, and the Apostolick office from grace, proveth so much; <hi>unto me, who am lesse than the least of all Saints, is this grace given.</hi> 7. The more unworthy that any is, upon whom the Lord bestoweth grace, and sheweth mercy, the glory of His grace is so much the more set forth, and shineth the more brightly: whileas where sin hath abounded, grace doth much more abound, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. -20. for, <hi>Paul</hi> commendeth the dignity of his calling, and the worth of that grace, by which he was called to that office, from his own basenesse and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse; <hi>unto me, who am lesse than the least of all Saints, is this grace given.</hi> 8. It concerneth a Minister much, as to be deeply affected with the sense of his own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse; so, seriously and frequently to ponder the weight and dignity of that trust, which is put upon him, and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints, the dispensing whereof, is committed unto

him; that so with greater fear and reverence, care and diligence he may take heed to his Ministery, which he hath received in the Lord, to fulfill it, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 17. for, <hi>Paul</hi> considereth also the worth of that message, which he was intrusted with, while he saith, <hi>that I should preach the unsearchable riches of Christ.</hi> 9. Though others of the Apostles besides <hi>Paul,</hi> were intrusted to carry the Gospel unto the Gentiles; yet considering, that he was so fully instructed in the knowledge of this mysterie of the rejection of the Jews, and calling of the Gentiles, ver. 3. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. and had a perpetuall conflict with the Jews, through the whole course of his life in the defence of this truth, as is clear from the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles: as also that he hath committed more unto sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writing to this purpose for the use and benefit chiefly of the Gentiles, than any of the other Apostles, Therefore is it that <hi>Paul</hi> doth seem to have been intrusted in a peculiar manner with the charge of preaching the Gospel unto, and being the Apostle of, the Gentiles, which appeareth, as from other places, <hi>Act. 26. 17, 18. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 7. so from this, <hi>unto me, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles.</hi> 10. Offices, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petencie of gifts for discharging any office, are given of God to those who have them, and especially to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, not to keep them without use-making, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 27. or, to make use of them only for gaining applause, or advantage to themselves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 5. but that they may employ them for the glory of God, and the good of others: for, this grace was given to <hi>Paul, that he might preach among the Gentiles.</hi> 11. As Jesus Christ, with all that rich store and copious abundance of created graces and divine perfections which are in Himself, and of satisfactory fulnesse which is in those many good things purchased by Him, should be the main subject of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters preaching, whatever he preacheth besides of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall threatnings or duties, being made to relate some one way or other unto Him; So Jesus Christ and the riches of the Gospel, are so large a field and subject, that the


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44180:258"/>
most gracious and able Ministers will find daily purpose, and fresh matter furnished of new, whereof to preach concerning it; yea, and never will be able to go through it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> made Christ and the Gospel the main sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his preaching, and did find them unsearchable; <hi>that I should preach the unsearchable riches of Christ.</hi> 12. Though those hid treasures of wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Christ, and the riches of the glory of His inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the Saints, and of all those other good things purchased by Him, and offered in the Gospel, go beyond the reach of all created understanding to know them fully; yet it is the duty both of Pastors and people to search into them; there being as much knowledge of those unsearchable riches attainable, even here, as may encourage all to search, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 4. and nothing being more sweet upon earth, than to be swallowed up, and overwhelmed in this deep and bottomlesse gulf of the unsearchable riches of Christ, when penury of thoughts, and want of enlarged hearts to comprehend that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible subject, necessitate the soul sometimes to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumb under the weight, to stand still, wonder and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, <hi>O the depth of the riches, &amp;c!

Though the Lords Ministers ought mainly to labour upon the affections of people, endeavouring to work them up to such a frame and temper, as the Word of God doth call for, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. yet, this also is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable part of the ministerial task, which they would endeavour in the first place, and in order to their more effectuall and orderly moving of the affections, even to make the Lords people understand the mind of God revealed in Scripture, as well concerning their sin and misery, as the remedy thereof held forth in the Gospel, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 22, 23, 38, 39. and therefore they would affect great plainnesse of speech, dimitting themselves, so far as is possible, unto the capacity of the meanest: For, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that the information of the judgement, was that which he endeavoured with the first in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his Ministery; <hi>And to make all men see,</hi> faith he. 2. The Word preached by sent Ministers, is the Lords ordinary mean and instrument, by which he


<pb n="183" facs="tcp:44180:259"/>
conveyeth the saving knowledge of Gospel-truths unto the Elect: and that both by making these truths evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and plain; that so they may be known, being otherwise hid, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 4. and by opening the eyes of their understanding, that they may see, being otherwise blind, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18. for, the Lord imployed <hi>Paul</hi> in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall calling, <hi>To make all men see, what is the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, &amp;c.</hi> The word signifieth both to make a thing evident, that it may be seen, and to give an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of knowledge unto men, by vertue whereof they may see. 3. The commission given by Christ unto His Servants to preach the Gospel under the New Testament, is not astricted unto the Jews only, as it was before Christ came in the flesh, yea and after His incarnation before the midle-wall of partion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jew and Gentile was removed by His death, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 5. But it is extended indifferently to all nations under heaven, and to all persons without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as God by His providence shall open a door unto His Servants to go unto them: for, so is <hi>Paul's</hi> commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion here to be understood, even, <hi>to make all men see.</hi> 4. That sinners, lost by nature, may attain to fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and communion with the true Church of God, by sharing with them in all their priviledges and good things purchased by Christ, and in Christ Himself, the Covenant of Grace, and in all the prayers, gifts and graces of all Believers through the world, is the gladest tydings that ever sounded in their ears: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having shown (ver. 8.) that his office was to <hi>preach</hi> (or, as it is in the Original, to declare good tydings) to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, he sheweth here what those glad tydings are, even, to <hi>make them see, what is the fellowship of the mysterie,</hi> that is, what that fellowship is, which they were now admitted unto with the true Church of God in all her priviledges, and formerly was an hid secret. 5. The written Word of God is such a depth, that the quickest wits cannot find the bottom of it; there being many things contained in it, at least by just consequence, which


<pb n="184" facs="tcp:44180:260"/>
even they, who have their senses exercised in it, cannot throughly discern or collect from it: for, even this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, that the Gentiles should have fellowship with the Church, without entring by the door of Circumcision, was revealed, though obscurely, in the Scriptures of the Old Testament, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth gather by consequence from the time of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Circumcision, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 10, 11. and from <hi>Melchisedeck's</hi> Priesthood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 11. and yet, saith the Apostle, <hi>this was a mysterie, which from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world hath been hid in God.</hi> So that even the Prophets did not fully understand it, nor the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles themselves untill it was more clearly revealed, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 10. 6. Jesus Christ is true God, equal with the Father in power and glory, having an eternal being before the world was made: for, the Father <hi>created all things by Jesus Christ.,</hi> to wit, not as by one instrument, but as one working with Him, and from Him, <hi>Heb. 1. 2. Joh.</hi> 1. 3. 7. Though the grace of Redemption be not of equal extent with the work of Creation, there being many created, whom God will never save, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 21. yet, Gods equal interest in all by creation, doth abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly plead His liberty to save whom He pleaseth, and to save one as well as another, whatever a spirit of envy in some may say to the contrary: for, the Apostle's scope in saying God <hi>created all things by Jesus Christ,</hi> is, to shew, that none could justly stumble at God's saving the Gentiles, as well as the Jews, seing He had equal interest in both by creation. 8. The consideration of Christ's God-head, and of His creating all things, doth contribute much to the faith and right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of His discharging the mediatory Office, in uniting all the Elect to God, and among themselves; in so far as this consideration doth hold Him forth to be one fitted and enabled to do what is undertaken, and speaketh His interest in them as His creatures, and right to save them, if He please: for, that <hi>Paul</hi> may further clear this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of uniting Jew and Gentile in one by Christ, he mentioneth God's <hi>creating all things</hi> by Christ as God equall with Himself.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle doth magnifie his office, sixtly, from the advantage and benefit, which did thereby redound unto the glorified Angels, called here, <hi>principalities</hi> and <hi>powers,</hi> chiefly, because God maketh use of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie in governing the kingdomes and principalities of this world, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 13, 14. and, 10. 12, 13. and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the force and power they have in executing the will of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 20. and are said to be <hi>in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places,</hi> not as if they were never upon earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 1. but the place of their ordinary residence is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 10. Now, the Apostle sheweth, that this was one end intended by God to be brought about by his preaching the Gospel unto the Gentiles, even, that the Church, being hereby gathered of Jew and Gentile, might be as a glasse, wherein these glorious creatures should behold <hi>the manifold wisdom of God,</hi> that is, the many and signall evidences of Gods infinit wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom manifested in the way of salvation held forth by the Gospel, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1. 24. and in His diverse wayes of dispensing grace and salvation in several ages, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. (the Doctrine of salvation remaining alwayes the same for substance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 8.) and more especially, as to the present purpose, in His receiving the formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and idolatrous Gentiles unto fellowship and society with His Church, having abolished Circumcision and the rest of those leviticall Ordinances: which is the main subject of all that preceedeth this Verse in this Chapter. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

This may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Ministers of the Gospel not a little unto men, and beget reverence in them towards the same, that even the blessed Angels are in some sort bettered by it, and that it is therefore respected by them: for, <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his Office from this, that by occasion thereof <hi>unto the principalities and powers, was made known the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold wisdom of God.</hi> 4. Though Angels be most know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creatures, as enjoying the immediate sight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 10. yet they are ignorant of some things, which, by Gods way of dispensing the Gospel to His Church, they come to a more full know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of: and therefore, though their present state of happinesse doth give them full satisfaction for the time; yet it is capable of some addition, and to be perfected fully at the last day, even as the torments of the fallen Angels shall then, and not while then be compleat, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that <hi>by the Church was made known the manifold wisdom of God.</hi> 5. Neither the souls of just men made perfect, nor glorified Angels, though they enjoy the blessed sight of God, do yet by vertue thereof come to the knowledge of every thing, which God Himself doth know; and therefore it is without ground affirmed by Papists, that by this mean they know the prayers, which are uttered here on earth: for, the Apostle, sheweth that even the blessed Angels are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of some things, untill <hi>by the Church was made known


<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44180:261"/>

So unworthy (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7.) and contrary <hi>(Philip.</hi> 1. 19) are those means for the most part, whereby He worketh the end intended; So sweet an harmony and concord betwixt infinit mercy and infinit justice, doth appear in this way, each of those rejoycing over the other, and yet ceding one to another, to the full satisfaction of both, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. 26. So variously and wonderfully doth he confound the wisdom of men and devils, who would mar the salvation of the Elect by making them (nill they will they) to advance it, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 12. And gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally all His way is such, that (as it evidenceth infinit wisdom in God, who hath contrived, and doth manage it; So) it containeth many evidences of that kind: for, therefore is that, which the Angels do learn from the way of salvation revealed to the Church, and God's way of carrying on His people's salvation, called <hi>the manifold wisdom of God.</hi> 7.

                  <p>HE magnifieth his Office, seventhly, by shewing, first, that the making manifest this manifold wisdom of God, in the dispensation of grace both to Jew and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles by his Ministery, was a thing which God (who worketh all things according to the counsel of His own will, chap. 1. 11.) had resolved upon, and purposed, not of yesterday, but from all eternity, though for wise rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons he did reserve the making of so much known until the times of the Gospel. Next, that this eternal purpose, was purposed in Christ, to wit, not only as He was God equall with, and the eternal wisdom, of the Father, and so did joyn with Him in all His decrees and purposes; but also, as Mediator, God-man, by whom the Father was to effectuate and execute all His purposes for good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Church. See upon Chap. 1. ver. 4. for, the word rendered <hi>purposed,</hi> may be also rendered, <hi>He made,</hi> or, <hi>did execute in Christ. Doct.</hi> 1. This may commend the Ministery of the Gospel, and gain respect unto it, that the plot and draught of mans salvation dispensed thereby, is founded upon the wise and eternal counsel of God; and therefore such as will endure all the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of sinners, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. yea, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 24, 25. and self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemned sinners may safely venture their salvation upon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth magnifie his Office from this, that the message which he carried, was <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods eternal purpose.</hi> 2. This may also, upon the same grounds, commend the Ministery of the Gospel much, that Jesus Christ, being chosen by the Father for that end, hath taken-on, and doth daily execute His mediatory Office for bringing about the salvation of the Elect, according to the plot condescended upon in Gods eternal purpose, and dispensed by the Ministery of the Gospel: for, <hi>Paul</hi> commendeth his Ministery from this,


<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44180:262"/>
that God had <hi>purposed,</hi> and resolved upon that draught of salvation, <hi>in Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> 3. As God before all time hath fore-ordained in His eternal purpose what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cometh to passe in time, His works being known unto Him, and accordingly resolved upon by Him, before the worlds were made, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 18. So, though Gods way of dealing in time with men, and more particularly with His Church, doth alter; yet this inferreth not any change or alteration in His purpose, seing every dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation remaineth so long as He hath purposed, and every alteration falleth out according to His purpose: for, lest from what the Apostle spoke of Gods manifold wisdom in dispensing grace and salvation now, in a way diverse from what He did formerly, any should suspect, that therefore God had altered His purpose, he sheweth here all this had come to passe <hi>according to His eternal purpose.</hi> 4. As it is but small comfort unto a Minister, that he is intrusted to carry unto others an excellent message and glad tydings of the plot and draught of mans salvation surely grounded upon Gods purpose, and infallibly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by Christ in all its steps; except he make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and take a share of those glad tydings unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; So the way for either Pastor or People to apply the Gospel, and all those rich treasures of spiritual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings contained in it unto themselves, is, by taking hold upon Christ, and pleading a well-grounded interest in Him as theirs: for, if Christ be ours, all things are ours, <hi>Rom,</hi> 8. 32. Hence is it that <hi>Paul,</hi> having magnified his Ministery and Message, doth make application of those precious things which he was intrusted with, unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, by pleading an interest in Christ, as his, while he calleth Him <hi>Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi>

                  <p>HE doth magnifie his Office, eighthly, from three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent priviledges, whereof Believers among them (some in a greater, some in a lesser measure, some at one time, some at another) did partake by the means of his Ministery; as being thereby brought to Christ, in whom they enjoyed all these 1. <hi>Boldnesse,</hi> or liberty to speak all their mind freely (as the original word doth bear) whereby, as it is distinguished from the other two, is meaned that holy freedom and boldnesse, which is in reconciled souls to speak their whole heart to God, both in the duty of prayer and thanksgiving, and is opposed to misbelief, terror of conscience, or to whatsoever doth straiten the heart, or stop the mouth in discharging these duties. 2. <hi>Accesse,</hi> to wit, unto God, (See chap. 2. 18.) which is larger than the former, as comprehending free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and liberty of spirit in reconciled souls to exercise all their saving graces, in the exercise whereof commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God doth consist. 3. <hi>Confidence,</hi> or a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded perswasion, that both our persons and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances are accepted of God. All which priviledges he sheweth were enjoyed by them by vertue of their being in Christ, of whom he spoke, ver. 11. and by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of faith relying upon Him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatsoever worldly disadvantage may follow upon the preaching of the Gospel unto a People, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 34, 35. yet, those excellent and spiritual priviledges which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed thereby unto them who receive the Gospel, may and ought sufficiently commend the Ministery of it unto all: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth here commend his Office from these spiritual fruits which were enjoyed by it, as their being <hi>in Christ, in whom they had boldnesse, and accesse with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</hi> 2. And more particularly, liberty and freedom to speak our heart to God in all our concernments; and accesse to God, or fellowship with Him in the exercise


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:44180:263"/>
of all our graces (all obstructions arising either from the apprehension of Gods terror, and our own guiltinesse; or from our inability, backwardnesse of spirit to good; or, from those impediments which the devil, the world, or our own hearts do create and cast in our way, being removed) Those, I say, together with confidence, and a well-grounded perswasion that both our persons and duties are accepted of by God, may and will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serve to commend the Ministery of the Gospel unto those who have found it accompanied with such effects to their own hearts, whatever other troubles they may be under for their receiving of it: for, the Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his Ministery from their enjoying of those pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges in particular by the means thereof; <hi>In whom we have boldnesse, &amp;c.</hi> 3. The more a Christian doth find his heart enlarged, and his tongue loosed to speak unto God in the duties of prayer and praise, he will find the more of accesse unto, and of fellowship with, God in the exercise of all His saving graces; and the more a man be restrained of liberty in those duties, he will readily find himself the more restrained from the exercise of faith, hope, patience, humility, meeknesse, or any other of His saving graces: for, the Apostle conjoyneth <hi>boldnesse,</hi> or liberty in prayer and praises, with <hi>accesse,</hi> or freedom of spirit to approach unto God in the exercise of saving graces; <hi>In whom we have boldness and access.</hi> 4. A well-grounded perswasion of our acceptation with God, both as to our persons and actions, doth serve exceedingly to furnish the heart with boldnesse in prayer, and with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar accesse unto, and fellowship with God; in so far as a great many of those obstructions, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and accesse, do arise from diffidence, misbelieving doubts, or ignorance whether God accepteth of us or not, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. for, the Apostle speaketh of <hi>confidence,</hi> or of this well-grounded perswasion, as having some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the other two, while he saith, <hi>boldnesse, and accesse with confidence.</hi> 5. Those excellent priviledges of boldnesse, accesse and confidence, are not only purchased


<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44180:264"/>
and conveyed unto sinners by Christ; (as was explained in the point of accesse, chap. 2. ver. 18. doct. 2.) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so they are enjoyed by none but such as are in Christ, and united to Him by a lively and saving faith: and all who are not so in Christ, are estranged from spirituall liberty and boldnesse in prayer, though they be never so much flowing in eloquence and discourse: They are estranged also from accesse unto God, being banished from His favour and presence, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58. 3. and have no well-grounded confidence, that God doth accept either of their persons or actions, seing He is well-pleased only in Him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 17. for, he saith, <hi>In whom,</hi> meaning Christ, <hi>we have boldnesse and accesse with confidence:</hi> They were first in Him, 6. Faith in Jesus Christ (whereby we receive <hi>(Joh.</hi> 1. 12.) and rest upon Him for salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 10.) is one thing, and confidence or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of our acceptation with God is another; the former being the cause, root and fountain of the latter: For, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, that confidence floweth from faith, while he saith, <hi>with confidence by the faith of Him,</hi> or faith in Him. See <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. 7. As faith in Jesus Christ is that grace which uniteth us to Him; So it not only goeth before our boldnesse, accesse and confidence, but also maketh way for, and is the cause of those: and therefore, the more that faith is keeped in exercise, there will be the more of liberty and boldnesse; the more of accesse to God and nearnesse, and the more of a well-grounded perswasion of our acceptation by God, and confidence: for, he ascribeth their being in Christ, their accesse, boldnesse and confidence unto faith, while he saith, <hi>by the faith of Him.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, having now sufficiently magnified his Office, doth here, in the third branch of this first part of the Chapter, hold forth his main scope in all he hath


<pb n="193" facs="tcp:44180:264"/>
spoken from ver. 2. in an exhortation to courage, or a disswasive from fainting and discouragement in their Christian course, notwithstanding of his present sad suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, who had preached the Gospel among them. Which disswasive, as it is most humbly and affectionatly propounded; (for the word rendred <hi>desire,</hi> signifieth <hi>humbly to beg and intreat, Act.</hi> 3. 2. and 12. 20.) So it is most vehemently urged from three reasons, 1. Because of the worth and dignity of his Apostolick Office, spoken of in the preceeding verses, and related unto here, as one reason of the present disswasive, in the illative particle <hi>wherefore.</hi> 2. All his tribulations were in a special man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for them, to wit, not only for their confirmation, and example; but mainly because they were occasioned by his publick asserting the priviledges of the Gentiles by faith in Christ without circumcision, <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 21, 22. And thirdly, they were not only profitable unto them in the former respects; but also glorious and honourable, in so far, as God did herein shew how much He esteemed of them, by sending His Apostles not only to preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, but also to confirm the Gospel by their suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: and that hereby the glorious priviledges of the Gentiles, as to their interest in Christ, and all the blessings of the Covenant of Grace, were asserted and confirmed in despite of the desperate rage and fury of the Jews, <hi>Philip. 2. 17. Doct.</hi> 1. It is an ordinary evil, incident even to those who have once made swift progresse in their Christian course, to faint and relent in it, so as to give way unto lukewarmnesse and coldrifenesse, in stead of their former zeal and fervency, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4. to security and lazinesse, in stead of former watchfulnesse and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 7. to drouping discouragement and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse, in stead of former courage and chearfulnesse, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 12. for, this is the evil of fainting, which <hi>Paul</hi> did look upon as incident to those Ephesians, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore disswadeth from it; <hi>Wherefore I desire that ye faint not.</hi> 2. As tribulation for the Gospel, whether immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or already lying on, doth usually make those faint,


<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44180:265"/>
and turn remisse in their Christian course, who have not timeously fore-casten trouble before it came, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 17. So when trouble and persecution befalleth the Ministers of Christ, especially those who are primely instrumentall in the work of the Gospel, then are the Lords people most apt to faint and be discouraged; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that therein they do frequently with great anxiety and diffidence fore-cast irrepairable detriment to the work of God, as if God could not find out other hands to carry on His work, when such and such are laid aside: for, <hi>Paul</hi> fore-saw that his tribulation (who, having been such an eminent instrument in the work of the Gospel, did now every day expect death at <hi>Rome)</hi> would occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion their fainting, and therefore he doth guard against it; <hi>I desire, that ye faint not at my tribulation.</hi> 3. Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and tribulation for the Gospel, is a triall not only to those who are under it, but to others also, who look on, and ate in no lesse hazard to be thereby brangled in their confidence, blunted in their zeal, and rendered remisse in their former forewardness, than the person himself who suffereth: for, <hi>Paul</hi> is more afraid of their fainting because of his trouble, than of his own; and therefore doth carefully guard against it; <hi>I desire that ye faint not at my tribulation.</hi> 4. It is not sufficient for a faithfull Minister, that he labour earnestly to rouze up people from their naturall deadnesse, and once engage them in the way of Christianity, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. but he must also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep them moving, when they are so engaged, forecasting wisely, and labouring to remove carefully what offences and stumbling-blocks Satan and corrupt flesh may cast in their way to retard them in it, or make them turn aside from it: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> wisely foreseeth and carefully laboureth to remove that ground of stumbling and fainting, which they were apt to take from his suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; <hi>faint not at my tribulations.</hi> 5. A faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, suffering for truth, will not be so sollicitous for his own concernments relating to his outward estate, as for the Church and people of God, lest they be turned


<pb n="195" facs="tcp:44180:265"/>
aside, or made to faint by reason of his sufferings: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not so much desire, that they would furnish him with things necessary in the prison, or use means for his delivery from it, as that they <hi>faint not at his tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi> 6. It is not sufficient that Ministers exoner them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves simply in holding forth to people their dutie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they be vehemently serious in pressing upon them the practice of it: and this especially in hard declining times, wherein the dead and lukewarm affections of people use not to be easily wrought upon: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth affectionately <hi>desire,</hi> or humbly beg of them (as the word signifieth) <hi>that they would not faint.</hi> 7. This may sufficiently guard the Lord's people from discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, stumbling, and heartlesse fainting, notwithstanding the sad suffering lot, which is sometimes measured out unto the Lords faithfull servants for the truths cause, when they consider the excellent worth of truth, and how those, who suffer for it, have not cast themselves without necessity upon their sufferings, but were neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated to meet with them in the way of their calling: for, from what <hi>Paul</hi> hath said formerly, from ver. 2. of his calling to preach the Gospel among the Gentiles, and the worth of that message which he did carry, and was the occasion of his sufferings, he inferreth this disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, <hi>Wherefore, I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations.</hi> 8. This may in reason prevent the fainting and stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the Lords people at the contempt, reproach, and other hardships, under which they who preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, do for the most part labour, if they would seriously consider, that all those sufferings are occasioned in a great part by them, in so far, as if it were not for respect to the souls of people, Ministers might do much to shift the crosse, as well as others: for, <hi>Paul</hi> laboureth to prevent their fainting and stumbling at his sufferings from that consideration; <hi>faint not at my tribulations, which are for you,</hi> saith he, implying, if he had not preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel unto the Gentiles, he might have been free from trouble. 9. So honourable is it to suffer for Christ and


<pb n="196" facs="tcp:44180:266"/>
truth; that not only the persons themselves, who suffer, are thereby honoured, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 41. But also all such as have interest in them: and especially the sufferings of a faithfull Minister, are glorious and honourable unto his flock, as testifying Gods high esteem of them, in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing His servants to suffer for their good: which ought in reason to prevent their fainting at his sufferings; yea, and make them glory in them, and take encouragement from them: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, <hi>his tribulation was their glory,</hi> and therefore desireth them not to faint.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle doth now follow forth the second part of the Chapter, which was begun, ver. 1. and interrupted by a digression untill this verse, for such reason, as was given, ver. 2. And in this part of the Chapter (while he giveth a sum of his fervent prayers to God for them, that they might persevere and grow in the faith and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall knowledge of the Doctrine of Salvation deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by them) he doth not only give an evident testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his sincere affection and endeavour after their salvation; but also laboureth hereby to beget the like ardency of affection in them, and so doth (indirectly at least, though most pithily) by the example of his prayers, excite them to persevere and make progresse in the experimentall knowledge of, and communion with Jesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>In this prayer there is, first, a preface in those verses wherein he doth, 1. repeat the occasion of his prayer, which was mentioned, ver. 1-. and doth relate, as I there shew, unto the close of chap. 2. even because <hi>they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready builded by faith upon Christ.</hi> 2. He denominateth his prayer from the outward gesture he used therein, <hi>bowing of the knee,</hi> thereby expressing the humble, reverent frame of his heart in prayer. And, 3. he sheweth unto whom he


<pb n="197" facs="tcp:44180:266"/>
did pray, to wit, God the Father, described, first, from His relation to Jesus Christ, as chap. 1. ver. 17- This is the sum of verse 14. Secondly, from his relation to His Church, as being the Father by Adoption of the whole Church of the truly regenerate, whether triumphant in heaven, or militant upon earth, whether Jew or Gentile, which is here called a <hi>family,</hi> and said to have its name from God, as being His Familie, Children, Domesticks of His houshold, and that both in name and thing, the one whereof, is not to be separated from the other, seing God bestoweth not empty names and titles upon any. Now, God is thus described with relation to the purpose in hand; for, hereby the Apostle breaketh down the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance of the Jews, who would have had the whole Church denominated from, and contained within the Jewish Nation, excluding the Gentiles, whom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> doth upon all occasions make equal sharers of an interest in God through Christ with the Jews; and thereby sheweth his warrand to pray for perseverance and growth in grace from God, even to them.</p>
                  <p>From Vers. 14. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is the duty of Christs Ministers, as to teach and admonish the People of God committed to their charge, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. So also to pray to God for them: And that not only in publick with them, as being the mouth of the People unto God, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 17. but also in private to the Lord for them, seing their own pains cannot profit without the Lord's bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. which Ministers ought fervently to seek from God by prayer, else they have not ground to expect it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 37. for, <hi>Paul,</hi> as he taught these Ephesians; so he prayed for them, and that not only in publick, but also in private, as he here sheweth; <hi>For this cause I bow my knees.</hi> 2. It is of no small advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage unto the Lords People to have such a Minister as is able to pray, and accordingly doth pray pertinently, spiritually, and fervently with them and for them, By whom, as by their mouth, they may have their severall cases made known unto God more distinctly than can


<pb n="198" facs="tcp:44180:267"/>
be expressed by many of themselves, <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 17. and they themselves are edified and instructed how to pray with the like affection and fervency, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 19. By whose affectionate prayers unto God for them, a blessing is drawn down from heaven to make the Word preached effectual in them, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. -16. and they themselves inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and rouzed up to seek after those good things prayed for unto them: hereby also they are comforted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, as knowing their Minister is speaking to God for them, when he is absent from them, and cannot speak unto them, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 4. and when they through some one distemper or other cannot deal with God for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, at least in any measure satisfactory to themselves, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 14, 15. for, as <hi>Paul's</hi> exhortation and doctrine was advantagious unto these Ephesians; So also were his fervent prayers in order to their being kept from fainting, and to their up-stirring to endeavour after those good things, which he sought from God unto them, and therefore doth he mention his praying for them in this place; <hi>For this cause I bow my knees.</hi> 3. From the Apostle's scope in making known unto them, what, and how he prayed for them, See a further note, chap. 1. ver. 17. doct. 1. <hi>I bow my knees.</hi> 4. Our prayers unto God for others, especially the prayers of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster for his Flock, should take their rise, not only from their wants, afflictions and sinfull infirmities, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 14, 15. but also from the grace and good things of God already received by them, that they may persevere and grow in them, and be preserved from abusing them, seing the graces of the best are but imperfect, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. subject to decay, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 2—and may be abused, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. for, the Apostle taketh occasion to pray for these Ephesians from the good already received by them, even their being builded already upon Christ, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, chap. 2. ver. 22. unto which the words, <hi>for this cause,</hi> do relate. 5. Though we be not tied by a divine precept or Scripture-example unto any one gesture in prayer, seing the Saints have used several gestures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording


<pb n="199" facs="tcp:44180:267"/>
to the present frame of their heart thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, 1 <hi>King. 8. 22. 2 Sam. 12. 16. Luke 18. 13. 2 Sam.</hi> 7. 18. and though God be a Spirit who will be worshipped in spirit and in truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24. and careth not for the outward man alone, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 7, 8. yet, seing God craveth service both from the soul and body, as having created and redeemed both, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. and seing an outward reverend gesture of the body in prayer, doth not only expresse and natively flow from a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend frame of spirit within, from which the body is acted in other things, but also serveth to stir up the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in prayer, as being a man's remembrancer what his heart ought to do, if he would not play the grosse hypocrite with God, therefore it is a thing needfull and convenient (if we be not otherwise restrained, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2. 4.) to use some reverend gesture of the body while we are about the duty of prayer: for, <hi>Paul</hi> did kneel in prayer; <hi>I bow my knees,</hi> saith he. 6. We ought, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in prayer, to draw near to God with deep reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto, and high esteem of, the majesty of God, being joyned with low and mean thoughts of our selves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of our basenesse and unworthinesse, seing God honoureth them who honour Him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30. and giveth grace unto the humble, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. -6. for, <hi>Paul</hi> did evidence such a frame of heart by <hi>bowing his knees</hi> when he prayed. 7. Deep reverence of heart towards the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred majesty of God in prayer, may well consist with faith and confident approaching unto God, as a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled father. Both of them ought to be joyned together in prayer: yea, and both, when they are sincere and not counterfeit, do mutually strengthen and intend one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, so that the more we put our trust in Him, the more will our hearts fear and adore Him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 4. for, the Apostle exercised not only reverence in his prayer, as is already shown, but also confidence, while he taketh up God as <hi>the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> and of the whole family of Believers through Him. 8. See further (concerning this title given to God with


<pb n="200" facs="tcp:44180:268"/>
relation to Christ) upon chap. 1. ver. 3. in the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and doct. 2. and ver. 17. doct. 3, 5, 6. <hi>unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From Vers. 15. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As there is but one Church universal, comprehending all the Elect in all times and places, whether in heaven or earth; So all within the Church are of one kinred and linage, descending of one common father: for, he designeth the Church to be <hi>one whole family in heaven and earth:</hi> the word signifieth such a family as is the linage of one man. 2. As this one Church is Gods family and houshold; (See chap. 2. ver. 19. doct. 8.) So all the members of His Church and family are comprehended either in heaven or earth. Scripture knoweth nothing of a purgatory, or third place different from these: for, the Apostle shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this <hi>whole family is in heaven and earth,</hi> and <hi>named of God.</hi> 3. Those near relations, under which God doth stand towards His Church, are founded upon Jesus Christ: and all the benefits flowing from such relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are conveyed unto the Church through Him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom God is a consuming fire to sinners, and in whom He is a reconciled father unto Believers: for, the Apostle looketh upon God, first, as He is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and next, as He is the Father of all the Elect; <hi>Of whom the whole family is named,</hi> to wit, His children, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. and domesticks, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 19. 4. The near relation which God hath to His Church, and His Church to Him, is sufficient ground and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for faith to rest upon Him, and plead with Him for supply and furniture of all grace, and of every thing needfull: for, shall not He provide for His own children, who hath pronounced those among men to be worse than infidels, who provide not for theirs? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. Hence the Apostle maketh this a ground of his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be answered by God in what he sought in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of those Ephesians, even Gods fatherly interest in them; <hi>Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle doth, secondly, particularize those peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he put up to God in his prayer: and they are four.

Even the regenerate children of God, in seeking increase of strength, and of more grace from God, must not, if so they would obtain their suit, plead from their merit, or any good use they have made of their former grace; seing upon a strict account it will be found that grace hath not been so improven by the best as it ought, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. -6-. But they must seek what they so expect as a gift from God's free grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect had to their own worth: for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, while he seeketh increase of spirituall strength unto those converted Ephesians, he prayeth that <hi>God would


<pb n="203" facs="tcp:44180:269"/>
grant,</hi> or give it as a gift (for the word signifieth so much) and that from the inexhaustible fountain of His glorious grace; <hi>That He would grant unto you according to the riches of His glory,</hi> not, according to your worth. 6. As all the attributes of God, and especially His mercy and power, are not onely altogether glorious, because the glory of God is manifested unto the creatures in their severall wonderfull effects, <hi>Psal. 19. 1, &amp;c.</hi> but are also infinite, and without measure, as being indefatigable in working, wholly insuperable by any impediment or opposition whatsoever, and inexhaustible by supplying any want in the creature; So in making our approaches unto God for seeking any good, and especially saving good, it is most necessary, that we lift our eyes above any thing that is ours, whether our good, or our evil, and fasten them by faith upon that inexhaustible foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of mercy and power in God, whereby, he is not only willing as mercifull; but also able, as omnipotent, to bestow what ever we shall ask according to his will; for, the Apostle, in seeking spirituall strength for those Ephesians, doth look to the inexhaustible riches of Gods mercy and power, called here <hi>His glory; that He would grant according to the riches of His grace.</hi> 7. It is the Spirit of God, the third person in the blessed Trinity, who, taking up His place of abode in the truly regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 13.) doth make it His work to renew their strength by upholding and actuating their graces, and making them advance from strength to strength in despite of all imaginable difficulties: neither is there any other strength or might, whether naturall or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, which can sufficiently furnish us to rancounter all those difficulties, which are incident in our Christian course, but that whereof the Spirit of God residing in us is the author and giver: for he prayeth <hi>they may be strengthened with might in the inner man from the spirit.</hi> 8. Though Christians are not to neglect their outward and bodily concernments, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. 23. yet the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall estate of their eternall souls is to be cared for most,


<pb n="204" facs="tcp:44180:270"/>
and so much, as if it go well with that, and if the soul be strengthened with might for carrying on the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereof, their outward concernments may trouble them the lesse: and especially the care of Ministers should be employed about the inward and spirituall estate of their flock; for, <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth they may be <hi>strengthened in the inner man,</hi> his care did run most upon that.</p>

                  <p>HEre is the second petition of the Apostle's prayer, wherein he seeketh that which is the cause of strengthning and corroboration by the Spirit, spoken of, ver. 16. even that Jesus Christ by vertue of a continued act of lively faith in Him, might be perpetually present in His Vertue, Grace and Spirit, working not only in their tougnes and brains, but also and mainly in their hearts. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That we may partake of any saving benefit purchased by Christ, and particularly, that we may be strengthened with might by the Spirit in the inner man for doing any thing that is spiritually good, it is most necessary that we partake first of Christ Himself, being most strictly united to Him, and even as the members are to the head, from which they receive sense and motion. Christ giveth nothing of His purchase unto any, but to whom He giveth Himself first, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 11, 12. and to whomsoever He giveth Himself, upon those He bestoweth all things; Christ in us being the hope of glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. the fountain of life, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. and of all things needfull, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 4. 4. for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having prayed that they may be strengthened with might in the inner man, subjoyneth the way and manner how this strength was to be conveyed unto them, even by <hi>Christ's dwelling in their hearts by faith.</hi> 2. There is a strict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction and near familiarity between Christ and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, even such, in some sort, as is between an indwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and the house, wherein he dwelleth, whereby Jesus


<pb n="205" facs="tcp:44180:270"/>
Christ, God and Man in one person, is present with the Believer, not in His substance only, as He is God; for, so He is every where, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 24. nor in His substance at all, as He is Man; for, so the heavens do contain Him, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. but by His gracious operation and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall influence upon them, whereby He quickeneth them, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 8. 10.) ruleth them <hi>(Act.</hi> 9. 6.) and liveth in them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. for, he prayeth that <hi>Christ may dwell in their hearts,</hi> which petition is granted, in behalf of all Believers, seing he prayed in faith. 3, Though Christ doth thus familiarly communicate Himself unto all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, so as to dwell in them by His gracious presence; yet not unto all alike: but unto some in a larger mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure than unto others, according as He worketh more, and more effectually in some than in others: for, though Christ did already dwell in those converted Ephesians, chap. 2. 22. yet <hi>Paul</hi> doth pray that <hi>Christ may dwell in them,</hi> which therefore must be understood of a greater measure and degree of His indwelling presence, than formerly they had. 4. Where Jesus Christ doth once take up His abode and dwelling in the heart, there He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth constantly and flitteth not: in so far, as though sometimes He withholdeth that gracious influence of His, which is necessary only to the wel-being, flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and vigorous thriving of grace in the heart, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 6. yet He never withdraweth that influence, which is necessary to the being of grace, and without which grace would utterly die and perish, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 23. for, the word rendered <hi>to dwell,</hi> signifieth to take up a fixed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable habitation, and differeth from another word very like unto it, which signifieth to sojourn in a place only for a season, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 17. That Christ may dwell in your hearts.</hi> 5. Though even the bodies of Believers be temples of the holy Ghost, and consequently of Jesus Christ; for Christ dwelleth in them by His Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19. yet the heart, will and affections of man, are the chief place of His habitation, wherein He resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth as in His strong citadel, from which He comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

the other faculties and members. And without His presence there, He cannot have any habitation in any part of the man elsewhere; the tongue cannot receive Him by speaking, nor the understanding by knowing, nor the hand by external working, except He be received in the heart, from which proceed the issues of life, <hi>Pro.</hi> 4. 23. for, he prayeth that <hi>Christ may dwell in their hearts.</hi> 6. Though Jesus Christ doth make His first entry un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and dwelleth in Believers by His Spirit, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 13. whereby He uniteth them to Himself, quickeneth and ruleth them, yea, and worketh the grace of faith in them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. yet, faith being so wrought, the Believer doth thereby lay hold on Christ, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. -12. giveth Him daily imployment, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. -5. and Christ being so laid hold upon and imployed, remaineth and resideth in the Believer: for therefore is it, that he ascribeth this indwelling of Christ in the heart unto faith; <hi>that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith.</hi> 7.

                  <p>THe third petition followeth, wherein the thing prayed for, is an excellent effect of that spirituall corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, flowing from Christs dwelling in them by faith, spoken of, ver. 16. 17- even that God would make them grow in knowledge, especially in the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentall knowledge of his love in Christ. And, first, he setteth down the mean of attaining the thing prayed for, to wit, their firm and sure laying hold upon, and adhering to the love and free grace of God in Christ, as it is revealed in the Gospel, by the grace of faith, as trees are firmly fastened in the ground by their roots, and edifices are built, and lean upon their strong foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for, the two words <hi>rooted</hi> and <hi>grounded,</hi> are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors taken from trees and edifices, ver. -17. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the request it self, first proponed more obscurely, to wit, that they might be <hi>able to comprehend,</hi> or certainly to understand what that love of God in Christ is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he hath presently spoken, and is to speak immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately afterwards; and therefore it is most agreeable to the present purpose, that it be here understood as the thing which he would have them able to comprehend in its infinit greatnesse and full perfection, according to all its dimensions, as of <hi>breadth,</hi> whereby it is extended unto all ages, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. and all ranks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. of <hi>length,</hi> whereby it reacheth from eternity to eternity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103. 17. of <hi>depth,</hi> whereby it stoupeth down to the lowest depths of sin and misery, and draweth sinners from thence, <hi>Psal.</hi> 86. 13. and of <hi>height,</hi> whereby it reacheth up to heavenly joyes and happiness, and carrieth sinners up thither, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 3. which are the four usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dimensions and measures, according to which we


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:44180:272"/>
ordinarily take up the bignesse of grea test bodies. And withall, he sheweth that this compr ehension, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of Gods love here prayed for, was in part at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and in its full measure attainable after time by all reall Saints and sound Believers; that hereby those Ephesians might be more animated and incited to aspire unto it, vers. 18. Secondly, the request is proponed more plainly, to wit, that they might know in some measure, and chiefly from their own experience, this love, which is here called <hi>the love of Christ,</hi> not to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the love of the Father, or holy Ghost; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, the love of the whole Trinity is conveyed in the effects thereof towards lost sinners through Christ and His merit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. and concerning this love he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, that it <hi>doth passe knowledge,</hi> or created under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to know it, to wit, fully, and in its utmost extent, seing it is infinit, as God Himself is infinit, ver. 19-.</p>
                  <p>From ver. -17. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As trees cannot long stand against the blasts of boisterous winds, except their roots be deeply fastened in some good ground, and as houses cannot remain long firm and strong, except they be built upon some sure foundation; So neither can Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors hold out for any space of time against the furious assaults of many violent tentations, except they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-propped by, and rely upon some strong foundation; for, the Apostle expressing that stability and constancy arising from the faith of God's love, which he wished for to those Ephesians, by two metaphors taken from trees deeply rooted, and houses strongly built, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that without the faith of this love they were as trees without a root, and houses without a foundation; <hi>that ye being rooted and grounded in love.</hi> 2. The only sure foundation, whereon the soul being built and fastened, is able to stand out against the strongest blasts of most violent tentations, is the unchangeable and free love of God in Christ revealed in the Gospel, and laid hold upon by faith: and no conceit of our own righteousness,


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:44180:272"/>
naturall courage, fixed resolutions, or such like, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 33. with 70. for, the Apostle would have them <hi>rooted and grounded in love,</hi> to wit, the love of God in Christ. 3. As this love of God in Jesus Christ, is a most firm rock and sure foundation in it self; So it concerneth those, who would be sustained by it against the furious assaults of Sathans tentations from all hands, to be firmly fastened in, and built upon it: which is then done, when they do not rest upon the notionall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof in the brain, so as to be able pertinently to discourse of it; but when this marvellous love, and all the good things prepared by it are laid hold upon by faith, as they are offered: and this not faintly, but seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, as we would grip to a thing upon life and death, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. for, <hi>Paul</hi> would have them firmely fastned in, and built upon God's love, as trees are rooted in the ground, and houses are joyned with their foundations. And the mean whereby they were to be so rooted and grounded in God's love, is the grace of faith, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from a parallel place, <hi>Col. 2. 7. That ye being rooted and grounded in love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From ver. 18. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As they who have found the saving effects of Gods love in Christ, and consequently cannot but know something of it, do yet know but a small portion thereof; So the knowledge, and chiefly the experimentall knowledge of this abounding and marvellous love, from the felt and known effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is of great concernment unto Believers, and ought to be sought after by them accordingly: for, this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not only pleasant, as being of a subject won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, but also edifying, both in order to our comfort, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. -2. with 5. and to our incitement unto duty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. for, he prayeth for a greater measure of this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, even to those converted Ephesians, who had somewhat of it already; <hi>That ye may be able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what is the breadth, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Our embracing by faith the love of God in Christ, and those good things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by it, as they are revealed and offered in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,

is a necessary mean for attaining to fuller insight in the admirable nature of this love: yea, and to the sense and feeling of it, and experimentall knowledge flowing thence: for, he premits their being rooted in the faith of this love, ver. -17. as a mean for attaining the more full understanding, and especially the experimentall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it; <hi>That ye being rooted—may be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.</hi> 3. This love of God in Jesus Christ to lost sinners, is so large, <hi>(Isa.</hi> 55. 8, 9.) so free, <hi>(Hos.</hi> 14. 4.) and in all respects so wonderfull, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31. 19. So nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row are hearts to take it up, and so strange are the wayes of conveying the effects and fruits of this love through a wildernesse of triall and humiliation going before, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 14, 15, 16. that though it be revealed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16. yet no man can attain to know it so, as certainly to believe the reality of it, except it be given unto him graciously of God; and therefore prayer to God, would be joyned with the use of other means for attaining to it, for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth pray to God that they <hi>may be able to comprehend,</hi> or certainly to understand and know <hi>what is the breadth.</hi> 4. We are not to content our selves with a superficiall view of God's free love in Christ; but ought to take most accurate inspection of it in all its dimensions, and in all those several respects and wayes wherein it is manifested, endeavouring, at least, to know it so far, as that which is infinite may be known by finit creatures, and to know it in its outmost capacity, as reaching beyond all created understanding, upward, downward, to the right-hand, and to the left; that so we may be the more constrained to our duty by it; more ravished with the thoughts of it, and may draw more solid comfort from it. All which profitable effects, are obstructed by our narrow thoughts and shallow appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of Gods love in Christ: for, he prayeth <hi>they may be able to comprehend it</hi> in all its dimensions of <hi>breadth and length, depth and height.</hi> 5. As every real Saint, and all who are inherently holy have their allotted measure from God of the saving knowledge of Gods


<pb n="211" facs="tcp:44180:273"/>
love in Christ, and shall attain to the full knowledge thereof afterwards; So whatever priviledge the Lord is pleased to bestow upon the Saints in common, we ought to aspire unto it, and confidently expect to receive it from the Lord: for, as he maketh this comprehension and knowledge, here spoken of, a common priviledge of all Saints; So he doth thereby animate and incite the Ephesians to seek and expect it from God in answer to his prayers; <hi>That ye may be able to comprehend with all Saints.</hi> 6. As the love of Christ is the common treasure and allowance of all Saints, whatever be their different lot in other things; So they who would clear an interest in this love, must study sanctity and holinesse, as that without which no man can convincingly prove his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 21, 23. for, he maketh the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending of Christs love, a priviledge of those only who are Saints and holy; <hi>Ye may be able to comprehend with all Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From Vers. 19- <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The love of God in Christ, and of Christ to lost sinners, is so rich and unsearchable, <hi>(Eph.</hi> 2. 7.) so vast, boundlesse, yea, and infinit, (See ver. 18.) So matchlesse, and without any parallel to equal it, whereby we might come to the exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7, 8. that not only the naturall man cannot understand it at all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. but even those who are truly renewed, do not take it up fully, as it is in it self, and so, as they can expresse those infinit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable riches which are in it: they do but know in part, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. for, the Apostle saith, <hi>this love of Christ passeth knowledge.</hi> 2. Though this love of Christ passeth knowledge in the sense presently mentioned; yet every true Believer should endeavour to attain, yea, and doth attain to the knowledge of it in some measure, and so far as is necessary for their salvation and comfort: for, though this love is unsearchable, yea, and infinit; yet created understanding may so far comprehend it, as to know it to be infinit; and that there is not so much known, but more doth yet remain to be known of it.


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:44180:274"/>
They may know it so, as to stand and wonder at it, as not being able perfectly to comprehend it: and they may know it thus, partly, from what the Spirit of God in Scripture, condescending to our capacity so far as is possible, doth speak of it; and partly, from those effects of this unsearchable love which they do find to be wrought in themselves by it: for, the Apostle prayeth <hi>they may know this love of Christ which passeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi> hereby implying, that the knowledge thereof may be attained in some measure, and that it is our duty to seek after it. 3. The infinit and unsearchable nature of this love of God in Christ to sinners, should be so far from discouraging Believers to search after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, that by the contrary we ought to be so much the more encouraged in that search, and this for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons given, ver. 8. doct. 12. for, he addeth this of its passing knowledge, as it seemeth, of purpose to provoke them so much the more to seek after the knowledge of it; <hi>And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.</hi>

Such a fulnesse is spoken of, <hi>Rom. 15. 14. 1 Corinth.</hi> 1. 5, 7. and prayed-for here; <hi>That ye may be filled.</hi> 2. All the fulnesse, and compleatnesse in grace attainable here, is but an emptinesse, being compared with that fulnesse in glory, which shall be attained here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, called here the <hi>fulnesse of God,</hi> and is made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of as the journey's end, to be aspired unto and aimed at, as a step far beyond any fulnesse which can be attained here: for, he saith, <hi>that ye may be filled with,</hi> or <hi>untill, all the fulnesse of God:</hi> where he implieth a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold fulnesse, the former attainable here, by which we advance to that other fulnesse in glory, which shall be enjoyed herafter. 3. The desires and endeavours of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers after Christ and Grace, should not be easily satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, nor stand at a stay for every attainment; but ought to be inlarged, and alwayes advancing towards a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther measure than any thing already received, even to that fulnesse of grace attainable here; yea, and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most measure of grace here, is not to be rested upon, as fully satisfying, nor any thing else, untill grace be fully compleated in glory hereafter: for, the Apostle, not being satisfied with what he hath asked already, doth here pray, <hi>that they may be filled</hi> even <hi>untill all the fulnesse of God:</hi> and hereby teacheth them to be satisfied with no lesse. 4. The state of Believers in heaven shall be most glorious and blessed, as being no lesse than, first,


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:44180:275"/>
the enjoying of Gods immediate presence by sense, not by faith or through the glasse of Ordinances, which shall then be laid aside, God Himself being all in all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. And, secondly, the enjoying of His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence fully, and so far as finit creatures can be capable of that which is infinit, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. -2. for, this is to be <hi>filled with the fulnesse of God,</hi> which shall be attained in heaven.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle, lastly, concludeth his prayers with an heavenly strain of thanksgiving to God, whereby he laboureth, indirectly at least, to perswade them that he would be answered in those great and large petitions, which he had put up to God for them, seing he himself was so much perswaded of it, that he breaketh forth in thanksgiving to God for it, even as if all he sought had been already granted. And therefore he doth labour to perswade them further by that apposit description, which he giveth of God in the first part of this thanksgiving, taken from God's infinit power, whereby He is able, not only to bestow moe things and greater than we can either expresse, by seeking them in prayer, or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend in our thoughts, which are oftentimes larger than can be vented by expressions; but also to bestow those greater things in a large and abundant measure. And because this of God's power, absolutely considered, had been a weak ground for faith to lean upon, seing He is able to do many things which He doth not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 53. therefore he giveth an instance, or proof, of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit power in what He had wrought in Believers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, by converting, quickening and carrying on the work of grace to some good length in them, leaving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them to gather hence, that the same power would be forth-coming, and applied unto work for them in time


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:44180:275"/>
coming, as the exigence of their case and state should require. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the duties of prayer and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, do mutually contribute for the help one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, (See chap. 1. ver. 16. doct. 1.) So we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ordinarily be fervent in prayer, but of necessity our heart will sometimes break forth in thanksgiving to God among hands, occasioned partly, by those hopes of an answer, which sometimes are in the very time of prayer suggested by God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 6. 8. partly, from the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of mercies formerly bestowed, which are called to mind in prayer, as arguments to plead for our present suit, <hi>Psal.</hi> 56. 12, 13. and partly, from that felt accesse to God enjoyed in prayer, <hi>Psal. 57. 1, &amp;c.</hi> with His gracious presence and assistance communicated to the heart, chiefly when we are discharging that duty, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138. 3. for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having prayed fervently, doth find his heart constrained to break forth in a song of praise; <hi>Now unto him that is able—be glory.</hi> 2. As we ought not only to pray, but also study what grounds of hope we may attain, for coming speed in prayer; So we should have such conceptions of God, and expresse them to Himself by way of thanksgiving in prayer, as may furnish our hearts with grounds of confidence, that we shall be heard in what we seek: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> in giving thanks to God, describeth Him from this, that <hi>He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think,</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by giving them ground to believe, that the former great things sought by him should be granted. 3. We ought especially to establish our hearts in the faith of Gods omnipotency and power to bestow that which we seek, as a main prop for confidence in prayer, seing it is above all doubt, that God will do whatever He is able for granting our petitions, if we seek those things which He hath promised, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 14. and therefore usually the doubts of Believers concerning God's good-will to grant, are but pretences to cover their shamefull and atheisticall doubting about His power: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> to ground their confidence in expectation of an answer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44180:276"/>
God from His power, whereby <hi>He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.</hi> 4. As our prayers would be well digested, and diligent consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration had of those things we are to seek, else our prayers are but lip labour of the grossest sort; So our conceptions concerning things lawfull and necessary to be sought in prayer, go oftentimes beyond our expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Eeither we dare not expresse them, they are so great, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 18, 19. or we cannot expresse them, they are so many, that expression is too narrow a vent or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. -26. for, he joyneth <hi>thinking,</hi> or conceiving, with asking, and speaketh of it as being more capacious and comprehensive than our asking doth reach unto, while he saith, <hi>above all that we ask or think.</hi> 5. So large is God in His bounty, and so mercifull in His way of dealing with His people, that He doth far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stripe not only their prayers, but also their very concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and hopes, in so far as when they obtain not all they ask, even then they get above what they ask, delay or disappointment being in that case much better for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall reasons than a present grant: for, saith <hi>Paul, He is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think.</hi> Now he speaketh not of His absolute power, but as it is operative, and working in, and for Believers, as appeareth from the instance given; <hi>according to the power that worketh in us,</hi> saith he. 6. This superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant work of Gods mighty power, transcending the hopes and apprehensions of the most inlarged hearts, is not reserved wholly to be manifested in the glorification of the Elect; but is manifested already to every Believer in part; in so far as the work of their conversion at the first, of carrying on the work of grace in them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, of their through-bearing under, and delivery from crosses and trials, the timous and unexpected tryst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of severall comfortable providences with their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, are so many proofs and instances of Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above what they do ask, or think; for <hi>He is able to work</hi> so, saith he, <hi>according to the power that worketh


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:44180:276"/>
in us.</hi> 7. We ought to look upon the by past instances of Gods gracious and powerfull working in us, as so many confirmations of our faith, that He will work powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in us for the time to come, yea, and above what He hath already wrought, according as our present state shall call for it: for, he maketh God's working powerfully in them at their conversion, an argument to confirm them, that God would work exceeding abundantly even to the fulfilling of all his petitions for them, the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of some whereof, to wit, their being filled with the fulnesse of God, was more than any thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready wrought in them; <hi>according to the working of His</hi> mighty <hi>power,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>NExt, there is the thanksgiving it self, wherein the Apostle (having his own heart, doubtlesse, duely affected and overcharged with high thoughts of Gods goodnesse, mercy, power, justice, and other attributes manifested chiefly in that admirable work of Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, whereof he hath spoken at length from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Epistle; and having engaged his heart to set forth the glory and excellency of those praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy attributes, both in word and work) doth further wish that this duty of glorifying God may, and thereby also doth foreprophesie that it shall be gone about by Gods true Church, to wit, among visible professours, members of the Church, and chiefly, sincere Believers, (even all such as should find the saving effects of Gods glorious attributes in their own experience) and this in <hi>all ages</hi> and generations, so long as the world should stand, and to all eternity after time shall be ended; and <hi>by Jesus Christ,</hi> in whom all their sacrifices of prayers and praises, or of any other performance, are accepted of God. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

God hath graciously done already; but what He is yet to do, together with the consideration of His power and goodwill to do them: for, the Apostle doth here ascribe glory to God, even for what <hi>He was able to do above what they could ask or think,</hi> as appeareth from the connexion of the two verses. 2.

               <p>THe Apostle, having in the three preceeding Chapters given a short sum of saving doctrine, doth now, to ver. 21. chap. 6. exhort them to suitable practice. And, first, being to presse upon them the practice of such duties as are more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and common to all, as they are Christians, to chap. 5. ver. 22. He doth, in the first part of this Chapter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them to unity: and, to make way for his so doing, he first premitteth a general exhortation to walk worthy of their vocation, ver. 1. And next, subjoyneth a more particular exhortation unto such graces, as have a more special influence upon unity, as humility, &amp;c. ver. 2. and so doth fall upon his intended scope, which is to presse upon them the study of unity, ver. 3. Which he inforceth, 1. by an argument taken from seven things, which are one and the same in the Church and all the


<pb n="220" facs="tcp:44180:278"/>
true members thereof, ver. 4, 5, 6. Secondly, by an other argument, taken from these things which are not one, but diverse, almost in every member, to wit, diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of gifts and graces, and their different measures; which diversity he showeth doth also tend to union, first, because all those gifts and different measures do come from one author, Christ, ver. 7. which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth from <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 18. cited, ver. 8. commented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and applied, ver. 9, 10. And further confirmeth it, by giving an instance of those severall gifts, in the severall offices appointed by Christ in the Church, ver. 11. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because they are all given for promoting the same end, the edifying of the Church, first, propounded, ver. 12. secondly, illustrated from the term of its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance by those means, ver. 13. and from two of its fruits, to wit, preservation from error, ver. 14. and growth in grace, ver. 15. by vertue of influence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from Christ, ver. 16.</p>
               <p>In the second part, he dehorteth them from all impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and profanity in the general; first, because uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Gentiles did live in those, ver. 17. whose godlesse conversation is set forth distinctly in its several branches and degrees, ver. 18, 19. Secondly, because the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which they had of Christ, was inconsistent with such a licentious life, ver. 20. which he proveth from three things, which that knowledge did oblige, and strongly incline them to, first, to mortifie the old man, ver. 22. secondly, to have the mind or understanding renewed, ver. 23. thirdly, to put on the new man in righteousnesse and holinesse, ver. 24.</p>
               <p>In the third part of the Chapter, are six particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, belonging to the second Table: The first is to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain from lying, and to speak truth, ver. 25. The second, to moderate and suppresse anger, ver. 26. else they did cast open doors for Satan to tempt them unto some mischief, ver. 27. The third, to abstain from stealing, and to labour diligently in some lawfull calling, ver. 28. The fourth, to abstain from all corrupt communication,


<pb n="221" facs="tcp:44180:278"/>
and to utter edifying purpose in their ordinary discourse, ver. 29. because they would otherwise grieve the spirit, ver. 30. The fifth, is, to abstain from all the branches, degrees, and effects of sinfull anger, ver. 31. The sixth is, to exercise kindnesse and tender-heartednesse in mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual forgivenesse, ver. 32.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle doth here inforce one generall duty, which is a comprehensive sum of all such other duties as he is to presse afterwards, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of that unity, unto which he exhorteth in the first part of the Chapter, is a special evidence. Which general exhortation, is, <hi>that</hi> (supposing that they were effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, at least they took themselves for such, and the better part were really such) <hi>they would walk worthy of their vocation,</hi> not, as if they had been to purchase and merit by their walking, that God should call them: for, the text holdeth out, that they behoved to be called, before they could walk after the manner which the Apostle here presseth, and therefore were not to merit vocation by their walking: See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. but that they ought to walk suitably, and as it becometh those who are dignified with such a calling, as the word is rendred, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 2. Which exhortation is propounded by way of intreaty, and backed with two arguments. The first whereof, is hinted at in the illative particle, <hi>therefore,</hi> and it is taken from that excellent state, in which free grace had placed them, spoken of in the three preceeding Chapters. The second, is taken from the suffering condition of <hi>Paul</hi> himself who did exhort, whose sad sufferings might justly challenge from them obedience unto those truths for which he suffered, as that which would comfort him much under his suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and their denial whereof could not but adde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:44180:279"/>
to his bonds. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Doctrine of salvation through free grace in Jesus Christ, is so far from ministring an occasion of security, ungodlinesse or profanity, that there is no stronger argument to induce men to the conscientious practice of holines in all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof, than sanctified knowledge, saving faith, and the solid consideration of that Doctrine, especially seing the principles thereof do many wayes engage the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to lead an holy life, <hi>Rom. 6. 2, &amp;c.</hi> and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gifted salvation offered by it cannot be imbraced, except covenanted strength for through-bearing in the way of holinesse be imbraced also, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. for, he infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the study of holinesse from the Doctrine of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through free grace; the former being, as it were, the native result, and inseparable companion of the latter; <hi>I therefore beseech you, that ye walk worthy.</hi> 2. Though there be a necessary connexion betwixt our imbracing the doctrine of salvation through free grace, and the study of an holy life, as said is; yet such is our natural aversnesse from holinesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. so many are the tentations and difficulties which ly in our way to it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12. that even, the best of men do need the spur of earnest and vehement exhortation to excite unto it: for, notwithstanding that <hi>Paul</hi> holdeth forth upright practice, as the result of imbracing the former doctrine; Yet he seeth it needfull to exhort and <hi>beseech them, that they walk worthy of their vocation.</hi> 3. A suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering lot for Christ, is such, as those who rightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it, will highly esteem of it, not onely in their first thoughts, and at their first engaging in it, but also, and chiefly in their cold bloud, after a times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and in their second thoughts: for, <hi>Paul</hi> having boasted (chap. 3. ver. 1.) of his being a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner for Christ, he doth here repeat the same, to shew he had not reason to eat-in any thing of what he former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had said; <hi>I therefore the prisoner of the Lord.</hi> 4. It sweetneth much the sufferings of the Saints, that he for whom they suffer is Christ, the Lord, as being worthy

The suffering lot of Christs Ministers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth people to yeeld themselves so much the more obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in the Lord unto their Ministery, by walking like the Gospel, there being nothing more comfortable to His suffering Servants, than when their sufferings are usefull for that end, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 14. and nothing more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than when it is otherwise, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10, 16. for, <hi>Paul</hi> designeth himself from his sufferings, hereby to adde weight to his exhortation; <hi>I therefore the prisoner of the Lord.</hi> See more from this stile taken by <hi>Paul,</hi> chap. 3. ver. 1. doct. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. So ticklish are people to be dealt with in the point of pressing duty, and so ready to cast at duty, when it is not pressed in a way suitable to their own mind, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3. that though Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are not to be directed by people, as to the matter which they preach, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. 12. 13. yet as to the manner of bearing-in what is pressed, they are much to condescend to that way, which will be most taking with, and gaining upon, their humor: and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are to presse the duties of holinesse, with as much of servent, earnest, and insinuative entreaty, as if it were a matter of their own concernment only, or as if people by their obedience were to hurt themselves for doing a favour unto their Ministers; for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth presse his exhortation by an insinuative entreaty, rather than by commanding; <hi>I beseech you,</hi> the word signifieth, vehemently to entreat. 7. It is no small honour, which God doth put upon His people, when He effectually calleth them, and by His omnipotent and irresistible power <hi>(Joh.</hi> 12. 32.) doth draw these, who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dead in sins and trespasses <hi>(Eph.</hi> 2. 1.) from under the power of darknesse, and translateth them unto the


<pb n="224" facs="tcp:44180:280"/>
Kingdom of His dear Son, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. giving them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all possession of the state of grace, with all the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges accompanying that state here, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 2-. and a right unto, <hi>(Luk.</hi> 12. 32.) with the well grounded hope of, glory, to be enjoyed hereafter, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 18. for he speaketh of their vocation, as a state of much digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and honour, requiring a singular sort of walking an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to it; <hi>That ye walk worthy of the vocation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ye are called.</hi> 8. So far are we from meriting by our holy and tender walking, that God shall call us out of nature unto the state of grace, and consequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow a right to heaven and glory upon us, that our ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall calling doth go before our holy walking, as that, without which we cannot walk one step acceptably in the wayes of God: for, <hi>Paul</hi> supponeth them to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready called, and from that exhorteth them to walk answerably; <hi>That ye walk worthy of the vocation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ye are called.</hi> 9. It is the duty of called Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and will also be their care and study, to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant eye upon that dignity, unto which they are called; that so they may walk worthy of it, and answerably unto it: which then is in some measure performed, when we have respect unto all the commandments, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 6. and do in a speciall manner make conscience of all those particular duties, aftermentioned in this Epistle: for, he exhorteth them to walk worthy of their vocation, as their duty following upon, and flowing from, that dignity put upon them in effectall calling; <hi>Walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the vocation, wherewith ye are called.</hi> 10. But more particularly, Our carriage and practice cannot be answerable to this excellent state, to which we are called, except, first, we shake off slouth and lazinesse, bestirring our selves in the way of duty. Secondly, as we begin well, so we hold on without down-sitting and turning aside. And, thirdly, we be daily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing, and making progresse in our Christian course; for, he designeth a carriage answerable to this excellent state by <hi>walking,</hi> which implieth all those three, motion

                  <p>HE doth, next, exhort unto severall graces and duties, the exercise and practice whereof, are not only branches of that walking worthy of their vocation, spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, ver. 1. and here pressed, as such, but also ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary helps and means for attaining and entertaining that unity, which he is afterwards to presse, as, first, humility, or <hi>lowlinesse,</hi> a grace and vertue, whereby a man, from the sense of his own infirmities <hi>(Gal.</hi> 6. ver. 1.) and the uncertainty of outward things which he enjoyeth, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17.) doth esteem but meanly and soberly of himself, and of all that is his, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 3.

The grace of humility and lowlinesse, as it is most beseeming Christians; so it is of necessary use to fit men for the duty of mutuall forbearance in order to unity and peace; in so far, as the humble man, being conscious of his own infirmities, doth know he needeth as much of forbearance from God and others, as others do need from him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18. and through humility is made to think but meanly of himself, and highly of others, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 3, 4. and so to eschew vain glory and pride, the usuall occasion of strife, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 10. for, he presseth lowlinesse, in order to forbearance and unity, while he saith, <hi>with all lowliness, forbearing one another,</hi> and ver. 3. <hi>endeavouring to keep unity.</hi> 3. Humility and lowlinesse is also necessary to the exercise of meeknesse and long-suffering; those only being able to moderate anger, and to restrain the inundations of their impetuous passions, when stirred and provoked by real injuries, who being conscious of their own infirmities, do judge but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of themselves, and therefore not too good to have, by the Lords wise and gracious dispensation, a suffering lot from the wicked and injurious carriage of others, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10. for, he presseth humility in the first place,


<pb n="227" facs="tcp:44180:281"/>
as the foundation of, and enterance unto, all the rest; <hi>With all lowlinesse, and meeknesse, with long-suffering.</hi> 4. There is an all-nesse, or universality, which ought to be in the grace of lowlinesse, first, with respect to the subject: it ought to extend it self to the whole man, as being seated in the heart, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. -3-. and kything in the outward carriage, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 8. Secondly, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to all objects: There must be humility towards God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 19. and humility also towards men, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 3. and towards all sorts of men, not only supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours <hi>(Levit.</hi> 19. 32) but inferiours also, <hi>Job</hi> 31. 13. Thirdly, with respect to the grace it self, as being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mixture of the contrary vice, so far as is possible, <hi>Psal.</hi> 131. 1, 2. and daily growing up towards perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 7. 1. Fourthly, with respect to all cases, so as it be exercised in prosperity <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 16. 49.) as well as adversity: for, saith he, <hi>with all lowlinesse,</hi> which note of universality, is oft made use of by the Apostle when he would expresse a great measure and degree of any gift or grace. See 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 5. Philip. 1. -9. Doct.</hi> 5. Meeknesse and long-suffering, as they differ but little in substance, and are commendable graces in themselves; so they are notable means and helps to fit men for the duty of mutuall forbearance, in order to unity; in so far as they do render him, who is endued with them, gentle, affable and easie to be conversed with, and do moderate anger, which is ready to blow the bellows of contention and to stir up strife, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 18. for, he exhorteth unto meéknesse and long-suffering in order to forbearance and unity; <hi>With meeknesse, long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, forbearing one another—endeavouring to keep unity.</hi> 6. The best of men have their own infirmities, mistakes and failings, mutually justling and rubbing upon each other, whereby they prove often unpleasant and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome one to another: for, this is supposed, while they are commanded to <hi>forbear one another.</hi> 7. It is the duty of Christians mutually to tolerate, and forbear one another, even when there are real grounds of displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:44180:282"/>
for, hereby a man overcometh himself, and his own corrupt nature, which thirsteth after revenge, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 32. hereby he overcometh and shameth his party who did him wrong, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 17. and keepeth Gods way in overcoming of him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 17-, 21. and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man also in some comfortable measure doth enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain peace with others, which otherwise upon every occasion would blow up and evanish: for, he enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this mutuall forbearance, as a remedy against the clashing of mutuall infirmities, and for entertaining of unity and peace; <hi>forbearing one another—endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to keep the unity of the Spirit.</hi> 8. This duty of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance is to be exercised to the person of our brother, rather than his faults: we are so to bear with his person, as to endeavour the bearing down of his sin, by admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, (2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 15.) reproof <hi>(Levit.</hi> 19. 17.) or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, <hi>(Prov.</hi> 13. 24.) as we have otherwise accesse: and yet we are so to meddle with his faults, as in the mean time we may give due respect to his person, not irritating, or provoking his corruptions, while we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to cure them: for, saith he, <hi>forbearing one another,</hi> which relateth to persons rather than to faults. 9. This duty of forbearance ought to be mutuall, and cannot in reason be expected by any from others to themselves, who are not ready themselves to repay it unto others; seing there is no man, who wanteth his own infirmities which call for forbearance, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 2. and that every man is obliged to do, as he would be done to by others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 12. for, saith he, <hi>forbearing one another.</hi> 10. Love to our neighbour, whereby our heart and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most affections are inclined and disposed towards him for his good, as they ought, as it is the great root and fountain of all duties towards others, without which they are but counterfeit shadows, and not real and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. So it doth in a speciall manner dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and fit us for this duty of mutuall forbearance; love covereth a multitude of sins, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 8. and maketh us bear with many things in the person loved,

1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4, 7. which otherwise flesh and bloud would not digest, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15. for, he holdeth out love as the fountain of all the rest, and especially of mutuall forbearance; <hi>With all lowlinesse—forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in love.</hi> 11. Whence it followeth, that this duty of mutuall forbearance ought to flow from a principle of love: and therefore, though we forbear from neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, because we dare not do otherwise; or, from policie, untill we get opportunity to right our selves; or, from respect to our own ease only, lest by resenting injuries and miscarriages, we create trouble to ourselves; or, if we tolerate, connive at, and foster the sins of others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of forbearing them, which is inconsistent with love to them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 17. In all those cases, our forbearance is not acceptable service to God, nor yet in any case but when it is performed in love, and from a principle thereof: for, the forbearance he enjoyneth, is, <hi>forbearing one another in love.</hi>

                  <p>HE doth now fall upon the main scope of this first part of the Chapter, exhorting them by all possible endeavours to keep the union of all the members of the Church, being united together by the holy Ghost, even in heart, and especially in things spiritual: all which are implyed in this <hi>unity of the spirit,</hi> and that, in order to this unity, they would be of a peaceable disposition and deportment, to wit, so as not to make unnecessary rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and breaches upon every difference, whereby they should be firmly knit together, as the members of one body by its several ligaments and sinnews. <hi>Doct.</hi>

                     </gap>. As there are several sorts of union in the Church, and more particularly, besides that union which is amongst the members of the invisible Church, the bond whereof is the saving graces of Gods Spirit, (all of them being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Christ, the head, by faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. and one to


<pb n="230" facs="tcp:44180:283"/>
another by love, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 14.) There is an union also of the visible Church and the members thereof amongst themselves: and this is twofold, the one necessary to the being of a Church and being of a Church-member, so that a Church cannot be a Church, nor a man a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the visible Church without it: the ty of which union is Gods Covenant with the visible Church, and the Churches professed imbracing and laying hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Covenant, when offered in the Gospel, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 5. the other necessary to the welbeing of the Church, which is entertained by unity in judgement, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 10.) in heart and affection, <hi>(Act.</hi> 4. 32.) by concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in purposes and actings, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. -27. So all those sorts of union, and union in all those respects, is to be sought after and entertained in the Church: for, the Apostle speaketh indefinitly, <hi>Endeavouring to keep the union of the Spirit.</hi> 2. The union which God requireth among His People, is not an union in sin or error, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 12. nor yet a civil union only, in things worldly, upon politick and civil interests, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. 20. nor yet a meer outside agreement, or living together only, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 21. but an union in heart and spirit, in things spiritual, and such an union, whereof the Spirit of God is author: for, therefore is it called the unity of the Spirit; <hi>Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to keep the unity of the Spirit.</hi> 3. The study of keeping peace and unity in the Church, is a most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary duty, as being one prime instance of walking worthy of our vocation, spoken of, ver. 1. and yet such is the restlesnesse of some, and the prevalency of pride, passion, love to self-interest, and such like dividing lusts in others, that it is a duty most difficile to be practised, as being the result of all those graces, mentioned, ver. 2. and not attainable, even by those who are endued with those graces, except they apply themselves wholly to it, and use the utmost of their serious endeavours for that end, as is clear from the connexion of this verse with the two preceeding, and from the word in the original, rendered <hi>endeavouring,</hi> implying study, diligence and


<pb n="231" facs="tcp:44180:283"/>
solicitude. 4. Neither fair pretences for peace and union in the Church, not seconded, but rather contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, by practice, nor yet some carelesse endeavours, which are easily broken by appearing difficulties, are that which God will accept of at our hands as the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty required for preserving unity in the Church, where it is, or for restoring unity where it is already lost: there is no lesse called-for than the utmost of our serious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for that end, so as we not only carefully eschew what may on our part give cause of renting, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 13. but also, that we be not easily provoked when a cause of renting is given by others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. and that, when a rent is made, we spare no pains, nor stand upon any thing, which properly is our own, for having it removed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 8, 9. and that we do not-weary of those endeavours under small appearances of present successe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 15. for, he biddeth them seriously <hi>endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit.</hi> 5. So many are the temptations arising from the corruptions of those among whom we live, to make us neglect this duty of keeping the union of the Spirit, that except we be of such peaceable dispositions as to digest many things one in another, which otherwise our corruptions would make much stir about, we cannot choose but fall at ods, rent assunder as so many disjoynted legs and arms, and upon every occasion involve our selves and the Church of Christ in several sad and dangerous broils and rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for, he calleth <hi>peace,</hi> that is, a peaceable dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, kything in all our deportment, the <hi>bond,</hi> or ligament, whereby the members of the Church are knit together; <hi>in the bond of peace,</hi> saith he. 6. Whatever differences may fall out among the members of the Church in the matter of opinion and judgment; yet they are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to break the bond of peaceable walking one with another by counteractings and factious sidings; but ought to study unanimous and joynt practice in those things wherein there is agreement; and where this peaceable deportment, flowing from a peaceable frame of


<pb n="232" facs="tcp:44180:284"/>
spirit, is, it tendeth much to preserve what remaineth of this spiritual unity, and to regain what is already lost: for, peace with man, which is the peace here spoken of, doth especially consist in our harmonious walking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, flowing from a peaceable frame of spirit, and is here enjoyned as a special mean for <hi>keeping the unity of the Spirit,</hi> even <hi>in the bond of peace.</hi>

                  <p>HE doth now inforce the former exhortation to unity and peace, first, from an argument taken from those many things, which are one and the same in the Church and all the true members thereof: and for this end, doth reckon forth seven unities, which may be looked upon as so many bonds and tyes of the essential unity, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the invisible Church; and as so many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments also, that therefore all, professing Christ, should not only labour to be one in all those, as they would evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence themselves to be sincere Believers and members of that blessed society; but also improve their unity in these, for keeping unity and peace in lesser differences.</p>
                  <p>There are three of these unities, which are so many bonds and arguments, in this verse. The first is, that the whole Church is but one body, to wit, the invisible Church of real Believers is one mystical body, knit by faith to Christ their head, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. and by the bond of love among themselves, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 35. And the visible Church is one politick body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. conjoyned with Christ their head, and among themselves by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal covenanting, <hi>(Psal.</hi> 50. 5.) and their serious professing of saving truths, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 12, 13, with 23. and this body is but <hi>one,</hi> the invisible Church without all doubt is so, and the Catholick visible Church, made up of all Christians and true Churches in the world, is also one, because they have the same King, Laws, Word, Sacraments of admission and nutrition, which they vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:44180:284" rendition="simple:additions"/>
subject themselves to, and receive, and have a grant of the same common priviledges from God in the Gospel; and therefore they are all one visible Church. 2. There is but <hi>one Spirit,</hi> to wit, the third Person in the blessed Trinity, who, residing in Christ, the head. <hi>(Isa.</hi> 61. 1.) and in all the members <hi>(Rom.</hi> 8. -9.) as the soul in the natural body, doth by His gifts and graces ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, move and govern the Church, the body presently spoken of. 3. As the Church is one in these two; so their <hi>hope,</hi> following upon effectuall calling, is also <hi>one.</hi> Where, by <hi>hope</hi> is not so much meaned the grace of hope, as the object of that grace or good things hoped for, as <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 5- especially heaven and glory, the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. which they get not in hand, but only do possesse it in hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 24, 25. And this <hi>hope</hi> is said to be <hi>one,</hi> to wit, for kind and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, though there will be different degrees in glory, <hi>Dan. 12. 2, 3. Doct.</hi> 1. That the whole Church, and all the members thereof, are but one body, is a strong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inforcing the duty of keeping peace and unity; it being no lesse absurd and prodigious for Christians to bite and devour one another, than if the members of one and the self-same natural body, should rise up against, tear and destroy one another: for, he inforceth the study of unity from this, <hi>That there is one body.</hi> 2. That any be a member of this one body, it is necessary he have the Spirit of God residing in him, whereby he may be quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and acted, either by the saving operations of that one Spirit; otherwise he cannot be a member of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9, 10. Or, by His common gifts and operations; otherwise a man, come to age and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, cannot be a member, no not of the visible body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That the whole Church, and all the members thereof, are animated and acted by one and the self-same Spirit of God, is a strong motive to incite to the study of peace and unity, seing divid lusts and practices are among


<pb n="234" facs="tcp:44180:285"/>
those sins which grieve the Spirit. See ver. 30. 31. and that the difference of gifts and graces, wrought in us by that one Spirit, are given of purpose to make each mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber either usefull to another by that wherein it excelleth, or indigent of the help of others in that wherein it cometh short, and so to have the same care one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. from vers. 14. to the end: for, he pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth unity from this, that there <hi>is one Spirit.</hi> 4. As an external call by the ministery of the Word, and professed obedience thereto, is sufficient to make a man a member of the visible body, and to partake of the common ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit; So that any be of this mysticall invisible body, and quickened and acted by the saving operations of this one Spirit, it is necessary they be effectually called, and actually translated out of their natural state to the state of grace: for, he maketh their being of this one body, and having this one Spirit, to be necessarily joyned with their calling, to wit, their being of the visible body, and having the common operations of the Spirit with the external calling, and their being of the invisible body, and having the saving operations of the Spirit, with the inward and effectuall calling; <hi>Even as ye are called.</hi> 5. Though effectual calling be a work of Gods Spirit, there being none who comes to Christ except the Father draw him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44. yet none is compleatly called, untill he yeeld obedience to Gods call, and being wrought upon by God, doth actually work and concur with God for that end: for, what he called (chap. 1. ver. 18.) <hi>Gods calling,</hi> is here expressed to be their calling, because then only are we called when we obey the call of God; <hi>In one hope of your calling,</hi> saith he. 6. As those, who are yet in nature, not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, are in a hopelesse state, having no right to heaven and happinesse, and consequently no ground to hope for it, how big soever they be otherwayes in their vain and groundlesse hopes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19, 20. So, effectual calling, doth open to the person'called a large door of well-grounded hope, that whatever be his misery here,


<pb n="235" facs="tcp:44180:285"/>
yet he shall be perfectly blessed in the full enjoying of God for evermore hereafter: for, the called man only hath right to those rich promises, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4. and God, by calling him, doth engage Himself to perform all that is promised to the called man, according to his hope, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 23. with 24. for, therefore are those glorious things hoped-for called <hi>the hope of our calling.</hi> 7. The consideration of this, that called Saints are all of them aiming at one and the self-same prize of their high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and shall live together in glory, should be a strong argument to make them live in peace and concord, while they are here. Their joynt aiming at one mark should make them of one mind and heart, especially seing there is that in glory which will suffice all; and their seeking of one thing needeth be no occasion of strife and emulation, but rather of unity in heart, mind and affection; for, why should they strive together, who not only are brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 8. but also are heirs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the grace of life, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.—7. yea, heirs with Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. and shall one day reign together in glory? for, he presseth their keeping unity from this, that they were effectually called, and heaven and glory hoped-for would suffice all, and be enjoyed by all; <hi>Even as ye are called in one hope of your calling.</hi>

Secondly, there is but <hi>one faith,</hi> where, by <hi>faith</hi> may be meaned the grace of faith, for that is also one, in respect of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor God, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. of the object, which it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth, the whole Word of God, <hi>(Act.</hi> 24. 14.) and especially Christ, and the promises, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 9: Yet, by <hi>faith</hi> is mainly here meaned the Doctrine of faith, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned by God to be believed, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 23. and this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is but <hi>one,</hi> because, though in the severall ages of the Church it was proponed diverse wayes, and with considerable variation in some weighty circumstances, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 14, 15. yet in substance it hath been, is, and ever shall be the same, <hi>Act. 15. 11.

of the persons administrating, or receiving this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but of its nature and substance, as having the same author, Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. the same outward element for kind, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 36. the same way of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration enjoyned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. the same ends and uses towards those who are baptized, <hi>Rom. 6. 3. 4.

All these, who are of this one body, animated and acted by this one Spirit, and have well-grounded hope of glory, they must, and do subject themselves to Christ, as Lord, in so far as they are ruled by His Laws, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 6. and patiently submit to His corrections and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6, 7. for, He maketh their being of <hi>one body, having one spirit</hi> and <hi>one hope,</hi> and their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to this <hi>one Lord,</hi> of equal extent; <hi>one Lord,</hi> saith he. 2. The consideration of this, that the whole Church, and all the Members thereof, are subject to the dominion of one Lord and Master, Christ Jesus, is a strong argument for inforcing this duty of keeping uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and peace among themselves; this being a duty, which not only he did presse most vehemently upon His followers, when He was about to leave the world, and depart from them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 34, 35. but also did most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly intreat the Father for, even that they might be all made one in Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21, 22. Besides, what a shame is it for the Servants of one Master to fall at odds among themselves, and thereby neglect their Masters work committed to them? for, he presseth the study of unity from this, that there is <hi>one Lord.</hi> 3. The Law, by which the Lord Christ will have His subjects ruled and governed, is not searched out, and known by sense or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reason, but, being revealed in the Word, it is laid hold upon by faith, and credit given to it, because of His authority who hath revealed it: for, so much may be gathered from his making mention of <hi>faith,</hi> or the Doctrine of faith, immediately after he had spoken of the Lord Christ; <hi>one Lord, one faith,</hi> saith he. 4. The consideration of this, that the whole Church, and all the true and lively Members thereof, do professe one and


<pb n="238" facs="tcp:44180:287"/>
the same fundamentall Truths revealed in Scripture, as the only object of saving faith, and way to salvation, ought to be a strong motive for keeping concord and unity in all other things, which otherwise might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion dissention and strife. This agreement in the main, in the journeys end, and the necessary way, which lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to it, should make them ashamed to fall at odds and strife about other things of lesse importance and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for, he presseth unity from this, that there is <hi>one faith.</hi> 5. The wise Lord hath judged it fitting to add the Sacraments, as seals unto the Doctrine of faith and salvation, contained in Scripture; that hereby we may be the more enabled to take up and understand that Doctrine, and be the more affected with it, as having the purpose of it, not only exhibited and represented to our ear in the Word, but to our eye also in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that we may be the more confirmed in the truth of that Doctrine, as having not only His word and writ for it, but also His seal and pledge: for, after mention made of the Doctrine of faith, he presently addeth there is <hi>one Baptism.</hi> 6. The Lord hath added Sacraments to the doctrine of faith, not only for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons mentioned, but also for engaging the party receiver unto such duties as the Doctrine of faith doth presse upon him; a Sacrament being as a military oath, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we bind our selves to fight under the Lords banner, and in all things to be for Him: for, he doth presse them to duty, even to keep unity, from this, that they were partakers of this <hi>one Baptism.</hi> 7. The consideration of this, that the Church and all the Members thereof are dedicate to God, in one and the same Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, unto the receiving whereof, all do accord, is a strong motive to make them keep peace and unity in other things, seing this onenesse in Baptism doth imply our communion in all other things, which are signified and sealed unto us by that Sacrament, which are all those things wherein our salvation is most nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and that by Baptism we are solemnly engaged


<pb n="239" facs="tcp:44180:287"/>
to go about our Master's work, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. and so to eschew all renting, and falling out among our selves, by which His work is much retarded: for, he maketh this another argument to enforce unity, that they did all partake of <hi>one Baptism.</hi> Only know, that though we are not to re-baptize those who are baptized by schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall and hereticall Churches, even though they err in some fundamentall truths, so long as the substantiall parts of Baptism are preserved, though mixed with much of their own superstitious trash, and therefore in some respect we may be said to have one common Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism with them; yet, it doth not follow hence, that we are tied to keep unity with them simply and in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects. We are only hereby tied to seek union with them, not by joyning in their schism, or damnable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies, but by labouring to reclaim them from those: and if they be one in all the other essentiall ties and bonds of union here mentioned, as of having one Lord, one faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this onenesse of Baptism doth engage to be willing, and endeavour, for our part, to keep the bond of peace with them in other things: for, those seven unities, or bonds, and arguments, are not to be taken separately, but joyntly, as to the pressing of unity: yea, and though they be not one in all the rest, yet it engageth us to own them in those things wherein they are right and owned by God, providing always we touch no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. In these respects, and with those limitations we deny not but unity should be keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with hereticall Churches, even the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her self.</p>

to wit, all Believers have one common God and Father; for, though God, as Creator, is the God and Father of all the creatures, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 28, 29. yet, seing the Apostle is speaking of the union of the Church, and of all the members thereof, for urging whereof, this consideration of <hi>one God and Father of all,</hi> is used as an argument: therefore it seemeth He is called God and Father with respect to those, and chiefly to real Believers in the Church, to whom He is God and Father in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar way. He is their <hi>God,</hi> by entering a gracious Covenant with them, whereof this is one article, that He shall be their God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. that is, all in Him shall be forthcoming for their good: He is their Father also, by receiving them into the number, and by giving them a right unto all the priviledges, of the sons of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12.

Yet, seing the Son and holy Ghost, are spoken of before, ver. 4, 5. the first Person is mainly to be understood here, who is called <hi>one God,</hi> not secluding the Son and holy Ghost, who are one and the same God in essence with the Father, but in opposition to idols, who are no gods, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
                  <p>This argument or bond of unity, is, next, enlarged in a description of this one God. 1. From His eminencie and dominion above all His creatures. 2.

you all,</hi> meaning the believing Ephesians and such as they were. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As our strongest union is to be one in God, and our greatest happinesse to have interest in this one God; So, by making use of Christ, as He is held forth in the Doctrine of faith, and sealed to us in the Sacrament, we may come up to plead interest in God: for, as he placeth this unity of having one God, in the last place, because it is most considerable; so he doth subjoyn it immediately to what he spake of <hi>one Lord, one faith, one baptism: There is one God and Father,</hi> saith he. 2. The unity of the God-head in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Persons, ought to be a strong motive to stir us up to unity among our selves; seing there is nothing, wherein we can resemble God more, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21, 22, 23. for, the Apostle inforceth the study of unity from this, that there is <hi>one God.</hi> 3. This motive for keeping unity, is so much the stronger, and more moving, when we consider, that this God hath graciously become the common Father of all Believers through Jesus Christ, whereby they are all the sons and daughters of one Father, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. and so a matter full of shame for them to strive and contend among themselves, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 8. for, he strengthneth this argument for unity from this, that this <hi>one God</hi> is the <hi>Father of all,</hi> to wit, of all Believers. 4. Whatever be the other differences among Believers, and their discouragements arising hence, as that some are strong, some are weak, some rich, some poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet this is a priviledge common to all, which may counterballance all their other inequality, even that they have all equal interest in one God, and that this one God is their common Father; and therefore will have a fatherly affection, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 7. 11.) pity, <hi>(Psal.</hi> 103. 13.) and care of all, <hi>Matth. 6. 25, &amp;c.</hi> for, saith he, <hi>there is one God, and Father of all.</hi> 5. It is the duty of Ministers, when they are pressing duty to God upon people, and of people, when they would charge sense of duty to God upon themselves, to set forth and be much taken up with Gods excellency and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;


<pb n="242" facs="tcp:44180:289"/>
this being a singular mean to engage the heart unto high esteem of Him, and from esteem to serve and honour Him, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. for, the Apostle, pressing upon these Ephesians the duty of unity, doth hold Him forth in His glory and greatnesse; <hi>Who is above all, and through all.</hi> 6. Gods soveraignity and greatnesse, doth not mar His low condiscendency to supply the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and necessities of His creatures: for, though he be <hi>above all</hi> in dignity; yet He is <hi>through all,</hi> upholding and over-ruling all by His powerfull providence. 7. Whatever God is by His common providence unto all His creatures, He is all that, and much more to His own called people and real Believers: for, He is <hi>through all</hi> by His common providence; but besides that, saith he, <hi>He is in you all,</hi> to wit, by the presence of His Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and speciall grace. 8. From all those seven unities joyntly considered, and the Apostles scope in all, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The essential unity of the Church, which cannot be broken, the Church remaining a true Church, and the many things, wherein there is of necessity an agreement that way, is a strong argument to enforce the study of unity and peace in other things of lesse concernment: for, the Apostle doth here presse unity, by reckoning se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unities, wherein they did agree, as if he had said what a shame is it for you, who are so many wayes <hi>one,</hi> to rent in pieces for those things, which comparatively are just nought? 2. So near and intimate is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of true Believers, so many strong and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluble are these spirituall bonds, by which they are knit together among themselves, that, if they were duely pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the hearts of those who fear the Lord, could not choose but be mutually inlarged, and their affections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed one to another, as to their dearest friends: yea, the most strict of civil, carnall and naturall bonds, should not bind so firmly as those, <hi>Matth. 12. 48, &amp;c.</hi> for <hi>they are one body, one spirit,</hi> have <hi>one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism</hi> and <hi>one God.</hi> And what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction or union can be so firm, as what is grounded upon all those?</p>

                  <p>HItherto the Apostle hath inforced the study of unity, by an argument taken from those things that are one and the same in the Church and all the true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof. Now, followeth the second argument from those things which are not one in all, but diverse al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in every one, to wit, the diversity of gifts and graces bestowed by God upon the severall members of the Church: which diversity also he sheweth doth tend to union, because, first, all those several gifts and their diverse measures, do come from one and the same author, to ver. 12. Secondly, they are all given for promoting one and the same end, to ver. 17. And, 1. in this verse by way of correction, and pre-occupation of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, he holdeth forth Christ, as the author of all those gifts and different measures, to this purpose, that notwithstanding of what he said of those many things, wherein they were one; yet there were other things, wherein they did differ, which neverthelesse were so far from dissolving in reason the bond of union, that upon the contrary they did contribute much for keeping of it firme; in so far as, though every true member of the Church had his own peculiar grace, and in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, either as to the substance, or measure of the grace, differing from the grace of others; yet all those diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent graces of the several members, are bestowed by one and the same Christ, and received in the measure and degree which seemeth good unto Christ the giver to prescribe and measure out unto every one: where by <hi>grace,</hi> is not meaned Gods favour, or grace freely bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as in other places, (See upon <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8-.) but the fruits flowing from this grace, to wit, grace freely given, as appeareth from the instance given (ver. 11.) of this grace in the ministeriall gifts and offices: Which graces are of two sorts, First, saving, which are only in the


<pb n="244" facs="tcp:44180:290"/>
regenerate, called <hi>grace,</hi> because they flow from, and are evidences of Gods grace and favour, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 19. Secondly, common gifts, called <hi>grace, Eph.</hi> 3. 8. because they are freely given, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. The latter whereof is here chiefly meaned, as appeareth also from the instance given, ver. 11. because it is only in those common gifts and graces, wherein real Believers do differ, as to the substance of them, some being given to one, and some to another, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. whereas all have one and the same saving graces, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. although they differ also in the measure and degree received of those, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 13. In which respect, even saving graces may be also here meaned. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though the Lord is not pleased to bestow upon all the Members of the Church an equal measure of gifts and graces; yet He giveth to every one some gift and in some measure, and those either the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts of His Spirit, as to all the Members of the Church visible come to age, and the right use of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reason, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. Or, saving grace also, as to all the truely regenerate, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4. for, he saith, <hi>unto every one of us is grace given.</hi> 2. The Lord is pleased to dispense His graces and gifts to every one, not in the same, but in a different measure, so that though the same saving grace for substance be given to all the truely rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate: yet, it is not given to all in the same measure, nor yet to any in any measure, who are visible Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors only: and though all have some common gifts, whereby in some measure they may be made profitable in their station to the body, yet none hath all gifts, nor all the same offices, wherein they may exercise their gifts, ver. 11. nor yet do all receive the same measure of those common gifts: for, so much is implyed, while he saith, <hi>Grace is given according to a measure.</hi> 3. The greatest degree of gifts and graces, which God bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon any, is far below that fulnesse of grace which is in Christ: He giveth unto none so much, but there is alwayes somewhat wanting, and they who have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most, are capable of receiving more: for, their


<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44180:290"/>
receiving grace according to a measure, implyeth their receipts are capable of increase, and a difference, as to this, between their receipts and Christs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. -34. <hi>To every one is given grace according to that measure.</hi> 4. The want of some excellent gifts bestowed upon others, or of that excellent measure of saving graces, which others have, doth not argue a man unregenerate, or wholly destitute of saving grace: for, the Apostle sheweth that even those who had one hope, Lord, Faith, God and Father, and consequently had saving grace, ver. 4, 5, 6. were not all gifted with one and the same, but with a diverse measure of gifts and graces, while he saith, <hi>But to every one of us is grace given according to the measure.</hi> 5. Diversity of gifts in the Church, and diverse mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of saving grace, are an ordinary occasion of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and strife; in so far, as these dividing lusts of pride, contempt, envy, discouragement, are apt to take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to stir and vent themselves from those different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures: for, the Apostle his entering upon this argument for union from the diversity of gifts by the adversitive particle <hi>But,</hi> doth imply that they were prone to take occasion to rent upon that diversity, and therefore he doth joyntly preoccupy an objection against union, and bring an argument for it; <hi>But unto every one of us is grace given.</hi> 6. Whatever be mens pronenesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to rent and divide because of different receipts and measures; yet that same diversity, if well consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, would be found to be one of the strongest ties and bonds of union; in so far as hereby none, no, not the most eminently gifted, can say he hath no need of others, but every one are made mutually indigent of one anothers help, and even the meanest in some measure fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished to be helpfull unto others: (See <hi>Paul</hi> proving this excellently from the similitude of the different mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the natural body, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 14, &amp;c.)</hi> for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle's scope in this and the following verses, is to enforce unity from the diversity of gifts and graces amongst the Members of the Church; <hi>But unto every one of us is


<pb n="246" facs="tcp:44180:291"/>
grace given.</hi> 7. This doth also inforce the study of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from this ground of diversity of gifts, if we consider, that all we have of that kind, is freely given, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not to be puft up with it, nor to abuse it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the mind of the giver; and that both our gifts and measures, however diverse, do yet come from one rise, fountain and author, and therefore we ought to be one in making use of them; and that this one author is the Lord Christ, God Man; Mediator, in whose hands are all things given of the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 27. that He may dispense to whom, and in what measure He pleaseth, and therefore we are not only not to quarrel for our own measure, it being His allowance, who doth all things well and wisely, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 37. but also ought to imploy our gifts and severall measures for the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not the renting of His body, which is the Church: for, the Apostle inforceth unity from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of gifts upon those considerations, that they were given by one and the same Christ; <hi>But to every one is grace given, according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, secondly, in this first branch of the second generall argument for union, from the diversity of gifts, doth confirm, from <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 18. what he presently said, that Christ is the author and bestower of all graces and gifts with their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent measures. In which place of the Psalm, <hi>David</hi> doth look through the ark, a type and shadow, to Christ the substance, and in a prophetical way, speaking of things to come as already past, to point-out the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of their performance, he doth foretell that Christ should, in a triumphant manner, <hi>ascend up on high,</hi> or unto the heighest heavens (See ver. 10.) and that at, and by vertue of His ascension, He should, first, <hi>lead cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity captive,</hi> that is, as he had upon the crosse foiled


<pb n="247" facs="tcp:44180:291"/>
His many enemies, and begun to triumph over them, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. So in His ascension He should continue the triumph, evidently declaring, that He had given a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall rout to all the spiritual enemies of His Church and Kingdom. The expression used to set forth this purpose, hath in it an allusion to conquerors, who, in their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing solemnities, used to drive their captive enemies before their own triumphant chariots. See this expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion used in the same sense, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5. 12. And, secondly, following the same allusion to triumphing conquerors, who used to divide and scatter the spoil, and other mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent gifts among the applauding Citizens and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, he sheweth that Christ should at, and by vertue of His ascension, pour-forth and distribute a large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of gifts and graces upon His Church and severall members thereof: which prophesie, the Apostle, citing the place with some variation of the words, but keeping close to the sense and purpose, doth shew, was now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by Christ; and consequently, that Christ is the bestower of all graces and gifts with their different measures, as was affirmed, ver. 7. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Ministers ought to hold forth nothing for truth, or presse nothing as duty upon the Lords people but what they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and prove to be such from the authority of God speaking in Scripture: yea, and it is their duty some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to bring forward their proof, by making expresse mention of it: for, thus doth <hi>Paul</hi> confirm what he spake, ver. 7. by a testimony cited from the Psalms; <hi>Wherefore he saith,</hi> that is, <hi>David,</hi> or the Spirit of God, speaking by <hi>David, saith.</hi> 2. As there was much of Christ revealed in the Scriptures of the Old Testament, though but darkly, and under a vail of types and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial shadows; So He was revealed and spoken-of in those Scriptures as true God and Jehovah: for, that which is said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. was spoken of God, even Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, as appeareth from ver. 4. and all alongst, which <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth here was fulfilled in Christ; <hi>Wherefore be saith, he hath ascended, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Though the very


<pb n="248" facs="tcp:44180:292"/>
words and phrase of Scripture, are much to be thought of and closely adhered unto so far as is possible; lest by our unnecessary casting of Scripture-purpose in an affected strain of words unknown to Scripture, we lose at length the purpose with the words, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13. Yet, the sense and meaning of Scripture, is mainly to be sought-after and kept in remembrance, so that though we do not call to mind the very words of such a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only the sense, meaning and purpose of it, we may draw comfort, or information from it, or make use of it otherwayes: for, the Apostle here, as oft elsewhere, doth not so much adhere to the precise words, as to the sense of that Scripture which he cites, in so far as where in the Psalm it is said, <hi>Thou hast ascended, and received gifts for men,</hi> to wit, He received them to be given to men, it is here, <hi>When He ascended, and gave gifts unto men.</hi> 4. Our Lord Jesus Christ, having finished the work which was given Him to do on earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4. did locally ascend unto heaven, carrying His humane nature up thither, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 9. 10. that so He might be exalted in that glory, which He had before the world was, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 5. and take possession of heaven in our name, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 6. and there prepare a place for us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 2. for, saith he, <hi>When He ascended up on high.</hi> 5. As Christ did engage in a warfare on our behalf with many strong and potent enemies, to wit, the devil, the world, sin, death and hell; So He hath carried the day of all, and gained an absolute compleat victory over all, in so far, as, though the Godly must have a battel with these, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. yet Christ the Head of Believers, is now above the reach of hazard from enemies, and consequently Believers in their Head: yea, and they themselves are above all hazard also, in so far as all their enemies cannot mar their salvation, <hi>Rom. 8. 35, &amp;c.</hi> Sin and Satan doth not reign in them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12, 14. death hath lost its sting towards them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55. and become a passage unto life, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 23. for, by this <hi>captivity,</hi> which Christ led captive, is meaned not those


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:44180:292"/>
whom He delivered from captivity, but whom He fought against, brought in captivity, and triumphed over, even all His and our spiritual enemies; <hi>He led captivity</hi> (or, a multitude of captives) <hi>captive.</hi> 6. The constant opposition, which Satan raiseth against the Church and Kingdom of Christ, doth not so much flow from any principle of hope in him to prevail in that wofull work, as from his inveterate blinded malice against the salvation of sinners, so that he cannot but malign and oppose it, though he know he cannot mar it: for, at Christs ascension he could not but know, that by all his malicious cruel actings against Christ, he had effectuate nothing but his own eternal shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, seing that Christ did thereby openly declare <hi>He had led captivity captive.</hi> 7. As those, for whom Christ did purchase any good or advantage by His death, and did manifest His purchasing good for them by His as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension, were men, and not devils; So not only saving graces, which are given to the Elect only, but also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts, are a part of His purchase, which are given sometimes to reprobates for the good and edification of His Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22, 23. for, both these are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended here under <hi>gifts,</hi> which being purchased by His death, He did at His ascension in a larger measure than formerly <hi>give unto men,</hi> and to men indefinitly, even to rebels, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. -18.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle doth, thirdly, comment upon, and apply the cited testimony. And, first, he sheweth what Christs ascending unto heaven (to wit, by His own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, otherwise the Apostle's inference in this place should not hold) did presuppose, as necessarily foregoing, even His previous humiliation and abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all its steps, expressed by His <hi>descending to the lowerparts of the earth;</hi> where, the <hi>lower parts</hi> are to be


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:44180:293"/>
understood, by comparing not the parts of the earth among themselves, but earth with heaven, the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the lowest part of the world; and particularly, it pointeth either at His conception in the womb of the Virgin (See conception so expressed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 15.) or at His burial (expressed by a like phrase, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 40.) wherein the Apostle's scope is not only to prove, that the former testimony is pertinently cited, and applyed to Christ, but also to presse humility in order to unity and peace from Christs example, as <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. Now, Christ is said to have <hi>descended,</hi> not properly and locally, as man, (for, before His incarnation He was not man) but as God, and therefore not properly by changing place, but improperly, and with respect had to His state, by taking on the humane nature upon earth, under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities whereof He did for a time hide His divine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, so that very little of it did appear, and to some few only, <hi>Isa. 53. 12. Doct.</hi> 1. Sacred Scripture is a great depth, containing much more than what is obvious at the first view; and therefore we are to advert not only to that which is expresly said in Scripture, but what may be drawn from it by direct and just consequence: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth so look on this testimony of Christs as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension, as finding another great Truth concerning His previous humiliation lurking under it, and by just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence deducible from it, while he saith, <hi>Now that He ascended, what is it but that He first descended?</hi> 2. It is not enough for Ministers to cite Scriptures for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those Truths which they hold forth to the Lords People, except the Scriptures cited be pertinent, and the pertinency of them be also made clear and obvious: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having cited a Scripture to confirm somewhat which he said of Christ, doth prove the Scripture cited doth speak of Christ, because it implyeth previous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending and humiliation in the partie spoken of, which can agree to none other of the Persons of the blessed Trinity, but to Christ only; <hi>Now that He ascended, what is it but that He descended?</hi> 3. Such was the love of


<pb n="251" facs="tcp:44180:293"/>
Christ to lost sinners, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 13. and to the glory of His own and his Fathers mercy to be manifested in their salvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4. that He did willingly lay aside His glory, which He had with His Father before the world was, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 5. by assuming the nature of man to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and suffering therein the utmost of misery and grief which the malice of men and devils could inflict, and which seemed good unto the Father, in order to the satisfaction of provoked justice, to inflict, <hi>Heb:</hi> 10. 7. for, all this is implyed in His <hi>descending;</hi> and saith <hi>Paul, Now that He ascended, what is it but that He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended?</hi> 4. Then do we study and know Christs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation aright, when we do also seriously consider, and think upon His previous humiliation and abasement: for therein we may see, not only how low He stooped for our good, but also that He hath fully accomplished whatever He undertook, and is now absolved, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 4, 5. and that the Lords usuall way is with His own, as it was with Christ, to make their deep humiliation and lowlinesse of mind go before their highest exaltation and honour, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 33. for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth read previous humiliation in Christs exaltation, and thinks upon both joyntly; <hi>Now that He ascended, what is it, but that He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended?</hi> 5. Then do we think upon Christs humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and abasement aright, when we consider it in its greatest depth and lowest step unto which He demitted Himself, even to the lowest parts of the earth: for therein we may see the greatnesse of His love, the depth of our misery, and the full sufficiency of the price paid by Christ in the state of His humiliation, in order to our delivery; <hi>He also descended first into the lower parts of the earth:</hi> by which is not meaned the place of the damned, nor any place near to that, where the souls of the Patriarchs were before Christs death, as the Papists affirm; this being contrary to Scripture, affirming that Christs soul was after death to be in heaven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 43. and that the souls of the Patriarchs were there also, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 22, 23, 25, 26. but hereby, as I shew in the

                  <p>THe Apostle, in the explication and application of the cited testimony, doth, next, shew what it expresly holdeth forth, to wit, Christs ascension; and illustrates it from this, that the person who ascended, though now made man, was the same with him who descended to take on the nature of man. 2. That He ascended to the highest heavens, the seat of eternall glory, <hi>far above those</hi> visible <hi>heavens,</hi> not only in situation, but also in duration and glory, and are called the heaven of heavens, (1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. 27.) the third heavens, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. 4.) and sometime simply by the name of heavens, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21. And, thirdly, from the end of His ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even <hi>to fill all things,</hi> not all places, with His bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily presence, (for Him must the heavens contain, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 21.) but that He might fulfill all prophesies concerning Himself, and all those parts of His mediatory Office, which were yet to be performed in heaven: and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, that He might fill His Church, and all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, (which are His <hi>all,</hi> even His whole body, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 45.) with a large and plentifull measure of the gifts and graces of His spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 39. according as was foretold in the cited testimony. <hi>Doct</hi> 1. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of natures in Christ after His incarnation, doth not infer a distinction of persons in Him; He remaineth one person still: for, the Apostle speaketh of Him after incarnation, as of one; <hi>He that descended, is the same also that ascended.</hi> 2. Jesus Christ remaineth one and the same person after His assuming the humane nature unto Himself with that which He was before, so that neither is the person of God-man, Mediator, any third thing, made up, or compounded of both those natures, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the humane nature add any thing, before want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:44180:294" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to make up, perfect, or work any alteration in the personall substance of the Son of God: only the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Christ, being destitute of any personal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of its own, is, as it were, ingrafted in the second person of the God-head, the Son of God, and doth sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in Him: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that He who ascended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now God-man, is the same with Him who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended before His incarnation; <hi>He that descended, is the same also that ascended.</hi> 3. By vertue of this perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall union betwixt the divine and humane nature of Christ, there ariseth such a communion of the distinct properties of each nature, that those things, which are proper only to the one nature, are ascribed to the whole person: for, the same person is said here to descend and ascend, though He did <hi>descend,</hi> to wit, improperly, as God, not by change of place, but by assuming to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the humane nature, and did ascend properly by change of place, as he was man, and according to His humane nature; <hi>He that descended, is the same also that ascended.</hi> 4. Then do we profitably think on Christs exaltation, when we extend our selves unto the utmost to look upon the height of that honour and glory, unto which the humane nature, assumed by Christ, is now exalted; that so we may be the more taken up with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 6, &amp;c. and the more encouraged in hopes of through-bearing, as knowing that our head and neer kins-man is already possessed of glory, and resideth there, as our great and powerfull Atturney and Agent to minde our everlasting concernments, as His own, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. for, <hi>Paul</hi> holdeth forth His exaltation to be considered thus, when in stead of what was said in the Psalm. <hi>He ascended up on high,</hi> he saith here, <hi>He ascended up far above all heavens.</hi> 5. Though Christ did furnish His Church with a competent measure of gifts and graces, even before His ascension or incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 1. yet, it pleased the Lord to suspend the pouring forth of His Spirit in such a large and plentifull measure upon His Church both of Jews and Gentiles,


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:44180:295"/>
untill Christ, having overcome and spoiled principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and powers by His death, had risen again, ascended, and taken actuall possession of His Kingdom; that so the glorious state of His Church and subjects, as it now is under the Gospel, might not go before, but follow after the glory of their King and Head: for, saith he, <hi>He ascended, that He might fill all things.</hi> 6. The way of Christ with His own, especially with His Church in generall, is such, that what is sad and grievous in it, in one respect, is joyous and advantageous unto them in another; for, Christs removall of His bodily presence, was sad to His Disciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 6. and yet a forerunner of much good; <hi>He ascended, that He might fill all things.</hi> 7. So large, and inexhaustible is that fountain of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in Christ, our exalted Lord, that, though all His followers and subjects be but empty things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; yet, He can fill, not only one, but all, and all as well as one, yea and He doth really fill them, even here, to wit, with a fulnesse answerable to their present state of child-hood and imperfection, a fulnesse of grace in respect of parts, though not of degrees: for, this was the end of His ascension, <hi>that He might fill all things.</hi>

Neither doth he enumerate all those Office-bearers, which Christ hath appointed in His Church (See others besides, 1 <hi>Tim. 5. 17. Acts</hi> 6. 2, 3.) but only so many as are sufficient

to his present scope, even those who labour in the Word and Sacraments, whose various gifts are most conspicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the spirituall edification of the Church.

Joh.</hi> 20. 21. The reason whereof, is, because not only some were then added to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, as <hi>Act. 1. 26.

<pb n="256" facs="tcp:44180:296"/>
requireth; and the <hi>Teacher</hi> is he, who is gifted with the word of Knowledge, or ability to open up the mind of God in Scripture, establishing Truth, and confuting Error, without insisting much upon particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which office, because of the Churches poverty, is confined to the schools, and the ordinary exercise of it before the people left upon the Pastor. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the Father Son and holy Ghost are one and the same God; so they do all concur in one for bringing about the Churches good: and this in a speciall manner, by sending forth Ministers to feed the flock and furnishing them with competent gifts: for, what is here spoken of Christ, is some times ascribed to God the Father, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. and sometimes unto the holy Ghost, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 11. And he gave some Apostles, &amp;c.</hi> 2. It is the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of Christ the King and head of His Church, to appoint the severall sorts of offices, and Office-bearers in His Church: neither is it in the power of any whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, whether Kings or Churches, to add to, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish from any thing appointed by Him herein: for, it is the prerogative of Jesus Christ <hi>to have given some, Apostles; some, Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> 3. As Christ doth put none in office, but whom He furnisheth with gifts; so we are not to exercise our gifts in a disorderly way, but within the compasse of our stations, and in those offices unto which we are called by God: for, so much doth the Apostle teach, while, proving the variety of gifts, he giveth an instance in those diverse offices wherein those gifts are to be exercised, <hi>And he gave some, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; some, Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> 4. The gifts, which God bestoweth upon His publick Ministers for the work of the Ministery, are the prime and chief of all those gifts which the Lord Christ doth bestow upon His Church, and much to be preferred to the private gifts of others, in so far especially, as they are the ordinary mean ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God for working saving Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15. for therefore is it, that the Apostle not only here, but else where, <hi>(Rom. 12. 6. 1 Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:44180:296"/>
give an induction of those various gifts, bestowed by Christ upon His Church, doth begin with, and insist mainly on those gifts, which are given to His publick Ministers and preachers of the Word; <hi>He gave some, Apostles; some, Prophets.</hi> 5. A Ministery sent by Christ, and sufficiently furnished with ministeriall gifts for the conscientious discharge of that calling, is a singular gift of God unto a people, whereby Christ doth supply the want of His bodily presence among them, and bringeth about the edification of His Church, as effectually as if He Himself were present upon earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 12. for, when Christ ascended up far above all heavens, <hi>He gave,</hi> in a special gift to His Church, and as it were in supply of His absence, <hi>some, Apostles; some, Prophets.</hi> 6. The Lord Christ hath never appointed such an office-bearer in his house as the Pope, whom Papists call the visible head of the universal Church on earth, supplying the room and place of Christ now absent in heaven; nor yet of a Lord prelate, commonly called <hi>Bishop,</hi> who, according to the maintainers of that office, is one entrusted with the actual oversight of many Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of whole Provinces, with a degree of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity flowing from their office, over and above all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Jesus Christ within those bounds: for, if Christ had appointed those great Offices and office-bearers as necessary in His house, how should the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle have passed them over, not only in all other places, where he speaketh of this purpose, but also here, where he is reckoning forth those gifts and offices which Christ, ascending to heaven, hath appointed to supply in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner the want of His bodily presence upon earth? which without all doubt should be most supplied by those, if they were of His appointment: and therefore, though the office of ruling Elder and Deacon be not so necessary to be here mentioned; Yet, those great Offices, the mentioning whereof would have been so subservient to his purpose, could not be well omitted: Now, none of those are here; <hi>for he gave some, Apostles; some, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,


<pb n="258" facs="tcp:44180:297"/>
&amp;c.</hi> 7. The Lord Christ hath not intrusted all with a publick office in His house, but some only, to whom the rest ought to submit themselves, and obey in the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. Neither are all Office-bearers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted with one and the same office; and therefore not indued with the same measure of gifts and parts, so that we are not to measure all by some, rejecting others, who come not up in all things to those: for, <hi>He gave some, Apostles; some, Prophets; some, Evangelists, &amp;c. some</hi> only, and not all. 8. The Lord hath alwayes raised, and yet will raise up men in His Church according to what the exigence of the times requireth: and though we have not ground to look for men extraordinary, whether for gifts or office; Yet for men singularly assisted in their ordinary stations, when the important affairs of the Church do call for such: for, here, when there were extraordinary things to be done, the first foundations of the Christian Church to be laid, the Canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be compleated, the Jewish way of Religion, once established by God, to be put down, the Lord Christ sendeth forth extraordinary office-bearers, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily assisted: for, to bring all this about, <hi>He gave some, Apostles; some, Prophets; some, Evangelists.</hi> 9. So wise and mercifull is the Lord Christ, that He doth not overburthen His servants too much, but where their work goeth beyond their strength, He hath sufficiently provided how a part of their burden may be taken on by others: for, the work of laying the foundations of the Christian Church, being too heavie for the twelve Apostles, He did allow them co-workers and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helpers, even the Prophets and Evangelists; <hi>He gave some, Apostles; some, Prophets; some, Evangelists, &amp;c.</hi> 10. Whatever is done in the Church of Christ according to His order, though mediately by the hands of men, Christ will own it, as if it were done immediately by Himself: which holdeth especially in the Churches cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of fit men to the work of the Ministery, according to the order appointed by Christ: for, he maketh the


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:44180:297"/>
calling of ordinary Pastors and Teachers, though it be mediate only, and by men, to be from Christ, as well as the immediate extraordinary calling of the Apostles; <hi>He gave some, Apostles; some Pastors and Teachers.</hi> 11. As it is needfull that both the judgments of people be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and their affections wrought upon, and as God hath furnished His servants with answerable gifts for effectuating both; so we are not to despise either of those sorts of gifts, neither the sound, plain, able, teaching gift, though it be not so operative or taking upon the affections; nor yet the pithy, moving, pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gift that worketh upon the affections, though it be not accompanied with profound knowledge and great learning in those who have it: for, the Lord dispenseth both those gifts, and oftimes not to the same person; <hi>He gave Pastors and Teachers.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, having thus far enlarged himself upon the first branch of that general argument for union, taken from the diversity of gifts in the Church, to wit, because they all came from one and the same author, he doth now fall upon its second branch, inforcing unity notwithstanding the diversity of gifts and offices, because they are all given for promoting one and the same end: which end, is, first, propounded in this verse in three different expressions, all tending much to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, but with some difference in regard of three sorts of persons, to whom the ministerial function hath reference. First, in regard of the <hi>Saints,</hi> or people, the end of the Ministery is to <hi>perfect</hi> them, that is, to bring them out of that disorderly, disjoynted and confused frame, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture and condition wherein they are, and to fix them in a well-ordered, compact spiritual frame and state, which is attained when they are joyned to Christ by faith, and one to another by love: for, the word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:44180:298"/>
to prepare, fit and dispose things in an orderly frame, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. -22. and especially such things as were before rent asunder, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 19. or out of their own due place and order, as disjoynted members, with allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to which, the word is used, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. Secondly, in regard of themselves who are in office and accordingly gifted: the end of their gifts and office, is, that they may labour diligently in all the duties of their calling, which is only a subordinate end, and relative to the other two as a mean. Thirdly, in regard of Christ, it is that all Believers, being so perfected and joyned together, as stones of a building, by the work of the Ministery, may become His mysticall body, to whom He will perform all the duties of an head. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall offices and various gifts are all given for promoting one and the same end, and for promoting those ends in particular, which are expressed in the Text, is a strong argument to keep off emulations and rents, because of those, and to endeavour after unity and peace; seing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision and strife do marre the spirituall orderly frame of the Church, divert from the main work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, and obstruct the edification of the body of Christ, and so do crosse those main ends in all respects, for which all gifts and offices are given: for, the Apostle inforceth unity from the diversity of gifts and offices, upon this consideration, that all are given for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of those ends, even <hi>for perfecting the Saints for the work of the Ministery, &amp;c.</hi> 2. That publick gifts and gifted Ministers are sent to, or continued in any place by God, is for the sake of the Elect there, and to bring about their salvation: so that though the Word be preached and Ordinances dispensed, even to reprobates to make them the more inexcusable, and because they are joyned in one civill society and externall Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowship with the Elect; yet if God had none of His own to be wrought upon by the Ministery in a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, Place, or Nation, it is more than probable He should not send His Ordinances there at all: for, all the


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:44180:298"/>
ends of Christs sending a Ministery, do relate chiefly to the Elect, even <hi>for perfecting the Saints, for edifying the body of Christ.</hi> 3. Whatever outward, civill order may be among a people destitute of the Gospel; yet as to their spirituall concernments, they are wholly out of frame, rent and torn, even a disorderly confused masse and heap, as being at enmity with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. and destitute of all sound, solide and spirituall unity among themselves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15. for, seing the end of the Ministery is to <hi>perfect the Saints,</hi> that is, to bring them to an orderly spirituall frame, it is supposed, that before a Ministery be sent unto them they are not perfect, but wholly out of frame. 4. Even the Elect already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, are sometimes out of frame, their spirituall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as it were, disjoynted and unable to move, or stir, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 10. and one of them rent asunder from another through prejudices, passion, love to self interest, and such like, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 39, for otherwise there should be but small need of a Ministery toward them, the great end whereof, is to place those things which are disorderly in a right frame, to joyn together things which are rent asunder, to recover strength and motion to these things which are rendered weak, by being out of their right place, as the word, rendered <hi>perfecting,</hi> doth signifie; for <hi>perfecting the Saints.</hi> 5. A publick Ministery and the exercise thereof, is the ordinary mean appointed by the Lord Christ for perfecting the Saints and edifying the body of Christ, whether by converting those of the Elect who are yet in their unregenerate state, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. Or, by confirming and establishing those who are already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 12. and making them to grow, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 28. or restoring them when they are overtaken in a fault, 1 <hi>Tim:</hi> 5. 20. and therefore it is a most necessary ordinance, without which those great ends in an ordinary way can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained: for, He maketh the ministeriall offices formerly mentioned, the means of <hi>perfecting the Saints, and of edifying the body of Christ.</hi> 6. The highest office that is enjoyed by any within the Church, is only a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery


<pb n="262" facs="tcp:44180:299"/>
and service, and not a lordly dominion over the flock of Christ: for, he calleth the forementioned offices, even the highest of them (the office of the Apostles it self not being excepted) a Ministery, or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; <hi>for the work of the Ministery.</hi> 7. Ministers are not called to idlnesse, or to live like lazie drones wasting the Churches revenue, without executing the office for which it is given. They are called to work and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their talents and gifts in that laborious work of perfecting the Saints and edifying the body of Christ: for, this he maketh the end of those gifts and offices in regard of those to whom they are given, even the <hi>work of the Ministery.</hi> 8. The gaining of souls to God, and carrying on the work of grace in those who are gained to some perfection, doth meet with so much opposition, what from within, and what from without, what from men, what from devils, and what from a mans own heart, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. -4, 5. that the ministeriall office which is imployed for bringing those about, is no easie task: It is a work, and such, as, though it be a worthy work, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. yet, it is a weighty and laborious work: a work that will take up the whole man, and being rightly minded, will give the painfull and consciencious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster little time for any other work, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15. for, he casteth this second end, relating to the Ministers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in the middle betwixt the other two; because it relateth to them, as a mean to the end; and to shew, it is not naked gifts, or the credit of the office which will bring about those ends, but the painfull exercise and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of them; <hi>for the work of the Ministery.</hi> 9. The work of the Ministery, if rightly gone about, is an uniting work of the Church of Christ: Its great end, and to which all its other ends are subordinate, being to unite souls, as so many stones in a building, or as so many members in the body, first, to Christ the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this building, and head of this body, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up to believe in Him; and next, one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by bringing them up to mutuall love, and all the


<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44180:299"/>
duties thereof, and especially to mutuall for bearance, and the study of unity and peace: for, he maketh this the great and last end of <hi>the work of the Ministery,</hi> even, <hi>the edifying of the body of Christ,</hi> that is, the Church: (See wherefore it is so called, chap. 1. 23.) The word <hi>edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> is borrowed from masons, whose great work is, having prepared the stones apart, to joyn them most firmly, both to the foundation and among themselves.</p>

                  <p>IN the next place, he doth severall wayes illustrate and explain what he presently spake of that great end in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be brought about by the Ministery and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall gifts. And first, he illustrateth it in this verse, from the term of its duration, by shewing how long (not all those forementioned offices, ver. 11. but) that work of the Ministery in edifying the body of Christ, spoken of, ver. 12. shall continue and last; The term whereof, in a word, is the day of Judgement: And it is set forth by three expressions, the latter whereof, is a further explication of the former, and all of them do hold forth that high degree of perfection, which the Church shall not obtain before that day; And first, he sheweth that work is to continue untill all the Elect (some whereof are not yet born, much lesse called, and some of those who are called, do differ in many things among themselves) do <hi>come</hi> or meet (for so the word may read) in that compleat unity, not only of opinion, but also, and especially of heart and affection, to be manifested in that most perfect and blessed communion and fellowship, which the Saints shall enjoy, both with Christ, and amongst themselves in glory, called the <hi>unity of faith,</hi> as having its first rise from faith; however faith, as to the distance from Christ implied in it, shall then cease, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. which grace of faith


<pb n="264" facs="tcp:44180:300"/>
he describeth to be <hi>the knowledge of the Son of God;</hi> or, as the word signifieth, the <hi>acknowledgement of Him,</hi> which speaketh somewhat more than our simple knowing of Him, even a knowing Him as our own, and with a speciall application to our selves, and so as we give due honour, respect and reverence to Him: See upon chap. 1. ver. 17. doct. 10. Secondly, He sheweth what unity of faith he meaneth, even that which the Church and all her members shall attain to, being come to the state and degree of perfection in the life to come; which state is here called <hi>a perfect man,</hi> or a man come to full and perfect age; because that state shall be to the Church, and all her lively members, as their ripe and compleat age, in comparison of their infancy, childehood and growing age here in the world. Thirdly, he sheweth when the Church shall come to her ripe and manly age, to wit, when she attaineth that measure of perfection; (called her <hi>stature,</hi> with allusion to the ripe age of a man, when he is come to his full stature) That measure, I say, of perfection, which Christ shall fill them with in glory, or whereby Christ mysticall shall be fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, there being none of His Members then wanting, and all of them come to their perfect growth, or a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of perfection answering, though not in equality, yet in likenesse and conformity to that fulnesse of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which is in their head Christ, to whom all the members of this mystical body shall be in some measure conform in glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 49. This stature of the fulnesse of Christ may be taken any or all of those wayes, for they all agree in one and the same measure of perfection. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The edification of the body of Christ, is a work that shall be continually in motion, and on foot, untill all that are given to Christ of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no not one being wanting even all the Members of this mystical body, be effectually called and united with Christ the head, and among themselves, and every one of them attain to their full and perfect measure of spirituall growth, so, that Christ shall never want a Church of


<pb n="265" facs="tcp:44180:300"/>
Believers, while the world endureth: for, the tearm, to which that edifying work, mentioned, ver. 12. shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, is, <hi>untill we all come to the unity of the faith.</hi> 2. The Ministery of the Gospel is a standing ordinance untill Christs second coming; neither are there any other Church-offices to be given by Christ to the Church for edifying His body but those which are already given in the grant of the Gospel: and therefore those are to continue either more visibly or hidly in some one place or other, in despight of men and devils unto the end of the world, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. for, this work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery in edifying the body, spoken of, ver. 12. is to continue <hi>untill we all come to the unity of the faith.</hi> 3. There is none, no, not the most eminent Saints on earth, who are above the ordinance of the Ministrie, so as to stand in no need of it, or to be without reach of being bettered by it: even Ministers themselves must be wrought upon, and edified by this Ordinance, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they do not what they ought in saving both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16. for, even <hi>Paul</hi> reckoneth himself among those whom the Ministery was to have its due effects upon, while he saith, not <hi>ye all,</hi> but <hi>we all come to the unity of the faith.</hi> 4. As the Elect by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are far removed from God, from Christ, and one from another; So their great work, when once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, should be and in a great part will be, to tend and advance by degrees towards a compleat union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, and with one another in God, as the great scope they aim at, and the point or center, which they propose unto themselves to meet in: for, the former of those is supponed, and the latter expressed while he saith, <hi>till we all come,</hi> or <hi>meet in the unity, &amp;c,</hi> 5. This perfect union and communion of all Believers. with God, and with one another in God, is not attained at the first; yea, not in this life, nor before the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: untill then there will be alwayes some alienation and distance, not only from God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. but also among themselves, and that both in their judgements and


<pb n="266" facs="tcp:44180:301"/>
affections, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. for, he saith, <hi>till we come in the unity:</hi> which implieth, there will be some time before we come at it, even till the Church be a <hi>perfect man</hi> in glory. 6. Diversity of gifts bestowed upon Ministers, and the exercise of them in the work of the Ministery, is the ordinary mean, appointed of God for working up the body of Christ to this unity; and therefore ought not to be occasion unto the people of strife and emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, schism or faction, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 3. 4. much lesse should they be improven by Ministers for begettting, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining divisions or rents, either among themselves, or in the Church of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 15, 16. for, he sheweth the work of the Ministery, (ver. 12.) diversity of offices (ver. 11.) and diverse measures of gifts and graces, (ver. 7.) are all given to promot this unity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to raise division: <hi>Till we all meet in the unity.</hi> 7. The grace of faith, and the exercise thereof, is the way wherein the Saints do walk towards this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and perfect union; in so far, as faith uniteth us to Christ, and through Christ to God and one to another, chap. 2. 15. which union by faith, is a step towards, and endeth in, that perfect union and communion with God and all the Saints by sight, or sense, which shall be in glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 9. And therefore the exercise of faith, and closing with Christ, would mainly be pressed by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, and sought after by people, as they would attain to unity, entertain it being begun here, or meet in that perfect unity hereafter: for, therefore is it called <hi>the unity of faith,</hi> as having its rise from that grace; <hi>till we all come in the unity of the faith.</hi> 8. As faith in Christ cannot be without the knowledge of Christ, and such a knowledge, as is a reall acknowledging of Him, implying applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and high esteem of Him when he is known; So faith cannot find a sure foundation in Christ to rest on, while He be taken up, as God equal with the Father, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently endued with sufficient strength and worth for doing all those things, for which the Believer imployeth Him, for he describeth faith to be the <hi>knowledge,</hi> or, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement


<pb n="267" facs="tcp:44180:301"/>
of the Son of God.</hi> 9. The Church and body of Christ, in respect of particular Believers, the Members of that body, hath its divine different periods of age, as the infancy of the Church and particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, so called, because of their childish ignorance and infirmities: this age is spoken of, ver. 14. Next their youth and growing age, when they are making progresse in the way of grace towards perfection: this is mentioned, ver. 15. And, lastly, their perfect manly age, when grace is fully perfected in glory, spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in this verse. Only they have no declining, fading, or old age, but shall alwayes remain a perfect man unto all eternity, 1 <hi>Thess. 4. 17. Till we all come in the unity of the faith, unto a perfect man.</hi> See the exposition. 10. As Believers ought to aim at no lower degree of perfection than conformity with Christ, their glorious head; so they shall at last attain unto it: they shall be holy, harmlesse, undefiled, separate from sinners, as He, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 26. above the reach of all tentations, as He, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 30. their vile bodies made conform to His glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 21. and both soul and body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in that glorious state, unto all eternity, even as He, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 9. that so there may be a due proportion between the head and body of mysticall Christ: and when all Believers are from the fountain of fulnesse in Christ thus filled with a fulnesse of perfection, in some measure answerable unto that which is in Himself, then, and not till then, hath mysticall Christ attained His just stature, proportion and fulnesse: He doth in a manner reckon Himself imperfect, empty and incompleat, so long as one member of His mysticall body is wanting: for, <hi>Paul</hi> maketh the measure of the Churches perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or manly and full stature, to be the fulnesse of Christ, to wit, that perfection, which, flowing from Christs ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, shall compleat Christ mysticall, and be conform to that fulnesse of perfection which is in Christ: <hi>Unto the measure of the stature of the fulnesse of Christ.</hi>

                  <p>HE doth illustrate the forementioned end of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, next, by shewing one chief fruit of that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall edification, unto which the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery is subservient, even the removall of, and preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from, that which is contrary to it, and namely from errour and false Doctrines: the hazard whereof, together with the necessity of guarding against them, is set forth by three similitudes: the first two do expresse the temper of those who are surprized, or in danger to be surprized by errour. First, they are as <hi>little children,</hi> to wit, for ignorance of what is right, inconstancy in their choise, and simplicity, or easinesse to be deceived, and to credit all. Secondly, they are as ships destitute of skilfull masters, tossed and carried this way and that way with the tide and contrary winds among the waves and rocks, even so are they with the tide and winds of contrary and diverse Doctrines and opinions, sometimes fluctuating and uncertain what to choose, sometimes taken with one opinion, and presently changeing it with another. The third similitude expresseth the way how such are seduced unto errour, to wit, by the pernicious subtility of seducers, set forth, first, more obscurely, by a comparison taken from the fraud or sleight of gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who have devices, by cogging a die, to make it cast up any number they please; So do hereticks, by wresting Scriptures, force them to speak that seemingly which maketh for the defence of their errour, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. for, the word, rendered <hi>sleight of men,</hi> signifieth <hi>the crafty deceiving of men.</hi> Next, more plainly, while that sleight, or deceiving, is called <hi>cunning craftinesse,</hi> to wit, in hereticks and seducers: the word signifieth a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar dexterity to do mischief of any kind, acquired by


<pb n="269" facs="tcp:44180:302"/>
long use and great medling in all affairs. And lastly, he sheweth the end to which this cunning craftinesse doth tend, and that wherein it is exercised most, even in a subtile and compendious way of deceiving the simple and drawing them from truth to errour: for, the words do read in <hi>cunning craftinesse, tending to a compendious subtile art of deceiving,</hi> or, to deceive by a compendious art. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. One singular mean ordained by God for preserving us from the infection of dangerous errours and subtile seducers, is the work of the Ministery; and therefore the work of Ministers is not only to presse holinesse, and to reprove vice, but also to contend for the truth, stop the mouth of gainsayers, and guard the Lords people against infection from dangerous errours: and people ought to cleave unto their faithfull Ministers, as they would be preserved from being made a prey to seducing spirits: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth hold this forth as one fruit of the work of the Ministery, mentioned, ver. 12. even <hi>that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro with every wind of Doctrine.</hi> 2. Spirituall edification, and walking towards perfection in glory, doth call-for not only holinesse of life, but also orthodoxie in point of truth; heresie and errour being as great impediments in that spirituall building, and as palpable deviations from the way to heaven and glory, as profanity and vice, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2-1-. for, having spoken of that great end of the Ministery, the edification of the body of Christ, ver. 12. as the way to perfection in glory, ver. 13. he doth here speak of infection by errour and heresie, as impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of that edification, and therefore to be removed; <hi>That we henceforth be no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ore children tossed to and fro.</hi> 3. The most holy and able Ministers are not more ready to presse the sense of humane frailty, with the necessity of keeping a strict watch against it upon others, than they are to take with it, and to watch over it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: for, even <hi>Paul</hi> includeth himself, while he saith, <hi>that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro:</hi> which implyeth an acknowledgement, that, at least, he


<pb n="270" facs="tcp:44180:303"/>
was once such a childe, and that it was necessary for him, as well as others, to quit that childish temper. 4.

Pronenesse to error and easinesse to be carried away with every doctrine, which pretendeth to Truth, is a mark of one who is not grown in grace, and but a babe in Christ, if he be renewed at all: for, he calleth those <hi>children,</hi> who are <hi>tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine.</hi> 6. That errors and heresies are not lesse damnable and dangerous than other sins, appeareth from this, that the souls ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard from these is expressed by the hazard of masterlesse ships, tossed by contrary winds among rocks or beds of sand, while he saith, <hi>tossed to and fro with every wind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> 7. The spirit of error is alwayes turbulent, and when suffered to walk abroad, doth raise most strange commotions, both in the publick state of the Church, while hereby the lovers of Truth are called publickly to contend for it, <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 3. and in the hearts of private Christians, chiefly those who are weak and unsetled, and hereby made to fluctuate among the rocks of several opinions, and sometimes at last to split upon some one error or other, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 6. for, so much is implyed, while he compareth heretical doctrines to the boisterous winds which drive the ship of the Church <hi>to and fro with every wind of doctrine.</hi> 8.

As those whom Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan engageth to carry on a course of error and heresie


<pb n="271" facs="tcp:44180:303"/>
in a Church, are usually men of parts and gifts, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing far in abilities the generality of the Lords People, whom they intend to seduce, and as far as men of age and understanding go beyond simple children and babes; So these, whom Satan thus engageth, do usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove men void of conscience, and stand not much upon fraud or falshood, providing they may gain their point: for, the Apostle calleth them <hi>men</hi> in opposition to those whom formerly he called <hi>children,</hi> and sheweth them to be such men as did make use of sleight and cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging craftinesse, and a subtile compendious art of decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, for carrying on their point; <hi>by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</hi> 10. Though heretical spirits and seducers of others, are men void of conscience; Yet they make it their great work to hide their knavery, and to appear that which they are not, by their large pretences to conscience and piety, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 15. hereby to deceive the simple, and to carry on their wofull design the more securely under that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 18. for, he compareth them to cunning gamsters, who carry the matter so dexterously, that their fraud and knavery do not appear; <hi>by the sleight of men:</hi> He alludeth to subtile coggers of dice, as said is. 11. Hereticall spirits, and ringleaders of errour, are usually more than ordinarily assisted in their wofull work, and so as they fall upon dexterous means which they pursue uncessantly, and are attended with marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous successe oftentimes in so doing; the Lord permitting Satan so to act them, and to act by them for heightening the triall, and making a more speedy and through dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the unstability of peoples spirits by those means; for, the expressions here used, do imply their more than ordinary assistance in all those; <hi>by the sleight of men, their cunning craftinesse,</hi> or singular dexterity to do any mischief, and <hi>their lying in wait to deceive,</hi> or, their deceiving, by a compendious subtil art. 12. However subtil seducers make a fair shew of Reason, Scripture, Piety, and Humility for procuring credit to their errors,

That great measure of parts and gifts with which hereticall seducers are frequently indued, their unwearyed diligence in making use of these their deceits, falshood and sleights for gaining their purpose, and the more than ordinary successe which they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with in trying times, ought not to discourage the weakest of the Lords people, or make them dispair of standing out against their assaults, but rather incite them to watchfulnesse, to seek after knowledge, a spirit of discerning, solidity in judgement, and stability in truth; that so in the strength of the Lord they may resist their activity and wiles: for, the latter part of the verse hath an indirect argument in it for pressing the duty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the former, even that <hi>henceforth we be no more children, tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine,</hi> and that because they had to do with the <hi>sleight of men, the cunning craftinesse of those who lie in wait to deceive.</hi>

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:44180:304"/>
Christ, as they be in a manner transformed in Him, and become most perfectly one with Him, whom he calleth here, as often elsewhere, (See upon chap. 1. 22.) <hi>the head,</hi> to show a reason, why Believers should grow up in Him, and to through conformity with Him; even, that so the Members of this mystical body, may be in some measure proportionable to their head. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The ordinance of the Ministery, is appointed of God, not only to awake those who are yet in nature, and drive them to Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14. but also for the good of those who are already converted, even to make them grow up in grace untill they come to perfection; and therefore none, who live on earth, can justly account themselves to be above this Ordinance: for, the Apostle sheweth that also is one end of the work of the Ministery, that those who are already quickened by it, <hi>may grow up into him.</hi> 2. The work of edification intended to be brought about by the ordinance of the Ministery, is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained upon souls, though they be preserved free from Error, except they also know the Truth, adhere to it, and be growing up in grace, and in making conscience of all the duties of an holy life: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned one fruit of that spirituall edification, mentioned ver. 12. to be freedom from error and infection from false teachers, ver. 14. he here addeth another, that <hi>speaking,</hi> or <hi>cleaving to truth in love, we may grow up into him in all things.</hi> 3. Our making conscience to grow in grace, is a soveraign remedy against the hazard of being surprized with error, and tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine, in so far, as then we are so much bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied about our heart, that we have not leisure to be taken up with vain and giddy notions of an unsetled head: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having dehorted them from being as children tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrine, subjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as a preservative from that unsetled temper, <hi>but speaking the truth in love, we may grow up.</hi> 4. It is not sufficient for these who live under the drop of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, to attain to the being of grace, so as they can


<pb n="274" facs="tcp:44180:305"/>
prove by evident marks that they have grace; but they must also labour to grow in grace: for, hereby we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, and speak to the commendation of our Lords table, whereat we feed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 8. hereby we attain to the enjoyment of many rich priviledges, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we are deprived of, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 18. and hereby also we are more enabled to ride out against a storm in try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, as appeareth from the conhexion of these two verses, teaching, that babes in Christ and children are tossed to and fro with every wind, when grown and growing Christians will ride it out: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> teaching that the end of the Ministery is to make Believers grow, doth show they ought to grow, while he saith, <hi>But speaking the truth in love, we may grow.</hi> 5. As we do then sincerely adhere to the truth of heavenly Doctrine, when we make evident our so doing by walking in all the duties of love, both to God and our neighbour; (for faith worketh by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6.) So our love is then truely Christian, and not a fleshly lust, or morall vertue only, when it is grounded upon truth, and the result of our adhering to it by faith: for, therefore <hi>Paul</hi> conjoyneth these two, making the latter, as it were, the result of the former, while he saith, <hi>but speaking,</hi> or <hi>cleaving to the truth in love.</hi> 6. That Christians may grow in grace, it is most necessary they labour to have both their understanding enlightened with truth, and their heart and affections inflamed with love, without either of which, our growth is not Christian and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, but either superstitious and blind, even a growth in error, if the understanding be not enlightened; or, growth in pride, conceit, self-love and arrogance, if, the head only being filled with light, our affections be not inflamed with love to God and our neighbour: for, therefore he prescribeth, that <hi>by speaking the truth in love, we should grow up.</hi> 7. This Christian growth must not only be in one thing, but in all things; in so far, as grace must be growing, not only in all the parts of the soul, understanding, will and affections; but the whole


<pb n="275" facs="tcp:44180:305"/>
man also, and all the parts thereof must grow according to all the ordinary dimensions, or in all Christian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and duties, both of our generall and particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. even as it is in living bodies, who grow equally and proportionally in all their parts of length, breadth, height and depth; <hi>That we may grow up in all things,</hi> saith he. 8. Then do Christians grow as they ought, when they are in a perpetuall motion towards Christ, so as to be daily more and more like Him, incorporate in Him and one with Him; that full conformity with Christ, and that most perfect union and communion with Him, which shall be attained in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, being the mark and scope toward which they tend, and without attaining whereof they do not sit down sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, as if they had enough: for, saith he, <hi>we may grow up into Him.</hi> 9. Though there ought to be a spiritual emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation among Christians, so as to strive who may grow most and outstripe others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 12. Yet there should be no division, envious strife, or carnal emulation among them upon this account, so as to envie the progresse of others, or cast stumbling-blocks in their way to retard them, but an harmonious on-going and rejoycing in the progresse one of another; seing they are to grow, as the parts of one body under one head, Christ: for, so much doth <hi>Paul</hi> here teach, <hi>We may grow up into Him, which is the head, even Christ.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle doth illustrate the forementioned end of the Ministery, fourthly, and joyntly inforceth the study of love and unity, by shewing how all gifts and offices do tend to the edifying of the body, and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that growth, whereof he spake, ver. 15. while


<pb n="276" facs="tcp:44180:306"/>
he describeth Christ the Head, presently spoken of, from His influence upon, and relation to the Church, His bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; wherein he alludeth to a natural living body and the way how it, being orderly made up of its severall members, joyned together by nerves and sinews, doth receive life, motion, nourishment and growth from the head and heart, by the benefit of those bonds and liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby the particular members do not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive life and nourishment unto themselves, but do also convey them unto others, so that every member doth receive due encrease, and thereby the whole body doth come to maturity and growth. In allusion to which way of the naturall growth of the naturall body, he sheweth, first, that by vertue of spirituall influence drawn from Christ, who is as the head and heart of the mysticall body, the whole body, to wit, that which is militant on earth, or all sincere Believers, the true and lively members of this body, are <hi>joyned fitly,</hi> or orderly, every one in his own place and station, and also firmly or <hi>compactly</hi> with Christ, and among themselves. Secondly, that they are thus joyned, by the means of spirituall joynts and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>ews, whereby we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand every thing that joyneth Believers with Christ, and among themselves; and they are either joynts and bonds of inward union and communion, to wit, the Spirit, on Christs part, and faith and love on ours; or of externall union, to wit, the Word, Sacraments, and those functions and offices, which Christ hath appointed in His house: yea, and also all naturall and civil rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when they are sanctified; and they are all called <hi>joynts of subministration, or supply,</hi> (for the words read bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so than as they are rendered, <hi>by that which every joynt supplyeth)</hi> to shew, that those do serve, not only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn us with Christ, and among our selves, but also for channels and instruments of communication, by which, spiritual nourishment and matter of growth is conveyed both unto our selves and others. He sheweth, thirdly, that the whole members, and every one of them,


<pb n="277" facs="tcp:44180:306"/>
being thus conjoyned, do not only themselves, by vertue of that furniture and spirituall nourishment, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate from Christ, by the means of those joynts or bonds, make encrease and grow, but also make the whole body thus conjoyned to grow, and this <hi>according to the effectual working</hi> of the holy Ghost, whereby those joynts, or means of conveying spiritual nourishment are blessed and made effectuall to the effect mentioned: which effectuall working and blessing of encrease and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment following upon it, is not communicated unto the members or parts without measure, as it was to Christ the Head, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 34. or unto all alike, but <hi>in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of every part</hi> or member, that is, such a measure as Christ judgeth sufficient and most convenient to every member, according to the place and function which they hold in the body, and the use which he is to make of them for the good of the body. And, lastly, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the end of the growth, and encrease of the whole body in all its members, to be not so much the good and advantage of the particular members, as the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and edification of the body it self, and of the particular members only, in so far as their edification and growth is carried alongs in, and contributeth for the edification of the body; and that this floweth from the force and power of the grace of <hi>love</hi> in all the members, which doth not look to it self only, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. -5- but maketh every part contribute all what it is and can do for the benefit of others, and common good of the whole. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As Christ and Believers make up one mysticall body, whereof He is head, and they members; (See upon chap. 1. 22, 23.) So all things requisit unto Believers to make them a body, do flow from Christ: their union, order, bonds of union, spirituall nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and instruments of communication, whereby it is conveyed, their growth, and measure of their growth, and all is from Him, as the Apostle doth here fully teach: <hi>from whom the whole body, &amp;c.</hi> 2. As there is a most orderly and firm union of all the members of this


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:44180:307"/>
body with their head, and among themselves; so this union is necessary in order to their receiving spirituall nourishment and making encrease thereby, even as it is in the natural body, a member cut off, or separated from the rest, cannot be nourished: for, he saith, <hi>the whole body fitly joyned, and compacted, doth make encrease:</hi> The first word, <hi>fitly joyned,</hi> doth expresse the orderly frame and proportion of all the members in this union; The second, <hi>compacted,</hi> expresseth the firmnesse of this union. 3. As there are joynts and bonds both of the internall and externall union of this body, to wit, such as are held forth in the exposition, even the Spirit of God, with His speciall graces and common gifts; so that God doth make use of all those, both as bonds of union, and instruments of communication, whereby He conveyeth spirituall nourishment unto the respective members, is a strong argument to scare us from dividing, or renting upon these, or because of the diversity of those in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall members: for, he saith, <hi>the whole body is compacted by every joynt;</hi> and he calleth them <hi>joynts of supply,</hi> whereby furniture is conveyed: his general scope where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, is, to inforce the study of unity, notwithstanding of diversity of graces, gifts and offices, <hi>compacted by that which every joynt supplyeth,</hi> or, <hi>every joynt of supply.</hi> 4. There is no true member of this body either dead or idle, or living, and working only to it self; but what life or nourishment it hath received from the head, that it doth endeavour to communicate unto others: for, he saith, there is <hi>an effectuall working from the Lord in every member, according to which it maketh increase,</hi> not only of it self, but <hi>of the body.</hi> 5. As there is no member of this body, which receiveth the essentiall operation and gifts or graces of the holy Spirit without measure; and as all receive some measure, lesse or more: So it is the duty of all and every one to contribute for the good of others, and especially for the advantage of the whole body, not by extending themselves beyond their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but according to it; that being all which God


<pb n="279" facs="tcp:44180:307"/>
requireth: for, he saith, the <hi>whole body,</hi> or all the several members of the body, <hi>do make increase of the body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the effectuall working, in the measure of every part.</hi> 6. As it is not our improving of our measure of gifts and graces received, which, of it self, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the effectuall operation and blessing of Gods Spirit, will bring about the spirituall good and advantage, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our selves, or others; so we ought not on this pretence to ly-by doing nothing, but are to make use of our measure received, and depend upon the effectuall operation of Gods Spirit for a blessing to our so doing; for he saith, increase is made of the body according to both those, the Spirits effectuall operation, and the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of every part or member, according to its measure, even, <hi>according to the effectuall working, in the measure of every part.</hi> 7. As all the lively members of this body do make increase, and grow in gifts and graces; so that is only true growth, and a growth, whereof Christ the head is fountain and author, which addeth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the whole body, and bringeth advantage to the Church in common, but not that growth, which seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to bring some benefit to a few, with the disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the rest: for, <hi>the whole body,</hi> or every member of the body, <hi>maketh increase,</hi> not only of it self, but also <hi>of the body,</hi> saith he. 8. As there is no such degree of growth attained here, neither by the Church in generall, nor its lively members in particular, but there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees yet wanting of their full and just stature; So the measure of growth, and increase already received, should be improved by us for attaining a further degree of growth and advantage, not only to our selves, but also to others, chiefly to the edification of the whole body: for, he saith, <hi>every member maketh increase of the body, to the edifying of it self:</hi> so that the increase received, is to be improven for attaining more, even further edification. 9. The more a man do find himself inclined and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to improve in his station, and according to his measure, all his receipts, whether of saving graces, or


<pb n="280" facs="tcp:44180:308"/>
common gifts, to the spirituall advantage of others, and chiefly for the common good of the whole body, he may the more certainly conclude, that he hath the grace of sincere love and charity rooted in his heart, and is acted by it: for, he maketh <hi>love</hi> the impulsive cause, why the severall members do improve all their receipts for promoving the edification of the whole Church, while he saith, <hi>it maketh increase to the edifying of it self in love.</hi>

To live in a course of profanity, and to be a member of Christs mystical body, drawing life, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment and growth from Christ the head, are wholly inconsistent: if the one be, the other cannot be; seing profanity of life is not only directly opposit to that new life of grace, which all the members of that body do live, but also doth wholly obstruct the passages betwixt the head and the members, whereby spiritual influence for life and growth should be conveyed, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 6. for, the Apostle, from what he spake of influence for life and growth conveyed from Christ, the head, to all the members, doth infer here, that <hi>therefore,</hi> and as they would evidence themselves lively members of that body, so they would abandon profanity, while he saith, <hi>This I say therefore, that ye walk not as other Gentiles.</hi> 2. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters ought to be serious in pressing the duties of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication upon the Lords people, not only simply exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but sometimes most gravely obtesting them by that which is dearest to them: whereby the Lords people may know, that their obedience to what is pressed, is no trifling matter, but such, as their eternal welbeing is most highly concerned in: for, therefore doth <hi>Paul</hi> not only <hi>say</hi> and exhort them, but also <hi>testifie</hi> and obtest them <hi>in the Lord, that they walk not henceforth as other Gentiles.</hi> 3. Our long continuance in sin already, is so far from being an argument in reason to make us hold on in that course for the time coming, that, upon the contrary, this very same consideration should be a strong argument to shame us from it: for, so much is implyed in his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles:</hi> as if he had said, Ye have done so hithertils, therefore do no more so. See 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 3. Doct.</hi> 4. Our turning to God in earnest to expect life and salvation from Him through Jesus Christ, doth call for, and will be attended with, an other sort of conversation than what we formerly had before conversion, or that naturall men, dead in sins and trespasses, for the present have: for, <hi>Paul</hi> exhorteth these converted <hi>Ephesians</hi> not to walk as they themselves som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

Sense of mercy received from God, is a strong incitement unto dutie toward God: for, he doth not obscurely hint at Gods mercy in separating them from the common lot of other Gentiles, that so they may be the more incited to eschew what might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour Him; <hi>that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles.</hi> 6. The vilenesse of sin is such, that it cannot be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expressed, and so expressed as to make us abhor it, by doctrine or word-speaking: therefore it is sometimes profitable to take a look of it in its vilenesse, power and tyrannie, as it manifesteth it self in the lives of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed men, who are captive slaves unto it; providing we so look to it, as to make us abhor it, and carry at a greater distance from it: for, therefore doth <hi>Paul</hi> hold forth a map of that wickednesse, which he deborteth them from, in the example of those unconverted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that by seeing of it they might the more abhor it; <hi>That ye hence-forth walk not as other Gentiles walk.</hi> 7. The conversation of all men unrenewed, is vain and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, as spending their money for that which is not bread, and their labour for that which satisfieth not, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 2. for, he speaketh of all the unconverted Gentiles, <hi>that they walk in vanity.</hi> 8. Whatever vanity or wickednesse is in the outward conversation of a naturall man, it doth wholly flow from the vanity of the mind and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing within; and as the mind is, so will the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation be: and therefore even the mind it self, the chief seat of reason, is corrupted and vain, and so vain, that from thence doth flow corruption and vanity to the whole man: for, he ascribeth the vanity of their walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the vanity of their mind; <hi>As other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>NExt, that the Apostle may the more effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them from walking as these other Gentiles did, he doth more largely and distinctly set forth that vain and godlesse conversation of theirs, by shewing severall branches and degrees thereof, both inward in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and affections, and outward in their life and conversation: And, first, he sheweth, that <hi>their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> and knowing part, or that part of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men do reason, inferring one thing from another, (for so the word signifieth) was wholly blind and <hi>dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened,</hi> to wit, as to those things which relate to God and heaven, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. whatever was their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and quicknesse of judgement in other things, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 21, 22. yet, in those things they were altogether vain and <hi>wilde, Rom.</hi> 1. 21. And, secondly, that they were <hi>estranged</hi> from, and wholly destitute of, <hi>the life of God,</hi> or that spirituall life, begun in regeneration, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. and consisting in the saving knowledge of God, and the severall pieces of Gods image, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10. called the <hi>life of God,</hi> because not only God is the author of it, as He is of our naturall life; but also it floweth, both in its being and operation, from the gracious presence of God dwelling in us by His Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. And, thirdly, he sheweth that the cause of those former two, was their <hi>ignorance</hi> of God, and of those things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the worship of God and their own salvation, to wit, both simple ignorance, or want of the knowledge of those things; which ignorance is in all by nature, and ignorance affected and delighted in, whereby the things of God are judged foolishnesse, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. from which ignorance of theirs did flow a further degree of darknesse in the understanding, and of alienation from the life of God, than what was naturall unto them.


<pb n="284" facs="tcp:44180:310"/>
And, fourthly, that this their ignorance, with both the forementioned effects, did flow from <hi>their blindnesse,</hi> or rather, as the Originall doth read, <hi>hardnesse of heart,</hi> whereby their heart, or that part of the soul, which chooseth and refuseth good or evil, did obstinately and against all means used to the contrary, refuse the light of God, which was proffered unto them, and were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflexible to good, being obdured and hardened, not only naturally from their birth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 5. but also voluntarily by themselves, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 15. and judicially by God, <hi>Exod. 9. 12. Doct.</hi> 1. That the vileness of sin may be sufficiently seen, and so as we may abhor and detest it, it is not sufficient to take a general view of it, and in the bulk, except we also dive into the particular branches, pieces and degrees of it, and by ripping up the womb of that abominable monster, look upon the vile intrals of it, that so we may be made to detest and hate it with a perfect hatred: for, therefore <hi>Paul,</hi> being to deterre these Ephesians from walking as the Gentiles, doth not only give a brief sum of their wickednesse in the bulk, ver. 17. but also here, and ver. 19. doth more distinctly lay open the several branches and degrees of it; <hi>Having the understanding darkned, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Man considered in his natural state, is so vile and loathsom by reason of sin, that being rightly anatomized and deciphered, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be seen in him but what may make himself and others to abhor him; there being no part of him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in soul nor body, free from those wounds, bruises and putrifying sores which sin hath brought upon him, as appeareth by this discovery, which in these two verses the Spirit of God by <hi>Paul</hi> maketh of him: <hi>his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is darkned, his heart hardned, his conscience past feeling, &amp;c.</hi> for, he speaketh this of all the Gentiles, who were not yet converted, and consequently of all men in their unrenewed state: and though all such have not arrived at the utmost height of that wickednesse, which some of those expressions hold forth; yet that vain mind, spoken of, ver. 17, which is the root of all the rest, is


<pb n="285" facs="tcp:44180:310"/>
in every unrenewed man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. and every such man is posting towards all that wickednesse here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed: yea, and would arrive at the utmost height of all, if restraining grace did not hinder him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 6. and therefore in Gods sight he may be justly charged with all; <hi>having the understanding darkned, &amp;c.</hi> 3. As every man by nature is wholly unskilfull to discern the things of God, or to improve those lurking principles of the knowledge of a Godhead, and of right and wrong remaining after the fall <hi>(Rom.</hi> 1. 20.) by drawing so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid conclusions from them, for rules to direct him in the matter of worship, and walking in the way to salvation; So this unskilfulnesse and darknesse of his, doth daily increase, and the longer he liveth, and exerciseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in finding out what is right and acceptable to God in those things, by the direction and guidance of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural light only, he is the further from the mark: for, he speaketh of a further darkening of their understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than what was naturall to them, even that, which did flow from ignorance and hardnesse of heart, as is clear from the construction of the words; <hi>Having their understanding darkened—through the ignorance that is in them.</hi> 4. As all men did once in their common root and first father <hi>Adam</hi> partake of the life of God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in Gods image, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 29. and are now, by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, from their very conception and birth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12, 13, 14. So, the longer they live in their unrenewed state, they are the more estranged from it, while every sin they commit doth make them in a further degree uncapable of it: for, he speaketh of a further degree of alienation from the life of God, than what was naturall to them, even that which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward contracted by their ignorance and hardnesse of heart; <hi>Being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them.</hi> 5. Hardnesse of heart is a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full evil, and the root and fountain of severall other evils, in so far as when a man doth obstinatley refuse light, and walketh contrary to light, and so hardeneth


<pb n="286" facs="tcp:44180:311"/>
his heart to do mischief, he thereby provoketh the Lord to give him over to ignorance, and to lose the small measure of knowledge which he formerly had, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 28. And thus, hardnesse is the cause of ignorance, and being thus both hardned in heart, and blinded in mind, he is further removed and estranged from the life of God, which consisteth in the saving knowledge of God in Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. and his understanding and reason rendered more dark and unskilfull to find out what is truth or errour, right or wrong; the common principles which were left in him after the fall concerning those things, being now through a continued custome of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie in sin almost wholly obliterated and blotted out: for, if we look exactly to the construction of the words, we will find that the <hi>blindnesse</hi> or <hi>hardnesse of their hearts</hi> is mentioned as the cause of that <hi>ignorance which was in them,</hi> and both hardnesse and ignorance, as the cause of their <hi>alienation from the life of God,</hi> and <hi>the darkning of their understandings.</hi>

                  <p>HE doth here set forth some other, and those higher branches and degrees of their impiety, profanity and godlesse conversation, which did follow upon, and flow from the former. As, 1. They had lost all remorse of conscience, fear of Gods judgement, and so did sin without inward check or challenge. And, secondly, which followed upon the former, they gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the full consent of their will and benfall of their affections to think upon, and delight in the fulfilling of their lascivious, perulant and filthy lusts. And, thirdly, which was the result of all the rest, they acted all sort of uncleannesse with a sort of greedinesse, and, as it were, striving who should do most mischief for a prize and reward. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though originall sin hath seazed upon the whole soul, understanding, will


<pb n="287" facs="tcp:44180:311"/>
and affections; yet the Lord hath keeped so much of the knowledge of Himself, and of right and wrong in the understanding of naturall men, as they may know in many things, when they sin and do evil; and so much of conscience, as to accuse or excuse according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the fact, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. whereupon followeth either grief, or joy in their affections, for, while he saith, they were <hi>past all feeling,</hi> and lost all remorse, he implieth they once had it, before they came to that height. 2. Wicked men may arrive to such an height of sin, as to have no sense of sin, no greif, nor check, nor challenge from conscience for it: for, this is to <hi>passe feeling,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth of those Gentiles; <hi>who having past feeling.</hi> 3. As one degree of sin maketh way for another; so in particular, hardnesse of heart, and obstinacie in sin, do eat out the edge of conscience, making it wholly sens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and stupid, so that it giveth neither check nor chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge for sin: for, upon their hardnesse of heart did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that which is here affirmed; <hi>Who being past feeling.</hi> 4. A watching conscience, doing its duty, is the strongest restraint from sin: and where that is not, all other restraints will serve for little purpose: for, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>having past feeling,</hi> he saith, <hi>they gave themselves over to lasciviousnesse.</hi> 5. When men do give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves without check and restraint to think upon their sin with delight, they cannot choose but fall out in the outward act of that sin, though it were never so grosse: for, upon their giving themselves over to lasciviousnesse, they <hi>gave themselves</hi> also <hi>to work all uncleannesse.</hi> 6. For a man to be given over to lasciviousnesse, and to fulfill his beastly lusts without all check or challenge, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth a great height of impiety, and such as speaketh a man ignorant of God, judicially hardned in heart, and altogether past feeling: for, he maketh this the result of all the fore-mentioned branches of their wickednesse, even that <hi>they gave themselves over unto lasciviousnesse, to work all wickednesse.</hi> 7. As upon senslesse stupidity of conscience, through frequent resisting of light, there


<pb n="288" facs="tcp:44180:312"/>
followeth an unsatiablenesse in sinning, especially in the sin of uncleannesse, that the more a man doth sin, he is the more eager upon sin, and can never have enough of it; So, when a man cometh to this, he is then arrived at the greatest height of sin, unto which ever the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, destitute of the knowledge of God, did attain: for, this is the highest step of all, that through hardnesse of heart, being past feeling, they did not only simply act uncleannesse, but <hi>gave themselves to work all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with greedinesse.</hi>

As the giving of loose reigns to sin, is inconsistent with the state of grace and the saving knowledge of Christ; So, there is no argument more prevalent with a gracious heart to keep them up from profanity and loosnesse, than the through inculcating of this truth: for, among many other arguments <hi>Paul</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth choice of this, <hi>But ye have not so learned Christ.</hi> 3.

The first whereof, is in this verse, to wit, a daily study to <hi>put off</hi> and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the <hi>old man,</hi> whereby is not meaned the substance of a mans soul and body, nor yet the naturall and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall faculties of the soul; (for, those of necessity do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes remain, untill the man cease to be) but that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and inbred corruption, which hath infected and polluted all those: which inbred corruption he sheweth had manifested it self in their former godlesse conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and doth grow daily worse, and more <hi>corrupt,</hi> yea, and by little and little bringeth corruption and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon the whole man, both in soul and body, where it is given way to in <hi>its deceitfull lusts:</hi> for, so much doth he intend, while he saith, <hi>it is corrupt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or, by <hi>deceitfull lusts.</hi> Now, this inbred corruption, is here called <hi>the old man,</hi> and the mortifying of it, is called a <hi>putting of it off,</hi> by a metaphor taken from the laying aside and casting off of old garments. See the reasons for both, upon <hi>Col.</hi> 3. -9. doct. 1. Hence, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. So much may we reckon our selves to know of Christ, and to be taught by Christ, as we do pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise according to what we know. Those only are best scholers in Christs school, who are most tender walkers: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, that to learn Christ, and to be taught by Him, is, in a word, to practise all the duties of an holy life, even <hi>that ye put off the old man, &amp;c.</hi> saith he. 2. Then do we set about the duties of sanctification in


<pb n="292" facs="tcp:44180:314"/>
the right order, when we begin at the work of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the first place, and thence proceed to the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive duties of a new life: the plants of righteousnesse will not thrive in an unhumbled, proud, impenitent heart, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 44. for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth the first part of this lesson, is, to <hi>put off concerning the former conversation, the old man.</hi> 3. Then do we carry on the work of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification right and to good purpose, when we single not out some one sin passing by others, but do strike at all sin, and do not content our selves to lop the branches, but strike at the very root of sin: for, <hi>Paul</hi> describeth this work to be a putting off the old man, that is, the bitter root of inbred corruption, in its full latitude and extent; <hi>That ye put off concerning the former conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the old man.</hi> 4. Though we must begin to strike at the root of sin within; yet we are not to rest there, but must set against sin in all its branches; and whoever setteth upon sin at the root and in the heart, he cannot choose but set against the breaking forth of sin in his hand and outward conversation also: yea, the reality of his fighting against his inward corruptions, will make it self manifest in an outward change in his conversation from what it formerly was: for, so much is imported, while he sheweth they were to <hi>put off the old man, as to the former conversation,</hi> not as if sins of the outward man and conversation only, were to be put off; but because those are also to be mortified, and the inward work of mortification doth kyth by our putting off of those. 5. The work of putting off and mortifying this old man of inbred corruption, is to be entered timously, in so far, as the longer that corruption is spared, it groweth worse, and posteth the person, in whom it is, more swiftly to ruine and destruction: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth, indirectly at least, presse this duty of putting off the old man, from this <hi>that it is corrupt,</hi> or groweth worse and worse <hi>by its deceitfull lusts.</hi> 6. This inbred root of naturall corup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth vent it self in multitudes and swarmes of inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate lusts and sinfull desires, by venting whereof, it


<pb n="293" facs="tcp:44180:314"/>
doth alwayes acquire the more strength, and secureth its interest more firmly, both in soul and body: for, he sheweth, that this old man hath lusts, and is corrupted, or made worse, and more deeply rooted by those lusts; <hi>which is corrupted by deceitfull lusts.</hi> 7. Sinfull lusts are entising and deceitfull lusts, in so far as they promise what they never perform, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19. and do often co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themselves under the mask of some laudable vertue, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18. and thus do by subtilty carry the sinner cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to their slavery, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 21, 22. for, he calleth them <hi>deceitfull lusts,</hi> or, as it is in the Originall, <hi>lusts of deceit.</hi>

It is not sufficient in order to our effectual learning of Christ, and being taught by Him, that we cease to do evill, and labour to mortifie our inbred cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, with the several branches thereof; but we must also learn to do well, and endeavour to have the whole man adorned with the several graces of Gods Spirit, making conscience of all the positive duties of an holy

See three doctrines im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the notation of the word <hi>renewed,</hi> which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth to restore a thing deformed and antiquated, to its ancient form and beauty, upon <hi>Col.</hi> 3. vet. 10. doct. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Right information of the mind and judgement, and the knowledge of truth and duty flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefrom, are most necessary to be sought after by Christians, if so they would lead an holy life: An er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mind will of necessity, at least in so far, make a crooked heart and an irregular hand: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that in particular it is necessary to be <hi>renewed in the spirit of the mind.</hi>

Only those who are renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and have their souls adorned with gracious and spirituall qualities of righteousnesse and holinesse, are like to God; and such, as are most so, are most like unto Him: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of being renewed in the mind, and of putting on the new man, saith, that it is <hi>after God,</hi> or, (as it is more plainly, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10.) after the Image of God; <hi>Which after God is created,</hi> saith he. 4. The Image of God consisteth, not so much in the natural substance, or faculties of the soul, or the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it, (for those are in a wicked man) as in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gifts and graces, even conformity with God in true knowledge, righteousnesse and holinesse: for, the Apostle, speaking of the renovation of the mind by knowledge, and putting on the new man in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and holinesse, saith, That this is <hi>after God,</hi> or, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter His Image. 5. This new man of grace, created after Gods Image, as it consisteth not in things external, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 17. but in the inward and substantial graces of Gods Spirit; so it comprehendeth all spiritual habits, and vertues, and the exercise of all those graces, in all the duties of universal obedience, prescribed in both the Tables of the moral Law: for, he sheweth this new man consisteth in righteousnesse and holinesse, which include a conformity to the Law of God in both its Tables; <hi>Which is created in righteousnesse and holinesse.</hi> 6. No performance of any one, or of all commanded duties whatsoever, is a sufficient proof of a renewed mind, or

                  <p>THe Apostle (being in the third part of the Chapter to presse upon them the exercise of some particular vertues, which do belong to all Christians of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever rank or station equally, aswell as those formerly spoken of, all of which are injoyned in the second Table of the Commands) exhorteth them, first, from what he spake of putting off the old man, and putting on the new, to <hi>lay aside</hi> and mortifie the sin of <hi>lying,</hi> forbidden in the ninth Command, whereby a man doth speak what he knoweth or conceiveth to be untruth, with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and purpose to deceive. He exhorteth them also to speak the truth every man with his neighbour, that is, to speak as they think, and to think of what they speak as it really is, so that our speech may be conform both to the thing it self, and to our conceptions of the thing. Which exhortation in both its branches, is inforced from this, that they were not only members of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but <hi>one of another,</hi> every member of this mysticall body being bound to contribute all its endeavours, as for the good of the whole body in the first place, so of every particular member in the next; and therefore it had been alike unnaturall and monstrous for them, by


<pb n="297" facs="tcp:44180:316"/>
lying and deceiving to circumveen one another, as it were for the eye in the naturall body to deceive the hand, or for any one member to contrive and carry on the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of another. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is not sufficient for Christs Ministers to presse upon the Lords people the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sin, or conscience-making of the duties of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse in the generall; but, seing people are apt to think that an sleight performance, or faint endeavours are suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient obedience to these generall exhortations; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ministers must condescend upon some particular vices, chiefly such as are most commonly practised in the place where they are, and some particular vertues, which are most ordinarily sleighted, pressing upon the Lords people to evidence their renovation by abstinence from the former, and practising of the latter: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having indirectly at least exhorted them to put off the old man, ver. 22. and put on the new, ver. 24. doth now fall upon some particular vices and vertues, dehort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the one, and exhorting to the other; <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore putting away lying.</hi> 2. There is no sin more unseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a Christian, and more inconsistent with grace, than the sin of lying, there being no sin that maketh a man more like the devil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. more abominable to God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 16, 17. nor more shamefull in the eyes of men, so that even they, who are most guilty of it, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to be charged with it; no sin more hurtful to the sinner, as making him to be trusted by none, and no sin which tendeth more to the utter overthrow of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane societie; fidelity and trust among men, being that which maketh any society comfortable: for, the Apostle dehorteth from lying, upon the ground of their putting on the new man, as is implied in the illative particle <hi>Wherefore: Wherefore putting away lying.</hi> 3. As all kind of lying is intrinsically sin, and to be avoided, whether the pernicious, officious, or sporting lie; (See upon <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 8, 9-. doct. 10.) So there is no person of whatsoever rank, whether rich or poor, to whom God giveth any dispensation to lie, or speak contrary to


<pb n="298" facs="tcp:44180:317"/>
truth: for, he saith indefinitly, <hi>putting away lying,</hi> and <hi>speak every man truth,</hi> without exception. 4. Though we are not bound to speak all the truth, and at all times, and to every person, but in some cases may and ought conceal somewhat of it, <hi>Luk. 9. 21. 1 Sam.</hi> 16. 2. yet, when we speak, we are to speak nothing but truth, and that without mentall reservation of any part of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, without which the rest which is spoken, would not be truth but a lie: for, though it be sufficient for a man to think what is truth, and not expresse it, when he is speaking or meditating with himself; yet he is to speak truth, if so he speak at all, when he speaketh with his neighbour; <hi>speak every man truth with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> saith he. 5. This is a generall rule to be observed for the right understanding of divine precepts, that where a sin is forbidden, the contrary duty is also commanded, and where a duty is commanded, the contrary sin is also forbidden: for, the Apostle, expounding here the ninth command, doth not only exhort <hi>to lay aside lying;</hi> but also <hi>to speak every man the truth with his neighbour.</hi> 6. Though it be sinfull to lie, and speak untruth unto any, even to an infidel, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. 16. yet, it is more sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and most odious for Believers and Professors of the same faith, because of their nearer bonds and relations, to lie unto, and deceive one another: for, so much the Apostles reason here used, which is astricted only to such, doth teach; <hi>for we are members one of another,</hi> saith he. 7. It is not sufficient, that a man abstain from ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and endeavour to speak truth with his neighbour, from a motive of self-advantage and interest, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his doing otherwise would tend both to his losse and shame; but he ought to be acted herein from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of love towards those with whom he speaketh, chiefly, if he conceive them to be Believers, as to members of that same body, for whose advantage and preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion especially, he is bound to lay out himself in his place and station; so far must he be from seeking to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine them, or deceive them: for, <hi>Paul</hi> will have

them to put away lying, and to speak the truth, for this reason, that <hi>they were all members one of another.</hi>

                  <p>HE exhorteth them, next, to restrain and moderate their anger, forbidden in the sixth command. And, 1. he, as it were, giveth them way to be angry some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and in some cases. 2.

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:44180:318"/>
giving way to private revenge in the accomplishment of our anger, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 54. 55. In those cases, anger is praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and commendable: for, the Apostle giveth way to anger, yea after a sort commandeth it, to wit, in those cases; <hi>be ye angry,</hi> saith he. 2. As there is an easie and ready passage from what is moderation in our naturall affections of joy, fear, grief, desire (and therefore lawfull and in some cases necessary) to what is excesse, (and therefore sinfull) <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. -11, So this doth chiefly hold in the affection of anger; it being most difficile to keep a measure, and not to exceed, by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressing some one or other of the fore-mentioned limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of just anger when it is once given way to: for, therefore doth he add this necessary caution, <hi>Be angry,</hi> but <hi>sin not.</hi> 3. As it is possible, even in the childe of God, for lawfull anger to degenerate in sinfull wrath, whereby the mind is imbittered, and accordingly rageth against the person of him who hath done the wrong; So, an implacable spirit, which cannot be worn out by length of time, is not so incident to any such: for, the Apostle supponeth they may have wrath; only they might not entertain it long, while he saith, <hi>Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.</hi> 4. The childe of God in his resisting sin, is not to sit down discouraged, nor give the back when sin prevaileth; but, having received a new recruit of strength from Christ, by the exercise of faith in prayer, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. he is with renewed cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to set upon sin a-fresh, that so he may recover what was formerly lost: for, <hi>Paul</hi> enjoyneth, in case their anger should at any time exceed, to set against it without delay; <hi>Let not the sun go down upon your wrath.</hi>

Where any known sin, especially excessive anger, is not only given way to, but also continued in, there doth Sathan get an open door to setle himself in the heart, and exercise his power, by inciting the person guilty to commit more of wickednesse and mischief: for, he sheweth, that by their persevering in wrath they would <hi>give place to the devil.</hi> 3.

                  <p>HE doth, thirdly, exhort those, who, when they were un-converted Pagans, did contrary to the eighth command, steal their neighbours goods, or who were yet, after their professing faith in Jesus Christ, guilty of


<pb n="302" facs="tcp:44180:319"/>
that sin in some degrees and respects, that they would <hi>steal no more:</hi> where by the sin of <hi>stealing,</hi> is meaned all those fraudulent and deceitfull wayes whereby a man doth wrong his neighbour secretly and without his knowledge in his goods or outward estate, whether by taking <hi>(Joh</hi> 20. 19.) or withholding from him what is his, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 4. or by partaking with such as do so, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 18. He exhorteth them also to the contrary duty, as a remedy of this evil, even that they would rather la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour diligently, and to wearinesse (as the word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth) in any good and honest calling, if it were but in some mechanick or handy-trade: The use of which remedy is inforced from a following advantage, to wit, that hereby, and through Gods blessing upon their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, they should acquire not only a competencie in things worldly unto themselves, and so be keept from a necessity of stealing; but also might be able to bestow somwhat for supplying the necessities of others: <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As Jesus Christ doth not reject the vilest, no not theeves, nor worse, for any thing they have been, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding they amend their life in time coming; So there are many, who, after they have taken on a name of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, do secretly live in the practice of base and sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full sins, which hardly can be called the spots of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: for, while he saith, <hi>Let him that stole,</hi> or <hi>doth steal,</hi> (as the word beareth) <hi>steal no more,</hi> it is supponed, that some of those <hi>Ephesians,</hi> were guilty of this sin, before an offer of mercy was made to them in the Gospel; yea, and that some were yet living in it. 2. It hath seemed good unto the wise Creator of all things, (for eschewing of confusion, strife, contention and other infinit evils; for tryall of the charity of some, and patience of others) to establish property and dominion of goods and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not to leave all things common among men, so that every one should have an equall right unto all: for, if there were no propriety of goods, there could not be such a sin as <hi>stealing,</hi> neither were it necessary to forbid it, as the Spirit of God doth here; <hi>Let him that stole,


<pb n="303" facs="tcp:44180:319"/>
steal no more.</hi> 3. As want of a particular calling, or idlenesse in it, occasioneth poverty and want, by reason whereof men are cast upon tentations, to steal and use such other sinfull shifts, to keep them from straits; So it is the Lords will, that every one betake himself to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour diligently in some lawfull calling and employment, as a remedy, not only against this evil of stealing, but severall others also, which flow from idlenesse, and too much ease, 2 <hi>Thess. 3. 12. Psal.</hi> 73. 5. for, the Apostle, having forbidden them to steal, subjoyneth this as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, <hi>rather let him labour, working with his hands.</hi> 4. Though it be not absolutely necessary, nor yet conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, or possible, that every man should betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to some mechanick calling, or handy-trade, and therein to labour with his hands, seing every one is not able to go about any such calling; and there are other lawfull callings, which require no lesse labour with the mind, than those do of labour with the hands, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. yet, there is no calling so base, providing it be honest, to which a man should not betake himself (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be for birth, and nobility of descent) and spend his strength therein, even to wearinesse, rather than to steal, or use any sinfull shift to save himself from straits: for, saith he, <hi>let him steal no more, but rather let him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, working with his hands.</hi> 4. Even those things that were imposed upon fallen mankind, for a curse and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of sin, have their nature changed unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and are turned unto a blessing and an effectuall remedy against sin: for, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 3. 19.) it is imposed upon <hi>Adam</hi> as a part of the curse, in the sweat of his face to eat his bread; and here it is enjoyned, and commended by the Apostle unto Believers, as an effectuall remedy against the evil of stealing; <hi>but rather let him labour, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his hands.</hi> 5. No necessity, or want whatsoever, can warrand a man to imploy himself in any calling, which is not lawful and honest, or tendeth only to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie mens lusts, of pride, vanity, prodigality and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: this calling ought to be such as he may therein serve

The Lords ordinary way is to blesse a mans conscientious diligence in his lawfull calling, with such a measure of successe, as he may have whereby to sustain himself, and to be helpfull unto others, except the Lord see it otherwise fitting, for the mans triall and the exercise of his faith, patience and other graces, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2. for, the end of labouring in a lawfull calling, here proponed, is for the most part at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, else it had been no encouragment, even <hi>that he may have to give to him that needeth.</hi> 7. As it is the duty of all whom God hath blessed with any measure of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly substance, to bestow some part of it for the help of others; So we ought in the exercise of our callings, as we would expect the Lords blessing upon it, to intend, not only the enriching of our selves and ours, but also that we may have whereby to do good unto others: for he sheweth they were to aime at this end, while they wrought with their hands; <hi>that they might have to give to him that needeth.</hi> 8. As not only the rich, but even the poor labourer, who hardly getteth his livelyhood with the work of his hands, is bound to give his mite for the help of the indigent; So we ought to give alms of that which is our own lawfully purchased, and not of the gain of oppression, or hire of an harlot, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 18. for, saith he, <hi>Let him work that which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.</hi> 9. As the Lord seeth it fitting to keep alwayes some among His People, poor and indigent, even objects of charity, for the exercise of their faith and patience, and for the trial of the charity and compassion of others, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15. 11. So those only are to be relieved by our charity, who are needy, indigent, and cannot relieve themselves: but not such, as, being able to work in a lawfull calling, do


<pb n="305" facs="tcp:44180:320"/>
rather choose a life of ease and idlenesse, and to live upon the charity of others: for, he saith, <hi>that he may have to give to him that needeth.</hi>

                  <p>HEre is a fourth exhortation, wherein he giveth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for the right ordering of the tongue: and, first, he forbiddeth them to utter corrupt, or unsavory and putrified communication, or speech, whereby is meaned all discourse, not tending to the glory of God and edification of our neighbour, (as appeareth from the latter part of the verse, where edifying conference is opposed to this corrupt communication) but mainly all obscene, scurril, ranting and arrogant discourse is here intended, even such as argueth a rotten and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 35. and proveth not only noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som and unsavory to honest ears, but also contagious and infecting to ordinary hearers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 33. even as a stinking breath (unto which he seemeth here to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude) argueth rotten lungs, doth prove unsavoury, yea, and (if the party be taken with any contagious disease) dangerous also unto those who stand by, lest they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by it. Next, he enjoyneth the contrary duty, that their discourse and communication should be good, and usefull for the edification of hearers, even such as may minister grace unto them, that is, which may be a mean blessed of God for begetting or carrying on the work of grace in them, and for that end may be so proponed, as it should prove most taking, gracious and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto them. See upon <hi>Col.</hi> 3. -16. and, 4. 6. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the duty of renewed Christians, as to watch over the heart and hand; so in a special way to guard against the sins of the tongue; seing they must make an accompt to God, even for words, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 36. and their sinfully, vain, frothy and rotten discourse doth argue


<pb n="306" facs="tcp:44180:321"/>
such a heart, from the abundance whereof the mouth doth speak, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 34. yea, and maketh the heart more perverse and wicked, while the corruption which is in it doth strengthen it self by getting vent, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 13. and proveth also contagious to the hearers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 33. for, the Apostle, having disswaded them from the sins of the heart and hand, doth now disswade them from the sins of the tongue; <hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.</hi> 2. As our corrupt hearts, which in the best are but renewed in part, are very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hatch impure, vain and unprofitable corruptions, and to presse the venting of those by the tongue, in vain and corrupt communication; So it is the renewed mans duty, and ought to be his care, to keep a watch at the door of his lips, <hi>Psal.</hi> 141. 3. that, though he cannot get his heart keeped from framing such conceptions; yet, at least, he may preserve his tongue from venting of them; seing our corrupt conceptions do not only prove more dishonourable to God, when they are vented in expressions, but also, in that case they prove offensive and hurtfull unto others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 33. for, the Apostle, supposing that such impure stuffe would somtimes breed in the heart, and seek a passage, he commandeth, <hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.</hi> 3. As there is no sin which wanteth a remedy; So the most proper remedy of every sin, is not only to set against the sin it self, but also to set about the practice of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vertue: for, <hi>Paul</hi> prescribeth this remedy, as against the sins fore-mentioned, so against this, <hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good,</hi> saith he. 4. It is not sufficient to retrain our tongue from speaking evil, keeping alwayes silence: but, seing our tongue is our glory, <hi>Psal.</hi> 57. 8. and given unto us, not only for the use of rafting &amp; carrying down to the throat our meat and drink, but also to expresse the conceptions of our heart, to the glory of God, and edification of our neighbour; therefore, we must also exercise our tongue in speaking what is good: for, so


<pb n="307" facs="tcp:44180:321"/>
doth the Apostle command, <hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good.</hi> 5. It is the duty, not only of Ministers, but of private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians also (keeping themselves within the bounds of their calling, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4.) to endeavour the edification of those with whom they converse, while they labour either to beget, or carry on the work of grace in them; and this not only by their good example, but by their edifying discourse and communication: for, he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to all indifferently, while he saith, <hi>Let no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation come out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying.</hi> 5. We are not left to run at random in our ordinary discourses, as if we might speak what we please, providing we speak not evil, but are tied only to speak edifying purpose, and this at all times, and with all persons, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 6. whether we be speaking of things religious, or which appertain to our particular calling, or recreations: for, as it is lawfull and necessary for Christians sometimes to speak of those things; so there is such a way to speak of them, as the hearers may be bettered by our speech; <hi>But that which is good to the use of edifying.</hi> 6. As godly discourse and conference ought to be heard, and entertained by those who are present; So, although the Word preached be the ordinary mean of converting sinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14, 15. yet, the Lord is sometimes pleased to blesse the familiar and secret dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of private Christians, being spoken with grace, and seasoned with the salt of divine wisdom, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them a mean of conveying grace unto others, even to some, whom no publick preaching of the Word could ever move or work upon, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1. for, the end of speaking good to the use of edifying here proponed, is attainable, else it had been no strong motive to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>That it may minister grace unto the hearers.</hi>

                  <p>HE doth here inforce the former disswasive, by a strong reason set down in form of precept: the force whereof, is, first, propounded, that by their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene unprofitable and unedifying discourse, they would grieve the holy Spirit of God: who is called <hi>holy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause He is holy in Himself, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 3. and the cause of all holinesse in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 16. And we are are said to grieve Him, not, as if He, who is God, could be grieved properly; for, the passions of grief, anger, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as implying some defect, or imperfection) are not in God, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 19. But improperly, and in so far, as we do that, which in it self is apt to grieve Him, if He were capable of grief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. -15. and which provoketh the Spirit of God to do that which grieved persons do, even to withdraw from the soul, to shew His dislike, and to return grief for grief. This reason is, next, inforced from one work of the holy Spirit in the hearts of Believers, which is here called <hi>sealing,</hi> by a metaphor taken from that use of seals and signets among men, whereby publick writs are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and made authentick, or, the wares of merchands are marked, and set apart for their own use. In like manner, the Spirit of God, by renewing and sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Believers, imprinteth the draughts and lineaments of His own image upon them, whereby they are not only set apart and sealed, as His own peculiar goods, but themselves also may be assured that they are His, and shall be safely keeped under that seal untill the day of judgement, called here the <hi>day of redemption:</hi> (See, upon chapter 1. ver. 13.) and therefore by grieving the Spirit, they did hazard the removall of this seal, at least darken it much, and consequently mar their own comfort excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

a singular manner familiar with the truely regenerate, taking up a place of abode in their spirits, and furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with sweet and necessary counsel and advice from time to time, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 27. for, as we shew, His being grieved doth speak His withdrawing from them, and a ceasing from being so friendly and familiar with them, as a stranger will do from an inne, wherein he hath received some affront, which implieth that He was once present and familiar with them; <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God.</hi> 2. How friendly, and familiar soever, the holy Spirit of God be with the believing soul; yet so holy and pure is His Nature, that he can behold no iniquity, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 13. but when those that are dearest to Him, give any way to known sin, He must shew Himself displeasd with it, and with them for it: for, so much is supponed, while the Apostle, disswading them from sin, sheweth, this holy Spirit of God will be grieved by it; <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God.</hi> 3. However many, by their obscene and putrid dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, intend no further than to make themselves, or others joviall and glad, <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 3. yet hereby, and by such other sins of the like stamp, as being against the motions, light and direction of the Spirit, this holy Spirit of God is much displeased, and so much, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons grived use to be; and therefore will withdraw His gracious and conforting presence, with all those other tokens of His respect and favour from the person, by whom He hath been grieved, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. -17. leaving him to be guided for a time by his own spirit, and the spirit of Satan, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 12. and giving him over to a kind of desperate grief and hellish horrour, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 3, 4. or senslesse stupidity, <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 17. as a just reward for griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy Spirit of God: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, that by their putrid communication they would grieve the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and make Him do what grieved persons use to do, while he saith, <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God.</hi> 4. As those spirituall plagues, inflicted upon our spirits for grieving of the Spirit of God, and following upon


<pb n="310" facs="tcp:44180:323"/>
His withdrawing from us, are most terrible; so the childe of God, not only may, but ought to skare at, and abstain from sin, even that he may be preserved from those spirituall plagues and judgements, though neither love to duty, nor fear of an other correction do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain him: for, the Apostle laboureth to deter them from the sin of loose speaking, by this consideration, as being of greatest force, even lest thereby they should grieve the Spirit; <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God,</hi> saith he. 5. Though the redemption of Gods children be perfected, in regard of the price payed by Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 30. yet, in regard of the application of it unto us, it is but begun in this world, and perfected in the next: for, he speaketh of our compleat redemption, as yet to come, <hi>Whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</hi> 6. Those whom God will compleatly redeem from all sin and misery, both in soul and body, and from whose eyes He will wipe away all tears at the last day, are only such, upon whom the Spirit of God doth imprint the draughts of His own image, in righteousnesse and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, as the impression of the draughts and lineaments of a seal, or by sealing put upon the thing sealed: for, he saith, <hi>by whom,</hi> meaning the holy Spirit, <hi>we are sealed unto the day of redemption.</hi> 7. Upon whomsoever the Spirit of God doth imprint this seal and stamp of true holinesse, and of joy, peace and comfort flowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, all such shall be securely keeped and preserved, as Gods own peculiar treasure by the power of God unto salvation, to be fully manifested and compleatly bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the last day; for, <hi>they are sealed unto the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> a metaphor, as we shew, from merchands, who, leaving their wares behind them, do put their mark and seal upon them, untill such a day wherein they will come and own them. 8. By vertue of this sealing and stamp of sanctification, peace and joy imprinted by the Spirit of God upon the hearts of Believers, even they themselves may attain to know assuredly, that they are in the state of grace, and shall be preserved in it untill the


<pb n="311" facs="tcp:44180:323"/>
great day: for, as this sealing of them, by imprinting the draughts of Gods image upon them, is a discriminating mark betwixt them and others; so it serveth, not so much to make it known to God, that they are His, who knoweth who are His from all eternity, and anteceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to their effectual calling, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. -19—or to make it known unto others, who cannot infallibly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the grace of God in any but themselves, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8. -39. as unto themselves; otherwise the Apostle would not have used a forcible argument not to grieve the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, from His sealing of them, if it were a thing which could not be certainly known, but guessed at by them; <hi>Grieve not the Spirit, by whom ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</hi> 9. So far is the work of grace in Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or their assurance of being in a state of grace, flowing herefrom, and wrought in them by the Spirit of God, from breeding security and loosnesse of life, that, by the contrary, there can be no such prevailing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make them abhor sin, entertain and follow the motions of the Spirit of God, and consequently to lead an holy life. Not only ingenuity and gratitude, for the favour received, will bind them to it, but also holy fear and circumspection, lest otherwise they mar and darken the seal so as they cannot discern the draughts of it, and consequently lose, though not the seal it self, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. yet the comfort and assurance, which they had by it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. -7. for, the Apostle useth this as an argument to keep them from grieving the Spirit by sin, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they <hi>were thereby sealed unto the day of redemption.</hi>

                  <p>HEre is the sixth precept enjoyning the exercise of some vertues, which are opposite unto, and remedies against, those vices presently mentioned.

The second is <hi>tender-heartednesse,</hi> commiseration, or mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whereby we are most inwardly and in the very bowels (as the word signifieth) touched and affected with compassion towards the miseries and infirmities of others, so far would he have them from thirsting after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. And, thirdly, he recommendeth unto them to give evidence of their kindnesse and tender-heartednesse, in an hearty, free and pleasant pardoning of mutuall wrongs, as the word signifieth. And, lastly, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth this dutie of mutuall forgivenesse, from Gods example, in forgiving us all our offences for Christs sake. Concerning which duty of forgiving and pardoning one another here enjoyned, know, first, that, as to the wrong to be forgiven, in so far, as it is alwayes an offence against God, and sometimes against the publick laws of the land, we have not power to forgive it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 25. nor to meddle with it further than by prayer to God, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 14, 15. and in some cases, by intercession with the Magistrate; but in so far only, as it is a wrong done to us we are to forgive it. Know, secondly, that this forgivenesse implyeth a removall of all inward grudge and endeavour after private revenge, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 18. together


<pb n="315" facs="tcp:44180:325"/>
with a readinesse to do all duties of love and kindnesse to him who hath done the wrong, as God doth minister occasion and ability, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 4, 5. Which yet, thirdly, doth not bind us up from having recourse to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate for attaining restauration to our right, and repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of our wrongs, providing we go not to law for trifles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 7. nor yet before all amicable means be privately essayed, for taking away the occasion of strife, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 5. See further upon <hi>Col.</hi> 3. ver. 13. doct. 3. Hence, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The exercise of kindnesse in a sweet and amicable carriage, is a singular remedy against sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full anger and all its branches, in so far, as thereby we not only give no occasion of anger unto others, but also do give place unto wrath, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 19. whereby it slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it self, and we do overcome evil with good: for, as a remedy against all the branches of sinfull anger, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned, he enjoyneth <hi>And be ye kind one to another.</hi> 2. The exercise of mercy and tender-hearted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is another soveraign remedy against sinfull anger and all its branches, in so far, as thereby we are inabled to look upon the fooleries, infirmities, yea, and other greater injuries done by our neighbour with pity and compassion, which otherwise would provoke our anger and passion: for, he enjoyneth this as another remedy against all the branches of sinfull anger, <hi>Be ye tender-hearted.</hi> 3. Then, and not while then, may a man conclude, that wrath and anger are sufficiently mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, when he is not only in a readinesse to discharge all duties of kindnesse and love to the party who hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured him, but doth also look upon him for so doing, as one, who is an object of compassion and pity, rather than of passion and anger: for, in stead of bitternesse, wrath, anger and malice against those who had injured them, he injoyneth, <hi>And be ye kind one to another, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted.</hi> 4. The exercise of kindnesse and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartednesse, ought, and will go together, where there is a suitable object for both to work upon, so that kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse will not be broken off, because of the miseries and

infirmities of those to whom we owe kindnesse, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heightened and helped by an addition of tender-heartednesse and bowels of compassion: for, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth not only <hi>be ye kind one to another,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specteth our neighbour under either state, whether of prosperity, or adversity, but also <hi>be tender-hearted,</hi> which respecteth him under misery. 5. Those graces of kindnesse and mercy, are to be exercised especially in the case of wrongs and injuries; yea, the reality of those graces are best tried, not by our exercising them to such as do us no hurt, but in bearing with, and pardoning of those who have given just cause of provocation by real injuries: for, the Apostle will have kindnesse and tender-heartednesse exercised <hi>in forgiving one another,</hi> which supponeth a wrong done. 6. Even those, who have gotten a heart from God to forgive wrongs done to themselves by others, are not so free of infirmities, but they will be sometimes doing reall injuries unto others, and therfore stand in need of forgivenesse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: for, so much is implyed, while he calleth for mutual performance of this duty, even <hi>forgiving one another.</hi> 7. Only those whom God hath forgiven for Christs sake, can freely, pleasantly, and from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of true love in the heart, forgive those wrongs which are done to them by others: and the more a man hath attained to know, that God hath pardoned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he will be the more inclinable to shew forgivenesse unto others: for, he maketh their forgiving of others, a consequence of Gods forgiving them. And therefore, when the Scripture commandeth us to forgive, that we may be forgiven, <hi>Mark</hi> 11. 25. it doth not mean, that our forgiving others doth go before Gods pardoning of us, but is an immediate effect of it, or at the most an antecedent to our sensible perceiving of it; <hi>Forgiving one another, even as God for Christs sake hath forgiven you.</hi> 8. That Gods practice in forgiving us, is an effectuall argument for exciting us to forgive and pardon one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, see upon <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 13. doct. 7. 9. The example


<pb n="317" facs="tcp:44180:326"/>
of God in forgiving us, is not only an argument exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us to forgive one another, but also a pattern, which we are to resemble in the manner of our forgivenesse; not, that our forgivenesse can match His in equality or perfection, but in similitude and likenesse: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth chiefly in this, that we forgive sincerely, not hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritically, freely and not unwillingly, fully and not by halfes, irrevocably and not for a time only, as He doth, <hi>Matth. 18. 35. Mica. 7. 18. Col. 2. 13. Jer.</hi> 31. 34: for, he saith, <hi>Forgiving one another, even as God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given you.</hi> 10. Though God hath freely forgiven us; yet He hath seen to the satisfaction of His provoked ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice for the wrong done, antecedently to His forgiving of us: which satisfaction, is not exacted of us, but of Christ who was made sin for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. And therefore, though we are to imitate God in remitting the private injury done to our selves, and that in the manner mentioned in the preceeding doctrine; yet we have not power to dispense with the injury done to the Justice of God, nor to the publick Laws of the Land; yea, in some cases, the Law of God alloweth that we pursue the party before the Judge, and notwithstanding of our forgiving him, to seek that the Law may strike against him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 18, &amp;c. <hi>Even as God for Christs sake hath forgiven you.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>THe Apostle, in the first part of this Chapter (having, first, confirmed the precept given in the last words of chap. 4. by pressing upon them to imitate God in forgiving one another, from the fountain of love, ver. 1, 2.) doth yet exhort them unto such duties as belong unto all Christians in generall. And, first, he forbiddeth six vices, all of them almost contrary unto chastity: because, first, they are


<pb n="318" facs="tcp:44180:327"/>
uncomely for Saints, ver. 3. Secondly, inconvenient, ver. 4. Thirdly, they exclude from Gods Kingdom, ver. 5. And fourthly, they bring down Gods wrath, ver. 6. Secondly, he dehorteth from partaking with wicked men in their sins, ver. 7. because of that blessed change wrought in them from darknesse to light, ver. 8. The force of which consequence, is proved from the fruits of light, ver. 9. and (having pointed at the rule of right walking, ver. 10. and explained the precept, set down, ver. 7. by discharging all accession to the sins of the wicked, and enjoyning them to reprove them, ver. 11.) he enforceth yet further the duty so explained, first, from the abominable filthinesse of those sins, ver. 12. Secondly, from the good following upon reproof, even the conviction of the sinner, ver. 13. And, thirdly, from Gods own example, who reproveth the world of sin, and thereby conveyeth light unto them, ver. 14. Thirdly, he exhorteth to circumspect walking, ver. 15. which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth mainly in redeeming the time, ver. 16. and, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hereto, that they would acquaint themselves with Gods revealed will, ver. 17. Fourthly, he exhorteth them to eschew drunkennesse. And, fifthly, to be filled with the Spirit, ver. 18. and to vent that fulnesse of the Spirit, first, in melodious singing of praises unto God, ver. 19. Secondly, in giving of thanks for all things, ver. 20.</p>
               <p>In the second part of the Chapter, The Apostle (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving premitted a generall exhortation unto all, to submit themselves one to another, ver. 21.) doth presse those duties, which belong to Christians, as they are members of Families. And, first, the duties of wives under the name of <hi>submission,</hi> set forth by the manner of it, <hi>as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord,</hi> ver. 22. Secondly, by the ground or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it, the husbands headship, illustrated from Christs, ver. 23. Thirdly, by the pattern of it, the Churches subjection to Christ. And, fourthly, by the extent of it, to all things, ver. 24. Next, he presseth the duty of husbands under the name of <hi>love,</hi> 1. from Christ's love


<pb n="319" facs="tcp:44180:327"/>
to His Church, giving Himself for her, ver. 25. and that for two ends, to wit, the sanctification, ver. 26. and glorification thereof, ver. 27. Secondly, from the near union betwixt husband and wife, they being one flesh, and therefore he ought to love her, ver. 28. Because, 1. all men care for their own flesh. 2. Christ careth for His Church, ver. 29. because of the strict union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Him and the Church, ver. 30. And thirdly, the ancient law of Marriage doth expresly enjoyn so much, ver. 31. And because he hath spoken of the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Christ and the Church, he declareth it to be a great and unsearchable mysterie, ver. 32. and so conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the purpose, by summing the duties of husbands and wives in two words, <hi>love</hi> and <hi>reverence.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle (being to insist further in exhorting to such particular vertues as do belong to all Christians in general of whatsoever rank or sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) doth, first, illustrate the sixth and last precept, given, chap. 4. whereby he enjoyned the exercise of mutual kindnesse and mercy in forgiving one another, because of Gods example in forgiving them for Christs sake. Which precept he doth illustrate, first, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcing the duty, together with the motive to it, from Gods example, while, 1. he commandeth them <hi>to be followers of God,</hi> to wit, in the exercise of kindnesse, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and forgivenesse: for, according to the present scope, the imitation of God here enjoyned, seemeth to be astricted unto those particulars, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 44, 45. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 35, &amp;c. though otherwise it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and elsewhere is extended, unto all those divine vertues, whereof some representation and shadow, at least, ought to be in us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 16. And, secondly, he giveth a reason why they should imitate God thus, even because they were His children by Adoption, and


<pb n="320" facs="tcp:44180:328"/>
not only children, but <hi>dear children,</hi> and dearly beloved by God their Father. All of them did, at least, professe themselves to be such, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6- and the better part of them really were such, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. and therefore they were to imitate Him in the exercise of those vertues, as they would evidence themselves to be of His children. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. One and the self same action of God, and chiefly His works of mercy towards Believers, are more than one way advantagious unto them, in so far, as thereby not only they are freed from sin and misery, but also have an argument and motive, furnished both unto them on whom He sheweth mercy, whereby they may be incited to their duty of shewing mercy unto others, and to others also to shew mercy unto them: for, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that God in forgiving them, had cast a copy to be followed by them in their forgiving one another, while he saith, <hi>Be ye therefore followers of God.</hi> 2. Though we neither ought, nor can imitate God in His works of creation and providence, <hi>Isa.</hi> 14. 13. 14. neither may we presume to imitate Him in any thing further than His revealed will prescribeth as our duty, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 20. yet, what ever attributes or actions of His have in them any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, or resemblance with any vertue or duty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed unto us, we ought to look upon such, as our copy and pattern to be followed by us: for, he saith, <hi>Be ye followers of God,</hi> with relation to His forgiving them for Christs sake. 3. It is not sufficient to do the same things to others, which God hath done to us, except we endeavour to imitate and follow Him in the way and manner wherein He doth them; So as that we do them not from any base or inferiour motive, or for any wrong end; but from a desire to be conform un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him, and unto what is required of us in the Word by Him: for, this following, and imitating of God here enjoyned, implyeth a purpose and endeavour to conform our selves to Him; <hi>Be ye therefore followers of God.</hi> 4. Gods example in such things as are imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by us, is the only un-erring pattern, to be abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely


<pb n="321" facs="tcp:44180:328"/>
followed, and without any reserve or limitation: and the practice of any other, is to be followed but so far as their example is conincident with Gods Word and practice. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. where <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth them to follow him with an expresse limitation, to wit, as he was a follower of Christ, but here his command is absolute and unlimitted; <hi>Be ye followers of God.</hi> 5. The Lord doth enter into most intimate friendship with, and taketh on most neer relations unto those, whose sins He pardoneth, So that He doth not only free them from deserved wrath, but placeth them among the children, and maketh them adopted sons and daughters unto Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: for, here he calleth them God's <hi>dear children,</hi> of whom He said, chap. 4. 32. that <hi>God had forgiven them for Christs sake.</hi> 6. All those who are dear children to God by adoption, should look upon their highest priviledges, as strongest engagements to duty, and particularly set themselves to imitate Him in the exercise of mercy, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, forgivenesse, and of such other duties as He hath made lovely and amiable by His own example: for, <hi>Paul</hi> maketh their priviledges an engagement to duty, and to imitate God in particular; <hi>Be ye followers of God as dear children.</hi> 7. It is not sufficient that we set our selves to imitate God, except we do it as dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that is, first, humbly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 2. 3. and next, with a kind of naturall affection and propension (for, so do children affect to imitate, and by imitation to please their parents) and not as servants and slaves by compulsion: Hence he saith, <hi>as dear children,</hi> pointing not only at the reason why, but the manner how, they should follow Him.</p>

                  <p>HE doth, next, illustrate yet further that precept given, chap. 4. ver. 32. and joyntly sheweth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were to imitate God, to wit, not only in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,


<pb n="322" facs="tcp:44180:329"/>
but also in loving one another, and so, as they should <hi>walk in love;</hi> whereby is meaned, that all their actions towards their neighbour, ought not only to be good in themselves, but also flow from a principle of love to his good and edification: which duty, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant task of walking in love, is inforced by a new argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken from Christ's example, <hi>who loved us,</hi> and did evidence His love by <hi>giving Himself</hi> freely, and of His own accord <hi>(Job.</hi> 10. 18-) even unto death <hi>for us,</hi> or for our sins, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. which action of Christ is illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, first, from the end for which He did give Himself, even to be a propitiatory sacrifice unto God, for expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the sins of the Elect, as was fore-signified and typified by all those expiatory levitical sacrifices under the Old Testament; whether those, which were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally called by the name of <hi>offering,</hi> under which were comprehended all sacrifices, both of living beasts, and of things destitute of life, as flowre, oyle, frankincense, and such-like; or those, which were more strictly called by the name of <hi>sacrifice,</hi> and were of living beasts, and therefore conjoyned with shedding of bloud, as the word in the original implyeth, which cometh from a root, signifying to kill and slay: hence it is that our crucified Lord doth here get the name both of an <hi>offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>sacrifice.</hi> This action of Christ is illustrated, next, from its fruit and efficacy, to wit, the rendering of God well-pleased with Christ His offering up Himself, and with the persons and performances of true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers for His sake, as sweet smelling odours, by reason of their likenesse unto, and agreement with our spirits, are well-pleasing and satisfying unto such as find them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever duties of mercy and kindnesse we do discharge unto our neighbour, we do not sufficiently imitate God therein, neither perform service acceptable to Him, if they flow not from a principle of love to our neighbours good and edification, and be not directed thereunto, as the great end of our work next to the glory of God: and therefore a man may do many externall


<pb n="323" facs="tcp:44180:329"/>
duties of love, and yet not be accepted of God, when his great aim is to be seen of men, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 2. or to merit heaven by his good works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 31, 32. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inward compassion or affection to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or a sincere aim towards his good: for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle sheweth we do only then rightly imitate God in the duties of kindnesse and love, when all we do, floweth from the inward affection of love, and is from love to our neighbour, directed to his good, while he saith, <hi>walk in love.</hi> 2. Our walking in love to our neighbour, as it is formerly explained, and when it floweth from the fountain of love to God, is an evidence of adoption, and of one who is a dear childe to God: for, having spoken of their near relation to God, as being His dear children, he presently enjoyneth them to make so much evident by their <hi>walking in love.</hi> 3. That God the Father doth pardon the sins of the Elect, having given His Son unto death to purchase pardon for them, doth speak His love unto those whom He doth pardon; and that Jesus Christ did willingly give Himself to death for them doth no lesse speak His unspeakable love unto them also, So that they are equally loved both by the Father and the Son: for, he saith, <hi>as Christ also hath loved us:</hi> the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>also</hi> relateth to the love of the Father in pardoning for Christs sake, whereof he presently spoke. 4. So necessary is love among Christians, together with those many duties which flow from it; So many are the snares and difficulties, which Satan, our own corrupt natures, and our mutual infirmities do create in our way to keep us from it; that God seeth it necessary to propose the love both of the Father and the Son, as two most powerfull adamants to draw our backward hearts up towards it: for, saith he, <hi>Walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us.</hi> 5. As Christs love to lost sinners, being firmly believed, is a strong argument constraining those whom He hath so loved, to walk in love towards others; that being one of the great things required by Him from those whom He loveth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 12. So, this love of


<pb n="324" facs="tcp:44180:330"/>
Christ to us, ought to be a pattern and copy, to which we are to be conformed in our love towards others: and therefore our love ought to be free; for, so was His, <hi>Job.</hi> 15. 16- It ought to be fruitfull; for, so was His, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. it ought to be constant; for so was His, <hi>Job.</hi> 13. 1. it ought to be discreet, not encouraging or humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the person beloved in sin; for so was His, <hi>Matth. 16. 23. And walk in love, as Christ hath loved us,</hi> saith he. 6. Then do we consider the love of Christ aright, and so as to be effectually incited to our duty from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of it, when we look upon it in those effects which flowed from it, and especially in His death and sufferings, and do labour to appropriate by faith the good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of those unto our selves: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> holding forth the love of Christ, as an argument inciting to love one another, doth so look upon it, while he saith, <hi>and hath given Himself for us.</hi> 7. The guilt of sin is so great, as being a breach of Gods most holy Law, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a wrong done against an infinit God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 4. So exact is divine justice in requiring equivalent satisfaction for the wrong done, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. -7. that, as there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling of God with man without satisfaction; So no satisfaction, which man himself, or any meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could give, was sufficient to do the turn: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise there had been no necessity that Christ should have <hi>given Himself for us.</hi> 8. What no meer creature could do, Christ Himself, having taken-on the nature of man, hath done, even given full satisfaction to provoked ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, by giving Himself to suffer both in soul <hi>(Isa.</hi> 53. 10.) and body <hi>(Isa.</hi> 50. 6.) in the Elects stead; so that He is taken, and they go free, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. -8. for, <hi>He gave Himself for us.</hi> 9. The pain and torment both in soul and body, which Christ did give Himself to endure and suffer, was inexpressible, and such, as was fore-signified by what was done with the ancient offerings and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, according to Gods command: some whereof were killed, flayed, and burnt; some rosted, some fryed on coals, and some seethed in pots: All which are but sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows


<pb n="325" facs="tcp:44180:330"/>
of what Christ our Lord endured; for, <hi>He gave Himself an offering and sacrifice.</hi> 10. As those leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call offerings and sacrifices under the Law, were not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to satisfie divine justice for the sins of the Elect; So Jesus Christ, being offered up to God in death, is that only true and reall sacrifice, wherein provoked justice doth rest satisfied, and whereof all those other sacrifices were but types and shadows: for if they had satisfied justice, there had been no necessity of this other sacrifice, which came in their stead, and so was repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by them; <hi>He gave himself an offering and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> 11. Jesus Christ Himself in this offering, was both the Priest, who, as He was God, did offer up Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. and the Sacrifice which was offered, to wit, as He was man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. Yea, and we may add, He was the Altar also whereupon this sacrifice was offered up; the vertue of His God-head being that which not only underpropped His humane nature in suffering, <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 7, 8. but also did adde an infinite value to His sufferings, as being the sufferings of Him who was God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. -28. even as the altar doth sanctifie the gift, <hi>Matth,</hi> 23. 19. for, <hi>He gave himself an offering and sacrifice.</hi> 12. The ransom given by Christ for sinners, was payed unto God whom they had wronged, and not unto Sathan whose slaves we are by nature: although by vertue of that ransom we are freed from Sathans slavery and sins dominion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. for, God the just Judge being satisfied, Sathan the jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and unjust tyrant, did lose his right to keep us long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in bonds; <hi>He gave himself an offering and sacrifice</hi> (not to Sathan, but) <hi>to God,</hi> saith he. 13. As sin doth mak us loathsom and unfavourie to God, and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up His wrath against us; So the sweet savour of this one sacrifice, offered up by Christ, being laid hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon by faith, appeaseth His wrath, and maketh us sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourie and well-pleasing in His sight: for, so much is implyed, while he saith <hi>He gave himself a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour:</hi> a metaphor taken from


<pb n="326" facs="tcp:44180:331"/>
men, who when their senses are offended with some stinking favour, cannot be at quiet until some sweet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume be burnt, which prevaileth above the other: In like manner the noisom smell of our sin, did so move the Lord to wrath, that He would not be at rest, untill the sweet smell of His Sons obedience did come to His no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 24. 14. It is the only sacrifice of Christ, which by its own vertue doth appease the wrath of God, and make both the persons of the Elect, and their spirituall performances acceptable to God: for, <hi>it is a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour.</hi> And though this much be also spoken of other sacrifices, <hi>Gen. 8. 21. Exod.</hi> 29. 41. yet it is to be understood of them, not as they were considered in themselves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1. but as they related to this sacrifice of Christ, whereof they were types, and upon which the godly even then did rely by faith, <hi>Heb. 11. 4. Doct.</hi> 15. Whence it followeth and from the text also, that not only an end is put to all those leviticall sacrifices; (seing Christ this true and reall sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, whereof they were types, is offered up already in death) but also that there is no sacrifice, properly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to be offered up in the Christian Church, neither of any other thing besides Christ, neither is that sacrifice of Christ Himself again to be repeated, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that there is no Priest, properly so called, but Christ alone: for, the Apostle sheweth, this one sacrifice did abundantly pacifie provoked justice, and therefore there is no need of any other: besides that the vertue of it is perpetual, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14, 18. and so it needeth not to be reiterated; <hi>A sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour.</hi>

of which vices are in the outward actions, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in this verse. 1. <hi>Fornication,</hi> or the sin of filthinesse, between parties, both free from the yoke of marriage, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 2. a sin looked upon as a thing indifferent, and no sin among the Gentiles, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 12. 2.

True Christian-love unto our neighbour, whereby we endeavour his preservation and good in his honour, person, chastity, outward estate and good name, <hi>(Rom.</hi> 13. 9.) doth hugely differ from fleshly love flowing from lust, and from the love of the world, whereby we seek to satisfie our own sinfull lusts, with our neighbours hurt: for, the former was enjoyned, ver. 2. but the latter is here forbidden; <hi>But fornication, and all uncleannesse, or covetousnesse, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The generall prevalency of any sin, ought neither to make people give more way to it, nor Ministers speak lesse against it; but rather, because, the more common any sin is, God get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the more dishonour by it; therefore the zeal of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ministers and private Christians ought to be so much the more intended against it: for, because forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was so common among the Gentiles, that it was hereby looked upon as no sin, therefore doth <hi>Paul,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in all his Epistles to the Churches of the Gentiles, fall upon it, as he doth also here; <hi>But fornication, and all uncleannesse, &amp;c.</hi> 3. So violent is the lust of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that, if it be not all the more carefully guarded


<pb n="328" facs="tcp:44180:332"/>
against, there is no state of life, wherein it will not break forth, even although the ordinary mean of marriage appointed by God to prevent it (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 2.) be used: for, he will have them to guard not only against fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is the sin of filthinesse between parties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married, but also against <hi>all uncleannesse,</hi> that is, all other sorts of filthy lusts, whereof filthinesse between married parties is one. 4. There is a great affinity and sibnesse between the lusts of filthinesse and covetousnesse; in so far, as the former, given way to, doth necessitate the lascivious wretch to thirst after, and by indirect means to purchase worldly goods, that so he may have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to uphold, (as his other lusts, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 3. so) in a speciall manner this lust of uncleannesse: for, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he forbid those two lusts joyntly; <hi>But fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all uncleannesse, or covetousnesse.</hi> 5. It is not sufficient for Saints to abstain from the outward practice of grosse evils, except their outward abstinence do flow from inward detestation of them; otherwise, outward abstinence may well make a good Civilian, but not a sincere Christian: for, <hi>Paul</hi> will have them abstaining from the formentioned evils, so as not to name them with delight, and without detestation; <hi>Let it not be once named among you.</hi> 6. Not only the outward act of filthinesse, but also lascivious filthy discourse, is to be refrained from, as that, which is an evidence of inward love to that sin, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 34. and maketh way for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward committing of it, not only by our selves, while the inward flame of lust is blown up by the bellows of filthy speeches, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 6. but also by others, who are easily infected by the pestilentious breath of evil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 33. for, he will not have those evils so much as spoken of among them with delight and without detestation; <hi>Let it not be once named among you.</hi> 7. The only life beseeming Saints, is to keep themselves pure in heart, in tongue, in hand, from the pollutions of fleshly lusts, and the immoderate love of worldly goods: and in so far, as those are given way to by professed


<pb n="329" facs="tcp:44180:332"/>
Saints, they walk unworthy of their high and heavenly calling; do stain their profession; and declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unworthy of the name of Saints: for, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that not practising those evils, and inward detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, made evident by their not speaking of them, was such a carriage as <hi>becometh Saints.</hi>

                  <p>IN this verse he forbiddeth other three vices, which belong mainly to the tongue. 1. <hi>Filthinesse,</hi> whereby is meaned, in general, whatsoever is contrary to decency and Christian gravity or modesty, whether in deeds, words, or outward gesture and adorning of the body: for, so the word is used, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 6. But here, because this sin and the rest are opposed to giving of thanks, it seemeth to be restricted to filthy speaking, or speaking of those things which belong to the lust of uncleannesse. 2. <hi>Foolish talking,</hi> which, as being contradistinct to the vice which goeth before, and to that which followeth after, doth comprehend all impertinent, superfluous, rash and roving discourse, which doth rather bewray the speakers folly and indiscretion, than any way edifie the hearers, though it be neither filthy speaking, nor sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrick jesting. 3. <hi>Jesting:</hi> the word in the originall, is somtimes taken in a good sense, and so it signifieth a dexterity in allaying (when it is necessary so to do) the too much severity of countenance and discourse with a quick and honest sport, for begetting honest recreation and moderate laughter; that thereby the mind may be the more fitted to go about serious things in a serious manner, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 3. 4. Such honest and sometimes pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ironies we find used by holy men in Scripture, 1 <hi>King. 18. 27. Phil.</hi> 3. -2. But here it is taken in an evil sense for scurrility, when men do make it their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise to shew the sharpnesse of their wit in jesting, and


<pb n="330" facs="tcp:44180:333"/>
to beget not moderate recreation of spirit in order to their fitting for a more serious purpose, but immoderate laughter, and carnall mirth in the hearers: and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, when, in order to this end, they spare not offensive jests by tart reflections upon the way, gesture, yea, and personall imperfections of others; nor yet profane and impious jests, by wresting Scripture to expresse the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of their light and wanton wits: now, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle forbiddeth all those three, because they are <hi>not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,</hi> or beseeming to Saints, so that this reason is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incident with the former, ver. 3. And in opposition to all those, he recommendeth unto them for their mutuall cheering, and edifying one another by discourse when they should meet, rather to recount what favours they had received from God, and to blesse Him for them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As there are many wayes by which a man may transgresse with his tongue; so we ought to guard against all transgressions of that kind: not only those, which naturall reason would blush to patronize, but others also, which are pleaded-for by many, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended as laudable strains of a quick wit: for, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth not only <hi>filthinesse,</hi> but also <hi>foolish talking and jesting.</hi> 2. Satan and corrupt nature do take advantage of mens naturall temper and inclination, even of that, which in it self is not sinfull, thereby to stir them to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courses to get their inclination satisfied: for, from this sociable temper and inclination in men to entertain one another by discourse, he taketh advantage to put them upon those sins of <hi>filthy speaking, foolish talking and jesting.</hi> 3. It is a task of no small difficulty to keep within the bounds of lawfull and allowed mirth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, especially in recreating our spirits by pleasant and delightfull discourse, so that we exceed not either in matter or manner; considering that what is inoffensive at one time and place, and to some persons, may be irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating and offensive at, and to others: for, therefore it seemeth the Apostle designeth this vice in speech by that name, which (as I shew) agreeth also to that which


<pb n="331" facs="tcp:44180:333"/>
is lawfull and allowed, implying, that in this particular there is an easie passage from what is allowed to that which is forbidden; <hi>And jesting,</hi> saith he. 4. It is not sufficient for Ministers to forbid and reprove sins under such and such general heads; but, seing people either through ignorance cannot, or wickednesse will not see, or lazinesse care not to see the evil of severall particular sins contained under those generall heads; therefore they are bound in their reproofs and prohibitions to fall upon the particular branches and instances of that evill, which they speak against: for, the Apostle, chap. 4. ver. 29. having spoken against corrupt communication in the general, doth here enumerate three distinct branches of that evill; <hi>filthy speaking, foolish talking, and jesting.</hi> 5. Called Saints and Christians should be so tender in walking, as that they scare not only at those evils which are palpably grosse and cryed-out against by all; but also at every other thing which is unbeseeming their profession, or inconvenient and disadvantagious to the Gospel or their own peace: for, the Apostle disswadeth from those sins upon this ground, that they <hi>are not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</hi> 6. A choice remedy against filthy speaking, foolish talking, jesting, and other sins in our ordinary communication, is, to have our hearts alwayes keeped so sensible of Gods goodnesse, and so desirous to expresse what sense we have thereof unto others, that, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever occasion offereth, we may gladly lay hold on that subject rather than on any other, and thereby provoke others to do the like: for, so we should not be necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated (as oft-times in a kind we are) to fall upon sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, vain and idle communication through penury and want of better purpose: hence the Apostle, as a remedy against the fore-mentioned evils, prescribeth <hi>giving of thanks.</hi> 7. There is not any case incident to a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, but if he search throughly, there will be found some ground for thanksgiving and rejoycing, though not in himself, yet in Gods dealing with him, whether for mercies bestowed, or judgments not inflicted, <hi>Philip.</hi>


                     <pb n="332" facs="tcp:44180:334"/>
2. 27. for, while <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth them to exercise themselves, and cheer up one another with giving of thanks in stead of foolish talking and jesting, he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneth there will be alwayes reason of thanksgiving; <hi>But rather giving of thanks.</hi> 8. Though Saints may, and are bound sometimes, and in some cases to confesse their faults one to another, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 16. and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may regrate their spiritual losses and decay; yea, and may also speak of what concerneth their worldly affairs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 38. Yet, it is not only most seemly, but also a thriving way for the inward man, not to dwell alwayes upon heartlesse regrates for what they want; but to adde, at least, a mixture of chearfull acknowledgement of what they already have, giving hearty thanks to God for it: for, as the Apostle doth not astrict them only to giving of thanks in their conference and discourse; So he doth recommend it, as the choicest subject to be most frequently insisted on: <hi>But rather giving of thanks.</hi>

This argument is further strengthened by joyning ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the by with it; while he deterreth them from one of the fore-mentioned evils, to wit, <hi>covetousnesse,</hi> by calling the covetous man an Idolater; because he setteth his prime affections of love and confidence upon riches, 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 16.

Hence, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. So strong is the interest of sin, even in the best; and so violent are those tentations especially, which drive men towards the fulfilling of their fleshly lusts, That although a man be convinced of the great evil which is in them, and the losse of heaven which doth follow upon his living in them; yet there is no small hazard, when such tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are presented, of yeelding to them: for he taketh it for granted they knew the hazard of living in those sins, and yet doth see it necessary to set them on their guard against them; for, <hi>this ye know, that no whoremonger, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The Lords servants are not to flatter people in any beloved sin, upon pretence of rendering them thereby more tractable and obedient in other things; but must discover the evil of all sin, excepting none, though it were never so generally practised, yea, and pleaded-for by those to whom they preach: for, this sin of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, chiefly of fornication, was commonly practised


<pb n="334" facs="tcp:44180:335"/>
and pleaded-for as no sin among the Gentiles; yet <hi>Paul,</hi> at his first preaching the Gospel to those Ephesians, had spoken against it, and convinced them of the ill which is in it: Hence, he saith so confidently; <hi>for this ye know, that no whoremonger—hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ.</hi> 3. As this doth highly aggreage a sin, that it is committed against our knowledge; So the moe and weightier aggravations that any sin is liable unto, when it is committed, we ought to be the more deterred from the committing of it; for, he mindeth them of their knowing the danger that would follow upon those sins, hereby implying, their guilt would be the more weighty, if they should commit them, that so they might be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from them; <hi>For this ye know, that no whoremonger, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Prohibitions and threatnings denounced in Scripture against any grosse externall sin, are to be extended unto all the causes, means, occasions and appearances of that sin, and provocations to it: for, this threatning against whoredom and uncleannesse, is to be applied unto filthy speaking, foolish talking and jesting (as being either causes, occasions, appearances of, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations unto those) otherwise the threatning would not be of force to presse the former dehortation in its full latitude: <hi>No whoremonger, nor unclean person—hath any inheritance.</hi> 5. The doolfull sad event, and dreadfull consequence of sin, would be seriously represented by Christ's servants unto the Lords people, and by people to their own conscience; there being nothing of greater force to cool the vehement heat of sinfull lusts, than the frequent and serious consideration of their dreadful issue: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> to scare them from fornication and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, presenteth unto them the event of all such work, even losse of heaven and happinesse; <hi>No whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger-hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ.</hi> 6. The reign of sin in the heart, cannot consist with true grace and a right to heaven; and therefore the truely regenerate, in whom the seed of God abideth, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so far left of God, as that sin should reign in them,


<pb n="335" facs="tcp:44180:335"/>
and they give willing obedience to it with the full swey and consent of the heart: There must be alwayes a party acting for God in some degree lesse or more within them, at least not consenting to act against Him, even when they are at the worst, and possibly overcome with some grosse tentation: in which respect, they cannot be the whoremonger, unclean or covetous person here spoken of, to wit, one in whom such sins reign: for, saith he, none such <hi>have any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ.</hi> He speaketh of somewhat which they presently want, and others have, which must be a right to the Kingdom of glory, or a present portion in the Kingdom of grace. 7. To whatsoever a man doth give that outward or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worship and service, which is only due to God, that thing, though it were never so base, is that man's god, who is thereby rendered guilty of Idolatry, and of giving divine worship unto a false God, though he think not so: for, the covetous man is called an Idolater, and consequently riches are his god; because he setteth his prime affections of love and confidence upon them in that measure which is only due to God; <hi>Nor covetous man who is an Idolater.</hi> 8. There is no accesse for lost sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners unto the Kingdom of God in glory, but by Jesus Christ the Mediator, who is the way, the truth and the life, and without whom none cometh unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6. for, it is <hi>the Kingdom of Christ and of God:</hi> Christ is first named, because we make entrance by Him in this Kingdom.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle, in this verse, doth, first, give them a watchword to guard against the suggestions of any who would labour to perswade them, that either the practices reproved were no sins at all, or at least not so dangerous, as he affirmed; and calleth all such sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions

See upon chap. 2. ver. 3. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The servants of Jesus Christ, ought to be through and serious in the reproof of sin, not doing the work of the Lord negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, or by halfs: they must not only start and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver those sins, which the Lord's people are in hazard to be surprized with, and to lay open the dangerous, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and doolfull consequences of living in them; but also pursue them through all the lurking holes and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfuges of specious pretences and fecklesse excuses, under which they use to lurk, untill no place of refuge be left for them in peoples hearts: for, so doth <hi>Paul,</hi> having forbidden those evils, and shown the dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of living in them, he striketh off at one word the fig-tree leaves of all such vain excuses, whereby sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners use to plead for them; <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words,</hi> saith he, 2. So corrupt and fleshly are we by nature, that, we are not only prone and bent to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sin, but also ingenious and witty to excuse and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate our sin, and thereby to seduce our own hearts into a belief that either sin is no sin, or that we shall be free of judgment, though we live in sin: for, those who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to deceive others this way, by making them think light of sin, do first deceive themselves; <hi>Let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you with vain words,</hi> saith he. 3. It is the usuall course and strain of those who have given themselves over unto the slavery of sin, to use the utmost of their wit and endeavours to draw on others to do the like, and


<pb n="337" facs="tcp:44180:336"/>
for this end to deceive them, by making them believe that sins are but petty slips, small escapes, humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, that God's patience suffereth all things, that His grace pardoneth every thing, that no man can be perfect, and the rarest Saints have fallen in as great faults, and such like vain words, which the Apostle doth here guard against; <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words.</hi> 4. All such opinions and reasonings as tend to cast a covering over sin, to extenuate and hide the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of it, and the terrour of judgment belonging to it, are but vain, even spiders webs, sandy foundations, fig-tree leaves, untempered morter, and will in end but mock all those who listen to them: for, so doth the Apostle affirm of them, <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words.</hi> 5. Though we are to fear and avoid sin princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, because it is sin, and displeasing to God, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poning there were no hell nor punishment due to sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. -9. yet, we may and ought in the second place fear and abstain from it, because it draweth down Gods wrath and judgement: for, he holdeth forth the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Gods wrath as an argument to scare them from those sins; for, <hi>because of these things cometh the wrath.</hi> 6. The terrible threatnings denounced in Scripture against such and such sinners, some where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of declare the sinners exclusion from heaven, and others his unspeakable torment in hell, are verified not in all, who have once or often fallen in any such sins, but in those only, who have hardened themselves in them, rejecting all admonitions to the contrary, and do remain obstinate and impenitent untill death: for he expoundeth whom he meaneth by the whoremongers, whom he threatned, ver. 5. even <hi>children of disobedience,</hi> that is, such as remain obstinate, and will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, as the word rendered <hi>disobedience</hi> doth signifie. 7.

As the Lord doth of purpose inflict most memorable judgements upon obstinate sinners, even in this life; that thereby, as by one mean amongst many other, He may teach and instruct His own called children to beware of their sins; So, then do we make right use of Gods judgements upon such godlesse sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, when we are not idle spectators of them, as if we were not concerned in them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 2, 3. or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murers against the severity of Gods justice manifested in them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 41. but do take up the voice of those rods, as speaking unto, and pressing upon our selves the exercise of repentance and tender walking, in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining from such like sins, for which they are smitten: for, from what he spoke of Gods wrath coming upon the children of disobedience, he inferreth this as a most native use, <hi>Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</hi> 2.

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 8. For ye were sometimes darknesse, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light,</head>
                  <p>IN this verse, there is, first, an argument to enforce the former dehortation, taken from that blessed change which was wrought in them from darknesse to light, <hi>they were once darknesse:</hi> whereby is meaned their estate before conversion: And it comprehendeth under it, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God, and of the way to heaven, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. -8. a godlesse and profane life, flowing from a wicked and unrenewed heart, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. -6. together with subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto all miseries and calamities following upon the former, and especially to the wrath and curse of God: for, a sad disconsolate case goeth under the name of <hi>dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Amos</hi> 5. 18, 20. This is the state, under the which they once were, and all unregenerate men yet are: they are in all those respects, not only dark, but <hi>darknesse</hi> in the abstract, as having nothing of the contrary light in them. But they were <hi>now light:</hi> whereby is meaned that estate wherein they now were, being converted, which is opposed to their former estate of darknesse, and comprehendeth under it the saving knowledge of God


<pb n="340" facs="tcp:44180:338"/>
in Christ, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 1, 2. a life conform to Gods Law, which shineth forth in the rayes and beams of good works, as a light unto others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 16. together with deliverance from Gods wrath, and restitution to His fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, with joy, peace, and filiall confidence flowing from the sense of those: for, a lightsome and comfortable case goeth usually under the name of light, <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 28. This is the state, wherein the truely regenerate are; They are in all those respects not only lightsome, splendid and shining, but <hi>light</hi> in the abstract, not as if there were no darknesse in them at all, 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 8. Act.</hi> 14. 22. for, in that respect only God Himself is light, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 5. but because they are so <hi>in the Lord,</hi> to wit, Christ, (chap. 4, 5.) as he here declareth, who not only is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser and worker of that measure of the light of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, holinesse, and of joy and peace following there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, which the regenerate do already enjoy, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9. but also His most perfect light of righteousnesse, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wisdom and redemption, is imputed to them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. so that the dregs and remainders of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and corruption in themselves, are not laid to their charge, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 21. The Apostle, next, from this argument, doth infer the affirmative of the former ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative precept, ver. 7. to wit, that therefore they should <hi>walk as children of the light,</hi> that is, answerably unto that blessed state of light, to which they were called, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now children of light, that is, not only born of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 29. (who is that light unaccessible, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 16.) by the preaching of the word, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 18. which is called <hi>light, Psal.</hi> 119. 105. but also were endued with the light of knowledge and holinesse: In which respect, those, who are endued with wisdom, are called children of wisdom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. -19. Hence, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It concerneth those, in whom God hath wrought any saving change, as to be reflecting frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon that miserable estate wherein they once were; So to look upon it under that variety of notions and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, whereby it is expressed in Scripture; there


<pb n="341" facs="tcp:44180:338"/>
being not any one expression so comprehensive, or simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude so far extended, as to point out all the dool, wo and misery which is in it, and that hereby the heart may be the more sensibly affected with it: for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle hath now severall times in this Epistle represented it to their view, and at every time almost under a different notion and similitude; the latter alwayes expressing somewhat, which was not reached by the former. See chap. 2. ver. 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 19. and chap. 4. ver. 17, 18, 19. And here again, he mindeth them of it under the name of <hi>darknesse; for, ye were sometimes dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> 2. The childe of God ought so to remember what he once by nature was, as not to question, far lesse deny, but confidently avow what he now by grace is: and that because not only the joynt consideration of both, maketh them shine forth more clearly in their own colours; but also our fixing our eye upon the former, without avowing the latter, doth breed discouragement, unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and in progresse of time heartlesse dispare of an outgate from the wofull state wherein we apprehend our selves yet to be: for, the Apostle representeth to their view both those joyntly; <hi>Ye were sometimes darknesse, but now ye are light.</hi> 3. Believers can never attain to read the happinesse of their present state through grace, so long as they fix their eye only upon what they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: nor yet untill they consider what they are in Christ, and by vertue of that fulnesse of perfections in Him, which not only floweth forth to them in the streams according to their measure, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 16. but also is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to them in the fountain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 21. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may be looked upon by them as their own; for, although he calleth them <hi>darknesse</hi> absolutely, and in themselves; yet <hi>they are light,</hi> not in themselves, <hi>but in the Lord Christ.</hi> 4. Our former darknesse of ignorance and profanity, wherein we have for a long time lived, is so far from being an argument to make us continue in our former wofull course; that on the contrary, we ought from the consideration thereof be incited to take


<pb n="342" facs="tcp:44180:339"/>
up our selves and live more tenderly for the time to come; seing the time past of our life may suffice usto have walked in a godlesse course, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 3. for, <hi>Paul</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this an argument, why they should not any longer partake with obstinate sinners in their godlesse course: <hi>for,</hi> saith he, <hi>ye were sometimes darknesse.</hi> 5. Neither long continuance in sin already, even to wearinesse, nor yet any conviction of the shame and dammage which do attend it, are sufficient to make a man abandon and quit it throughly, except there be a gracious change wrought in him, chiefly as to his inward state, from that which he sometimes was: for, he mentioneth this gracious change of their inward state, as that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the strength of the present argument doth ly, whereby he would disswade them from being partakers with them; <hi>for ye were sometimes darknesse, but now are ye light in the Lord.</hi> 6. As all spirituall priviledges in generall, are bestowed upon us, that we may improve them, both for our comfort, and also for enabling and inciting to duty; So the more we enjoy of light, whether external light in preaching of the Word, or the internal light of knowledge in the mind, we ought to improve it the more by walking according to that light; else our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation shall be greater, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18. for, from their priviledge of being <hi>light in the Lord,</hi> he inferreth <hi>walk as children of light.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, in way of parenthesis, doth give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the former consequence, or why their being <hi>now light in the Lord</hi> did bind them <hi>to walk as children of light;</hi> and consequently, not to partake with obstinate sinners in their sin: and withall, sheweth wherein that walking doth consist. The reason is taken from the new creature and habits of grace in the heart, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Rom. 7. 25. Gal.</hi> 5. 22. and are


<pb n="343" facs="tcp:44180:339"/>
the same with the light of grace by the Spirit of God, spoken of, ver. 8. Now, he sheweth the fruit of this light, or of those gracious habits, consisteth in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of all Christian vertues, which are here summed up in three, 1. <hi>Goodnesse,</hi> whereby we are inclined to communicate what good is in us for the advantage of our neighbour, both in his spirituall (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 10.) and bodily <hi>(Gal.</hi> 6. 10.) estate. 2. <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we deal righteously in all our transactions with others. And, 3. <hi>Truth,</hi> whereby we carry our selves sincerely, being free from error, hypocrisie, or dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, whether towards God or men. So the force of the argument cometh to this, Such a walking as he did enjoyn, was the native fruit and result of their being made light in the Lord by the Spirit of God; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were obliged to it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the duty of Christs Ministers, not only to presse upon the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the practice of holinesse in generall, but also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend upon, and accordingly to presse the exercise of those particular vertues both to God and men, wherein holinesse doth consist; otherwise people will readily place most of holinesse in those things wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth least, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 23. for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having exhorted them to walk as children of the light, doth here shew wherein that walking doth consist, even <hi>in all goodnesse, and righteousnesse, and truth.</hi> 2. None can walk as a childe of light, or practise those duties wherein such a walk consisteth, in a way acceptable to God, but he who is a childe of light, truely regenerate, and acteth from a principle of grace in the heart. Whatever flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from an unrenewed heart, how specious soever, is but a shadow, and imperfect imitation of the childe of light in this christian walk, as an ape would imitate a man, or a violent motion doth resemble that which is natural, and floweth from an inward principle: for, he sheweth the exercise of goodnesse, righteousnesse, and truth, wherein our walking as a childe of light consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is the fruit of the Spirit, or of the root of grace in


<pb n="444" facs="tcp:44180:340"/>
the heart, wrought by the Spirit of God; <hi>For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, &amp;c.</hi> 3. As it concerneth Christians to walk suitably unto their state and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; So they would seriously consider, in order to their walking thus, that holinesse of life is the native fruit and result of their being in a gracious state, or of the work of grace in the heart; and therefore, that they are not only obliged to lead an holy life in way of duty and gratitude, but a necessity also doth ly upon them to it, if so they be renewed, and as they would not evidence themselves to be yet in their unrenewed state: for, having exhorted them to walk as children of light, or suitably to the state of grace, he inforceth the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, by shewing, that such a walking is the native fruit and necessary result of being in such a state; <hi>For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodnesse, &amp;c.</hi> 4. A facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and easinesse to communicate what is in us for our neighbours good and advantage, doth well consist with the exercise of righteousnesse, whereby we give every man his due, and do require of him what is our due from him: for, he conjoyneth the exercise of those two, while he saith <hi>the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodnesse, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</hi> 5. As the grace of sincerity and freedom from dissimulation and hypocrisie, is a necessary ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient in the exercise of all other vertues; So our walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing answerably unto that state of light, unto which we are called, must be extended unto duties of all sorts: not only to duties of goodnesse and righteousnesse towards our neighbour, but also to duties towards God, so as we imbrace those Truths, which He holdeth forth in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without all mixture of Error, yea, and take Him for our party in every duty, as being the only judge of our sincerity; for, he saith, <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is in all goodnesse, and righteousnesse, and truth.</hi>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 10. Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</head>
                  <p>BEfore the Apostle use any moe arguments to inforce the former precept, he doth, first, resume and explain the precept it self. And, first, he explaineth the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative part thereof, by giving one direction, necessary to be practised by those who would walk as children of light, even that by diligent search and enquiry they prove and try according to God's will revealed in His Word, <hi>(Isa.</hi> 8. 20.) what is acceptable, and well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing unto Him in every step of their way. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is no walking as a childe of light, or suitably unto that gracious state to which we are called, except we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our selves, not unto this world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. or to what may bring about our own advantage, and so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our lusts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 29. but unto what is acceptable to God, and prescribed unto us as the rule of duty in His Word: for, this proving of what is acceptable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him, is required not for it self, or to rest thereon, but to regulate our practice accordingly; (See ver. 11. doct. 1.) and is called-for as a necessary concomitant of walking like children of light, as is clear from the grammatical construction, according to which this verse is to be joyned with the close of the eighth; so that it runneth thus, <hi>Walk as children of the light—proving what is acceptable.</hi> 2. We cannot conform our selves unto what is acceptable to the Lord, and consequently cannot walk as children of light, except we make a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious search and enquiry into the rule of duty and acceptation revealed in the Word, yea, and do what we do, that we may come up to that rule: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we walk not acceptably, when either we do things rashly without deliberation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 2. or doubtingly after deliberation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. yea, nor when the thing done, is in it self right and acceptable, but we do it not from that ground, but to gratifie our own lusts. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 2. or the lusts of others, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. - 10. for, in order to


<pb n="346" facs="tcp:44180:341"/>
this walking, he requireth them <hi>to prove what is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Lord,</hi> as the rule by which they were to walk. 3. It is not sufficient to make this inquiry in order to some few and weighty actions of our life, but in order to all, whether of greater or lesser concernment, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advantage or losse may probably follow upon our conforming of our selves unto this rule: for, the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is indefinit without any limitation or restriction unto this action, or that; and therefore it ought to be extended unto all; <hi>Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</hi> 4. The finding out of what is acceptable unto the Lord, especially in some intricate cases, is not easily attained: there must be an accurate search, together with an excercising our selves in the practice of those things, which we already know to be acceptable, that so we may experimentally know them to be such, and get our knowledge bettered in those things, whereof we are yet ignorant, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 17. for, the word rendred <hi>proving,</hi> signifieth an accurate proof, not so much by argument as by trial and experience, as gold is tried in the fire, <hi>Iam. 1. 12. Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>HE explaineth, next, the negative part of the former precept, as it was expressed, ver. 7. First, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging them to be accessory (any of those wayes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ver. 7. doct. 3.) to the sins of wicked men, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led here <hi>works of darknesse,</hi> because they flow usually from the darknesse of ignorance, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 17. and are the works of unrenewed men, who are nothing but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, (See ver. 8.) are contrary to the light of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 20. and are usually committed in the dark, the very actors being ashamed to do them openly, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 7. and because they bring those, who live and die in them without repentance, unto utter darknesse, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 30. They are also called <hi>unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full


<pb n="347" facs="tcp:44180:341"/>
works;</hi> because they not only bring no advantage unto those who do commit them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21. but also much hurt and dammage, even the wages of sin, which is death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. Next, by commanding them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove convincingly those works of darknesse, and the parties guilty of them, and this, though chiefly by their contrary good works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. yet not only by those, but also by the word of admonition and reproof, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 5. as occasion should offer, and Gods glory with the edification of their neighbour should seem unto spiritual prudence to call for it. Besides what is already observed from a parallel place, ver. 7. doct. 1. hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Then do we make an approven search and enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what is acceptable unto the Lord, when we do not satisfie our selves with the naked knowledge of what He approveth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 18. nor yet do only labour to defend by force of reason, or sufferings, what we find to be truth after search against gain-sayers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2, 3. but do also make it the rule of practice, by practising or for bearing accordingly: for, the Apostle, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them, ver. 10. <hi>to prove what is acceptable unto the Lord,</hi> doth here enjoyn them to abstain from that which they could not but by searching find to be displeasing to Him, while he saith, <hi>and have no fellowship with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull works of darknesse.</hi> 2. Though we are not simply, and in all cases to abstain from the fellowship of wicked men, but may freely converse with such of them, as we are bound unto, either by the law of necessity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 120. 5, 6. or by any civil, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18.) religious, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 12.) or natural bond, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 1, 2. yet, no ty of that kind doth give us warrant to partake with them in their sins; and therefore we are to eschew all unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and voluntary fellowship and familiarity with them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 26. 4. lest thereby we be drawn to walk in their wayes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 24, 25. and they be hardened in their evil course, and kept from being ashamed, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 14. for, he forbiddeth absolutely all fellowship with them in their sins, and consequently whatever may bring


<pb n="348" facs="tcp:44180:342"/>
us under that hazard, if so it can be eschewed, without the neglect of any other duty; <hi>And have no fellowship with the unfruitfull works of darknesse.</hi> 3. We ought to look upon sin in its blackest colours of shame, digrace, losse of our time, strength, and of all other expence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed upon it, together with the dammage both here, and hereafter, which followeth upon it, and lay aside the consideration of those pleasant deceitfull baits, which Satan doth busk it with to make it more taking; that so we may be the more deterred from it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> giveth sin a name implying all those and much more, that the very name given to it may scare them from it, while he calleth it <hi>the unfruitful works of darknesse.</hi> 4. Though the command enjoyning to reprove the sins of others, be an affirmative precept, and therefore not binding unto all, with relation to all persons, at all times, and in all cases, and Christ Himself forbiddeth to cast the pearl of precious reproof before dogs or swine, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6. that is, such who mock the word of admonition, or prove more inraged by it, whom we are to reprove, not so much by conversing with them, or by speaking to them, as by fleeing from them; yet as to others, our not reproving of their sin, when occasion offereth, and Gods glory with their edification seemeth to call for it, is a sinfull partaking with them in their sin: for, having discharged them to have fellowship with the works of darknesse, he subjoyneth, <hi>but rather reprove them,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that otherwise they would have fellowship with them. 5. Though this duty of labouring to reclaim others from sin by convincing reproofs, whether in words, or in the contrary work, ought mainly to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged unto such as have nearest relation to us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. -4. or whom we have a more speciall charge of, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 12. or whom we are most intimate with in spirituall bonds and fellowship, 1 <hi>Thessal.</hi> 5. 14. yet we are not to neglect this duty towards others, who stand not under such near relations to us, no not to those, concerning whom we have strong grounds

to fear that they are yet unrenewed, and enemies in their hearts to Jesus Christ, so long, at least, as all hopes of prevailing with them by that mean are not cut off, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 16. for, he commandeth them here to reprove the sins even of unrenewed Pagans, called therefore <hi>the unfruitfull works of darknesse; but rather reprove them,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>HE doth now confirm the precept thus explained; and, first, he inforceth the disswasive, <hi>from having fellowship with the unfruitfull works of darknesse,</hi> by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument taken from the abominable filthinesse of those sins which the wicked Pagans committed in secret, that they might eschew publick shame, which was such, that it was a shame even to speak of them, or to hear them spoken of, leaving them to gather, it was much more shamefull to act them, or to be any wayes accessory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the acting of them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There should be such an holy bashfulnesse in converted Christians, as to think shame in speech to utter, at least without detestation, those things, which godlesse sinners are not so much ashamed to practise: and especially Ministers in their publick preachings would be very modest and sparing in the deciphering of filthy sins, lest they thereby defile their own tongues, offend the ears of some, and do teach others how to commit that sin, which they pretend to reprove: for, <hi>Paul</hi> giveth this as a reason not only why they should not communicate with the unfruitfull works of darknesse, but also why he did not make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse mention of those works in particular; <hi>for it is a shame even to speak of those things,</hi> saith he. 2. As all conscience of right and wrong, together with fear and shame following upon doing wrong, be not fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct in the unrenewed man; So those small remainders, are not effectuall to restrain them from what is wrong, but being over-powered with prevalent Atheism, do give them full liberty to act abominable wickednesse, if so


<pb n="350" facs="tcp:44180:343"/>
they can hide it from the eyes of men, without any effectuall restraint from the all-seeing eye of God: for, conscience of the dishonesty, which was in those un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull works of darknesse, made them eschew the eyes of men, but notwithstanding they committed them in secret; <hi>for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</hi> 3.

So when men do not seek the vail of secrecy to cover their sins, but do glory in their shame, and dare with <hi>Absolom, (2 Sam.</hi> 16. 22.) commit those sins openly, and before the sun, which very common honesty, and a naturall instinct would seek to cover; it speaketh a man more corrupt than the very grossest of Pagans, who hath put out-the very common principles of naturall honesty, and made his own conscience dead and senslesse, so that he knoweth not shame, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. -<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>HE doth, next, enforce the exhortation to reprove those works of darknesse, first, by an argument taken from one excellent use of admonition and reproof, while he sheweth that those secret sins of wicked most being <hi>reproved,</hi> are <hi>by the light,</hi> whether of Gods Word in the mouth of the reprover or of his holy life, <hi>made manifest</hi> in their black and ugly colours, to wit, not so much unto others, as unto the actors and authors of them. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24. Next, by proving that the light of reproof attaineth this end from the nature of light, which is to make all things that are within its reach,


<pb n="351" facs="tcp:44180:343"/>
manifest and conspicuous; for, the words in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall do read better thus, <hi>for light is that which manifesteth all things. Doct.</hi> 1. The discovery and conviction of sin in its vilenesse, is of necessary and profitable use unto the sinner; as being the first step towards contrition, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 36. with 37. and consequently to faith in Jesus Christ and repentance unto life, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 37. with 38. for, he maketh this an excellent use of reproof, and that which should be aimed at by the reprover, even that sin be made manifest in its vilenesse to the sinner; <hi>for all things that are reproved, are made manifest.</hi> 2. It is not a naked sight and knowledge that sin is sin, and in some measure shamefull, which is of any great use to the sinner, but a sight of it in its vilest colours, as it is a breach of Gods most holy Law, enmity against the great God, and a bringer down of Gods eternall wrath: for, those heathens had some knowledge of sin, and of the shame was in it, and therefore they did run to secret with it: and yet he speaketh here of a further discovery, and manifestation of it by the light of reproof, which was usefull and necessary; <hi>All things that are reproved, are made manifest.</hi> 3. The Lord doth sometimes blesse not only publick preaching, but also the word of reproof in the mouth of private Christians, and the example of their holy life, for making godlesse sinners take occasion thence to reflect upon themselves, and therein, as in a glasse, to see the filthy vilenesse of their beloved sins, and to judge themselves for them; for, he saith, <hi>All things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light,</hi> to wit, the light of verball, or reall reproof, held forth, even by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Christians: for, he doth not speak here to Ministers only. 4. The probable good, which God may bring about to the party reproved by the means of our reproof, should have more of weight to incite us towards the making conscience of this duty, than the feared incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to our selves, arising from the parties displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, should have to scare us from it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> will have us to set upon this dutie, because of our neighbour's


<pb n="352" facs="tcp:44180:344"/>
good, which probably will be brought about by it: <hi>reprove them,</hi> saith he; <hi>For all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light.</hi> 5. As there is no duty, of the successe whereof we use to be more diffident than that of reproving the sins of others; So there is not any duty, the successe whereof we have better ground to be perswaded of, even than of this, that discovery of sin to the sinners conscience, either to his conversion or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obduration, shall follow upon a timeous and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided reproof: for, he proveth that this effect shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon reproof as natively as the discovery of things dark and hid doth follow upon light; <hi>for that is light,</hi> saith he, <hi>which discovereth all things.</hi>

                  <p>HEre is a second argument to enforce the duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving those unfruitfull works of darknesse, which also confirmeth the former, to wit, that by reproving them they should be made manifest. The argument is taken from Gods own example, who in His Word doth reprove the world of sin, and thereby conveyeth the light of Jesus Christ unto them, as the Apostle proveth, by shewing what is Gods great work and design through His whole Word, whereof this verse is a short sum, though it seemeth more particularly to relate unto <hi>Isa.</hi> 60. ver. 1. 2. from which this place is thought to be cited, with some variation in the words, but none in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Which design is threefold: The first branch whereof, is here implyed, even to convince all unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed men especially, how wofull and dangerous their present case is, and that it is a spirituall sleep and death. 1. A <hi>sleep,</hi> because the carnall man hath all his spirituall senses bound up, <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 8. having no spirituall fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with those who live a new life, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 18. doth dream and fancy that he seeth, heareth, and converseth with them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. which he will after find to be


<pb n="353" facs="tcp:44180:344"/>
but a meer fancy, when his conscience doth rouze him up, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. neither hath he power over himself, but is exposed as a prey to Satan, or any who mindeth his spirituall hurt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26. for, such is the case of those naturally who are in a naturall sleep. And, secondly, a <hi>death,</hi> because the naturall man hath not only his senses bound up, as in a sleep; but there is no spirituall power or faculty remaining in him to do any thing which is truly good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. as a dead man hath no principle of life, or vitall action. The second branch of this great design is here expressed, which is to point out unto all such what is their duty in that case, even to awake and <hi>rise from the dead,</hi> that is, in a word, to turn to God, to break off their sins by repentance, and to set about all the duties of holinesse flowing from the principle of a new life. Which duty is here, and elsewhere, enjoyned by God unto dead sinners, not, that it is in their power, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23. but because it is their duty so to do; yea, and such a duty as must be gone about, otherwise they cannot be saved, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 3. and because by such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations and commands, as by an outward mean, the Spirit of God doth effectually work that in them, which He requireth from them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. The third branch of this great design, is to encourage them unto this duty, from the promise of a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the light of knowledge, holinesse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort here (all which are comprehended under the name of <hi>light.</hi> See upon ver. 8.) and of glory hereafter (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led also <hi>light, Col.</hi> 1. 12.) to be given unto them by Christ upon their so doing. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The pains which God doth take upon godlesse sinners, yet in nature, to awake them from the sleep of sin, and to draw them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, is a strong argument binding us to commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serate the case of such, and from pity towards them to endeavour in our stations to bring them out of that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full state wherein they are. Our obligation to help them is greater than His, besides that we are bound to work with God, and to further His design: for, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth


<pb n="354" facs="tcp:44180:345"/>
upon them the duty of reproving those godlesse Atheists, in order to their conviction and amendment, from Gods example, who doth the like; <hi>Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest.</hi> 2. That God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed reproof of sin to be the ordinary mean of awakning dead sinners, and of bringing them to Christ, and that He maketh use of this mean Himself all alongs His Word, in order to this end, should encourage us, as we have accesse, in our stations, to make use of that mean towards those with whom we converse; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God may, and when He pleaseth, will, blesse the mean appointed by Himself, whatever unliklyhood there be otherwise of successe: for, he exciteth them to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise this duty from this, that God maketh use of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, as the ordinary mean of bringing souls to Christ; <hi>Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest.</hi> 3. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth not consist so much in the formall words, as in the sense and meaning of those words: and therefore though we cannot keep in memory the very formall words of Scripture; yet if we remember the sum of the purpose contained in those words, we may make use of it, as of the Word of God, whether for confirmation of truth, refutation of errour, exhortation to duty, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof of sin and vice, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. for, the Apostle, being to presse this duty of reproving upon them from Scripture, doth not cite the very formall words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but giveth the generall drift of all Scripture in few words, or the sense and meaning of one particular Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to wit, of <hi>Isa.</hi> 60. 1, 2. from which this verse seemeth to be cited; <hi>Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest.</hi> 4. The first Doctrine deduced from ver. 8. hath ground here also, in that he doth again minde them of their miserable case by nature, not only under the similitude of <hi>death</hi> formerly used, chap. 2. 1. but also of <hi>sleeping.</hi> 5. Neither can an offer of Christ unto a sinner be savoury, nor a command to imbrace this offer get entertainment, untill first a discovery be made unto the sinner of his sad and miserable case by nature: for, the


<pb n="355" facs="tcp:44180:345"/>
Lord, in holding forth the offer of Christ, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to imbrace it, doth so speak, as he first discovereth the wofull case, wherein they were, by the similitude of sleep and death, while he saith, <hi>Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead.</hi> 6. Our utter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to help our selves, or to do any thing acceptable to God, contracted by <hi>Adam's</hi> fall, doth not weaken or abolish Gods soveraign right and dominion over us; in so far as, though we be not able to do, yet He may justly require and exact of us to do: for, though they were dead, and consequently unable to help themselves, yet He requireth them to awake and arise: <hi>Awake thou that sleepest, arise from the dead.</hi> 7. Though it be the only power of God, which quickneth dead sinners, and bringeth them from nature unto grace, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 13. there being no principle of a spirituall life in us by nature, whereby we can quicken our selves; yet the Lord is pleased to work upon us, not as upon senslesse blocks, but as reasonable creatures, by commanding and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading us to do that which is our duty (though not in our power) to do, and thereby, as a mean, convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Elect the effectual working of His power, whereby He worketh in them, what He requireth from them: for, He commandeth those who are dead, to arise from the dead, and so maketh them to rise, <hi>Rom. 4. 17. Arise from the dead.</hi> 8. Though the Word of God for the most part be contrived in general precepts, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and promises, without expresse mention of one more than another, except in some general qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to whom each of those in particular belong, <hi>Joh. 3. 16. Gal.</hi> 3. 10. yet, before a sinner be brought to Christ, the Spirit of God doth make particular application of those unto his conscience, as if they were directed unto him by name: And the more a Minister doth labour to reach the consciences of people, by making particular application of general truths unto them, they are in a fairer way of gaining ground upon them, and doing good unto them by what they preach: for, the Apostle,


<pb n="356" facs="tcp:44180:346"/>
holding forth a directory unto us, how to walk in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the gaining of godlesse sinners, from the Lord's example, doth bring him in speaking, as it were, to every one in particular; <hi>Awake thou, arise thou, Christ shall give thee light.</hi> 9. The holding forth of Christs excellency, and of that excellent state of light, joy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, knowledge, which, being once forfeited by <hi>Adam's</hi> fall, is again purchased by Christ, and to which He bringeth all such as do come unto Him, is one of the strongest arguments (though others also must be made use of, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 3.) to prevail, even with natural hearts to make them willing in the day of Gods power, and obedient to Him when He doth call them: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, that even God Himself doth make choice of this argument; <hi>Arise—and Christ shall give thee light.</hi>

                  <p>HEre is a new precept, the third in order of those which are contained in this Chapter, and it is deduced also as a conclusion from what goeth before, to this purpose, That seing they were now light in the Lord, ver. 8. and obliged not to have fellowship with the unfruitfull works of darknesse, but to reprove them, ver. 10. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would <hi>see</hi> to their <hi>walk,</hi> or take accurate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection of their life and conversation, whether in word or deed; and to see to their walk, as to be circumspect or precise in it, even willing to go to the outmost (as the word in the original doth signifie) of what every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand requireth, both for matter and manner, especially labouring as to approve themselves unto God; so to give no just cause of exception or offence at what we do unto others, no, not to those that are without, who are expresly mentioned, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 5. where the same precept is in substance proponed: Which precept so proponed, he doth, first, inforce by a reason; for, the particle <hi>as,</hi> doth not alwayes make comparison, but sometimes ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth


<pb n="357" facs="tcp:44180:346"/>
a reason: and the reason is, that true wisdom doth consist in walking thus, and to walk otherwayes is extream folly. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The more of light and knowledge a man hath received from God, he ought to take the more diligent heed, that in all things he practise according to his light; seing not only the way of such is most eyed by wicked men, who watch for his halting, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. 10. but also, if he doth not walk the more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectly, he deserveth double stripes, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 47. for, this exhortation may be looked on as an inference from what he saith, ver. 8. <hi>ye are now light in the Lord—See then that ye walk circumspectly,</hi> saith he. 2. So many are the wayes, by which we may become accessory to other folks sins, (See ver. 7. doct. 3.) and so many are the snares, which Satan and his instruments do lay in our way to intrap us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 11. that, if we walk not all the more circumspectly, we cannot eschew but we must partake one way or other with wicked men in their sins: for, this exhortation may be looked upon also, as an inference from what he said, ver. <hi>11-Have no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the unfruitfull works of darknesse—See then that ye walk circumspectly,</hi> saith he. 3. Those only are most fit to reprove sin in others to some good purpose, who walk most circumspectly, and live so, as they cannot be justly blamed themselves: Even the very righteous walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such, is a forcible reproof of sin in others, though they speak nothing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5. and otherwise their speaking will have no force, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 3, 4. besides that God doth usually blesse the pains of such, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 21. for, this exhortation may be also looked upon, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from what he said, ver. -11. <hi>but rather reprove them—See then that ye walk circumspectly.</hi> 4. That a man may walk accurately and circumspectly, coming up (so far as through grace he is able) to the outmost of what every command requireth, both for matter and manner, it is necessary that he walk, not rashly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliberately, but, that he see and diligently consider an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently to his acting, to wit, not only what he is to


<pb n="358" facs="tcp:44180:347"/>
do, that it be neither evil nor appearance of evil, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 22. nor an occasion leading to evil, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. but also from what principle and fountain, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 7. 17, 18.) for what end, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 6. 2, 5.) and by what means, <hi>(Job</hi> 13. 7, 8.) he intendeth to act in every thing which he is about to do: for, in order to their circumspect walking, he requireth of them that they should <hi>see,</hi> the word signifieth <hi>to take heed, to see with attention,</hi> and <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to consider,</hi> Matth. 7. 3. <hi>See then that ye walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly.</hi> 5. As those are only truly wise in Gods account, whatever the world think of them, who labour to walk most exactly by the rule of Gods Word all alongs their christian course; So where this true and sanctified wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (which cometh from above) is, it will render it self evident, by making the person endued with it, walk circumspectly, so that he will foresee the evil of a course, and eschew it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 3. search out the mind of God in every thing, understand it <hi>(Hos.</hi> 14. 9.) and observe it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. 43. keep silence when he should not speak, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 19. speak advisedly, and the truth only, when he speaketh, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 23. hear the voice of the rod, and take with reproof and correction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 10. be loath to stumble any with whom he converseth, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 5. yea, and will labour to gain them to God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. -30. for, he maketh true wisdom to consist in, and to evidence it self by, walking circumspectly; <hi>Not as fools, but as wise.</hi> 6. The lesse circumspect and exact men be in walking by the rule of Gods Word, the greater fools they are in Gods esteem (whatever the world do think of them) as being not only destitute of all the fore-mentioned evidences of true wisdom, but having also the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary evidences of extream folly; <hi>See ye walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly, not as fools.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle doth, next, amplifie and illustrate the former precept, by pointing out one thing, wherein this accurate and wise walking doth mainly consist, which he doth therefore exhort them unto, even that they would <hi>redeem the time,</hi> that is, close with, and make use of every opportunity and fit occasion of doing good (for, the word, rendred <hi>time,</hi> doth properly signifie that nick of time, which is fit and opportune for doing any thing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10.) and to use it with more than ordinary diligence, yea, and with the losse of their own pleasures, ease and worldly profit, and so in a manner regain the time formerly lost by negligence, while they should do as much in the present time, as they might have done both in that, and in the time formerly mis-spent, if they had used but ordinary diligence: Even as merchants, from whom the word renderd <hi>redeem</hi> is taken, who use to buy their commodities while the fit time of buying lasteth, and having haply had great losses, or formerly spent their time idely or unthriftily, do dispense with their own pleasures and ease, and by their more than ordinary diligence, seek to redeem, and, as it were, to buy back again the time which is lost. Which duty of redeeming time he doth inforce upon them, from the evil of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent times through the wickedness of men, and those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold troubles in the times, which were hanging over the Churches head, and whereby all opportunity of doing good might in a short time be taken from them, or they from it. See <hi>Eccles. 11. 2. Joh. 9. 4. Doct.</hi> 1. As there are some times and seasons more fit and opportune than others, for doing some pieces of service to God, and of our duty to men; So a great part of spiritual wisdom and accurate walking, doth consist in diligent and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous going about of such duties, as God doth call-for at that time: and they, who for love to their ease, profit, pleasure and credit, do mispend their time, and neglect


<pb n="360" facs="tcp:44180:348"/>
that good one thing, which God's glory and their own salvation do call-for to be gone about in the seasonable time, are but inconsiderate fools: for, he sheweth, that circumspect, wise walking consisteth in this, even in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming the time.</hi> 2. As we are naturally prodigall and lavish in mispending of time; So it is no small part of divine wisdom to regain, as it were, mispent time by double diligence, and to buy it back again, so far as is possible, by breaking off our ease, our sleep, and wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves from our ordinary and allowed recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at other times: for, this command to <hi>redeem the time,</hi> doth speak so much. 3. So far should we be from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with the evils of the times, for eschewing the hatred, and gaining the favour of wicked men in the time, <hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 10, 11. that the abounding of sin and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse in the time, should make us so much the more conscientious and diligent in a profitable spending of the time, and in accurate and circumspect walking, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a great distance from any thing that is sinfull in the time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 4. as knowing not only that such evil times do threaten to remove all opportunity of doing good from us, or us from it, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 2. but also that they carry alongs with them many tentations from evil example, from straits, from persecutions, <hi>Matth,</hi> 24. 24. which calleth for greater circumspectnesse: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that the dishonour which God getteth from many in such times, should make us honour him the more, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 136. for, he maketh the evils of the times a motive, not only to redeem the time, but also to walk circumspectly; <hi>For the dayes are evil.</hi> 4. Times cannot be so evil, but Gods children may, and will improve, even the evil of those times for Gods honour and their own spirituall advantage: yea, and the worse that times are, in some respects they find a way to improve them the more for those ends: for, <hi>Paul</hi> maketh the evil of those times a spur to incite the Godly unto their duty, while he saith, <hi>Redeeming the time, for the dayes are evil.</hi>

                  <p>IN the third place he inferreth a conclusion from the evil of those times, containing a further amplification of the precept given, ver. 15. from the rule of, or the mean enabling us to, this circumspect walking, set down both negatively and affirmatively, to wit, that, seing the time was evil and full of snares, they would not be unwise, or without understanding in the point of duty, either for the matter or manner of it; but would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint themselves with God's will revealed in His Word, whereby they might be directed in relation to all duties, dangers, snares, tentations and cases. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The great thing to be aimed at in seeking knowledge and understanding, is not that we may only know, or be able to jangle about questions, or that we may be known or esteemed of for our knowledge; but that we may practise, and walk circumspectly, according to what is made known unto us: for, he would have them understanding, and knowing God's will, for this end, that they may walk circumspectly in those evil dayes, as is clear from the illative particle <hi>wherefore: Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding, &amp;c.</hi> 2. No mother-wit, naturall philosophie, or carnall wisdom is a sufficient rule to walk by in a way acceptable to God, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey us safely through those rocks and snares, which are spread for our feet in evil times, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20, 21. and 2. 14.

As it ought to be a Christian man's study to know the will of God revealed in Scripture; So this is a subject, which never will be perfectly known; there being alwayes some new thing to be learned of it and from it, even by those who are greatest proficients in the knowledge of it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 96. and therefore we must be still schollers at this school: for, <hi>Paul</hi> setteth forth their studying to know this subject, by a word of the present time, implying it would be a continued lasting work, while he saith, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding what the will of God is.</hi>

                     <hi>Vers.</hi> 18. And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excesse: but be filled with the Spirit:</head>
                  <p>IN this verse are other two of those precepts, which do belong to all Christians in generall, first, that they <hi>be not drunk with wine:</hi> where by <hi>wine</hi> is meaned all drink, which maketh drunk, set forth in one of its kinds, which is most generally known. And the Apostle's scope is not to forbid all use of wine; seing it may be lawfully used (as all other good creatures of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 4.) for health, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 23. for satisfying thirst, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 20. as also for a Christian and sober chearing up the naturall and vitall spirits upon some sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular occasion, <hi>Joh. 2. 8. Prov.</hi> 31. 6. but he condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all excessive and inordinate use of wine, when more of it is taken than either natural necessity calleth-for, or Christian sober recreation and chearfulnesse doth allow, and so much as our bodies and spirits are thereby over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in some measure, lesse or more, and so rendered unfit for God's service, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21. 34. even although the


<pb n="363" facs="tcp:44180:349"/>
use of naturall reason be not taken away by it, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 22. This disswasive from drunkennesse is inforced from the sad concomitant and consequence of this sin, called here <hi>excesse.</hi> The word signifieth lavish wasting, and destruction; which wasting destruction is extended else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to the drunkards means, <hi>(Prov.</hi> 23. 21.) his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and credit, <hi>(Hab.</hi> 2. 16.) his natural strength of body <hi>(Prov.</hi> 23. 29.) his wit and judgement, <hi>(Hos.</hi> 4. 11.) yea, and to his soul for ever without repentance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 10. So that this one word hath a comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive sum of all those dreadfull consequences, which do accompany this one sin. Secondly, in opposition to their being drunk with wine, he exhorteth them to <hi>be filled with the Spirit</hi> of God, to wit, by labouring to have the fruits of the Spirit in all goodnesse, righteousnesse and truth, with joy, peace, and the comfortable sense of His presence abounding in them in a rich and copious mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Christians, as in all other things, so in their eating and drinking must be ruled by the Word, and neither by their own appetite, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23, 1, 2. nor the pleasure of others, <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 5. for, he prescribeth a rule for their drinking; <hi>Be not drunk with wine,</hi> saith he. 2. So pernicious, and perverse is our naturall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that those things, which God hath given to man for his help and good, are perverted by it, for bringing about his hurt, both in soul and body, and outward estate: for, <hi>wine,</hi> which is given for health and glading the heart of man, <hi>(Psal.</hi> 104. 15.) is abused to drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and consequently to God's dishonour, and the man's own prejudice: so much is supponed, while he saith, <hi>Be not drunk with wine.</hi> 3. There is no sin more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with wise, circumspect and conscientious spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of time, than the sin of immoderate drinking is. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience sheweth it consumeth time, casteth open doors to all wickednesse; burieth shame, which keepeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from vice; and transformeth a man to a very beast, so that he neither knoweth nor careth what he doth; it is the mother of strifes and lust; driveth to stealing, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,


<pb n="364" facs="tcp:44180:350"/>
swearing, and what not? for, in opposition to the duty of walking circumspectly and redeeming the time, he mentioneth this sin of drunkennesse and forbiddeth it; <hi>And be not drunk with wine,</hi> saith he. 4. Such is the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of this sin, that where it is once given way to, it carrieth a man headlongs in the service of it, so that he valueth no losse, whether of credit, means, body, or soul, if he may get his bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tly appetite satisfied: for, <hi>Paul</hi> supponeth many were given to this sin, though therein was <hi>excesse,</hi> or destruction, and losse of all the forementioned good things following upon it, while he saith, <hi>wherein,</hi> or <hi>in which being drunk</hi> or in <hi>which drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness there is excess,</hi> or losse and destruction. 5. Though a gracious person may through infirmity slip into this sin of drunkennesse, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 32, 33. yet a drunken course of life cannot consist with a mans having the spirit of grace in any plentifull measure; seing He is a spirit of temperance, chastity and moderation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 23. and not of excesse: for, the adversative particle <hi>but,</hi> implyeth an opposition betwixt those two, drunkennesse, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the presence of the Spirit of God; <hi>Be not drunk with wine—but be filled with the Spirit.</hi> 6. We ought not to rest upon, and content our selves with, a small mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the graces of Gods Spirit, but are to endeavour to be filled with them, and to have the Spirit of God dwelling richly in us, by actuating all our graces, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 16. and adding one degree of grace unto another; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. for, he commandeth them not only to have, but to <hi>be filled with the Spirit.</hi> 7. What even fleshly sinfull pleasure a man doth find, or imagineth to find from any sinfull course, the same, and much more is to be had in a spirituall and divine manner in the way of grace: and particularly, a copious plentifull measure of the spirit of grace doth work the like effects spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, which wine immoderately taken doth bodily; It filleth the soul with joy and gladnesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 7. It maketh a man forget his former miseries, <hi>Job</hi> 11. 16. it enlargeth his heart, louseth his tongue, and maketh

him eloquent in setting forth the Lords praises. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 67. 68. for, he recommendeth unto them to <hi>be filled with the spirit,</hi> as a remedy against their filling themselves with wine, and calleth the one a filling, or ebriety and drunkennesse, to wit, in a spiritual sense, as well as the other, in a bodily sense, because of the likenesse of effects betwixt them.</p>

                  <p>THis last precept is illustrated, and the duty enjoyned thereby recommended from two things, wherein this fill of the spirit, and of spirituall joy flowing from it, should and will vent it self, which he proponeth also in way of precept. His scope wherein mainly, is, to teach them, and us in them, how we ought to carry our selves in our times of mirth and gladnesse. The first of those two things is in this verse, to wit, melodious and artificiall singing of praises unto God: where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth, first, the act of singing in three words, <hi>speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, singing, and making melody.</hi> By all which is meaned an intelligible, artificiall, and melodious tuning of the voice, together with an answerable orderly motion of the understanding and affections within, going along with the matter which is sung. Secondly, An inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and subordinate end to be aimed at in singing, even our mutuall edification, while he saith, <hi>Speaking to your selves,</hi> or, <hi>one to another:</hi> for, it is the same word, which is chap. 4. 32. and <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16. Thirdly, He expresseth the matter to be sung, in three words, the very titles which are given to <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms, and other scriptural Songs: and though there be some difference among In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters about the kind of Songs, which are expressed by every one of those in particular; yet the most received and probable opinion is, that by <hi>Psalms</hi> are meaned all holy Songs in generall of whatsoever argument, whether


<pb n="366" facs="tcp:44180:351"/>
they contain prayers, praises, complaints, deprecations, prophesie, history, or a purpose mixt of all those; and by <hi>Hymnes</hi> are meaned speciall songs of praise to God; and by <hi>songs,</hi> a certain kind of Hymnes, expressing the praises of God for some of His noble acts, great and wonderfull beyond others. And those <hi>Songs</hi> he calleth <hi>spirituall</hi> (which epithet is to be extended to the Psalms and Hymnes also) as being framed by the Spirit of God, containing spirituall and heavenly purpose, and requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the assistance of God's Spirit and a spiritual frame of heart for singing them aright; and this in opposition to the obscene, filthy, and fleshly songs of carnall men and drunkards. And fourthly, he sheweth the chief thing to be made use of, and employed as an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in singing, to wit, not so much the lips, tongue, and outward voice, (though those be also necessary in sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 25.) as the heart, which then is made use of in singing, when our heart goeth along with the voice, so, as we understand (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15.) and be intent upon the purpose, <hi>(Psal.</hi> 57. 7.) and our affections be stirred and suitably affected with it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 98. 4. And lastly, he sheweth the great end, to which all our songs ought to be directed, even <hi>to the Lord;</hi> the glorifying, and praising of Him, being not only the remote scope of singing, as it is of all other ordinances, and ought to be of all our actions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. but its proper and immediate scope; so that the heart in singing ought to be actually taken up with the thoughts of praise of God, arising from the consideration of the purpose which we sing. Besides what I have already observed upon a parallel place, <hi>Col. 3. -16. Learn</hi> hence, 1. The duty of singing Psalms and spirituall Songs, is not astricted and limited to only one in the Congregation, or to some certain orders of men, the rest being silent, but is enjoyned to all the Lords people, even all the members of the Church: for, <hi>Paul</hi> maketh the command to sing, of equal extent with that other of being filled with the spirit, ver. 18. <hi>Speaking to your selves in Psalms and Hymnes, &amp;c.</hi> saith he. 2. That


<pb n="367" facs="tcp:44180:351"/>
we may go about this worship of singing praises to God acceptably, it is necessary that we be filled with the Spirit and have a rich and copious measure of His presence and assistance, though not to compose new songs: for, he pointeth at scripturall Songs, as the most fitting purpose to be sung, under the titles of <hi>Psalms, Hymnes, and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall songs;</hi> yet that we may be enabled to choose the fittest songs for the present occasion, and sing them with such a spirituall, elevated frame of heart, as such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly piece of worship requireth; for he saith, <hi>be filled with the spirit, speaking to your selves in Psalms, and Hymnes, and spiritual songs.</hi> 3. As even the children of God, when they have gotten a full draught of joy, peace, and other sweet fruits of the Spirit of God, are not above the hazard of venting their joy, by falling out in fits of carnall lightnesse; So there is nothing, which the childe of God ought more to advert unto, than how to carry aright when his cup is full according to his hearts wish: and in order hereto, would expresse his joy in the praises of God; lest by doing otherwise, and giving way to lightnesse of carriage or expressions, in that case he provoke the Spirit of God to withdraw from him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. for, therefore doth he command them being filled with the Spirit to vent their joy, by <hi>speaking to one another in Psalms, and Hymnes, and spiritual songs.</hi> 4. As the Lord hath provided Songs and Psalms to be sung by us of diverse arguments, containing pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose suitable for every condition we can readily fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; So we ought to make such use of that variety, as to make choice of those Psalms for our present singing, which are most fit for the present occasion: for, as is said, the titles here given, do relate to the severall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, which are set forth in spiritual songs; all of which are to be sung, as God by His present dealing with His Church, or our selves shall require; <hi>Speaking in Psalms, and Hymnes, and spirituall songs.</hi> 5. In singing of Psalms to God, there must be an inward harmony, and musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call melody in the soul and heart, as well as in the


<pb n="368" facs="tcp:44180:352"/>
tongue: yea, the chief melody which soundeth most sweetly unto God, is that of the soul and heart; and therefore the outward delighting of the ears is to be taken no further notice of, than it serveth to make the purpose we sing, work the more effectually upon the heart: for, he saith, <hi>singing and making melody in the heart:</hi> what this melody of the heart is, was shown in the exposition.</p>

                  <p>HEre is the second thing, wherein our being filled with the Spirit, should, and will vent it self, even in giving of thanks, or in a sensible acknowledgement of favours received, and in expressing our sense of them, whether by word or work to the praise of the bestower. Which duty is amplified, 1. from the time, when it ought to be discharged, <hi>alwayes,</hi> and at all times: not as if we were to be alwayes, and without intermission in the actuall exercise of this duty of formall and direct thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; (seing there are other necessary duties which sometimes must divert us from it) but because our whole life ought to be according to the will of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently a reall expression of our thankfulnesse to Him; and because we are not to omit any occasion, when it offereth, of formal and direct thanksgiving to God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in words, flowing from the inward sense and feeling of our hearts, as they are said to do a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, who do it upon all due occasions. See 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 13. Secondly, from the matter, for which we are to give thanks, <hi>for all things,</hi> whether spirituall or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, prosperous or adverse; for, God maketh all things, even those which are adverse, work together for the good of such as love Him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. yea, He pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth lesse than our iniquities deserve, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9. 13. and maketh saddest corrections to afford most necessary and profitable instructions, <hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 12. and 119. 71.


<pb n="369" facs="tcp:44180:352"/>
so that there is ground of thanksgiving, even for those. Thirdly, from the party to whom this duty is to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, <hi>unto God and the Father.</hi> See upon <hi>Col.</hi> 3. ver. 17. doct. 3. And, fourthly, from the party through whom, <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> by the vertue of whose merit and satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which are His name whereby He is known) we are not only inabled to go about our duty, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 13. but also all our spiritual performances, whether of prayer or thanksgiving, are acceptable and well-pleasing unto God, <hi>Eph. 1. 6. Doct.</hi> 1. The more a man doth find his heart disposed to give thanks to God at all times, and for all things, even for those things wherein divine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation goeth crosse to his own affections, he may the more certainly conclude that he hath the saving work of Gods Spirit in him in a copious measure; and the more apt we are to mistake, repine and murmure at Gods dealing, and so to wast our spirits in heartlesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, there is the lesse evidence of a gracious work of Gods Spirit in us, at least in any great measure: for, he maketh <hi>giving of thanks alwayes for all things,</hi> an effect of being <hi>filled with the Spirit.</hi> 2. So firm, so calm and composed is that man's state and inward frame of heart, who hath his soul replenished with a rich measure of the saving work of Gods Spirit, that nothing can fall out so crosse unto him, but, he may see the hand of God working for good to him in it, and consequently be kept in perfect peace, and a joyful frame of heart, expressing it self in giving of thanks to God, notwithstanding of it, yea and for it: for, he sheweth, the man filled with the Spirit, may attain to this fixed frame of heart, even to be <hi>giving thanks alwayes for all things unto God.</hi> 3. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual exercises, especially that of giving thanks, are such, that, being rightly gone about, frequency in them doth not beget satiety and loathing, but rather a greater delight to continue in them; so that the more we are acquainted with them, the more we love them: for, otherwise this command of <hi>giving thanks alwayes,</hi> should never receive obedience. 4. So steadable and usefull is a


<pb n="370" facs="tcp:44180:353"/>
cheery and thankful frame of heart unto a Christian, that it bringeth meat out of the eater, encouragement from matter of discouragement, and taketh occasion to lift it self up in the praises of God, even from these things which are matter of down-casting and heartlesse drouping unto others: for, a thankful heart will <hi>give thanks alwayes and for all things,</hi> even for adverse and crosse dispensations. 5. Though we are bound to give thanks unto men for favours received, as unto instruments of Gods good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. -15. yet, religious thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving is only due unto God, as implying an eying of Him to whom we give thanks, as the supream fountain and author of the favour received, having sufficiency in Himself, and receiving nothing from any other, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 14. and implying also a religious subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole man, both in soul and body, unto his benefactour, in evidence of a thankfull heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. for, the Apostle, speaking of this religious thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, will have it ascribed to God only; <hi>Giving thanks unto God and the Father.</hi> 6. That we may imploy Jesus Christ aright, whether for furniture and through-bearing in duty, or for acceptation of our performances by God, it is most conducing and necessary that we so take Him up, as He is made known by the Word in His Person, Nature and Offices, and accordingly close with Him by faith, as ours, whereby, our faith being acted in Him with relation to our state and persons, upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted grounds, we may find more easie work to act faith in Him for furniture to such a particular duty, or for acceptation to it when it is performed: for, <hi>Paul</hi> seemeth to imply so much, while, teaching them to act faith in Christ for through-bearing and acceptation in this duty of thanksgiving, he doth hold Him forth not only under His titles of <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Jesus</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> which do imply His distinct Natures, with the unity of His Person, and His threefold Office, to which He was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynted, (See upon chap. 1. ver. 17. doct. 6.) but also maketh mention of His <hi>Name,</hi> which expresseth what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever


<pb n="371" facs="tcp:44180:353"/>
other thing is revealed of Him, and whereby espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially He is made known; and withall appropriateth Christ unto himself, teaching them to do the like upon grounds of knowledge of what He is, while he saith, <hi>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle (having from chap. 4. ver. 1. exhorted unto such duties, as belong to all Christians in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, of whatsoever rank or station) doth now, in the second part of this Chapter, exhort to those duties which belong to Christians, as they are members of families. And, first, in this verse to make way from the former purpose to that which followeth, he doth premit a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral exhortation unto all, whether superiors or inferiors, to be mutually <hi>subject one to another:</hi> where, submission, or subjection, is taken, not strictly for that which is the root of obedience in inferiors towards superiors, as ver. 22. but generally, for that service of love which every one oweth to another for their mutuall good and advantage in their severall stations. See upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. ver. 13. And it is called submission to our neighbour; because it is not sufficient that we simply do the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded dutie unto him, except our so doing flow from a principle of love to him, and that we actually intend therein his good and advantage; and because it must be done with condescendency of spirit and stouping, seing our proud and lofty spirits do look upon every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards our neighbour, as below them. And he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>in the fear of God:</hi> which containeth 1. a motive to the duty, this mutuall submission and stouping unto all those duties, which we owe one to another, being an evidence of a man's fearing God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42. 18. and, 2. the right fountain, from whence this submission should flow; for, then do we our duty towards others accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, and as we ought, when our so doing floweth from


<pb n="372" facs="tcp:44180:354"/>
the fear and awe of God, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. -22: and, 3. the rule and measure of this submission, there being none bound to submit himself to please his neighbour further than is consisting with that subjection and obedience which he oweth unto God, <hi>Act. 5. 29. Doct.</hi> 1. We are not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of going about the duties of Gods immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate worship, to neglect those other duties of our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular callings, and which we owe to man in our seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral stations: God alloweth time for both, we are to take time for both; and conscientious regard of the one and of the other, are most consistent: for, the Apostle enjoyneth both the former, and latter sort of duties, as it were with one breath, which is clear from the gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical construction of the words; <hi>Giving thanks alwayes—submitting your selvet one to another.</hi> Yea, secondly, The consciencious discharging of those duties which we owe to our neighbour in our several stations, in a way acceptable to God, doth call for, and argue a copious measure of, the saving work of Gods Spirit in the heart no lesse than those other duties of Gods worship and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: for, this verse dependeth upon, and is constructed with ver. 18. <hi>Be filled with the Spirit—submitting your selves.</hi> 3. There are none living, whom God alloweth to live only to themselves; but all are bound to lay out themselves in their respective imployments for the good and behoof of others; even superiors for the good of inferiors: for, this command is given to all without exception; <hi>Submitting your selves one to another.</hi> 4. As God hath tyed us not to live to our selves only, but also to others, whose good we are to aim at in our place and station; So, for a recompence, and that there may be a kind of equality, He hath tyed those others to live also unto us, and one way or other to be forth-coming for our good and advantage: for, the command and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation founded upon it, is reciprocal; <hi>Submitting your selves one to another.</hi> 5. Where the fear of God is rooted in the heart, it will make a man conscientiously carefull and tender of his duty towards man, so that he will not

only do his duty, but also do it from a right principle and motive, and so do as he will not overdo, by displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing God, while he goeth about to please men: for, he holdeth forth the fear of God, as the fountain, motive and rule of that submission which is here enjoyned; <hi>Submitting one to another in the fear of God.</hi>

Now, this submission of the wives, is explained, first, from the party to whom they owe it, to wit, their own husbands, even though they should come short of others in knowledge, wisdom, and every other thing, which doth deserve it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 17. And, 2. from the manner, motive and rule of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive obedience, while he saith, <hi>as unto the Lord,</hi> to wit, Christ, expresly spoken of, ver. 23. For, 1. It must not be constrained and feigned, but willing and sincere, resembling so far, at least, that subjection which they owe to the Lord Christ: for, though the compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive particle <hi>as,</hi> doth not hold forth an equality in all things; yet it pointeth at a similitude and likenesse in some things. 2. It must not flow from a natural principle only of law, custome, or desire of preventing domestick broyles; but from conscience of duty to the Lord Christ, and from respect to His ordinance, who hath so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. And, thirdly, it must be only in things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and no wayes contrary to that submissive obedience, which they owe to Him. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the right order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Families doth conduce much to the advancing of Religion and Policy; (combination in Families being the foundation of all other societies) So the good and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly conversation of husband and wife, is of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for advancing piety and godlinesse among all the other members of the Family: for, as the Apostle presseth much those duties which belong to Christians, as they are members of Families; so he doth begin with the duties of husband and wife. <hi>Wives, submit your selves.</hi> 2. When we are to deal with persons of several estates and conditions, and to inform and presse upon them their respective duties, we are to begin with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, rather than the superiours; because their duty, through the subjection which is in it, is more difficile, and being made conscience of, is a strong motive unto the Superiour to go about his dutie in like manner: for therefore the Apostle, in pressing duties upon those three pairs, which are in every compleat Family, doth alwayes


<pb n="375" facs="tcp:44180:355"/>
begin with the inferiour first, as here, <hi>Wives, submit your selves.</hi> 3. The great and main duty which a wife, as a wife, ought to learn, and so learn as to practise it, is to be subject to her own husband, so that what ever wives be otherwise for parts, for birth, for beauty, for thrift, for breeding, if this be inlaking, they want their chief ornament, are dishonourable to God, and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to their husbands; for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth hold it forth as their great lesson, and the sum of all their duty; <hi>Wives, submit your selves unto your own husbands.</hi> 4. There is no wife, what ever be her birth, parts, or any other privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, who is exempted from this ty of subjection to her own husband. The law of nature, God's ordinance, and her own voluntary covenant, do bind her to it; for, he speaketh indefinitely to all wives; <hi>submit your selves.</hi> 5. There is not any husband, to whom this honour of submission from his own wife is not due; no personall infirmity, frowardnesse of nature, no, nor errour in the point of Religion doth deprive him of it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 13. for, he speaketh indefinitely also of husbands; <hi>Wives, submit your selves unto your own husbands.</hi> 6. A wife can never discharge her duty in any measure of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious tendernesse towards her husband, except she have an high esteem of the Lord Christ, and be in the first place subject unto Him; that so from love to Him she may subject her self to her husband, not going with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out those bounds of submission, which are consistent with her love to Christ: for, while he biddeth <hi>submit themselves unto their husbands, as unto Christ,</hi> he supposeth they had submitted to Christ already, and speaketh to them as such.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle doth, next, enforce this duty of submissive obedience upon wives, from the ordinance of God,


<pb n="376" facs="tcp:44180:356"/>
who hath made the husband to be an head to his wife: which similitude of an <hi>head,</hi> taken from a naturall or politick body, implyeth, first, the husbands eminency by reason of his sex, the woman being the weaker vessel, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. -7- and made for the man (to wit, an helper to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 18.) and the man not for the wife, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 9. as the head is more eminent than the body. 2. It implyeth the husbands power and authority of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over his wife, as the head hath power over the body to rule and direct it: in which respect the man is called the image of God in a sense peculiar to himself, which agreeth not to the woman, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7. And, it implyeth, thirdly, that ordinarily men are, at least should be, endued with a greater measure of knowledge, prudence and other parts, which they are to employ for the behoof of their wives, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14, 35. even as the head is the seat of wisdom, knowledge, nerves and senses, sending down influence for sense and motion to all the members: upon all which grounds, women ought in reason to be subject to their husbands. Which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he doth illustrate and enforce from the similitude of Christs headship over the Church (whereof see chap. 1. ver. 22) so that wives ought to submit themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God will have some resemblance of Christs au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the Church held forth in the husbands au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the wife. I say, some resemblance only: for, the comparative particle <hi>as,</hi> holdeth forth not an equality, but a similitude and likenesse, and in some things only, betwixt Christs headship over the Church, and the husbands over the wife, even in those things, which I presently shew are implyed in the husbands headship, which are some shaddows only of that eminency, power and fulnesse of grace and perfections, which are in our head Christ. But besides those, the Apostle doth here expresse one thing, wherein this resemblance doth also hold to wit, that Christ, as head, is the <hi>Saviour of the body,</hi> thereby implying, that as Christs dominion over the Church, His body, doth tend to, and is exercised in


<pb n="377" facs="tcp:44180:356"/>
procuring and bringing about the Churches good and salvation; So the husbands authority and eminency are given him for the like end, even to procure the good and safety of his wife, in defending her from injuries, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 18.) providing for her, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8.) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting her in things necessary, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 35. and therefore the wife, upon this consideration also, ought to subject her self; seing the husbands power and authority over her are given for her good. Besides those doctrines, which the Text thus explained doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly hold forth, we may gather these consequences from it, 1. It is not sufficient that wives do subject themselves to their husbands from respect to their own peace, ease, credit, or to any thing of that sort; but their subjection ought to flow from the conscience of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to that state and dignity wherein God hath placed their husbands above them, so that their personall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities do not prevail so much to make them despise them, as the dignity of their state to beget respect, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and obedience towards them: for, <hi>Paul</hi> enforceth such a subjection, as floweth from this ground, while he saith, <hi>for the husband is the head of the wife.</hi> 2. There is no society, though never so strictly tied together with strongest bonds, which can comfortably subsist, and keep together for any space of time, except there be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent degrees of superiours and inferiours, some to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and others to obey in the Lord, among them: for, the wise Lord did see it necessary so to ordain, even in conjugall society of husband and wife, who are so strictly tied, that both are but one flesh, (See ver. 31.) and yet the husband is made <hi>the head of the wife.</hi> 3. Christians ought to be of such an heavenly frame of spirit, as to take occasion from things civil or naturall, which do occur in their ordinary employments, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to heavenly contemplations of things spirituall, which have some resemblance to these other things, which are among their hands: for, the Apostle teacheth so much, while he leadeth husband &amp; wife from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration


<pb n="378" facs="tcp:44180:357"/>
of the union, order and duties of married par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to contemplate that sweet union and order, which is betwixt Christ and His Church, both here and in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verses; <hi>Even as Christ is the head of the Church,</hi> saith he. 4. Husbands, and consequently other Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, have a speciall piece of the image of Christ put upon them, in respect of their power and authority over their inferiours given them of God; whereby both inferiours may be afraid to vilifie and contemn their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, lest they be therein found defacers of the image of God, and they themselves also may be taught to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble Christ, whose image they bear, in employing their state and dignity, so as they walk answerably to it, if they would have that submission and respect from infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours which is due unto it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> maketh that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency and authority, which husbands have over their wives, a shaddow and resemblance of Christs power over His Church; <hi>even as Christ is the head of the Church.</hi> 5. As the members of Christs body are by nature lost and gone, even dead in sin and children of wrath, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1. -3. So there was no way for their recovery, but by Jesus Christ His becoming man, and suffering death, and uniting Himself, being now risen from death, unto them as their head, that so He may bestow the influences of spirituall life, with a right to heaven upon them, here, and at last take them to Himself in glory hereafter: for, he sheweth that Christ is become the <hi>Churches head,</hi> that He might be <hi>a Saviour of his lost body.</hi> 6. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and power which husbands have over their wives, is not tyrannicall, rigid, or soveraign, but loving, gentle, warm and amiable, and such as the wife may look upon as a mercy to her self, as well as a dignity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her husband; for, it is compared here unto that sweet and naturall power which the head exerciseth over the body, and Christ over His Church, who maketh His people willing in the day of His power; and it ought to be employed wholly for the good and safety of his wife, as Christ is <hi>the Saviour of the body.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, secondly, repeateth the exhortation, as a conclusion from the former argument, that wives should subject themselves unto their own husbands; and addeth two things, 1. The manner of this subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to wit, such, as it may resemble the subjection of the Church unto Christ: which is to be understood, not in all things; (for wives are not to subject their souls and consciences to their husbands, as Believers do to Christ, trusting in Him for life and salvation) but in some things only, to wit, so, as they may subject them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves willingly, chearfully, lovingly, chastly, and dutifully unto their husbands: for, so doth the Church subject herself unto Christ. He addeth, secondly, the extent of this subjection and obedience, even to <hi>all things:</hi> which is not to be understood of all things absolutly, and without exception, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 29, but all things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, godly, honest, and which are not forbidden in the Word of God, even though they crosse the humour of the wives, and argue little discretion in the husband who commandeth them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 14, 15. &amp;c. for, nothing is excepted here but what is contrary to that subjection which is due to Him who hath commanded this subjection of wives to their husbands, as <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth upon an expression like to this, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 27. Doct.</hi> 1. As subjection in wives unto their husbands, is a most necessary duty; So, considering the inbred pride, arrogance and self-willednesse, which is in all the sons and daughters of <hi>Adam</hi> by nature, it is a work of no small difficulty to get wives peswaded to give that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, chearfull, loving and dutifull respect and obedience unto their husbands, which both the Law of nature, and the written Word of God do require from them: for, to what purpose else doth he reiterate this exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inforce it by so strong and convincing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?


<pb n="380" facs="tcp:44180:358"/>
                     <hi>Therefore as the Church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be unto their own husbands.</hi> 2. Though there be much unmortified corruption in the Church of true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and a law in their members rebelling against the law of their mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 23. yet God doth look upon them as true and loyall subjects to Christ: in so far, as with the Spirit and better part (according to which God doth reckon with them) they serve the Law of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 25. and do groan after, and long for the time when they shall be fully freed from the body of death, and throughly subjected unto the will of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 23. for, while he saith, <hi>as the Church is subject unto Christ,</hi> it is supponed that the Church is subject unto Him, and looked upon by God as such. 3. The servants of Christ in pressing duties, ought mainly to guard against that extremity, which people naturally are most prone to fall into; especially, seing all the guards, which can be used, will have sufficient work to keep the heart from breaking over upon that hand: for, though there be some things excepted from coming un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that obedience, which wives do owe to their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, as was cleared in the exposition; yet, because wives are more inclined to multiplie exceptions in this purpose, than to diminish them. Therefore he extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this obedience expresly to all things, leaving them only to gather from the circumstances of the Text, and other places of Scripture, those few things which are excepted; that thereby he may with one word cut off all unscriptural exceptions, limitations and restrictions, which imperious, aspiring spirits, impatient of the yoke, are ready to bound and straiten this submission and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by; <hi>Let them be subject in every thing,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle doth now exhort husbands to their duty: which he, first, proponeth summarily under the name of <hi>love</hi> to their wives, whereby the heart, and inmost affections of the husband ought to be so inclined and disposed towards his wife, as that not only he do wish her good, but also endeavour unto his utmost to bring it about: which is not to be so understood, as if the wife were not bound to love her husband also, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 4. But he presseth love upon the husband in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, because he is most ready to fail in this duty of love, and to abuse that superiority which God hath given him over his wife, by proving rigorous and bitter against her, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. -19. Now this love enjoyned to husbands, is not that common Christian love, which is extended unto all Christians of both sexes, as unto brethren and sisters in Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 34. but a speciall and conjugall love, which ought to be extended unto none, but unto a mans own wife: and it includeth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation with his wife, and contentation with her love only, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 18, 19. a patient bearing with her infirmities and frailties, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. with a fatherly care to defend her, 1 <hi>Sam. 30. 5, &amp;c.</hi> to provide for her in all things, according to his power; which either her ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity or dignity of her rank doth require, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. lovingly to govern, direct and instruct her, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 35. yea, and to cherish her, ver. 29. Next, he inforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this duty by two arguments: The first whereof, is proponed in this verse, to wit, Christ's example, who loved His Church, and from love gave Himself for it. See upon ver. 2. Which example of Christ's love, doth not only inforce the duty as an argument, but also point forth the right manner of the duty, as a pattern: In so far as the husbands love ought to resemble Christs, to wit, in the chastity of His love, who loveth none to


<pb n="382" facs="tcp:44180:359"/>
His Church, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9. the sincerity of His love, who loveth the Church, not for His, but for her advantage, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 30. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. -20. not for what is hers, but for her self, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. -4- and not in words only, but in deeds also, testifying His love by the effects, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 13. and in the constancie of His love, who loveth whom He loveth unto the end, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. -1. even, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of their infirmities, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 30, 33. such ought the husband's love to be. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though husbands are not to suffer their wives to exercise dominion and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them, that being contrary to the Ordinance of God, and the good both of husband and wife, ver. 22. 23. yet, seing the nature of men, and of husbands in particular with relation to their wives, are sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent of their own accord to exercise any power and authority they have, and rather to exceed their due, than to keep within it; therefore neither ought they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so much to mind their power, neither is it so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for them to be minded thereof by others, as to be carefull how to use their power and authority well, and as it ought: for, therefore the Apostle, though he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the wives to submit; yet, he doth not expresly bid the husbands rule over their wives, but, <hi>husbands love your wives,</hi> as thinking it more fit to let them understand how to use their power well, than to stir them up to the exercise of it. 2. The great and main duty, which an husband, as an husband, ought to learn, and so learn as to practise it, is love to his wife; and so to love her, as to make love kyth in all his deportment to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, and in all those other duties, which he oweth to her; this being that one thing in the husband, which sweetneth the yoke of subjection laid upon the wife, giveth her courage under it, and maketh her willingly submit unto it, when it receiveth such a sweet return from her husband: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth hold forth this as the husbands great lesson, and the sum of all his other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>Husbands love your wives.</hi> 3. There is no husband, whatever he be for birth, parts, authority, or power,


<pb n="383" facs="tcp:44180:359"/>
who is not tyed to love his wife, and to evidence his love to her in all those duties mentioned in opening up the Text: for, he speaketh indefinitly unto all; <hi>Husbands love your wives.</hi> 4. Neither is there any wife, to whom all those duties, flowing from the fountain of love, are not due by her husband. No meannesse of birth, <hi>(Esther</hi> 2. 17.) no personall infirmity, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 5.) adultery being excepted, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. -9- nor frowardnesse of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>(Joh.</hi> 19. 17.) do prejudge her of them: for, he speaketh indefinitly also of the wives; <hi>Husbands love your wives.</hi> 5. Though it concerneth husbands and wives, and others also, who are tied together by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all relations, as masters and servants, parents and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to take some sort of inspection one of another, lest any of their relations come short of their duty, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 13. yet, it concerneth every one most, to make conscience of his own duty, not only to God, but also to his relations, and that, as for other reasons, so for this, There can be no greater encouragement to stir up his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to make conscience of their duty to him: for, he commandeth every one to mind their own duty most, the wives <hi>to submit themselves,</hi> the husbands <hi>to love their wives,</hi> and so in the rest. 6. As Jesus Christ hath deigned Himself to undergo the relation of an husband to His Church; So this, and those other relations taken on by Him, are not empty titles; He doth the duties, which all such relations do bind to, even to the utmost. And particularly. He is such an husband, that for love to His Church, and all other duties flowing from love, He is exemplary unto all other husbands; seing greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down His life for His friends, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 13. for, as <hi>Paul</hi> implyeth here, and in the verses following, that Christ is the Churches husband; so he holdeth forth His love as a pattern to be imitated by all; <hi>Husbands love your wives, even as Christ also loved the Church.</hi> 7. The love which a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band carrieth to his wife, ought to be founded, not upon beauty, riches, health, or any such thing only which


<pb n="384" facs="tcp:44180:360"/>
is subject unto decay, but also, and principally, upon that unchangable foundation of the love of Christ unto His Church: which is here held forth, not only as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, but as an argument also, and the reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore husbands ought to love their wives, even as <hi>Christ also loved the Church.</hi> 8. As those, whom Christ doth love with a speciall love, are only His, that is, real Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, who are subject to Him, ver. 24. So Jesus Christ did give Himself to death, not for all and every one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 9. but only for His Church, which is His <hi>All,</hi> and consisteth of some of all Nations, and of all ranks in the world, in which respect only Christ is said to have died for all, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. for, <hi>Paul</hi> astricteth both His love and His death to the Church; <hi>As Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it.</hi> See some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrines gathered from the like words, ver. 2.</p>

                  <p>HE insisteth upon this excellent pattern of love, by shewing two ends, why Christ from love did give Himself for His Church. The first whereof, is attained in the present life, and expressed in this verse, to wit, that He <hi>might sanctifie</hi> those for whom He gave Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Which sanctifying work, as it is here taken, doth comprehend that whole complex businesse of translating the Elect from the state of sin and death, to the state of grace and life, even our regeneration, justification, and the gracious change of our dispositions, or sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on strictly so called, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 17. which he calleth a <hi>cleansing</hi> of us, expressing the manner how Christ doth sanctifie His Church, even by doing away the guilt of sin, or obligation to wrath because of sin in justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. and the filth, power, and activity of sin, in the renovation of our natures after His own Image, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. which cleansing work, is here described from the externall means and instruments by which


<pb n="385" facs="tcp:44180:360"/>
Christ doth cleanse His Church, and make application of the vertue and power of His death and sufferings, in order to that end. And those are, 1. the Sacrament of Baptism, called <hi>the washing of water,</hi> because of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall rite and element used in that Sacrament; and <hi>cleansing</hi> is ascribed to this <hi>washing,</hi> not, as if there were any vertue bestowed upon the water by God; whereby grace is conferred and really wrought, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. but because, though it be God alone, who wholly and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually doth sanctifie and cleanse us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 7. yet, this Sacrament, as also the other, are made use of by Him, not only to represent Christ, and those graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous saving works of His, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 10. 16. but also to confirm the grant of them to us, if we believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11- yea, and to exhibit a greater measure of those saving graces unto us upon our right using of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24. therefore is it, that the thing signified is ascribed unto the sign and seal. Now, the Apostle doth mention Baptism only, and not the Lords Supper, either because there is the same reason for both, and therefore it was sufficient to expresse the one; or, because Baptism is the first and leading Sacrament, and sealeth up our regeneration and new birth in a peculiar manner, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. and therefore it is most appositly mentioned here, where he speaketh of God's work in bringing sinners out of nature unto the state of grace. The second mean and instrument which God maketh use of, is the Word, to wit, the Covenant of Grace revealed in the Gospel, and preached by sent Ministers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. which the Lord doth blesse for conveying grace to gracelesse sinners, and so, for sanctifying and cleansing them, not by any vertue in the sound, syllabs or sentences of this Word, but by the effectuall working of His own Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. whereby He doth accompany His Word, when, and where He pleaseth, <hi>Joh. 3. 8. Doct.</hi> 1. The love, which an husband carrieth unto his wife, ought to make it self evident, not only in these things which tend to her welbeing in things temporall, but also, and chiefly,

in his sincere endeavours to bring about her spiritual and eternall good, by labouring to instruct her in the saving knowledge of God in Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. lovingly to admonish her for her faults, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 10. and to pray with her, and for her, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. -7. for, the example of Christs love to His Church which he is to imitate, doth teach so much, seing He from love <hi>gave Himself for the Church, that He might sanctifie and cleanse her.</hi> 2. As Gods Image was lost and forfeited by <hi>Adam's</hi> fall unto all his posterity: so there was not any possible way, for our recovering of it, except a price, and no lesse price than the bloud of Christ, had been first payed to provoked justice for it: for, Christ behoved to give Himself, and thereby purchase sanctification for us, that so <hi>He might sanctifie and cleanse the Church.</hi> 3. Our dying Lord had an actuall intention in due time to sanctifie, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly doth regenerate, justifie and sanctifie, yea, and bring unto glory all those for whom he died, and gave Himself a sacrifice and offering unto God: for, His intentions cannot be frustrated, but He must see the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell of His soul, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 11. Now, that He intended to sanctifie all such, is clear; <hi>For He gave Himself for it, that He might sanctifie and cleanse it.</hi> 4. As all those, for whom Christ our Lord did from love give Himself, and whom by His death He intended to sanctifie, were in themselves polluted and unclean, lying in their bloud, defiled both with the guilt of sin already committed, and with the filthy vilenesse of sin yet indwelling, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 1,-3. So, such was the fervency of love in Christ to lost sinners, and such was the vertue of His merit, that no uncleannesse of this kind did make Him loath them, or despare of getting them made clean; <hi>For</hi> that <hi>He gave Himself for the Church to cleanse it,</hi> supponeth that they were unclean, and yet He loveth them, and from love setteth about to cleanse them. 5. The stain and blot of sin, both in its filth and guilt, hath so much sunk down in, and polluted the whole man in soul and body, that no liquor under heaven can wash it out, or cleanse the


<pb n="387" facs="tcp:44180:361"/>
soul from it, but only the washing cleansing vertue of Christs most precious bloud; <hi>For He gave Himself for the Church, that He might cleanse it.</hi> 6. This precious liquor of Christs bloud did not cleanse and sanctifie all those for whom He gave Himself, so soon as it was shed upon the crosse, no, there neither was, nor can be any cleansing of any by the bloud of Christ, untill it be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually applied unto the filthy soul: for, he mentioneth the Word and Sacraments, as the means whereby Christ applieth the vertue of His death, and ascribeth therefore this effect of cleansing unto them; <hi>He gave Himself, that He might cleanse it, by the washing of water, by the word.</hi> 7. As this work and duty of applying the cleansing vertue of Christs death by a lively faith <hi>(Act.</hi> 15. 9.) is of all the other most difficult; So the goodnesse of God hath provided many means, by the help whereof, we may be carried on towards it, the chief whereof are the Word preached, and the Sacraments administrated, the former containing the charter, or grant of Christ, and of all His benefits from God, unto every one, who will receive Him, <hi>Job.</hi> 3. 16. The latter being the great seal of heaven annexed to this grant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. that thereby we may be more and more confirmed in the faith of it: for. His providing these means, doth point at both the difficultie of applying Christ, and his care to have us brought up to it; <hi>That He might cleanse it, by the washing of water, and by the word.</hi> 8. The Spirit of God prescribeth means unto Himself, by which He bringeth about the work of grace in gracelesse sinners, not to ty Himself absolutely, and in all cases to such means, but that we may be tyed to depend on Him in the use of them, His ordinary way being to convey grace by these: for, though He may sanctifie some from the womb, before they hear the Word, or receive any Sacrament, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 5. yet, He holdeth these forth, as the ordinary means, by which He cleanseth, even <hi>the wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of water by the word.</hi>

                  <p>FOlloweth the second argument to inforce this duty of love upon husbands towards their wives, taken from the near conjunction betwixt husband and wife, which he doth propound in this verse, by shewing that the wife is the husbands body, in so far, as by the law of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age (which shall be explained, ver. 30.) they two be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come


<pb n="391" facs="tcp:44180:363"/>

As love in husbands toward their wives, after the pattern of Christs love unto His Church, is a most necessary duty; So (considering the many quench-coals of love, which the mutual infirmities both of husbands and wives, do frequently furnish, together with that naturall pronenesse, which is in corrupt man, being advanced and preferred above others, to abuse his authority, to domineer with a kind of tyranny over such as are under him) it will be found a task not so easie, as at the first it would appear, for husbands to keep this affection and love flowing from the right fountain, and manifesting it self in all its necessary effects towards their wives: for, to what purpose else doth he reiterate this exhortation, and inforce it by so strong and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing arguments? <hi>So ought men to love their wives, as their own bodies.</hi> 2. That place of honour and superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which God hath given the man over the wife, as appointing him to be her head, doth tye him unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable duty; so that the greater his honour is, the greater is his burden: and in particular, it bindeth him to love her; and from love to govern, instruct, cherish her, and provide for her, and to all other things by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, which the head doth for the body: for, from what he said, ver. 23. that the husband is the head of the wife, he inferreth here, <hi>So ought men to love their wives, as their own bodies.</hi> 3. Though there be a sinfull


<pb n="392" facs="tcp:44180:364"/>
love to a mans self, whereby a man preferreth himself, and the fulfilling of his inordinate desires to Gods glory and the good of his neighbour, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 21. which by all means is to be eschewed and mortified, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 23. yet, there is an orderly, lawfull, and allowed love to <hi>self,</hi> whereby a man doth seek his own preservation, both in soul and body, by just and lawfull means, with due subordination to Gods glory, and without any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to, or setting himself against his neighbours good: for, <hi>Paul</hi> supponeth this love ought to be in every man towards himself, and doth urge it, as the reason and rule of the love which the husband oweth to his wife, while he saith, <hi>men ought to love their wives, as their own bodies: he that loveth his wife, loveth himself.</hi> 4. The love which husbands do carry to their wives, ought not to have its rise from any such extrinsecal considerations, as love to their own peace and ease, fear of shame and disgrace, if, through want of love, secret discontents break out to publick strife, or from any satisfaction which they find to their carnal affections, but from respect to Gods holy Ordinance, whereby their wives are made a piece of themselves; hence their love shall be most native, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, yea, and insuperable by any provocations or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, when they shall look upon their wives as themselves, and consequently upon their infirmities; shame, hurt, as their own: for, <hi>Paul</hi> will have their love to flow from this fountain, while he saith, <hi>men ought to love their wives as their own bodies, &amp;c.</hi> 5. That hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands may carry themselves aright towards their wives, (which holdeth of all superiours with relation to their inferiours) they would seriously consider, not so much what is in the power of their hand, and what they are able to do, or may be for their profit and advantage, or tend to get themselves obeyed, feared and respected to the utmost, as what they ought, and is incumbent for them to do, and what the Law of God, and the state they are in, do require from them as their duty: for, the Apostle repeateth the former exhortation, held forth,


<pb n="393" facs="tcp:44180:364"/>

                  <p>HE proveth the consequence of the former argument, to wit, that husbands are to love their wives, because they are their own bodies, by three reasons. The first is taken from the universal custom of all men, to wit, who are in their right wit, not demented and wofully deluded by the devil: which is set down, first, nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>no man did ever hate his own flesh,</hi> or from hatred did any dammage to it; and next, positively, every such man doth to his utmost provide for, and allow upon his own flesh, all things necessary, both for <hi>nourishing,</hi> or feeding it, and for <hi>cherishing</hi> and keeping it warm, with such a sort of care and tendernesse, as hens have toward their young ones, while, by casting their wings over them, they do with their own natural heat keep the young ones warm: for, the word rendered <hi>cherishing,</hi> is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor taken from the practice of those tender and loving creatures: By all which, he not only proveth that hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands should love their wives, as being their own body; but also hinteth at some of those effects, wherein their love should be made manifest, whereof particular men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall be made among the Observations. Secondly, he proveth the same consequence, and also further clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with what care and tendernesse the husband should carry himself unto his wife, as to his own body, from Christs example, who nourisheth and cherisheth the Church, His body, by providing for her, and allowing on her all things necessary for soul and body. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is no lesse monstruous and unnatural, for a man to hate, and from hatred to carry himself austerely, sauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and undutifully to his wife, than if in a fit of phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie


<pb n="394" facs="tcp:44180:365"/>
he should hate, and from hatred refuse to do all duty to himself; But in stead thereof to be cruel against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: for, the Apostle mentioneth this, <hi>no man,</hi> not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, <hi>did never hate his own flesh,</hi> to shew that therefore husbands ought as much to abhor and abstain from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their wives; <hi>for no man ever yet hated his own flesh.</hi> 2. It is not sufficient that husbands do not carry any ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to their wives, but they must also love them, and evidence their love to them, not in empty words, and flattering insinuations, but in providing all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for them both in food and raiment: for, he holdeth forth indirectly the husbands duty to his wife, in that allowed care which every man hath, or ought to have of his own flesh; <hi>No man ever yet bated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it.</hi> 3. It is the duty of an husband to provide things necessary unto his wife, not grudgingly, or too sparingly, as to a stranger, or to his childe or servant; but liberally according to her rank and station, as being his equal; and confidently, without craving an exact accompt from her, of every thing which she receiveth, as having a common right and interest with him in all things that are his; and cheerfully, by testifying such contentment in her, even while he bestoweth things necessary on her, as he would do in bestowing the same or the like on himself: for, so much is implyed in a mans nourishing and cherishing of his own flesh, which is held forth as the rule of the husbands tender care and liberal benevolence toward his wife; <hi>but nourisheth and cherisheth it.</hi> 4. The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, under pretence of cherishing his wife, ought not to pamper her, or lavishly to wast his estate in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her prodigality in apparel, unnecessary, expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive ornaments, and such like vanities; but the rule according to which he is to walk in those things, and more than which the wife ought not to expect from her husband, nor yet complaine if he come up to it, is what his own rank requireth, his necessity doth permit, and that tender care which is taken by


<pb n="395" facs="tcp:44180:365"/>
him in nourishing and cherishing himself: for, this is here held forth as his rule, <hi>But nourisheth and cherisheth it,</hi> to wit, his own flesh. 5. Though there be an exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive pampering of the flesh, which is sinfull and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when provision is made for it to fulfill the lusts thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 14. yet there is a lawfull and necessary care of the flesh, or of a mans own body, whereby things necessary for food and raiment are bestowed upon it, in so far, that health and strength be not inlacking for discharging the duties of our calling: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not condemn, but approve this custom among men, that <hi>no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it.</hi> 6. As Christs example in His dealing towards the Church, is a most excellent copie, to be eyed and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by husbands in their carriage toward their wives, and that not only in their love, but in all those other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, flowing from love, which they owe unto them; So it doth concern both husbands and wives, to eye this pattern much, and to draw their motives and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto their mutuall duties from it, as that which will much conduce to keep their hearts in a spirituall frame, even in those performances, and to prevent that carnal, worldly disposition which the misguided care of performing such duties, as the married-state of life cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for, doth usually contract: for, as he propounded Christs example, for a motive to, and pattern of the duty of love, ver. 25. so of those duties also, of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing and cherishing, which flow from it, in this verse, <hi>even as the Lord the Church.</hi> 7. A husbands care ought to extend it self not only to nourish and cherish his wife in things temporal, and which concern her body only, but also in things spiritual, and which concern her soul; and therefore he would be circumspect, lest (under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of eschewing all suspicion of displeasure with her, and of giving necessary tokens and evidences of his love and kindnesse to her, in order to his outward cherishing her) he do neither willingly neglect the care of her sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or by fondnesse or lightnesse incapacitate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self


<pb n="396" facs="tcp:44180:366"/>
to do her any good in that respect: for, Christ doth nourish and cherish His Church, by taking care of, and providing mainly for, the souls and eternall state of His People; and husbands are commanded here to make Him their pattern, <hi>Even as the Lord the Church,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>HE giveth here a reason why Christ doth so cherish His Church, where, in stead of naming the <hi>Church</hi> expresly, which the sequell of his discourse did require, he mentioneth himself and other true Believers among the Ephesians under the pronoun <hi>we;</hi> the Church here spoken of, for whom Christ did give Himself, being only made up of such: And the reason is taken from that neer and strict union, or that spirituall marriage, which is betwixt Christ and Believers, whereof that ancient marriage betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eva</hi> was a kind of type and shadow, as appeareth from the words here used,, which are taken from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23. and were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at first by <hi>Adam</hi> concerning himself and his wife, but are here, by allusion to that marriage of theirs, made use of, to set forth the spirituall marriage betwixt Christ and His Church, the tie and bond whereof is so near and strict, that as the Apostle sheweth, all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are members of His body; yea, not only of one nature with him, which is common to them with all mankind, but also as they are new creatures, they have their originall and nourishment from Him, even from His flesh and bones, in so far, as they owe the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, progresse and accomplishment of their spirituall life, to Christ His taking on of flash, and His suffering in the flesh, and by the vertue of those His sufferings, they are quickned and fed, and so are <hi>of His flesh,</hi> and <hi>of his bones.

Church, when we make application of them to our selves, and by a lively faith do enter our selves among these for whom He doth so care: for, the Apostle, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the preceeding verse spoken of Christs nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cherishing of His Church, applyeth that to himself, and other true Believers among the Ephesians, while he saith, <hi>for we are members of his body.</hi> 2. Then may we upon good grounds apply these generall truths unto our selves, when, as members of Christs mysticall body, we draw our spirituall life and nourishment from that vertue and influence which Christ hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by His sufferings in the flesh: for, upon this ground, <hi>Paul</hi> doth substitute himself, and other true Believers in stead of the Church, and claimeth interest in Christs tender and warm care, whereby He doth nourish and cherish His Church, while he saith, <hi>we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones.</hi> 3. There is no relation, which Christ hath taken on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward His Church, but it bindeth him to, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly he will perform all those, answerable duties which men under these relations are bound to perform toward those to whom they have them: for, he giveth a reason, why He did nourish and cherish His Church as a man doth his body, and a husband ought to cherish his wife, because he had taken on the relation of an head and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to His Church, while he saith, <hi>we are members of His body, of His flesh, and of His bones.</hi> 4.

                  <p>THis verse, in the literal, plain and historical sense of the words, holdeth forth the law of <hi>marriage,</hi> binding all married parties in all times, which was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 2. 24. and approved by God Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 5. And the words taken in this sense contain the third reason, to prove the former conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ver. 28. that seing wives are the bodies of their husbands, therefore they should be loved. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is taken from that law of marriage, expresly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring that <hi>for this cause,</hi> to wit, because the wife is bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, as the cause is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23, 24. which is the same in effect with the cause given, ver. 28. even because she is the body of the husband, to which this verse literally taken doth relate, or to the thirtieth verse immediatly preceeding, in so far as the strict union, which is between married parties, is there alluded unto: Upon all which causes, or rather one and the same cause expressed in all those places, that law doth declare, first, That the man is to <hi>leave father and mother,</hi> to wit, not by casting off natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection to his parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44. 34. or by refusing to help them in their strait, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 4. but by loving his wife more than them, and by leaving his fathers family, if he, his wife and they cannot live all together, and by joyning in a new family with his wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. 5. as is further cleared by the second thing here decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to wit, that he ought to <hi>be joyned</hi> inseperably to


<pb n="399" facs="tcp:44180:367"/>
                     <hi>his wife,</hi> and that both in affection, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 19. and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation, dwelling with her, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. The word in the original, doth signifie such a <hi>joyning,</hi> as that of two boards of timber, firmly glued together; not as if a man were to reside constantly at home: for, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, the Lawyer, and men of other imployments also, must some times go abroad, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 19, 20. But his fixed dwelling should be with her, and his presence also, so far as his necessary calling shall permit, so that he is not without necessity to be absent from his own home, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. -19. And, thirdly, this law declareth, that <hi>they two shall be one flesh;</hi> which implyeth, first, a most strict union, so that they cannot be separated, (except in the case of adultery, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.—9—and wilfull deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the one party, persisted in, after all meanes used to the contrary, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 15) more than a piece of a mans body, may be cut off from the rest: And, secondly, a most intimate communion, whereby they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon goods, common friends, yea, and all things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as if they were but one person: And thirdly, the lawfull and sanctified use of the marriage-bed, allowed unto them of God, which out of the case of marriage is sinfull and damnable, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 16. Heb.</hi> 13. 4. But for further clearing of the words, know, that beside their literal and historical sense, God intended that the purpose contained in them, concerning the carnal mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of man and woman, should represent and shadow forth somewhat of Christ, and of that spirituall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between Christ and the Church, as appeareth from the situation of the words, immediatly after ver. 30. which doth evidently speak of Christ, as is already shown; and before verse 32. where he declareth, that the purpose in hand is a mysterie, and to be understood of Christ and the Church: now, the purpose here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, doth hold in Christ, by analogie and proportion, in so far as Christ did leave His Father, by laying aside the glory which He had with Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 28. and taking on the form of a servant, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 8. and did


<pb n="400" facs="tcp:44180:368"/>
leave His mother <hi>Mary</hi> also, and her house and family, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 49. that He might purchase a bride unto Himself, (See ver. 25. 26.) to whom He doth cleave inseparably: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35. and with most tender affection, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 15. by vertue of which spiritual marriage, Christ and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers become, though not one flesh, yet one spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. being most strictly tyed together by His Spirit, and the grace of faith, from which conjunction, Believers so espoused, become fruitfull in good works, and do bring forth fruit unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 4.</p>
                  <p>From the literal sense of this verse, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The love of married parties ought to be very great, and second to no love else, but that which we owe to God: for, even the love we owe to parents, from whom we have our being, ought to give place unto it; <hi>A man shall leave fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother,</hi> saith he, <hi>and be joyned unto his wife.</hi> 2. It is lawfull and allowed of God unto all persons of all ranks, being come to mature age, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. -36-) and especially to those who have not the gift of continency, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9.) to enter the married state of life, only if they marry in the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. -39. and therefore the doctrine forbidding marriage to all those who bear of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Church, is the doctrine of devils, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 3. for, the text speaketh of all men indifferently; <hi>A man shall leave father and mother, and be joyned to his wife.</hi> 3. Divine commands are alwayes founded upon most just reasons, which would be eyed by us, that so our obedience may be more willing and chearfull, yea, a piece of reasonable service unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. for, this command given here unto husbands, to cleave unto their wives, is not nakedly propounded, but with a strong reason annexed for inforcing the duty enjoyned by it: <hi>For this cause,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall a man be joyned unto his wife.</hi> 4. As children are not to remain alwayes childish, but being come to age and understanding, ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stir themselves in providing things necessary and honest, according as the station, wherein they are placed by God, shall require; So parents ought to remit some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what


<pb n="401" facs="tcp:44180:368"/>
of their fatherly authority over their children, as they grow in age and understanding, not expecting nor requiring that children, now come to age, should abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and in all things as formerly, depend upon the counsell and direction of parents, or give themselves wholly to minde their concernments, neglecting every other thing else which may concern themselves: for, this Law, supponeth a state of childehood, wherein children are to be wholly under the authority of parents minding their concernments and at their direction, and that their coming to age, and entering the married state of life, doth give them more liberty to follow their own direction, and to do for themselves; <hi>a man shall leave fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother, and be joyned to his wife.</hi> 5. Whatever hath been the corrupt custome of men, to the contrary, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 19. Yet, according to the first institution of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, only two, one man and one woman, and not moe, either of the one sexe or the other, may be lawfully married together at once: for, the law saith, <hi>a man shall be joyned to his wife,</hi> not to his wives, <hi>and they two,</hi> not they three, or four, <hi>shall be one flesh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the mysticall application of the words, and of the purpose comprehended in them, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. So great a depth is Scripture, that in some parcels thereof, which do appear most plain and easie to be understood, many dark and hid mysteries do lye undiscovered: for, under this plain history of the marriage of our first parents, that great mysterie of the spiritual conjunction of Christ and His Church, was also held forth, as the Apostle doth here make clear; <hi>For this cause shall a man leave father and mother.</hi> See further to this purpose, upon <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. ver. 24. doct. 1, 2. <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. So holy and honourable is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of marriage in it self, and so highly ought it to be esteemed of by us, that God maketh use of it to shadow forth that blessed union and most holy communion which is betwixt Christ and His Church: for, what was spoken historically of marriage, is here applied mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to Christ; <hi>For this cause shall a man leave, &amp;c.</hi>


                     <pb n="402" facs="tcp:44180:369"/>
3. As the Church of true Believers, is the Bride, the Lambs wife, espoused already to Christ; So never any man did more to purchase a Bride to himself, than Christ hath done for His. He laid aside the glory which He had with the Father, and became of no reputation, as was mystically foretold in this history of the first mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; <hi>A man shall leave his father and mother.</hi> 4. The great travel and trouble which Christ was put to for purchasing a Bride unto Himself, doth not make Him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard her the lesse now when He hath her: for, He doth inseparably cleave unto her, with most ardent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary affection, as was also mystically foretold; <hi>And shall be joyned to his wife.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle concludeth this purpose concerning the spiritual conjunction of Christ and His Church, here made use of to illustrate that near conjunction betwixt husband and wife, with an observable acclamation, that it is <hi>a great mysterie:</hi> which word, as it is usually taken in Scripture, doth signifie a thing secret, not obvious to every understanding; and hid, either in it self, or in its cause and reason, whether it be held out in plain terms, or under the vail of some external sign or figure to represent it. See 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. Eph. 3. 3. 1 Cor. 15. 51. Rom. 11. 25. 2 Thess.</hi> 2. 7. And lest, by reason of his speaking all alongs of the bodily marriage betwixt husband and wife, any had so far mistaken him, as to think he called that a mysterie, therefore he explaineth himself, by shewing he was to be understood, not of the bodily marriage, but of the spiritual, or that strict uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or conjunction which is betwixt Christ and His Church. Now he calleth this union <hi>a great mysterie,</hi> because it is a thing hid in it self, before it be revealed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7, 8. yea, and after, it remaineth unsearchable by the light of reason, how Christ, now glorified in heaven, can be one with us on earth, and can only be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged


<pb n="403" facs="tcp:44180:369"/>
by faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. Beside, the bonds of this blessed union and conjunction, are not naturall or bodily, but spirituall, even the Spirit of Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 18. and the grace of faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. and therefore, though the conjunction, following upon these bonds, be real, <hi>(Joh.</hi> 17. 21.) operative, <hi>(Joh.</hi> 15. 5.) and indissoluble, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 28, 29. yet the way of it, is wholly spirituall and heavenly: and consequently not so much to be searched into by reason, what, or how it is, as to be believed that it is, and improved for attaining and finding in our selves those blessed effects, which do attend it where it is. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That Papists have not ground from this place to make marriage a Sacrament properly so called, is clear from the Apostle's own commentary, whereby he sheweth by the mysterie here spoken of, he doth not understand the bodily marriage, but the spiritual: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, that the word <hi>mysterie,</hi> as we shew, in the use of Scripture, doth signifie a sacred secret, not obvious to ordinary capacity, and therefore every mysterie is not a Sacrament, (See 2 <hi>Thess. 2. 7. Rom. 11. 25.) This is a great mysterie: but I speak concerning Christ and the Church.</hi> 2. The more a man doth attain to know of this mysterie of the mystical union and conjunction which is betwixt Christ and His Church, the more he will be ravished with admiration at the unsearchable deepnesse and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity of it, so far will he be from thinking himself able sufficiently to comprehend it: for, even <hi>Paul,</hi> who saw as far in this mysterie as any other, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 4. doth stand, admire and cry, <hi>This is a great mysterie.</hi> 3. As Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are bound to set forth to the Lords People that most near and blessed union betwixt Christ and believing souls, and to presse upon them the study of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it; So, both Pastors and People have need of much sobriety of spirit in diving into this subject, not trusting to the quicknesse of their own wit, nor judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it by natural reason, but resting upon what God hath revealed and made known concerning it, and choosing rather to remain ignorant where he hath not


<pb n="404" facs="tcp:44180:370"/>
revealed, than curiously to search and pry further than is revealed: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> while he is instructing them in this subject, seeth it necessary to minde them of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundnesse of it; <hi>this is a great mysterie.</hi> 4. As we are ready through ignorance, or inadvertence, to mistake the right meaning and sense of Scripture; So the Spirit of God, speaking in Scripture, hath carefully guarded against all such mistakes, while he doth clear the right and genuine sense of a doubt some and dark Scripture, by Scripture it self, either in the same place, or another: for, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> here, while, to obviate a possible mistake, he saith, <hi>But I speak concerning Christ and the Church.</hi>

                  <p>HE doth here, by way of diversion from dipping fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at this time in that spiritual conjunction of Christ and His Church, exhort both husband and wife, to learn from that forementioned law of marriage a short sum of their respective duties: and, first, that every hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, without exception, or admitting any excuse, <hi>would love his wife as himself,</hi> that is, seing she is a piece of himself, as ver. 28. otherwise if the particle <hi>as,</hi> were only a note of similitude, comparing different things, and making a mans love unto himself the rule of his love unto his wife, Then every man's neighbours should be equally loved with his wife; for, every man is to love his neighbour as himself in that sense, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 14. And, secondly, he enjoyneth the wife, that she <hi>reverence,</hi> or as the word signifieth, from love do fear her husband: the meaning whereof is, that she inwardly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that degree of honour which God hath put upon him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. and give evident testimony of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward esteem, in words, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6. actions, and whole carriage, and especially in her loathnesse to offend him, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 2.

<pb n="405" facs="tcp:44180:370"/>
intended by the Spirit of God, to be set forth by some plain histories, recorded in Scripture, besides their historicall and literall sense; yet we are not, upon that pretence, to turn the whole Scripture into an allegory, as if no more were intended in those Scriptures by the Spirit of God, but only to set forth the spirituall my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie; We ought to look upon the historicall and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sense of them also, and mainly, and make such use of them as being so taken, they will afford: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having shown the mystical and allegorical use of <hi>Adam's</hi> words, doth divert from that consideration of them, and pointeth forth what the plain history doth teach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the duties of husband and wife; <hi>Neverthelesse,</hi> saith he, <hi>Let every one of you in particular so love his wife.</hi> 2. It is not unprofitable for people, that Ministers do wind up their large exhortations in a short and pithy sum of what they have spoken at greater length, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the memory of people may be somewhat helped, and their affections also may be more forcibly wrought upon, when the strength of a large discourse is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in two or three words, and presented both to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and affections of people at once: for, so doth <hi>Paul</hi> in the conclusion, sum up what he had spoken at large, from ver. 22. of the duties both of husbands and wives, in two succinct sentences; <hi>Let every one of you so love his wife, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Then do people receive and hear with profit these exhortations which are spoken unto all in generall, when they make application of them to themselves, as if they were delivered unto them in peculiar, and by name: for, what the Apostle spoke indefinitly unto all, ver. 25. he doth here make parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular application of it unto every one; <hi>Neverthelesse, let every one of you in particular, so love his wife.</hi> 4. As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried parties are ready to forget their mutuall duties, yea, and to sport at such doctrine, which doth presse and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn those duties; so the Ministers of Christ, would not only inculcate them the more frequently, but also deliver their exhortation of that kind, with greater


<pb n="406" facs="tcp:44180:371"/>
weight and authority: for, the Apostle not only repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but, in an authoritative commanding way, bindeth this exhortation on them; <hi>Let every one love his wife; and the wife see that she reverence.</hi> 5. As we would labour to infix in our memories a short sum of our most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary duties; so also of the most moving and taking ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to enforce the practice of these duties, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the naked knowledge of our duty will prove but ineffectuall, to lead us captive, to walk in it: for, <hi>Paul</hi> summeth up both the husbands duty, and the strongest argument to enforce the duty, taken from that near uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between him and his wife; <hi>Let every one of you so love his wife, as himself.</hi> 6. Then, and only then is the duty of subjection and obedience of inferiours toward their superiours, sincerely and heartily discharged and accepted of by God, when it floweth from inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and hearty esteem, in the former, toward the place and dignity, conferred by God upon the latter: for he here commandeth wives to give reverence to their husbands, thereby pointing at the right fountain of that subjection, which he had formerly pressed upon them, ver. 22, 24. even fear flowing from love; <hi>And the wife see that she reverence her husband.</hi>

And, first, he presseth upon children obedience to their parents, 1. from the equity of it, ver. 1. which he cleareth from the fifth command, ver. 2. Secondly, from the advantage which should redound to them by it, ver. 3. Next, he presseth upon parents, to hold off the two extremities of rigidity and indulgence towards their children, ver. 4. Thirdly, he presseth upon servants


<pb n="407" facs="tcp:44180:371"/>
obedience to their masters, which is set forth by severall of its necessary qualifications and properties, ver. 5, 6, 7. and inforced from the great advantage, which they should reap by it, ver. 8. Fourthly, he presseth upon masters their duty, which is to be accompanied with the like qualifications, <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>trembling</hi> only being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, ver. 9.</p>
               <p>In the second part, he presseth one duty which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto all Christians in generall, even to prepare for a Christian warfare. And, 1. more generally, that they would take unto them spirits, by making use of the strength which they had without themselves in the Lord Christ, ver. 10. and of the saving graces of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit inherent in themselves, ver. 11. which he enforceth from the nature of the warfare and terror of the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, ver. 12, 13. Next, he exhorteth them more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, to put on, and make use of six several pieces of the Christian armour, 1. The grace of sincerity. 2. The inherent righteousnesse of an holy conversation, ver. 14. 3. A resolute frame of heart to charge through all difficulties, ver. 15. 4. The grace of faith, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended from its excellency and usefulnesse, ver. 16. 5. The well-grounded hope of salvation. 6. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Lords written Word, ver. 17. Thirdly, he presseth the exercise of prayer, as necessary for the obtaining and right use-making of all those, ver. 18. exhorting them to pray for utterance and boldnesse to himself in particular, ver. 19. because of his office and bonds, ver. 20.</p>
               <p>In the third part of the Chapter, he concludeth the Epistle, 1. by shewing he had sent <hi>Tychicus,</hi> (whom he highly commendeth) to inform them of his own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular affairs, ver. 21. and to comfort them, ver. 22.

                  <p>THe Apostle doth now fall upon the duties of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and children.

The great and main duty, which a childe, as a childe, ought to learn, and so to learn as to practise, is to obey his parents, even to receive their instructions, and execute their lawful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; this being a duty, which of any other, proud and rebellious nature is most averse from, and yet such as nature it self doth plead for its equity: so, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever children be otherwise for beauty, for strength, for quicknesse, wisdom, activity, learning, preferment or honour; yet this being inlacking, they fight against the very law and light of nature, and so are a reproach to their parents, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 26. and do accelerate the judgement of God upon themselves, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 25. for, though the obedience here enjoyned, doth draw with it all those other duties, which children owe to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, as was shown in the exposition; yet, it doth, in the first place, signifie a submissive hearkening unto, and obeying of their lawfull commands, as the word in the Original doth imply, which he doth mainly presse upon children; <hi>Children obey your parents.</hi> 2. This duty of obedience to parents, belongeth unto all children what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, so that neither age, sexe, place, honour, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, do exempt them wholly from it, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 19. for, he speaketh indefinitly unto all children, and of both sexes; <hi>Children obey your parents.</hi> 3. Children are bound to obey not only one, but both their parents, the mother as well as the father: yea, the holy Ghost doth expresly provide for the mother, giving her the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 3. because, her sexe being weaker, she is the more subject to be despised: for, he useth a word common to both father and mother, while he saith, <hi>Children obey your parents.</hi> 4. It is not sufficient that children obey their parents, either from a natural instinct


<pb n="410" facs="tcp:44180:373"/>
or fear of their displeasure, or hope of great things to be received from them and enjoyed by them; but their obedience must flow from conscience of duty towards God, who doth enjo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

The nature of man, is, since the fall, become so perverse and backward, that there is need of a spur of earnest exhortation, inforced with strong and evident reason, to stir us up, even to those duties which are written in broadest letters upon every mans heart by nature: for, the Apostle seeth it necessary, not only to exhort unto this duty of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to parents, but also to enforce his exhortation by arguments; <hi>For this is right,</hi> saith he. 6. The first and chief motive, which ought to set us on work to any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is not so much the advantage, which may redound to us by the practice of it, as the equity and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which is in the thing it self, as being commanded by God, and well pleasing in His sight: for, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth obedience to parents, from the equity of it, before he mention (ver. 3.) the profit, which should accresce unto children by it; <hi>For, this is right,</hi> saith he.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle (passing-by all other reasons to prove the equity of the former injunction) doth pitch upon one, to wit, the Law of God enjoyning this duty in the fifth Command. The scope of which Command, is, to prescribe all those duties which inferiours owe to their superiours, and, by consequence, which superiours owe to their inferiours; where all superiours are expressed by the name of <hi>father</hi> and <hi>mother,</hi> because the authority of parents is most natural, and the yoke of it most easily comported with; and therfore all other authority goeth


<pb n="411" facs="tcp:44180:373"/>
under the name of that, to render it lesse invidious to those who are to be subject unto it. And the duty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to inferiors, is their giving honour to superiors, which implyeth (as was shown, ver. 1.) reverence, obedience and gratitude. Now, this command is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed from its precedency, as being the first and most weighty command in all the second table; and from the manner of propounding it, not nakedly, but with a speciall promise of a particular mercy subjoyned to this command in particular, and expressed, ver. 3. which cannot be said of any other command: for, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise annexed to the second, is a generall promise of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, made to such as keep all the commands. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Whatever God hath commanded in His Word, is most righteous, equitable and just: for, he proveth that it is right for children to obey their parents, because the Law of God enjoyneth <hi>honour thy father and mother.</hi> 2. Though the Law of Ceremonies, given by <hi>Moses,</hi> doth not oblige Christians, (Christ, the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of those shadows, being come, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 17.) nor yet the judiciall Law, which was given to the Jewish Commonwealth, and to stand and fall with it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 36. 6, 7. yet, the moral Law, or the Law of the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, as being never yet repealed by God, doth stand in force, and is binding unto Christians: for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth urge this duty of obedience unto parents upon chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, because the morall Law enjoyneth it; <hi>Honour thy father and mother, which is the first commandment with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</hi> 3. So far is God from abolishing different ranks, degrees and states among men, that He taketh speciall care to have those, and publick order in those inviolably preserved, while He not only enjoyneth the respective duties of superiors and inferiors, but also giveth them the first and chief place among all those other duties which man doth owe to man: for, saith he, <hi>honour thy father and mother,</hi> by whom, as we shew, are meaned all lawfull superiors; and he addeth, <hi>which is the first commandment,</hi> to wit, in the second table. 4. Though


<pb n="412" facs="tcp:44180:374"/>
God, as absolute Lord, might enjoyn us obedience to His commands without giving any promise of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; yet, so backward are we to our duty, and so mercifull is God, that, to overcome our backward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingnesse, He is pleased sweetly to allure us by His gracious promise of a free reward unto our obedience: for, here is <hi>a commandment with promise.</hi>

                  <p>HEre he sheweth what that promise is, and thereby giveth a second argument to inforce the duty of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience upon children unto parents, taken from the profit and advantage which should redound unto them by it: for, the Lord doth here expresly promise prosperity, and long life to all such as make conscience of this duty. For understanding of which promise, know, that though it was to be understood, even in the most plain and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sense of the words, as it was held forth to the ancient Church, to whom God used to promise and bestow things carnall and earthly, as an earnest and shadow of things heavenly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. Yet, even then there was a tacite condition implied, to wit, in so far as the thing promised should serve for Gods glory, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 24. and the good of those to whom the promise was made, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14. 13. But, now under the New Test<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, though this promise, even in the letter be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse fulfilled unto many; Yet, it is chiefly to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in a sprituall sense, in so far as the godly obedient childe, whether he live long or short, doth alwayes live well, because he liveth in Gods favour, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 3. and cometh to a full and ripe age, as having reached the prize and mark, for attaining whereof, life is given, even the salvation of the soul, <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 20. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Though our first and chief motive unto duty, ought to be the equity and righteousnesse which is in the thing it self, as being commanded by God; Yet we may eye the


<pb n="413" facs="tcp:44180:374"/>
promised reward, whether temporall or eternall, as a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary motive and encouragement, providing it be not looked at as a thing to be merited by our obedience, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 10. for, as (ver. 1.) he inforced this duty of obedience from the equity of it, in the first place; So here, from the advantage which should redound unto children by it, in the second place; <hi>That it may be well with thee.</hi> 2. So merciful is God to man, that He hath injoyned only those things as equitably righteous and conducing to His own glory, which tend also, and no lesse to our own profit and advantage, so that we need not to separate our own well-being from His glory, but are alwayes to seek the former as a mean of, and in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to, the latter: for, the Apostle sheweth, that this duty of obedience in children, as it tendeth to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in the first place, it being a doing of what is right according to His command; So it tendeth to the advantage of children in the next: <hi>That it may be well with thee,</hi> 3. To live well and long upon the earth, is in it self not to be despised or under-valued, in so far as though the godly man, the longer he liveth, he is the longer keeped out of heaven, yet he findeth the moe proofs and experiences of Gods goodnesse here on earth, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 13. and hath the larger opportunity of a fair seed-time of glorifying God here; and, consequently, shall of free grace reap a more plentifull harvest of comfort at death, and of glory hereafter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6. for, he promiseth this as a blessing to the obedient childe, <hi>that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long upon the earth:</hi> which (as we shew) is accomplished some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the very letter. 4. Then do we rightly apply unto our selves, under the New Testament, those things which were spoken to the Jews under the Old, when, passing-by what was in such things typical, or astricted to the infant-state of the Church which then was, we look upon what was substantial, moral, or of common equity as belonging unto us yet: for, so much doth the Apostle teach, while, citing the promise annexed to the


<pb n="414" facs="tcp:44180:375"/>
fifth command, he saith only, <hi>that thou mayest live long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth,</hi> and omitteth the last clause of that promise, to wit, <hi>which the Lord thy God giveth thee, Exod.</hi> 20. 12. whereby that promise was in a peculiar manner astrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Jews, and to the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which He did give them to inherit. 5. The best way to thrive, even in things worldly, and to attain prosperity, health, wealth and length of dayes, so far, at least, as shall serve for Gods glory and our own good, is, to live a godly life, by taking heed thereto according to Gods Word and especially by giving due reverence and obedience to our natural parents, and consequently to all our lawfull superiours, because of the Command of God: for, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Command, ver. 2. <hi>Honour thy father and mother,</hi> this promise is subjoyned, <hi>that it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long upon the earth.</hi>

them, first, <hi>to bring them up;</hi> or, as it is in the original, to nourish them, which comprehendeth not only their giving unto them present maintenance from the womb, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 7. but also their providing for them against the future, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14. and training them up in any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imployment, whereby they may be able under God to sustain themselves and theirs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 2. And secondly, to joyn <hi>nurture</hi> and <hi>admonition</hi> with their education: by the former whereof, is meaned the timous, season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and compassionate correction of children which parents are bound to dispense, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 24. and by the latter is meaned the information of their judgement, how they ought to carry themselves towards God in things religious, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. and how towards man in righteousnesse, civility and good manners, which is also a great piece of the duty of parents towards children, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31. 1, 8, 9. And lastly, he addeth, that their edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation must be in the admonition of the <hi>Lord</hi> Christ, that is, such as becometh Christians, and by which young ones are instructed chiefly in the knowledge of Gods Word, of Jesus Christ, and of the way of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion held forth by Him. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Such is the prevalencie and interest of sin in the soul of man now fallen, that in some it wholy extinguisheth, or much weakeneth the most intense of our natural affections, and maketh them run in a channel quite contrary unto what they ought: for, the Apostle supponeth, that even naturall affection in some parents to their own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will be so far weakened, as by their unnatural carriage to provoke and imbitter them, while he saith, <hi>Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.</hi> 2. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke or stir up others unto sin, maketh us guilty before the Lord, even of those sins which others commit, being provoked thereunto by us, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6. 9. for, <hi>Paul</hi> forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and condemneth this as a sin in parents towards their children; <hi>Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.</hi> 3. So small command have all men naturally over their passions, especially when provoked by reall injuries


<pb n="416" facs="tcp:44180:376"/>
from others, that the strongest of natural bonds cannot keep them in order, and at under, except they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by grace, but they must transgress the bounds: even children cannot bear injuries from their very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, without being incited thereby to sinfull anger; yea, such is the corruption of some children, that they can bear lesse at the hands of their parents than of any other else: for, so much is implied, while he saith, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, provoke not your children to wrath.</hi> 4. A necessary duty is not to be neglected upon pretence that others may take occasion to sin against the Lord from it, and particularly, parents are not to withhold seasonable and necessary correction from their children, even al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their children should be enraged and provoked to wrath by it: for, notwithstanding he forbiddeth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to provoke their children to wrath, yet he will not have them upon that pretence neglecting to bring them up in <hi>the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> 5. As peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are most ready to run from the one extream of any sin unto the other, from prodigality to sinfull parci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, from rigiditie to too much lenity; So the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ, while they are disswading people from the one extremity, had need most carefully to guard, lest under pretence of eschewing that, people do rush upon the other: for, the Apostle, while he forbiddeth too much rigidity in parents, he seeth it necessary to guard them against the other extremity of too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence and lenity, while he saith <hi>bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> 6. It is the duty of parents, not only to provide for the bodies and outward estate of their children, but also, and mainly to care for their souls, endeavouring by all meanes possible to bring them up for sons and daughters to the Lord Almighty: for, as they are to bring them up or nourish them; so also to beat down sin in them, by nurture or correction, and to make them know Jesus Christ the Lord; <hi>But bring them up</hi> (saith he) <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi> 7.

                  <p>HE commeth now, in the last place, to the duties of masters and servants; and, first, beginneth with servants. See the reasons why he insisteth so long on their duty, upon <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 22. Now, servants were of two sorts, some did serve for hire, or as apprentises, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.—5—. Others were bond-slaves to their masters, being either taken in war, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 10. or bought with money, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. 44. The Apostle speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to both those sorts; and, first, giveth a sum of their duty, to wit, obedience <hi>to their masters according to the flesh:</hi> by which designation of <hi>masters,</hi> he limiteth their dominion and mastership to the bodies of their servants, to things temporall and of the flesh only, leaving the soul and conscience to God only, who is the alone Lord of conscience, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 8. And the obedience here enjoyned to be given by servants unto those, as it is largely taken, doth consist in a chearfull executing of all their lawfull commands, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 9. even though the thing commanded be laborious, painfull, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 7, 8, 9. and rigid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18. in a meek and patient bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their rebukes, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 9. yea, and corrections also, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18, 20, 21. and in with-holding their hands from picking, and their tongues from abusing their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters by alledging commissions from them, which they


<pb n="418" facs="tcp:44180:377"/>
have not, for their own advantage, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in abstaining carefully from all contriving and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of their masters prejudice for benefiting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or others, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, he giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth some properties of this obedience, as first, it must be with <hi>fear and trembling:</hi> which property consisteth in a sollicitous and earnest care, and indefatigable diligence in following their masters affairs to his greatest advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, <hi>(Gen.</hi> 31. 38, 39.) joyned with reverence flowing from love to their masters person, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 1. and with fear of his displeasure, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. -6- and is contrary to pride and lazinesse. See <hi>working with fear and trembling</hi> taken in this sense, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. -12. Secondly, their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience must be with singlenesse of heart, which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to a double heart, hypocrisie and deceit; and it implyeth that faithfulnesse, which ought to be in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants towards their masters, as minding and intending from their very heart the thriving and successe of their affairs in all things and at all times, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10. And, thirdly, it must be <hi>as unto Christ,</hi> whereby he expresseth the manner, motive and rule of their obedience. See upon chap. 5. ver. 22. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Christian liberty, and spirituall freedom from sin, Satan, and Gods wrath, is not inconsistent with civil bondage and subjection. Christ and the Gospel teacheth no man to cast off that yoke, but how they are to carry themselves as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Christians under it: for, he speaketh to servants, as servants, enjoyning them civil subjection, though they were now converted and partakers of that spirituall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty purchased by Christ, <hi>Gal. 3. 28. Servants be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to your masters.</hi> 2. The condition of none is so base or despicable, but free grace in God will stoup so low, as to take notice of them in it, yea, and bestow upon them all those precious blessings purchased by Christ, that so grace may appear to be grace, when it hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on those who are in all respects most unworthy and vile: for, even some of those servants, who for the most part were bond-slaves, and as little esteemed of by


<pb n="419" facs="tcp:44180:377"/>
their masters, as their very beasts, were converted by the Gospel, and are therefore here spoken unto as converts; <hi>Servants be obedient to your masters.</hi> 3. Such is the sufficiency of Scripture, that there is no rank, state, nor degree of persons, even from the King to the bond-slave, to whom it doth not serve as a full and perfect rule to direct them how to walk acceptably in their stations: for here is in it a direction even for servants; <hi>Servants be obedient unto your masters.</hi> 4. The great and main lesson which servants, as servants, ought to learn, and so to learn as to practise, is to be obedient to their masters; and, in a word, faithfully and diligently and according to their masters own lawfull directions to go about their affairs; So that whatever they be otherwise for wisdom, breeding, or profession of piety, yet if they be inlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this, either neglecting their businesse, or preferring their own wisdom in carrying of it on to the direction of their masters, they are a reproach to the Gospel, in so far as they make not conscience of that which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel requireth from them most: for, this is it he doth mainly presse upon them; <hi>Servants be obedient unto your masters.</hi> 5. This duty of obedience belongeth unto all servants towards their masters, So that neither birth, breeding, nor their near relation of kindred unto their masters, do exempt them from it, providing they be servants: for, he speaketh indefinitly unto all servants; <hi>Servants be obedient unto your masters.</hi> 6. This duty of obedience from servants, is payable to all masters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, whether they be good or bad, rich or poor, great or small, no diversity of that kind doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from the masters authority, nor ought to lessen the servants obedience: for, he speaketh indefinitly also of masters; <hi>Servants be obedient unto your masters.</hi> 7. As the power of masters, yea, and all earthly power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somever, doth only reach the body, and the outward temporall concernments of inferiors, and cannot reach their conscience, soul or spiritual concernments, except to constrain the outward man unto the obedience of what


<pb n="420" facs="tcp:44180:378"/>
God hath already prescribed in those; So neither ought superiors to make their will an absolute rule to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by their inferiors in all things, nor yet inferiors to give up themselves wholly to follow all their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with a blind and implicit obedience; for, they are but <hi>masters according to the flesh,</hi> that is, have power over the bodies of servants only, 8. It is not sufficient to do what is commanded by God in any thing, except we do it in that manner wherein it is commanded: and particularly, servants must not only yeeld obedience to their masters, and do them service; but they must do it in such manner as it ought to be done: and in speciall, their obedience and service must be qualified, as the Apostle hath expressed, even with fear and trembling, singlenesse of heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See the exposition of this, and the two following verses. 9. A proud heart, evidencing it self in a saucie, malapert, awlesse and carlesse carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, is most unbeseeming the condition of servants, and highly displeasing to God in them, as being opposit to that property of fear and trembling, which ought to accompany their obedience; <hi>Be obedient with fear and trembling</hi> 10. Though servants are to stand in awe of their masters displeasure, and even from fear of that to go about their service, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. -6-. yet they must not be acted from fear alone, nor think themselves exoner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when so much is done as his displeasure will be eschewed; but, being acted from other motives also, they must make conscience of severall other things in the matter and manner of their service, which the awe and fear of their master would never constrain them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: for, although the master know not the heart, and consequently the servants need not to trouble themselves about their heart from the fear, or dread of him; yet, they are to obey in <hi>singlenesse of heart.</hi> 11. A servant can never discharge his duty with that sincerity and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, which he oweth unto his master, except he have an high esteem of Christ, and in the first plac, become an obedient servant unto Him, that so from


<pb n="421" facs="tcp:44180:378"/>
love to Christ he may yeeld himself obedient to his master in Christ, and so far as obedience to him doth not crosse that obedience which he oweth to Christ: for, he biddeth them be <hi>obedient unto their masters as unto Christ,</hi> and so implyeth they must be first obedient unto Christ.</p>

When a mans chief design is to gain applause, and to be well esteemed of by men, he hath no further regard of his duty, either to God or men, than what doth make way for the promoting of that design: for, <hi>men-pleasing</hi> is the fountain of <hi>eye-service</hi> in servants, or of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecting duty, but in so far only as they may be seen and approven by their masters; <hi>not with eye-service, as men-pleasers.</hi> 4. To propose unto our selves the pleasing of men, and gaining of approbation, good liking and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause from them, as our great design to be gained upon any tearmes, is inconsistent with the work of grace in the heart, and with that subjection which we owe to the Lord Christ: a man cannot serve two masters, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 24. for, he opposeth men-pleasers to the servants of Christ; <hi>not as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ,</hi> saith he. 5. The meanest and basest of services, which men go about in their lawfull callings, being done with the right qualifications, from right motives, for a right end, and in the right manner, is service done to Christ, and will be accepted of by Him, as such, because He doth command it; and it is done, if done a right in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to His command: for, he will have the meanest servants to go about their service <hi>as servants to Christ,

That a man do service to God, whether in the duties af immediate worship, or of his ordinary cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, it is of necessity required, that he do it cheerfully, not as of necessity and constraint, but with a delight and pleasure in it, as in that which God doth call-for at his hands: the Lord doth love a cheerfull giver, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. -7. for, that servants may go about their service to their masters, as servants to Christ, and thereby do the will of God, it is required, <hi>that with good-will they do their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> 3.

Even the basest drudgery of servants being so qualified, is a doing of good, and cometh within the compasse of good works, which the Lord will take notice of as such: for, it is with an eye to the imployment of servants mainly that he here speaketh: <hi>Whatsoever good thing a man doth, the same shall be receive.</hi> 3. As it is lawfull to eye the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised reward for our encouragement in the way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; So it is the mind of God that every one should in the due and right order, make particular application un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themselves of such promises as are in Scripture held forth unto all in general: for, he holdeth forth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of a reward, which is made unto all who do good in general, to be made use of by Christian servants, for their encouragement in particular; <hi>Whatsoever good a man doth, the same shall be receive of the Lord.</hi> 4. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises have no influence to excite unto duty, except the truth of them be known and believed, so that ignorance and misbelief of divine truths, are a great cause of abounding profanity and neglect of duty in all ranks: for, he layeth the weight of their encouragement to duty from this promise upon the knowledge and faith which they had of it; <hi>knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doth, the same shall be receive of the Lord.</hi> 5. The Lord, in dispensing rewards, looketh not to the externall beauty, splendour, or greatnesse of the work, but to the honesty and sincerity of it, how mean or inconsiderable soever it be otherwise: for, the promise of a reward, is

                  <p>HE doth here, in the first place, set down the duties of masters towards their servants, 1. positively, while he enjoyneth them <hi>to do the same things:</hi> which is to be understood, not of the duties themselves, which are much different from the duties of servants, (See them briefly summed up upon <hi>Col.</hi> 4. ver. 1. doct. 1, 2.) but of those properties and conditions which are common to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both; so, that the master is bound to discharge his duty towards his servant in singlenesse of heart, as service to Christ, in obedience to the will and command of God, from his heart, with love and good-will, even as the servant is bound to minde those qualifications in his duty towards his master. Next, negatively, while he forbiddeth <hi>threatning,</hi> or rather commandeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax and moderate threatning, as the word doth signifie; and so the thing forbidden is excesse in threatning and boasts, when they are alway menacing, oftentimes for light occasions, and sometimes for none; And by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, all fierce and inhumane way of dealing with servants by masters, whether in words or deeds, is here forbidden also. In the second place he inforceth this duty, by minding them of that which they did know, at least ought to have known, even that they also aswell as their servants had a master above them to call them to an accompt, to wit, God, who, to make the argument more pungent, is described, 1. from His magnificent and stately Palace, where His glory shineth, to wit, the Heaven; not as if He were only there, and nowhere else,

From His impartiality and justice, in judging so that He respecteth not persons, nor faces, outward shew and appearance, as the word signifieth; and therefore, by <hi>persons</hi> is not meaned the substance, or personal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of men, but their outward state and condition, even that which is conspicuous in man, and doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly make him more or lesse esteemed among men, as country, state of life, riches, poverty, wisdom, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. and consequently to <hi>respect persons,</hi> is to wrest judgement from a sinfull respect to the outward state, condition of parties, and such other things which are wholly extrinsick to the cause in hand, which vice the Lord is free of as being the righteous Judge of the world, who cannot be byassed by fear, love, pitty, or any other inordinate affection, as man is; and consequently, the outward dignity, power, or wealth of masters, would not make Him spare them, if they made not conscience of their duty. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Though masters are freed from subjection and giving obedience unto their servants; yet not from doing duty unto them. Neither is there any power among men so absolute, no not that of Kings and supream Rulers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3. -4. -6. but it implyeth an obligation, through vertue of Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, upon those who are invested with it, to make conscience of several duties towards their inferiours and subjects: for, he saith, <hi>And ye masters, do the same things unto them.</hi> 2. It concerneth masters in their place as much as servants in theirs, not only to go about their duty, but also to advert to the manner wherein they do it, even that it be done in sincerity, cordially, chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, taking God for their party more than men: for, he saith, <hi>Ye masters, do the same things unto them.</hi> 3. It is not only lawfull, but in some cases necessary for masters


<pb n="429" facs="tcp:44180:382"/>
sometimes to threaten, boast, cast down their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon negligent, lazy, disobedient, and chiefly upon profane servants, providing they do it moderatly, and keep off excesse: for, the Apostle doth not simply forbid all manner of threatning, but only prescribeth a moderation thereof; <hi>Forbearing,</hi> or <hi>moderating threatning.</hi> 4. The Servants of Christ in the reproof of sin, ought mainly to guard against such evils, as those to whom they speak, through custom, perverse inclination, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded mind, are most ready to fall into; and so ought people set mainly against such sins in themselves, and thereby defend the wall where it is weakest, and the enemies greatest force doth lie: for, because masters are most prone to break out against their servants in threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, railing and reviling words, as thinking words are but wind, and their tongues are their own, <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. 4. therefore he forbiddeth that evil mainly and expresly: <hi>Forbearing threatning,</hi> saith he. 5. As it is very usuall for powers on earth, sinfully to oversee, and not to punish the cruell and unjust dealing of masters towards ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; So those sins which are most connived at by men, are most severely taken notice of by God: for, the Apostle mindeth them, that God would call masters to an accompt how they carried towards their servants, though men did not take notice of them: <hi>Knowing that your master also is in heaven.</hi> 6. It is too too ordinary for men in place and authority above others, to carry themselves as if they had none above them to be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto; or, at least, to dream that the Lord will not take such strict account of them, as of their underlings and servants; for, the Apostle obviateth such thoughts, and so doth indirectly imply, that masters did so think, while he saith, <hi>your master also is in heaven,</hi> and <hi>there is no respect of persons with him.</hi> 7. Ministers are bound to inculcate, even those truths upon the Lords people, which they in charity do judge to be throughly known already by them; because truths are better known than made use of by the most part; yea, the calling to mind of


<pb n="430" facs="tcp:44180:383"/>
known truths by the publick Ministery, doth through Gods blessing put a new lustre and efficacy upon them for inciting unto duty: for therefore, though the Apostle supponeth they knew this truth, yet he putteth them in remembrance of it; <hi>Knowing that your master is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> See what is observed further upon this description of God, from His royal palace, and impartiality in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon <hi>Col.</hi> 3. ver. 25. doct. 4, 5. and <hi>Col.</hi> 4. ver. 1. doct. 4, 5, 6.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle (having from chap. 5. ver. 21. exhorted unto those duties which belong to Christians as they are members of families) doth now in the second part of this Chapter, exhort unto one duty, which belongeth unto all Christians in generall, the making conscience whereof, is necessary for practising all, or any of the fore-mentioned duties, even that they would prepare and make ready for a christian warfare. And being in the first branch of this part of the Chapter, unto ver. 14. to inforce this duty more generally, he doth, first, propone the exhortation, to wit, that <hi>finally,</hi> or notwithstanding of all he had formerly spoken, this one thing did remain yet necessary to be delivered by him, (for, so much the Original word doth imply) even that they would <hi>be strong,</hi> fortifie themselves, take to them spirits and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in order to their Christian warfare. And this, first, by looking at, and making use of that strength which they had, and all Believers have without them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the <hi>Lord</hi> Christ, who is engaged with them, as leader and generall in this warfare, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 28. And particularly, they are to look at, and act their faith upon <hi>the power of His might,</hi> or His almighty power, in order to their being strong and resolute, as that, which alone was able to answer all their faintings and fears, arising either from their own weaknesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 19. with 21.


<pb n="431" facs="tcp:44180:383"/>
or the strength of enemies, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is not enough for Christians to know what they ought to do by vertue of their severall relations, except they also set about the practice of their duty according to what they know of it: for, the Apostle, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready instructed them in the knowledge of their duty, he sheweth this one thing was yet remaining, even to prepare themselves with resolution and courage in order to their better practising of it: <hi>Finally,</hi> or, this yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, that ye <hi>be strong in the Lord.</hi> 2. As the duties of a Christian life, whether in our generall or particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, will not be discharged by us without a battell and conflict with strong difficulties and terrible adversaries; So it is the duty of Christs Ministers, not only to presse duties upon the Lords people, but also to forewarne them of these difficulties and dangers which ly in the way of their duty, and to instruct them how to wrestle with and overcome them all: for, so doth <hi>Paul,</hi> having already pressed upon them the duties of their generall and particular callings, he doth here not only forewarne them, but also forearme them against difficulties and hazards; <hi>Finally, be strong in the Lord.</hi> 3. Though the Lords Servants sometimes may, and are also bound to command and charge the people of God committed to their charge, to make conscience of their duty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. yea, and also denounce against them most terrible threatnings, if they neglect it, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 2. Tit.</hi> 1. 13. yet, so long as gentle exhortations, enforced with sweet smooth insinuations and rationall demonstrations of the equity and necessity of the thing, may prevail, they are rather to be followed by them, thereby testifying their affection unto, and charitable esteem of their hearers as of rationall men, who, are in a greater probability to be wrought upon by insinuations, desires and convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reasons, than by threats and boasts: for, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth here gently exhort them, enforcing this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation by an insinuative compellation, while he calleth them <hi>brethren,</hi> and afterwards convinceth them of the


<pb n="432" facs="tcp:44180:384"/>
equity and necessity of that to which he doth exhort them; <hi>Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord.</hi> 4. So strong and terrible are these difficulties which Christians are assaulted with in the way of duty, (See ver. 12.) that there is need of more than ordinary strength, reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and courage, for meeting with them, and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through them. Faint hearted-cowards and lazie sluggards, will never face them, far lesse overcome them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 13. for, in order to their rancountering those difficulties, he biddeth them <hi>be strong,</hi> that is, take to them spirits and courage. 5. No naturall courage nor hardinesse of spirit, arising from mans naturall temper, (though in some respect sufficient for making men endure any temporall hardship without succumbing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 14.) is able to underprop and bear us up against the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious assaults of such spirituall adversaries, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discouragements, arising from such multiplied dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties as daily do assault us in our Christian course: for, he biddeth them <hi>be strong,</hi> not in themselves or in the power of their own naturall resolutions, but <hi>in the Lord, and the power of his might.</hi> 6. No strength of grace inherent, no spiritual courage flowing from the graces of Gods Spirit in us, is alone, and by it self sufficient to make us stand and bear us through as victors in this spirituall conflict: we must besides, be underpropped by the power and strength of Christ the Lord without us, by whose influence our inherent graces must be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and applied to work, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 13. directed in their work, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 5. recruited daily with a new supply of strength, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 29. and keeped from fainting under renewed assaults, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 31, 32. otherwise they can do nothing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. -5. for, he forbiddeth them not only make use of grace inherent, as we shall hear, ver. 11. but also and antecedently, <hi>be strong in the Lord,</hi> or in that strength which they had without themselves in the Lord Christ. 7. As whatsoever is in the Lord Christ, must and will be forth-coming, for the encouragement strengthening and bearing through of Believers in this


<pb n="433" facs="tcp:44180:384"/>
spirituall conflict; So their greatest strength, and ground of courage in all their conflicts, doth ly in, and ought to arise from, not what they are in themselves, or can do for themselves, but what the Lord Christ is engaged to be and do on their behalf: for, he exhorteth them, <hi>be strong in the Lord,</hi> thereby implying, that the Lord Christ would be forthcoming for them, and that they were to draw their resolution and courage from thence. 8. Christian souldiers, in order to their own encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and strengthening for this spirituall conflict, ought to lay hold upon, and by faith make use, as of whole Christ, and of all those rich and glorious perfections which are in Him, So especially of His almighty power and strength, by vertue whereof, He doth all His pleasure, <hi>Isa.</hi> 46. -10. neither is there any thing too hard for Him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 14. The power of enemies and greatnesse of difficulties, together with our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, call for this: besides, that many of our discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements arise, not so much or only from misbelief of His good-will to help, as from our atheisticall doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings about His power and strength, which sometimes are expressed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. -20. and sometimes work sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly under ground, as if not His power but only His good-will were doubted of, which is clear from this, that His good-will is not usually questioned, but when difficulties are great, and to sense and reason insuperable. Hence it is, that, having commanded them to act their faith upon whole Christ and all that is in Him, he bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them pitch upon His almighty power in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; <hi>Be strong in the Lord, and in the power of His might.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle will have them to be strong and fortifie themselves, next, by acquiring and making use of spirituall strength inherent in themselves, while he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth them <hi>to put on the whole armour of God,</hi> that is,

the whole furniture and matter of Christian vertues, and all the means which God hath appointed for guarding the soul against Satans temptations, as he cleareth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the particular pieces of this armour. Now, those graces of Gods Spirit, are called <hi>armour,</hi> because they defend the soul from, and strike out against, Satan and sinfull lusts, as the armour of souldiers in wars do defend the body and hurt the enemy; and the <hi>armour of God,</hi> both to shew it must be spirituall and not carnall, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. as being fitted for the heart, soul and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and not the bodily members; and that God is the author, maker and inventer of this armour, and accordingly doth bestow it, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 17. In the latter part of the verse, he sheweth the end why they should be strong in the Lord, and put on this armour, even that they might <hi>be able to stand,</hi> that is, to hold on their Christian course (as a souldier standing orderly and keeping his ground) not running forth beyond the bounds of their calling to cast themselves upon tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and hazards, nor basely fleeing from or ceding to them when God calleth for valiant resistance: which duty of <hi>standing,</hi> is illustrated from the party whom they were to encounter and to fight against, even Satan, whose subtile wiles and stratagems, whereby he labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to intrap souls, cannot be otherwayes resisted but by putting on of this spirituall armour. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Christians are so to rely upon and make use of the covenanted power and strength of Christ, as not to ly-by lazie and idle themselves: They must also have, and accordingly make use of strength inherent in them, and bestowed on them by their Lord and General Jesus Christ. Confidence in Christ, and the conscientious use of all those helps and means appointed by Him, cannot be separated: for, the Apostle, having commanded them (vers. 10.) to place their confidence in the power of Christ, will have them here to acquire and make use of spirituall strength inherent in themselves, while he saith, <hi>Put on the whole armour of God.</hi> 2. It is only


<pb n="435" facs="tcp:44180:385"/>
the armour of God, the graces of His Spirit, and such other means as are appointed by Him, which Christians are to make use of in this spirituall conflict: whatever armour we use besides, (whether will-worship invented by our selves, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18. or carnall motives, to oppose the power of sin, or poor subterfuges to cover the guilt of it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 22.) will hurt, but cannot help in the day of battel: for, he biddeth them <hi>put on the armour of God,</hi> that is, the graces of the Spirit of God, and all such means as are appointed by Him. 3. That a Christian may be truely valiant and come off with honour and safety in this spirituall conflict, he must be wholly armed, and no power of the soul or sense of the body left naked without a guard. And in order to this, that not any saving grace be wanting, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7. or the use of any mean appointed by God, neglected, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 29. there being work for all, and use of all at one time or other, under one case or other, in relation to one tentation or other: for, he biddeth <hi>put on the whole armour of God,</hi> and that not any one piece thereof be wanting, or any part of the man be left naked. 4. It is not enough to have the root and habits of saving grace in the heart: but we must also exercise these graces, and be alwayes acting some one or other of them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58. and all of them as occasion offereth, and as suitable objects are presented by God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. otherwise we are not in a fitting posture for this spiritual combate. When grace is idle, sin and Satan are most diligent: for, when he biddeth them put on this armour, he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not only a putting on by acquiring the seeds and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of saving graces at conversion; (for, some of them were already converted) but also a putting on by using and exercising the grace which some of them at least al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had: <hi>Put on the whole armour of God.</hi> 5. The great adversary of the Saints, is the devil, who feight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against them most by lies and calumnies, speaking evil of God and His wayes to them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 5. misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting their own state to themselves, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 14. and


<pb n="436" facs="tcp:44180:386"/>
calumniating one of them to another: for, the devil is here spoken of as their chief adversary, and the name here given unto him, doth in the Original signifie a calumniator and slanderer; <hi>That ye may stand against the wiles of the devil.</hi> 6. As Satan is most witty and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile; so he imployeth all his skill and subtilty for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this battell against the Saints, while he most cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly contriveth, and with no lesse subtilty conveyeth such ensnaring tentations as he knoweth, all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing considered, will be most taking with the person tempted: for, here he speaketh of Satans <hi>wiles,</hi> the word signifieth methodick witty stratagems. 7. However Satan doth sometimes transform himself into an angel of light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 14. and covereth his foul designs with most plausible pretences to zeal for God, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 54, 55. to pity and natural affection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 22. or generally to something which is in it self commendable; yet, his great design in all his tentations, even when he speaketh fairest, is to drive the party tempted from his station, either by making him turn the back as a coward, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6. 10, 11. or driving him beyond the bounds of his calling, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 51. or presently to render up his arms and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come captive to some one prevalent lust or other, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 12. for, while he saith, <hi>that ye may able to stand against his wiles,</hi> he implyeth, that Satans aim is to drive us from our station: 8. The great work of a Christian, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to those wiles of Satan, is not to imitate him, by bending our wits to ensnare others to a sinfull course as he doth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 22, 23. nor yet so much to know his wiles, to lay open the subtilty and deceit that is in them for the use of others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22. as to guard against them, and to keep our station notwithstanding of them, even when we are assaulted by them: for, saith <hi>Paul, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</hi> 9. It is by the alone vertue of this armour of God, that is, the saving graces of God's Spirit, and the carefull exercise of those graces, that Christians are enabled to stand out against Satans wit and wiles. A piece of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural


<pb n="437" facs="tcp:44180:386"/>
courage and fixt resolutions, together with the deep engagement of credit and interest, may do much to make a man stand out against his avowed force and violence put forth by cruell persecuters; but there is no sence in flesh and bloud against his wiles: for, he biddeth <hi>put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, having thus propounded the duty, doth next enforce it from the nature of this warfare, as being a <hi>wrestling,</hi> which is a close combate betwixt two, hand to hand, each exerting their whole force &amp; strength against one another: And from the terror and greatness of those adversaries, whom we are to fight against, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, 1. negatively, or comparatively, that they were <hi>not flesh and bloud,</hi> that is, any bodily or humane power, to wit, only, or principally; for, the Believer doth fight against those also, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33. only they are but Satans auxiliary forces, whom he stirreth up and imployeth. Next, positively, the devils and damned angels, described, first, from their magnifick titles, <hi>principalities, powers, rulers of the darkness of this world:</hi> whereby is set forth their great naturall power and strength, together with their prince-like authority and government, which by Gods permission they exerce in the world, and upon wicked men in it by reason of their profanity and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, here called <hi>darknesse,</hi> as chap. 5. ver. 8. Secondly, from their nature, as being for their essence <hi>spiritual,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material and without a body; and for quality, most wicked, and here called <hi>wickednesse</hi> it self in the abstract, thereby to aggreage their wickednesse, as being wholly destitute of all moral goodnesse. Thirdly, from the place of their abode, the high air, whereof Satan is prince, chap. 2. 2. Or rather, by this particle <hi>in high places,</hi> (as


<pb n="438" facs="tcp:44180:387"/>
many Interpreters conceive) he setteth forth somewhat more of the nature of this warfare, to wit, the main matter about which the quarrel is, even high and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, which tend to the honour of God, and the eternal good of our souls: for, the word in the original is, <hi>in the heavenly,</hi> without the substantive <hi>places,</hi> and it may be as well supplied <hi>heavenly things,</hi> as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 5. and 9. 23. and so it readeth well <hi>in,</hi> or, <hi>because of heavenly things;</hi> for, this particle, rendered <hi>in,</hi> is sometimes causall, and rendered <hi>because.</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 31. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Lord doth deal ingenuously with all whom He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to fight this spiritual conflict, by letting them know the power, strength and subtilty of the enemy; and the height of those difficulties which ly in their way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before they engage, So that none may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to say they were deceived, and made to meet with harder work than they were told of at the first: for, he setteth forth the nature of this warfare, and terror of the adversary to the utmost of what could be said by any, <hi>We wrestle against principalities and powers, &amp;c.</hi> 2. So apt are men to dream of the way to heaven as easie, and to trouble themselves but little for attaining to it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 21. that nothing lesse is required to make us shake off security, and minde the work of walking to heaven in earnest, than to set before us all those dreadfull dangers, insuperable difficulties, and terrible opposition, which of necessity we are to meet with in our way to it; for, that they may be excited to shake off lazinesse and be serious in this work, he seeth it necessary to set before them what dreadfull enemies they had to fight against, as appeareth from the causal particle <hi>for,</hi> which coupleth this verse with the former; <hi>Put on the whole armour of God,—for we wrestle against principalities and powers.</hi> 3. The malice of Satan, our spiritual adversarie, is bent, not only against the Saints in general, but also against every one in particular, each of whom he setteth upon, with so much fury, force and eagernesse, as if he had none to deal with but one alone: for, the Christians


<pb n="439" facs="tcp:44180:387"/>
conflict with Satan, is here called a <hi>wrestling,</hi> which is a close combat betwixt two, hand to hand; and the original word signifieth such a strife as maketh the body shake again; <hi>We wrestle,</hi> saith he. 4. Every Saint and real Believer is this <hi>one,</hi> whom Satan so assaulteth: he forbeareth none, but setteth upon all; the strongest are not a terrour to him, nor yet the meanest are so far un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued by him, as not to think them worthy of his wrath; and therefore all must fight and wrestle: for, the Apostle of purpose changeth the pronoun <hi>ye,</hi> in the former verse, into <hi>we</hi> in this, to shew that neither he nor any other was exempted from wrestling; <hi>We wrestle,</hi> saith he. 5. No place, no inward case, or outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition wherein a Christian doth fall, can give him ease from, or a safe peace with, this restlesse adversary: his greatest safety is to be wrestling daily and without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission; for, he saith not, <hi>we did wrestle,</hi> or shall wrestle, but in the present time, <hi>we wrestle:</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth a continued action. 6. Devils and damned evil spirits, are a more terrible and dangerous party to wrestle with than any bodily or humane power; yea, though all the skill, courage, valour, strength, which over was amongst men, were united and placed in one, This dreadfull adversary, (for strength, for craft, for unwearied diligence, for unpeaceablnesse of spirit against his party, for his malice, not so much against our body and outward estate, as against our choisest part, even the immortal soul; for his courage to assault, his nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to pursue, his immortal nature, that he never dieth) goeth far beyond the most terrible of men, yea, and all men: for, he extenuateth the power and terror of flesh and bloud, being compared with Satans making the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter far more terrible than the former, while he saith, <hi>we wrestle not with flesh and bloud, but with principalities and powers.</hi> 7. As men in tempting us to sin directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, are subservient to Satan, and in that respect acted by him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 23. So, our surest way to guard against all such tentations, is to look at Satan as


<pb n="440" facs="tcp:44180:388"/>
our chief party, who maketh use of man one way or other, to promove his soul-ruining designes, and upon our ceding to the tentation, as a giving place to the devil, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 27. for, while he saith, <hi>we wrestle not with flesh and bloud, but with principalities and powers,</hi> he would have them to look at Satan as their chief adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, even when they are tempted by men. 8. It is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans constant work, not only to sin against the Lord himself; but to incite and tempt others to do the like, and envie and hinder that happinesse unto others which he hath irrecoverably fallen-from himself: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such as are most active to entice others to sin and wickednesse, do resemble Satan most, and are to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, not as men, but incarnate devils. It is their fathers work they do, and his lusts they fulfill, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. for, he maketh it Satans work to wrestle with the Saints and make them sin against the Lord; <hi>We wrestle with principalities and powers.</hi> 9. As there is not only one but many devils feighting under one head and chief, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. -41. So all of them are engaged in this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall warfare against the Saints; and therefore none of Christs souldiers should dream of ease, there being a sufficient number of enemies to engage all: yea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times many devils do set upon one man at once, <hi>Mark</hi> 5. 9. for, all the stiles here given to Satan, are in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall number, to shew that they are a numerous enemy; <hi>Principalities, powers, rulers, wickednesses.</hi> 10. The people of God ought not to extenuate or undervalue the force and power of their adverse party in this spirituall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict; but look upon them in their outmost strength, most numerous multitude, greatest activity, and in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever may make them terrible: and this, not to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their own hands; but to awake them from their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and to chase them to their strength: for, in order to this end, <hi>Paul</hi> holdeth out their enemy Satan in his most dreadfull colours; <hi>Principalities, powers, rulers of the darknesse of this world, spiritual wickednesses.</hi> 11. Though Angels by their fall, have losed much, even all their


<pb n="441" facs="tcp:44180:388"/>
morall goodnesse, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. yet their essence and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall being doth remain, yea, and such properties as do naturally flow from such an excellent being, as strength and ability to do, at Gods permission, whatsoever is not above the course of nature, (See upon chap. 2. ver. 2. doct. 8.) for which cause they are here called <hi>powers,</hi> yea. and what through Gods permission, their own usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the voluntary subjection of wicked men unto them, they exercise a prince-like authority over the children of disobedience: for, therefore are they called <hi>principalities and rulers.</hi> 12. Whatever prince-like au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Satan hath in the world, and whatever be his might and power to back his authority and make it dreadfull, he imployeth it all for carrying on this war against the Saints; his kingly power over wicked men is made use of for stirring them up sometimes to entice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 7. sometimes to constrain the truely godly to sin against the Lord, <hi>Dan. 3. 2, &amp;c,</hi> His power and might, whereby through Gods permission, he doth raise up storms, commove the elements, destroy cattel, smite the bodies of men with diverse diseases,, is all imployed for this to make men, and especially good men, break out in some one or other sinfull carriage, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 11. with 14. and 2. 5. with 7. for, while the Apostle designeth our adversary by stiles of <hi>principalities</hi> and <hi>powers,</hi> he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth whatever authority or power Satan hath, is imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him for carrying on the war. 13. This prince-like authority and rule which Satan exerceth, is not absolute and illimitted, but hath its own bounds ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for it by God. As, first, his principality and rule is only in <hi>this world,</hi> but not in that which is to come, no not over the wicked, in whom he now ruleth, but there he and they both shall remain for ever close prisoners in hell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 41. for, Christ is still to rule as Mediatour and Lord Deputy under the Father, untill He put down all rule, authority and power, and consequently Satan's among the rest, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. Hence it is they are called <hi>rulers of this world,</hi> that is,


<pb n="442" facs="tcp:44180:389"/>
now, and not hereafter. Next, his principality is limited only to those who are in their unrenewed state of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, sin and ignorance of God. He may indeed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erce a tyrannical power over the Regenerate, but no princely authority, unto which they give unwilling obedience, there being still in such, a party for God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. which in one degree or other opposeth it self, at least doth not consent to Satan's usurpation, <hi>Rom. 7. 19. Gal.</hi> 5. 17. for, he confineth their rule to <hi>darknesse,</hi> that is, those who are in a state of sin and ignorance; <hi>rulers of the darknesse.</hi> 14. Though Satan cannot so far prevail over the renewed man as to rule in him; yet, he ceaseth not to assault him, if it were but to vex him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. yea, and he may so far prevail with his assaults by drawing him on to some particular grosse acts of sin, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 4. and thereby to dishonour God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. and to mar his own peace, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 3, 4. as that the best of men have need to stand upon their guard against him: for, though the Apostle doth limit his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality and rule to unrenewed men, yet he maketh even that, an argument, why he himself and all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Ephesians were to stand to their arms against him: which implyeth, that at least he would assault them; yea, and might in part prevail against them: <hi>for we wrestle against the rulers of the darknesse of this world.</hi> 15. Natural excellency, greatnesse and dignity, are very consistent and often-times found to be stained with the greatest moral deformity; yea, and most excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when they degenerate to wickednesse, do usually prove most perverse: for, those glorious creatures, whom he presently called <hi>principalities and powers,</hi> having fallen from God, became not only wicked, but wickednesse it self in the abstract; <hi>Against spiritual wickedness.</hi> 16. So base, so shamefull, so defiling a thing is sin, that it put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a stain, a blot, a note of ignominy, upon the greatest of created excellencies, if once it get place; yea, the moe, and more choice excellencies that God hath adorned any person with, he proveth the more loathsom and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable


<pb n="443" facs="tcp:44180:389"/>
to God, when he giveth loose reigns to wickednesse for, those princely excellent creatures, by reason of their sin, are branded with this ignominious stile, they are <hi>spiritual wickednesse.</hi> 17. It addeth much to the christian souldier his disadvantage in this spiritual conflict, that his grand and dreadfull enemy, the devil, is of a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and immaterial substance: for, being a spirit, he is of vast understanding, and able to take up our natural inclination, and what temptation will be most prevalent with us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 6. with <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 11. he is invisible both in his nature and approaches; he oft doth reach a deadly blow before we know it is he, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 11. he penetrateth all material substance, and cannot be keeped out by locked doors; yea, the external senses being closed, he worketh upon the inward fancy and imagination, <hi>Mica.</hi> 2. 1. he is unwearied in his motions, and never ceaseth to pursue his design, notwithstanding of growing difficulties and multiplied repulses, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 7. with 10. 12. he hath a singular dexterity in driving us on to act spiritual sins, that is, either inward sins of the heart, or sins that are conversant, not about carnal passions and fleshly lusts, but spiritual objects, such as spiritual pride, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, unbelief, &amp;c. these being more like to his own spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual substance: for, he setteth him forth in his spiritual nature, to make him more dreadfull, as also (according to the judgment of some Interpreters) to hint at the kind of those tentations, which with greatest dexterity and vigour he assaulteth the Saints with most, even to spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual sins, <hi>against spiritual wickednesse,</hi> or the <hi>spirituals of wickednesse,</hi> as it is in the original. 18. The malice of Satan doth bend it self against the Christian souldier, not so much in his temporall and worldly, as in his spiritual and heavenly concernments; and whatever he doth to the Christian's hurt and prejudice in the former, it is that he may hereby reach him a blow in the latter, <hi>Job</hi> 1. 11. for, <hi>Paul</hi> doth shew the matter about which the quarrel is betwixt Satan and us, to be things heavenly, not earthly; <hi>in high places,</hi> better, <hi>because of heavenly things.</hi>

19. No worldly concernment or hazard, ought to go so near us, as that which concerneth the eternal good and salvation of our souls, the hazard of losing those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments will startle a Christian souldier much, as knowing it can profit him nothing to gain the whole world, if he lose his soul: for, to make them take the alarm with greater speed, he sheweth it was not things earthly, but heavenly, which Satan intended to spoile them of; <hi>For we wrestle—for heavenly things,</hi> Therefore <hi>put on the whole armour of God,</hi> as it is, ver. 11.</p>

                  <p>HE doth here first repeat the former exhortation with some small variation, as a conclusion following upon the former reason, while he commandeth them to <hi>take unto them this whole armour,</hi> and for the end formerly mentioned, even <hi>that they might be able to withstand</hi> and resist the enemy, as it were, face to face, foot to foot, hand to hand, and this chiefly in <hi>the evil day;</hi> whereby is meaned not only the whole time of our life, which is full of tentations, and therefore in that respect, evil, but also and chiefly some circumstantiat time wherein ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were to abound, chiefly the time of death, not excluding, but rather probably including that time which was foretold by <hi>Paul</hi> himself, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 29, 30. Next, he enlargeth this end, which was to be attained by their putting on, and making use of their armour, not only to their withstanding at the first onset, and during the time of the fight; but also to their stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the victory, and after they have done all, or overcome all: where by <hi>standing,</hi> as it is distinguished from <hi>withstanding,</hi> presently mentioned, must be meaned the posture not of a souldier, but of a conquerour, who useth to stand when the conquered are thrown upon the ground, <hi>Psal.</hi> 20. 8. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The dreadfull


<pb n="445" facs="tcp:44180:390"/>
opposition which the Christian souldier must meet with in the way to heaven, should not discourage or make him heartless, but only incite him to shake off security and laziness, and to prepare himself for the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell: for, from what he hath said, ver. 12. of their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible adversaries, he inferreth here, <hi>wherefore take unto you the whole armour.</hi> 2. As our serious fore-casting and thinking upon, together with our preparing our selves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly for, this christian conflict, is a necessary duty; So, such is our love to carnal ease and security, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 9. 10. that we are not easily excited to this duty; one alarm will not do it: for, therefore doth he give them a second, almost in the same words; <hi>wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God.</hi> 3. The graces of Gods Spirit, by which the soul is compleatly armed for this spirituall conflict, are not of our own making or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing, but being made to our hand by God, we have them for the taking: for, he calleth them the whole armour of God, and biddeth the Ephesians only take them; <hi>take unto you the whole armour of God.</hi> 4. As this spiritual armour, or the saving graces of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, being once put on, may, though not altogether, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. yet in a great part, be wrung or wyled from us by the power and sleight of Sathan, our dreadfull adversary, So we are not in that case to quit the field, and yeeld the cause: but by renewing our faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and former diligence in the use of meanes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. to take them to us again. Neither are they ever so far lost, but they may be recovered, our great Generall being alwayes at hand to renew our strength, to make us mount up and not be weary, <hi>Isai.</hi> 40. 29—. 31. for, the word rendered, <hi>take unto you,</hi> signifieth to <hi>take again,</hi> or recover that which we have lost or let go. 5. As our spiritual adversaries in this Christian conflict are most fierce pursuers, when ever we give them ground; so we are not to expect any truce or quarter from them, but must stand to it, and fight it out, placing all our safety in a couragious resistance, avowed defyance, and


<pb n="446" facs="tcp:44180:391"/>
none at all in base running, or cowardly ceding, or politick compliance: for, the Apostle will have all their thoughts taken up how to <hi>withstand,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth a furious charge and fierce pursuit upon the part of enemies, and an avowed defyance with couragious resistance upon ours: <hi>that we may be able to withstand.</hi> 6. What ever be the terrour, and strength of our spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual adversaries, and the weakness and inability of men, destitute of the saving graces of Gods Spirit, to resist the meanest of Sathans onsets, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.—26. yet of such excellent vertue is this whole armour of God, or those Christian graces wrought in us by the Spirit of God, that when the soul is once endued with them, and attaineth to the dexterous use and exercise of them, the weakest of saints, will be enabled to receive, without losing ground, the most furious of Sathans assaults: for, it is promised unto them all, even the meanest of them, if they will put on the whole armour of God, <hi>they shall be able to withstand.</hi> 7. As there are some evill dayes by reason of tentations and trouble, awaiting Christians, and some of those unavoidable by any, namely the day of death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. So, we ought to be fore-arming and preparing for such dayes before they come, and with Christian courage resist those violent tentations arising from them when they come, as knowing we are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then called and singled out to give proof of the reality of Gods grace in us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 16. for, he forewarneth of an ill day approaching, and will have them to arme themselves before it come; <hi>Take to you the whole armour—</hi>and to <hi>withstand in the evil day.</hi> 8. There can no such evil day befall a Christian, but through help of this spirituall armour, and the kindly exercise of saving graces, he may ride out the storm, and arrive with safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at the wished harbour when it is over and gone, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if trial and trouble find him ready armed, and at his duty: for, if they will take to them before-hand this armour of God, he promiseth <hi>they shall be able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand in the evil day.</hi> 9. It is a singular encouragement to


<pb n="447" facs="tcp:44180:391"/>
the Christian souldier, that the time of his hottest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict with afflictions, tentations, and the devil their leader, lasteth not long; it is but a day, an hour, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 10. a short season, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6. yea, but a moment, compared with eternity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. for, in order to their encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, he calleth the time of their feighting but a day; <hi>To withstand in the evil day.</hi> 10. The Christian souldier in this spirituall warfare, will meet with many assaults before he obtain a compleat victory, there must be variety of conflicts, exercises and tentations, so that usually his coming out of one, is but an enterance into another: the malice of the adversary is unsati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, his hopes are never quite gone, but what he misseth at one time and one assault, he hopeth to acquire at another, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 4, 5. for, he saith they must first <hi>do all,</hi> or <hi>overcome all:</hi> which implyeth there are many things to be overcome before they stand as conquerours. 11. It is not enough that the Christian souldier doth once engage in this spirituall warfare, and carry himself, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously in withstanding some few of Satans assaults, and afterwards fall back, and lay down his armes; but he must of necessity endure to the end, and untill he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the very last of Satans assaults and overcome them all, if so he expect to stand as conquerour after the feight: for, saith he, <hi>and having done</hi> or <hi>overcome,</hi> not only some few assaults, but all; <hi>To stand.</hi> 12. It is only this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God, those saving graces of His Spirit, and no common gifts or fair flourishes of temporaries and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrits, which will enable a Christian to feight all the battels that must be stricken before the compleat victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for, only if they take this armour, he sheweth <hi>they shall do,</hi> or <hi>overcome all.</hi> 13. How many soever the Christian's conflicts be, yet if he take unto him, and use this armour aright, he shall come through all, and stand victorious after all. Christ our generall, in whose victory we have interest, hath overcome all, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 33. He is engaged in this battell, and feighteth with us, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 13. yea, and prayeth for us, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 32. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,

none can pluck the Believer out of His hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Father and He is stronger than they, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 29. and consequently, the field cannot be lost, the feight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing souldier must one day be a triumphing conquerour: for, upon their taking to them this armour, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, that <hi>having done all, they shall stand,</hi> to wit, as conquerours.</p>

                  <p>THe Apostle, in the second branch of this second part of the Chapter, (having again exhorted them to stand to it as valourous souldiers by carrying themselves watchfully and orderly in all the duties of their generall and particular station) giveth an inventour of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pieces of this armour, both offensive and defensive, exhorting the Christian souldier to put on, and make use of, each of them; and reckoneth forth all the pieces of compleat bodily armour wherewith souldiers used of old to arm their bodies from head to foot, and assigneth some one or other of the graces of Gods Spirit, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to every one of those, for arming the spirit.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which, know, 1. in generall, that there is no piece of armour here fitted for the back parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no escaping by flight in this spirituall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, <hi>Iam. 4. 7. Heb.</hi> 10. 38. Secondly, that we must not so precisly distinguish the severall pieces, as to think that one may not serve for the use of another: for, faith which answereth to the shield here, (See ver. 16) is called the breast-plate, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 8. And yet, thirdly, as shall be made clear in the particulars, there is some resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between every grace, and that piece of the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly armour, to which it is here compared.</p>
                  <p>In this verse, are two pieces of this armour, the first is <hi>truth:</hi> not the truth of doctrine, which is included un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the sword of the Spirit, the Word of God; but the


<pb n="449" facs="tcp:44180:392"/>
grace of truth, or sincerity, whereby a man endeavoureth to be that really, both unto God and man, for which he giveth himself out, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 18. and giveth himself out for that to both, for which the word of truth doth call upon him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 1. which grace of sincerity goeth frequently under the name of <hi>truth, Psal. 51. 6. Joh.</hi> 4. 24. Now, he biddeth them have <hi>their loyns girt about</hi> with this grace; and so sheweth, it doth answer that piece of the bodily armour which was called the girdle, and was a broad belt, wherewith souldiers were girt about the middle, and did serve both for ornament, as being set with drops of brasse or silver, and hiding the gap and want between the other pieces of the armour in that place; and also for safety and defence, as keeping all the rest of the armour fast, guarding the belly and strengthening the loyns. In like manner, this grace of sincerity, is the Christians ornament, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 47. co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth many other wants, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20. 6. is a necessary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient in all other graces, without which they are but counterfeit shadows, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8. and addeth strength and courage to the heart in the day of sore trial, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 5, 6. The second piece of armour is <hi>righteousnesse:</hi> not the imputed righteousnesse of Christ, which seemeth to be included under the buckler of faith; but the inherent righteousnesse of an holy conversation, whereby we are enclined, and do accordingly endeavour, to give both to God and man their due and right, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 16. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to both the Tables of the Commands, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 6. and it answereth that piece of the bodily armour, which was called the breast-plate, whereby the breast and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall parts therein contained were secured: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, this grace of righteousnesse doth guard the vitall parts of the soul, and that wherein the life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian doth consist, to wit, the root and seed of inherent grace in the heart, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. and the faith of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in God: for, righteous walking is an evidence of interest, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2, 3. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. None shall after death stand as victorious over all their spirituall enemies,


<pb n="450" facs="tcp:44180:393"/>
but such as here do stand as souldiers in a military po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture. They must stand as watchmen, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. 1. to observe and take up their enemies motions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. and they must stand as fighters, to resist and withstand all his furious assaults, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 9. otherwise, they shall never stand as conquerours: for, having spoken (ver. 13.) of their standing as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours at death, he exhorteth them in order to their standing, that they would here stand as souldiers; <hi>Stand therefore.</hi> 2. Assurance, and certainty of through bearing and victory over all our spirituall adversaries, is so far from being in its own nature a pillow to foster security and carnall ease, that it addeth courage and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to those who have it, and rendereth them so much the more watchfull, active and diligent: yea, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing weakeneth more the hands of a christian souldier, than diffidence and distrust of successe: for, from what he promised, ver. 13. that they should stand as conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, he encourageth them here to stand in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict; <hi>Stand therefore.</hi> 3. Whenever a man doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to fight under Christs banner, and betaketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his military posture, he may expect a present charge, and to be set upon without delay by his spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all adversaries: for, no sooner doth he bid them stand, but with the same breath he commandeth them to put on their armour, and be in readinesse to receive a present assault; <hi>Stand therefore, having your loynes girt about.</hi> 4. The Spirit of God, speaking in Scripture, doth usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally set out most heavenly and spirituall purposes, by similitudes taken from things earthly, and such as do occur in our ordinary imployments, hereby teaching us so to converse among, and look upon things earthly, as to gather some spirituall lessons from them: for, the Apostle doth here resemble every piece of the souldiers armour, to some answerable Christian grace; <hi>Having your loyns girt about with truth.</hi> 5. The grace of truth and sincerity, is a necessary piece of the Christians ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, without the which we cannot choose but be


<pb n="451" facs="tcp:44180:393"/>
exposed and laid open to severall deadly blows, and dangerous tentations from our spirituall adversary; without sincerity we are easily driven to dissemble both with God, <hi>(Psal.</hi> 78. 36, 37.) and man, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 21. to go about choicest duties for base and by-ends, <hi>Math. 6. 2. Phil.</hi> 1. 16. to curtell our obedience, astricting it to some commanded duties only, neglecting others, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 17. with 20. yea, and to despare of mercy, or of doing better in time coming, when Satan shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse and challenge us for our base hypocrisie in time by past, to which he himself did tempt us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 4, 5. for, the Apostle commandeth the Christian soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to arm himself with truth and sincerity: <hi>Having your loyns girt about with truth.</hi> 6. Though Satans chief arms, whereby he fighteth in this spirituall conflict, are deceitfull wiles and subtile snares, (See ver. 11.) yet, the Christian souldier must not endeavour to overcome him with his own weapons, but ought to be sincere and streight; he must not lie, no not for God, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 7, 8. neither think to out-wit his adversary by yeelding a little, and falling back one step, of purpose to advance two for it, or to capitulate with him by yeelding to one sin at one time, upon condition to give way unto none other, or not to the same afterwards, which, at the best, is to do evil, that good may come, which is condemned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. -8. and is inconsistent with true sincerity and plain dealing, which is here enjoyned to the Christian souldier; <hi>Having your loyns girt about with truth.</hi> 7. The grace of righteousnesse, or an honest fixed purpose and earnest endeavour to obey God in all His commands, is another necessary piece of a Christians armour, without which we are exposed and laid open to severall deadly blows and dangerous tentations from our spirituall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, even such as question our interest in God, and brangle our peace with Him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 32. 17. without this purpose and endeavour, we are easily driven to break all, or any of Gods commands, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 5. and 13. 6. and more particularly, to take a sinfull course for our

own vindication under unjust reproaches, <hi>Isa.</hi> 51. 7. to distrust the providence of God, under straits, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 33. and to make a foul retreat in the day of trial, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 1. for, the Apostle commandeth the Christian soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier to arm himself with righteousnesse; <hi>And having the breast-plate of righteousnesse.</hi> 8. It is not enough for a Christian souldier to propose unto himself a good and approved end, and to be sincere and streight in aiming at the end proposed; but he must make use of good and approved means, consisting in conscientious practice of all commanded duties, both to God and man: for, with sincerity and <hi>truth,</hi> which relateth chiefly to the scope and end proposed in our actions, he enjoyneth the practice of <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> which giveth to both God and man their right and due.</p>

In like manner, this prepared resolute frame of heart to charge through all difficulties, doth not only guard the soul against the


<pb n="453" facs="tcp:44180:394"/>
pollution of filthy tentations which it doth meet with in the way, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 105<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also engageth the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian souldier to go through all the crosses, hardships and difficulties of the way with courage and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Christian souldier is so to stand in the fight, as that he be also daily advancing and marching forwards in his way towards heaven. His duty is both to stand and to advance at once in severall respects: he is to withstand and stand against his spirituall adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and yet to advance and make progresse towards Christ, perfection in grace, and his journeys end: yea, and the more firmly he stand against the one, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceth with greater speed towards the other: for, the Apostle, having exhorted them to stand, ver. 14-. he insinuateth here, that they must be also advancing, while he biddeth them put on the foot or leg-harnesse of reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: which piece of armour was usefull for souldiers chiefly when they were upon their march; <hi>And your feet shod.</hi> 2. The way wherein the Christian souldier is to march and advance towards heaven, is not plain and smooth, or free from trouble and hazard, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set with tentations and afflictions, as with so many sharp stones, piercing briers and thorns, which make a way impassible to bare-footed travellers; for, there was no need of the foot-harnesse, to which he here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludeth, but in such a way; <hi>And your feet shod.</hi> 3. The Christian souldier therefore must arm himself with a firm and well grounded resolution and purpose of heart, to charge through all difficulties, how dear soever it may cost him; this being another necessary piece of the Christians armour, without the which we are exposed and laid open to severall deadly blows and dangerous tentations from our spirituall adversary, even all such as unexpected difficulties and crosses do easily and usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drive an unprepared heart to yeeld unto, to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 1. repining against the Lord, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 9. a spirit of revenge against instruments, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 9. fainting in duty, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 12. closing with sinfull

In like manner, faith is a grace of so large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that it reacheth help to the soul in all its severall cases, <hi>Habak.</hi> 2. -4. it strengtheneth and supplyeth the inlacks of all other graces, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. -9. yea, and guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth against tentations of all sorts, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 23. but more particularly, as the Apostle doth here expresse, it quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth these o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Though the Lords Ministers ought to make known unto His People the whole counsel of God, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 27. there being no truth revealed in Scripture, the knowledge whereof is not use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full either for the being or well-being, for the necessary food or ornament of a Christian, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17. yet they are most to inculcate and presse upon peoples con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences the knowledge and practice of most necessary and weighty truths, chiefly those which are fundamental and of daily use and practice: for, the Apostle, in pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the use of the spiritual armour, doth wisely recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend one piece, of special and daily use, above all the rest, while he saith, <hi>Above all, taking the shield of faith.</hi> 2. The grace of faith is another necessary piece of a Christians armour, without the which we are destitute of Christs imputed righteousnesse, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 9. and so exposed to the dint of sin-pursuing justice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. -36. and to all the bitter accusations and challenges of the devil our adversary, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. We are destitute also of Christs covenanted strength, which is communicated and engaged for our through-bearing in all our spiritual conflicts only when it is laid hold upon by an act of faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 4, 5. and consequently, without the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of that grace, we are exposed as a prey to every ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and especially to Satans fiery darts, here spoken of in the text, seing in that case we have no strength to resist them but our own, which indeed is none, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.—5. for, the Apostle commandeth the Christian souldier to arm himself with this grace; <hi>Above all taking the shield of faith.</hi> 3. This grace of faith is the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and necessary piece of all the Christians armour, in so far as faith (though weak and imperfect in it self, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 5. yet) laying hold on the promise, it enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the almighty power of God and Christ to be for us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 28. it giveth life, being and vigour to the other pieces of this armour, even to all the sanctifying graces of Gods Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. it mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up all imperfections by covering them with Christs


<pb n="457" facs="tcp:44180:396"/>
most perfect righteousnesse, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 9. and so defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them against the furious or subtil assaults of Satan, whereby he endeavoureth to make us question their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, and throw them away as counterfeit, hypocritical and uselesse, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 18. it bringeth a fresh supply of strength to the rest from Jesus Christ when they are weakened, wounded, and almost rendred unprofitable, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 31. yea, it alone doth sometimes keep the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever from total fainting and quitting all, when the rest are shattered, brangled, disappear, and for the time are uselesse, <hi>Job</hi> 13. 15. for, the Apostle recommendeth this piece above all the rest, while he saith, <hi>Above all, take the shield of faith.</hi> 4. As Satans great design is to wrest and wring this piece of our armour from us, and that because of its excellency and usefulnesse, yea, and often doth prevail to mar our use-making of it; So it would be our chiefest care to keep this grace of faith in daily exercise, and without delay to return to the exercise of it, when we have fallen from it: for, the word, rendred <hi>taking,</hi> signifieth to take again that which we have lost or let go; <hi>Above all, taking the shield of faith.</hi> 5. It is the Christian's duty to study the excellency and useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of any grace, and especially of faith, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may be incited to seek after it, and to make use of it; we must first put a price upon grace, before we be at any pains for it: for, that he may incite them to make use of faith, he informeth them of its excellency and usefulnesse, while he saith, <hi>wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts.</hi> 6. Though the devils and fallen angels be many, (See ver. 12.) yet so united are they in wickednesse and in carrying-on their wofull work under one chief head and prince, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 24, 26. as if they were but only one: for, therefore doth he speak of the devil as of one; <hi>the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi> 7. As Satan, that wicked one, his great work and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is to draw and drive others to sin and wickednesse; So, he hath several sorts of tentations which he maketh use of for that end, according to the diversity of sins


<pb n="458" facs="tcp:44180:397"/>
to which he tempteth, and the different tempers and dispositions of those whom he tempteth: he hath not only subtil wiles and strategems, spoken of, ver. 11. but also fiery darts, whether of violent boyling lusts, or raging despair, which he throweth afar off, and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernably with great force and violence, wherein they resemble darts; <hi>All the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi> 8. Among all the tentations which Satan maketh use of to carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his wofull work, his fiery darts are most hard to be resisted, and, where given way to, most dangerous, in so far as they give a double hurt and dammage, even as materiall fiery darts do both wound and burn; so those tentations being entertained, do not only defile the soul with guilt, but also disturb and disquiet it with their force and violence, <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 4. or, vex, perplex and put it to pain with that anxiety and horrour which they breed in it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13. for, he commendeth faith above all the rest, from its quenching those tentations, which implyeth, that they are both hardly resistible, and most dangerous; <hi>wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi> 9. The grace of faith, though never so well exercised, cannot hinder Satan to throw those fiery piercing tentations, nor yet doth it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes repel them, but sometimes they pierce even the Believers soul, where, finding suitable fewel, they raise a burning flame, and make great vastation and havock: for, while he saith, faith doth quench them, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, they will be sometimes boyling and burning within; <hi>ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts.</hi> 10. The grace of faith not only supplyeth the place of armour to ward off blows; but is also medicinall to cure those dangerous wounds, which the soul receiveth in this spiritual conflict through the prevalency of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and the negligent use-making of our other graces, it is both defending and healing armour: for, thereby <hi>we are able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi> 11. There is no spirituall disease or wound so desperate, no sin so prevalent in the soul, but the


<pb n="459" facs="tcp:44180:397"/>
grace of faith, rightly made use of in laying hold on the merit and vertue of Christs death, is sufficient to cure it and destroy it; yea, and to cure not only one disease, but many: for, he attributeth a vertue to it, to <hi>quench fiery darts;</hi> and <hi>all the fiery darts of the wicked.</hi>

                  <p>IN this verse are contained the fifth and sixth pieces of the spiritual armour which he will have them to take and make use of. The fifth is <hi>salvation,</hi> or the hope of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the thing hoped for, being put for <hi>hope,</hi> as the Apostle explaineth himself, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.—8. which hope, is a grace, whereby we patiently expect salvation, both temporal <hi>(Psal.</hi> 62. 1.) and eternal, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 2. but chiefly the latter, according to the promise apprehended by faith, and it answereth the part of the bodily armour called the <hi>helmet,</hi> or head-piece, which being the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est piece of all the rest, did defend the head and face, and was so composed as to make the souldier of dreadfull appearance unto his enemies. In like manner this grace of wel-grounded hope doth lift the heart upwards, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 9. keepeth the head safe and above water, so that the Christian sinketh not, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 16. Rom.</hi> 5. 3. 4. and bringeth him to so high a pitch of Christian cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage as maketh him formidable to his adversary, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 45, 46. The sixth piece of armour is the written <hi>Word of God,</hi> which answereth that part of the bodily armour called the <hi>sword,</hi> whereby the souldier useth both to defend himself and wound the enemy. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Word of God, laid up in the heart, and made use of pertinently by the Christian souldier, hath somewhat in it to ward off the blow of every tentation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 4, 7, 10. and maketh Satan retire as one ashamed and wounded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 10, 11. and it is here called <hi>the sword of the Spirit,</hi> because the Spirit of God hath revealed this Word, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21, it worketh powerfully upon


<pb n="460" facs="tcp:44180:398"/>
the spirits of men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. and its efficacy in working dependeth on the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 4. Doct.</hi> 1. Though believers have heaven and salvation already in right and by promise, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36—: yet, the Lord, for good and wise reasons, seeth it necessary to delay the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and not to give them present possession upon their right: for, if there were present possession given, there would be no need of this grace of hope, wherby the believer doth patiently expect salvation promised; <hi>and take the helmet of salvation,</hi> or <hi>of the hope of salvation.</hi> 2 The sincere believer, during the time of the not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of promised salvation, may cast his accompt to meet with many sore assaults, and sad stroaks from manifold tentations upon all hands: for, what need of an helmet, if there be not appearance of blows? <hi>and take the helmet of salvation.</hi> 3. A wel-grounded hope of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, according to the promise, is another necessary piece of the Christians armour, without the which he is deprived of one strong motive and encouragement to the work of sanctification in generall, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and laid open to several deadly blows and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous tentations from Satan, and more especially, to immoderate grief for the death of near relations, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 13. to the evil of covetousness and of placeing our portion and happiness in this life, as knowing nothing of a better, <hi>Psal.</hi> 17. 14. with 15. to the evils of faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, discouragement and dispaire, arising from delayed performance of what is promised, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 12. from hard sufferings and persecutions for the Gospel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. with 18. and from the fear of approaching death, the king of terrours, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 32. for, the Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth the Christian souldier to arm himself with this grace of hope; <hi>and take the helmet of salvation.</hi> 4. Though this saving grace of hope be stronger and weaker in several Christians, according as it hath more or less of a mixture of contrary diffidence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18. and though the meanest degree of hope doth serve for good purpose to defend the Christian in some measure against the


<pb n="461" facs="tcp:44180:398"/>
forementioned tentations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 5—. yet it is the Christian souldier's duty, in order to his better guarding against those deadly blows, to aim at no less than a full assurance of hope, even such as maketh him no less diffident to obtain salvation promised, than if he had it in hand: for, it seemeth the Apostle expresseth the grace of hope by salvation, the object of it, to shew their hope should be as much fixed as if they had salvation it self already in possession; <hi>and take the helmet of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 5. The Christian souldier is not alwayes and only to be upon the defending hand, nor to think it enough to keep his sinfull evils from prevailing further and growing stronger: but he must also endeavour to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue them, weaken them, and not to think himself exon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered untill he fully subdue them: for, the Spirit of God injoyneth the Christian souldier to make use, not only of defensive armour to guard himself; but of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive also, to pursue and kill the enemy; of which sort is the sword in bodily wars; <hi>and the sword of the Spirit.</hi> 6. Acquaintance with the Lords written Word, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a dexterous usemaking of it, is another necessary piece of the Christian his armour, without the which he cannot choose but he exposed to several dangerous blows and deadly tentations, seing he can neither know sin to be sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 7. nor the right way of resisting sin, or of discharging duty, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 9. and bearing afflictions with Christian courage and patience, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 39. but by the word; besides, that the timous calling to mind of a word in Scripture, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding and threatening such an evil, pressing the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of such a duty, and speaking incouragement and comfort to the soul exercised with such a cross, is often blessed of God, to break the strength of the tentation which inciteth to it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 10, 11. to furnish the heart with resolution and strength for duty, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. - 50. and with Christian courage under the cross, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 92. for, he commandeth the Christian souldier to arm himself with the knowledge of, and acquaintance with,


<pb n="462" facs="tcp:44180:399"/>
the Word of God; <hi>and the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.</hi> 7. As it is the only vertue and power of Gods Spirit, which enliveneth the Word, and maketh it effectual; So it is only the Word of God, and no humane inventions, or magical charmes, with which the Spirit of God doth joyn His power and efficacy to resist and drive away the devil; for, therefore he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Word <hi>the sword of the Spirit,</hi> and expoundeth it to be no other word, but the Word of God.</p>

                  <p>HEre is a seventh piece of this armour, or rather a duty, the practizing whereof is injoyned by God as a mean for obtaining all those forementioned pieces of the spiritual armour from Him, together with the right use-making of them against the enemy, and the Lords successfull blessing thereupon. This mean is the duty of prayer, whereby we offer up our desires to God, <hi>Psal,</hi> 62. 8. for things agreeable to His will, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 14. in the name of Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 23. with confession of our sins, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 5. 6. and thankfull acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His mercies, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 6. Which duty is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, not simply, but with six necessary qualifications, the opening up whereof, doth serve for so many do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins. As, 1. we must <hi>pray alwayes,</hi> which is not to be understood as if we were to do nothing else but pray; but the phrase implyeth frequency in this duty, and at all times, when opportunity offers, (the original word will bear so much) together with an endeavour to keep our hearts daily in a praying temper, that when God offereth occasion, we may not want a sutable frame and disposition. 2. We must use all kinds of prayer, two whereof are here expressed, first, <hi>prayer,</hi> strictly taken, whereby we seek these good things which we want from God. Next, <hi>supplication,</hi> whereby we deprecate evils


<pb n="463" facs="tcp:44180:399"/>
and judgements whether felt or feared. 3. Our prayers and supplications must be in <hi>the spirit,</hi> as not being a work of the lip, tongue and memory only; but of the heart and inward man, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 8. being stirred up and assisted by the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26, 27. 4. The exercise of prayer must be joyned with <hi>watchfulness,</hi> a watchfulness especially of the mind. See upon <hi>Col.</hi> 4. verse 2. doct. 3. 5. It must be with most importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate perseverance, called here <hi>all perseverance,</hi> implying, that we are not to break off begun diligence in the practice of this duty, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 1. yea, and are to reiterate our petitions for one and the same thing, so oft as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion offereth, untill it be granted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. a seeming repulse or deniall, making us more vehement, <hi>Luke 18. 5. Matth.</hi> 15. 22. &amp;c. Lastly, it must be extended unto others besides our selves, which others are first expressed more generally in this verse, to wit, <hi>all saints,</hi> that is, all these, who, having given up their name to Christ, are standing Church-members, and especially those who have more convincing evidences of saving grace than others. See upon <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. verse 21. doct. 2. Which is not to be understood, as if we were to pray for none but such: we ought to exclude none from our prayers who are in a capacity to be bettered by them, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5-16. no not our very enemies, <hi>Matth,</hi> 5. 44. only the saints are to have the chief room, both in our hearts, and also in our prayers, as in all other duties flowing from Christian charity, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. ver. 10. Hence <hi>Learn</hi> further, 1. The Christian souldier doth never receive so much from God, while he is upon earth, as to stand in need of no more; he needeth alwayes more grace to preserve and improve what is already bestowed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. and to supply emergent necessities and wants, whereof while he breatheth there will be alwayes some new dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries made, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. with 9. for, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this compleat armour given them by God, he will have them yet to be alwayes praying and seeking more; <hi>praying alwayes,</hi> saith he. 2. This whole and


<pb n="464" facs="tcp:44180:400"/>
compleat armour of God can do no good to the Christian souldier, either to defend himself, or to offend his adversary, without the Lords special assistance, and concurrance, whereby he actuateth those graces, and without the which, habitual grace could never be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved or made use of by us to any good purpose, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 13. for, therefore he directeth them, having put on this armour, to make their recourse to God by prayer for obtaining His special assistance to improve it aright; <hi>praying alwayes.</hi> 3. The exercise of prayer is most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be made conscience of by the Christian soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, as that, by which he obtaineth all his other armour from God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. with 37. together with special assistance to improve it, and apply it to work, as said is: hereby also he doth recover his armour when it is in a good part lost, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 10. fourbish, sharpen and make it clear, when it is eaten and consumed with the rust of security, deadness and hardness of heart, <hi>Isai.</hi> 63. 17. and by diligent prayer, Satans assaults and tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are either keeped off, and diverted, so that the other armour getteth not much a doe, <hi>Matth. 26. 41. Luke</hi> 21. 36. or otherwise vigorously resisted; and the other armour, the several graces of Gods Spirit, made thereby tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-proof, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 32. In a word, prayer is the souls swift and trusty messenger to God, for receiving new orders, new strength, and all things the Christian soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier needeth, either before, after, or in time of fight, and never returneth empty without an answer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16, 23, for, he injoyneth the exercise of prayer as most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the Christian souldier; <hi>praying alwayes.</hi> 4. As the Christian souldier is never fully freed from all his straits, necessities and wants; So he ought to live in the daily sense of his own emptiness, and in the faith of Gods fulness and willingness to supply all his wants; for, he should be <hi>praying alwayes,</hi> and therefore alwayes sensible of his need to pray, and confident of Gods rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness to answer, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 6. As there are severall sorts of prayer, some mental only, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 15. others vocal


<pb n="465" facs="tcp:44180:400"/>
also, <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 1. 2. some sudden or ejaculatory, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 2. -4. others more solemn and of greater length, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 30. And of those latter sort, again, some publick or Church-prayers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. others private or Family-prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3. and others secret, as Closset-prayers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. Some, again, are ordinary for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary causes, and performed at ordinary times, <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 17. others are extraordinary, upon some special and weighty occasions, requiring more than ordinary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and time of continuance, <hi>Joel</hi> 1. 14 &amp;c. So all those several sorts of prayer, are to be made conscience of, and none to be neglected, as God doth call to any of them: for, the Apostle, supponing there are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sorts of prayer, injoyneth them <hi>to pray with all prayer.</hi> 6. It pleaseth God to exercise his dearest children, not only with the want of several things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and good, but also with the presence of many things in themselves evil and hurtfull, and those evils both of sin and punishment, as for other reasons, so for this one, that of both the one and the other, they may be making daily errands unto God in prayer, for getting the former supplied, and the latter either removed or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented: for, as was shown in the exposition, by prayer strickly taken, and as distinguished from <hi>supplication,</hi> we seek those good things which we want; and by <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> we deprecate evils and judgements: Now, the Apostle enjoyneth them to use both those; <hi>With all prayer and supplication,</hi> saith he. 7. However there be more intense affection, and fervencie of spirit, together with more assistance from the Spirit of God required in some sort of prayers, to wit, extraordinary, <hi>(Ioel</hi> 2. 12. to 18.) than in others; yet all our prayers, even those which are ordinary, sudden and ejaculatory, ought to be joyned with some measure of spirituall fervencie and intense affection; neither can any of them be discharged aright without the assistance of, and influence from, the Spirit of God, as being a piece of most immediate worship to God, who is a Spirit, and will be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed


<pb n="466" facs="tcp:44180:401"/>
in spirit and truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24. for, he requireth that <hi>all prayer and supplication be in the Spirit.</hi> 8. There is not any duty which Satan is a greater enemy to, or our hearts more averse from, than this of prayer in the spirit, it being no small difficulty to bring our hearts up to it, to keep them at it, or make them walk like it afterwards: for, so much is supponed while he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the exercise of watchfulnesse, chiefly over the heart, in order to prayer; <hi>Watching thereunto.</hi> 9. Neither is there any duty which Satan is more earnest to make us quit and fall from, after we have begun well, and which our hearts are more apt to be discouraged and take up an halt in, than in this duty of praying in the spirit, and chiefly under delayed answers: for, so much is supponed, while he requireth them to persist <hi>with all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance,</hi> and this not only in some, but all sorts of prayer. 10. As Christians ought to pray for others as well as for themselves; So, the more lively, watchfull and importunate we are in praying for our selves, the more our heart will be enlarged with desire to take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection of the necessities of others, and to hold up their case to God: for, having enjoyned them to pray for themselves <hi>with all prayer and supplication, watching there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto with all perseverance,</hi> he biddeth them, next, <hi>make supplication</hi> for others, even <hi>for all Saints.</hi>

As the Lords people ought chiefly to mind those in their prayers who are most instrumentall in the work of God; So it is the duty of Christians, to be seeking the mutuall help of one anothers prayers, and for this end to acquaint one another with their pressing wants and necessities, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 16. and especially Ministers should crave the assistance of their prayers who are committed to his charge: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having exhorted them to pray for all Saints, ver. -18. doth here incite them to pray for himself in a speciall manner who was their Minister, and an eminent instrument in the Lords work; <hi>And for me,</hi> saith he. 2. The most able and gracious Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, are usually most sensible of that weight and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den which is in the ministeriall charge, and so much sensible, that to be fitted for the imployments of it, they see a necessity, not only of their own pains and study, their wrestling with God by prayer in secret; but also of the assistance and prayers of others: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> a gracious and able Minister, doth see it necessary to seek the help of others; <hi>And for me,</hi> saith he. 3. Not only is piety and knowledge required in a Minister, but also a gift of utterance, or a singular dexterity to expresse his conceptions unto others pertinently, plainly and taking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without which his other abilities can avail but little to inform the judgements, or work upon the affections of hearers: for, therefore doth <hi>Paul</hi> desire chiefly <hi>that utterance may be given unto him.</hi> 4. Whatever gift a Minister hath of this kind, whether naturally or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, yet when he cometh to the exercise of it in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,


<pb n="468" facs="tcp:44180:402"/>
he is not so much to rely upon his gift and skill of this kind, as to depend on God for immediate influence and assistance to strengthen his memory, uphold and order the organs of speech, and to give him the present and actuall exercise of his gift, lest he either miscarry in the use of it, or otherwise sacrifice to his own drag and net, when God is not depended on, and so provoke the Lord to blast his pains and make them uselesse: for, though <hi>Paul</hi> had already a gift of utterance, having now preached so long, and so well; yet he willeth them to seek not only the continuance, but also the actuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of it from God whenever he should be put to make use of it; <hi>And for me, that utterance may be given unto me.</hi> 5. A plausible gift of utterance, is not all which is required in a Minister, he must have faithfull bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to deliver his message, without base fear or partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, joyned with his utterance, otherwise he may tickle the ear, but cannot rouse up dead and sleeping consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: for, with utterance he desireth he may be assisted to <hi>open his mouth boldly.</hi> 6. So much incensed are people usually at plain dealing in their Ministers, so little can they endure to be used by them with holy freedom and boldnesse, <hi>Isa.</hi> 30. 10. So much is there of unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied fear of flesh, even in the best of Ministers, <hi>Matth:</hi> 10. 26, 28. together with a sinfull loathnesse to intrust the Lord with the event or personall hazards which may follow upon their faithfull boldnesse, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 10, 13. that there is need of speciall assistance and present influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from God, to make a Minister open his mouth boldly, concealing no necessary truth, forebearing the reproof of no known vice, and fearing no flesh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard had unto any hazard or losse he may meet with for so doing: for, <hi>Paul</hi> will have them to seek from God on this behalf, <hi>That he may open his mouth boldly.</hi> 7. The serious perpending of the excellencie, worth and mysteriousnesse of the subject, the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and making known whereof, is intrusted to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, would tend to convince them abundantly of their


<pb n="469" facs="tcp:44180:402"/>
own insufficiency for such a task, and of the need they stand in of assistance from God, and the help of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples prayers for obtaining His assistance: for, this moved <hi>Paul</hi> to distrust his own strength, and to seek the help of their prayers; even <hi>that he was to make known the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the Gospel.</hi> 8. The great end for which Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters should be earnest with God for furniture and through-bearing themselves, and incite others to plead with Him on their behalf, is not that by vertue thereof they may gain applause, or get themselves exonered before men, but that the Lords people may be edified, and Christ exalted, by laying open what rich and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things are held forth of Him in the Gospel: for, the end why he desireth a gift of utterance and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is, <hi>to make known the mysterie of the Gospel.</hi>

                  <p>HE doth, first, give two reasons, exciting them to pray for him; First, from his office, he was intrusted by God, as an ambassadour in Christs stead, to publish the glad tydings of Reconciliation with God, contained in the Gospel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. Secondly, from his bonds, which did not hinder him to preach, seing as the original word, signifying <hi>in a chain,</hi> doth imply that at this time he was not bound with fetters, but in the custody of a Souldier with whom he might go abroad, having (as the custom of some prisoners was) a chain on his right arm, which was tied to the Souldier's left arm. Next, he repeateth the gift which he would have them to seek from God on his behalf, even to deliver his message with courage and boldnesse: and he extendeth it further to all those other things which a Minister ought to advert unto in preaching. See upon <hi>Col.</hi> 4. ver. 4. doct. 11. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As Christs Ministers do in a singular manner represent His Person, and being cloathed with authority from Him, are sent to treat and transact about


<pb n="470" facs="tcp:44180:403"/>
the greatest matters on earth in His Name, even the making up of peace and friendship betwixt God and sinners, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. So, their deportment, for gravity, prudence and holinesse, ought to be such, as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliate authority to their message, and bring no disgrace or rub upon Him whose Person they do sustain. It is their duty also to mannage their trust with faithfulnesse, speaking nothing but what they have a Commission for from Christ their Master, concealing nothing of what is intrusted to them to speak, but delivering all of it with that authority and gravity, boldnesse and majesty which becometh the ambassadours of Him who is Prince of the Kings of the earth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. -5- for, such is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and duty of ambassadours among earthly princes; and though this title of ambassadour for Christ, did belong to the Apostles in all respects chiefly, and in some respects to them only, as that they were confined to no certain charge, or country, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. and absolutely to be trusted as men who could not erre, at least in what they wrote, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16-. yet as to many other respects, and chiefly those which are mentioned in the Doctrine, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The matter and purpose contained in the Gospel, even the way of making peace between God and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is a businesse of great importance in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and such as he would have bear weight with us: for, an ambassadour is not sent among Princes and States for triffles, but for things of highest concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now, God sendeth ambassadours to carry the message of the Gospel: <hi>For which Gospel I am an ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,</hi> saith he. 3. So great desire hath God, that lost sinners embrace the Gospel with His peace and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship offered in it, that He dealeth with them not as with traitours and rebels; but as persons of dignity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, that thereby they may be the more induced to accept His offers: for, Kings and States send not am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours


<pb n="471" facs="tcp:44180:403"/>
to private obscure men, but to persons of respect and worth. Now, God sendeth ambassadours with the Gospel to sinners: <hi>For which I am an ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour.</hi> 4. That God doth graciously condescend to send an honourable embassage for peace and friendship to worthlesse traitours and rebels, it should make the Lords people mind and respect those who are intrusted with it, and particularly to hold up their case unto God by prayer for strength, wisdom, and every other thing which becometh those who are imployed in such an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable errand from the great God: for, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iddeth them pray for him, because he was an ambassadour sent from God with the Gospel; <hi>For which I am an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour.</hi> 5. Though our provoked Lord doth send a message of peace and friendship unto a rebellious world, and putteth respect upon them by sending ambassadours to them in His stead; yet, such is their ingratitude, and such enemies are they to their own mercies, that in place of giving a thankfull meeting to such kind usage, they do what they can to affront the Lord, not only by sleighting His message. <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 11. but by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull usage of His ambassadours, contrary to the law and practice of all Nations: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> though Christs <hi>ambassadour,</hi> was neverthelesse put in bonds <hi>for the Gospel.</hi> 6. As it concerneth the Lords people to pray to God for their Ministers at all times; So chiefly when they are in a suffering case, lest through their faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the day of adversity, they give the truth of God a dash, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 19, 20. and that they may be enabled by God to bear persecution with such undaunted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage as persecuters may see their labour to be but in vain, <hi>Acts 5. 34, &amp;c.</hi> and the truth of God, for which they suffer, may receive no hurt but advantage by their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 12. for, he urgeth them to pray for him, from this, that for the Gospel <hi>he was an ambassadour in bonds.</hi> 7. So mercifull and long-suffering is God, that when His offer of friendship is rejected by rebels and His ambassadours, contrary to the law of Nations


<pb n="472" facs="tcp:44180:404"/>
imprisoned and wronged; yet, he doth not presently give up with them, and denounce an irreconciliable war against them, but pursueth them with kindnesse, and in a manner beggeth their peace, and will not take a refusall: for, His will was, that <hi>Paul,</hi> being put in bonds by them, should yet discharge the office of an ambassadour towards them, and deliver the message of peace, even to those who put him and keeped him in bonds, if they would have come to hear him; <hi>For which I am an ambassadour in bonds.</hi> 8. So zealous should Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters be of Christs honour and the good of souls, that no sufferings for the Gospel should make them quit the preaching of it; but even when through persecution they are restrained of that liberty which they sometimes had, they ought to be alwayes doing and making use of what liberty they have: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> though in bonds, is yet doing the office of an ambassadour, and thirsting after a spirit of courage from God, for discharging of it, faithfully and boldly; <hi>I am an ambassadour in bonds,</hi> that <hi>therein,</hi> or <hi>thereof,</hi> meaning the Gospel, <hi>I may speak boldly.</hi> 9. The Lord setteth bounds to the wrath of men, in so far as he doth easily abate the extremity of their rage towards His Servants, and doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to come to its full height, so long as He hath any use to make of them: for, though their rage carried them to put <hi>Paul</hi> in a chain, yet he restrained them, from making him a close prisoner, he had liberty to preach notwithstanding; <hi>That therein I may speak boldly,</hi> saith he. 10. The Lords Servants are to deliver the truths of God with much holy freedom and boldnesse, not only when they are far from apparent danger, but even when they are in the mouth of hazard, and ready to be swallowed up by it: If they speak at all, as speak they must, when God doth call them to it, it must be done without all base fear of flesh, with such confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and boldness as may evidence they are not asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their Master or message: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> even <hi>in bonds,</hi> resolveth to <hi>speak the Gospel boldly,</hi> and craveth the help


<pb n="473" facs="tcp:44180:404"/>
of their prayers for that end. 11. However an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled heart, puft up with pride and confidence in his own strength, may judge it a task of no great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to carry a suffering lot with undaunted courage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be put to it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 33. and will readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all as faint-hearted cowards and base back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliders who ride not out the storm with as much chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, courage and resolution, as they conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves would do, <hi>Job</hi> 4. 5, 6. yet, an humbled heart, acquainted with sufferings, will not judge so, but so conscious is he of his own weaknesse, and knoweth so well how hard it is for flesh and bloud to deny it self, to postpone its own safety to the keeping of a good conscience, how ready it is to faint under a continued crosse, and find out subterfuges of subtile distinctions, thereby to plead for ease and sparing of it self, that he dare not trust his own strength, nor neglect, far lesse contemn, the use of any mean appointed by God for his encouragement and strengthening: for, <hi>Paul</hi> seeth it was no easie thing to speak boldly when in bonds, and that only God could make him so to do; and therefore beggeth the help of their prayers, as a mean appointed for obtaining courage from the Lord; <hi>I am an ambassadour in bonds, that therein I may speak boldly.</hi> 12. It is not every sort of boldnesse in speach, which a Minister ought to aim at, but such as is beseeming the excellency of his message, the gravity of his office, and may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce most to the end of his Ministery, the glory of God and good of the hearers; It is not fleshly boldnesse, or rather brazen-faced impudence, to vent every thing may tend to commend a man to his hearers, or to please their fleshly humours; not is it foolish temerity, or presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous rashnesse, to speak and utter the holy Oracles of God, without premeditation or serious consideration of what is most fitting to be uttered, and likely to have successe, at such a time, on such persons, and in such a place; But it is a spirituall holy boldnesse, conjoyned with modesty, gravity and prudence, and such as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth

alongst with it in the person where it is, the sense and feeling of his own infirmities, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2. 3. for, the beseemingnesse and decency, here spoken of, as it may be extended to all those necessary qualifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in a Minister; So it doth chiefly qualifie that boldnesse presently spoken of; <hi>That I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apostle, being now in the third part of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to conclude the Epistle, doth, first, shew, that because he neither could write, nor was it expedient to write of every thing in the body of the Epistle, he had concredited much to the bearer, who was to give them an account especially of <hi>Pauls own affairs,</hi> as how it went with him in prison, how the work of the Gospel did thrive by his Ministery, and generally <hi>how he did,</hi> or how he carried himself with courage and constancy under every dispensation. And that the bearer might get the more respect and credit, he is described, 1. from his name <hi>Tychicus.</hi> See <hi>Act.</hi> 20. -4. 2. from his state as a Christian, in which respect he is called a <hi>brother.</hi> See upon <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 25. doct. 1. and <hi>a beloved brother,</hi> thereby to shew that he was loved by <hi>Paul,</hi> and worthy to be loved by them for his piety and parts. 3. from his office, in which respect he was a <hi>minister,</hi> and <hi>a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minister in the Lord,</hi> as answering the trust reposed in him by the Lord Christ, whose servant he was. 4. from the confidence which <hi>Paul</hi> professeth he had of his fidelity in his present imployment, while he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth them he would keep up nothing which it concerned them to know. Hence <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word of God in Scripture is so contrived, that though nothing necessary unto salvation be omitted. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 31. yet our vain curiositie to know other


<pb n="475" facs="tcp:44180:405"/>
things not so necessary to be known, is not thereby satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> having committed unto writing the sum of necessary doctrine, relating both to faith and manners for the Churches benefit in all ages, doth not write any thing of his own particular concernments, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusteth them to the bearer, as not so necessary to be known to the ages following as to the age then present; <hi>But that ye may also know my affairs, Tychicus shall make known all things.</hi> 2. The life and conversation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and chiefly of Ministers, in publick and privat, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all cases, ought to be such, as they need not to be ashamed, who do know it; yea, and edification to the Church of God may arise from the knowledge of it: for, such was <hi>Pauls</hi> conversation, he acquainteth <hi>Tychicus</hi> with all, and sendeth him to <hi>Ephesus</hi> to acquaint the Church there with all. 3. It concerneth Christians much to inform themselves of the life and way of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent men in the Church of God, and chiefly of those who are, or have been sufferers for truth, and of the severall passages of Gods gracious providence towards such, though not to satisfie their vain curiosity, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 21. yet that thereby they may be incited to simpathize with them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 3. to follow their example, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. 10. and to blesse the Lord on their behalf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 11. for, therefore doth <hi>Paul</hi> send <hi>Tychicus</hi> to <hi>make them know his affairs,</hi> and how he did. 4. A Minister ought to be so affectionate towards his flock, as to prefer their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual edification and advantage to his own private concernment: for, though <hi>Paul</hi> was now every day expecting death, and had few to attend upon him, as appeareth from 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 6, 10. with 12, 16. yet he send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Tychicus</hi> unto them, choosing rather that himself should want an attender, than they a comforter; <hi>Tychicus shall make known unto you all things.</hi> 5. The Minister of Christ should in like manner be ordered with prudence in giving expressions of his affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the flock, least otherwise his imprudent carriage in the manner of what is done, doth more hurt than the


<pb n="476" facs="tcp:44180:406"/>
thing it self can bring of good and advantage: for, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apostle doth not commit the evidences of his affection to be carried to them by every man, but one whom he could trust, and they would respect, even to <hi>Tychicus a beloved brother and faithfull minister.</hi> 6. As Ministers would be loath to give their recommendation and testimony to naughty persons and those who are not deserving, least thereby they wrong the Church of God, and prejudge their own estimation afterwards when the person recommended by them doth not walk answerably; So they should not deny a testimony to those whom they know to be deserving; so far should they be from labouring to obscure and bear down the graces and gifts of God which are eminent in any of their fellow-labourers, of purpose that they themselves alone may be thought of: for, <hi>Tychicus</hi> was a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving, and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> doth recommend him, which without doubt he would not have done other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; <hi>Tychicus a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord.</hi> 7. Though God may make use of unconverted Ministers to do good in his Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 4. with 8. yet no man can be a faithfull Minister, or approved of God in His work, except he have saving grace and be in Christ by faith: for, <hi>Tychicus</hi> is first a brother as a sound Christian, and then a <hi>faithfull minister in the Lord:</hi> 8. That Ministers are beloved one of another, and live in love among themselves, is a strong inducement to make the Lords people allow them room in their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and receive their message with better will off their hand: and divisions, carnal emulations, and strifes among Ministers themselves, make both their persons and office lose much of their deserved respect among the people: for <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, that <hi>Tychicus</hi> was beloved by him, to make him have the more respect from them; <hi>Tychicus a beloved brother.</hi> 9. It is in a singular manner required of a Minister, and the prime piece of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters commendation, that he be faithfull, that is, diligent in his work, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. sincere in his aimes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours

A faithfull Minister will give proof of his fidelity in all the pieces of his imployment, not only in publick preaching, but also in his private coversing with the Lords people; yea, and in every thing will labour to answer the trust reposed upon him: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth <hi>Tychicus</hi> would be faithfull, even in relating the case and state of <hi>Pauls</hi> particular affairs; <hi>he shall make known unto you all things.</hi>

The greater paines are taken by Christ's servants to bring matter of edification and spiritual consolation unto the Lords people, they ought to receive it with so much the better will and likeing: for, <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth that both he and <hi>Tychicus</hi> were at the pains, the one to send, the other to be sent unto them, of purpose, hereby to induce them the more to receive the message sent; <hi>Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose.</hi> 2. The putting a right impression of the case of Christ's suffering servants, and the state of the Gospels thriving upon the hearts of Christians in other remote parts of the Church, is a


<pb n="478" facs="tcp:44180:407"/>
work worth the care and pains of most eminent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, if it were to make them undergo a long and tedious journey for that same very end: for, <hi>Tychicus was sent unto them for the same purpose, that they might know his affairs.</hi> 3. We should labour so to inform our selves of the case and carriage of others, and how it goeth with the affairs of Christ's Kingdom elsewhere, as to be drawing matter of spiritual edification thence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently not to feed our curious humour: for, <hi>Tychicus</hi> in making known <hi>Pauls</hi> affairs, was to aim at their spiritual consolation, much more were they to aim at it themselves; <hi>that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.</hi> 4. It is the duty of every Christian, and chiefly of a faithfull Minister, to have this end proposed unto himself in all his friendly visits bestowed upon his acquaintance, and chiefly upon his flock in all his familiar conferences with them, in all the intelligence he communicateth unto them, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods dealing with his Churches abroad, even that thereby they may not trifle-by precious time, or only satisfie curious ears, but furnish some matter of spiritual edification for bettering the inward man: for, <hi>Tychicus</hi> was to make them know <hi>Pauls</hi> affairs, for this end, that thereby <hi>he might comfort their hearts.</hi> 5. To know the several passages of Gods gracious providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards His suffering servants, together with their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted courage under sufferings, and the use which God doth make of their sufferings to advance His truth and cause, is and may be sufficient ground of comfort and incouragement unto the Lords people, against the sorrow and sadnesse, which their sharp sufferings, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in themselves, cannot choose but affect the lovers of truth with: for, <hi>Paul</hi> implyeth, that their hearing of his sufferings had sadded them, and sheweth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Gods dealing with him would comfort them; <hi>that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.</hi> 6. A Christian sufferer, supported by God, will not be so anxious about his own case, as the case


<pb n="479" facs="tcp:44180:407"/>
of others of the Lords people whom he knoweth to be in sorrow and heavinesse; yea, and ready to halt, and be scandalized for His cause: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> knowing their grief, and fearing their fainting at his tribulations, chapter 3. 14. doth send <hi>Tychicus of purpose to comfort their hearts.</hi>

                  <p>NExt, in the conclusion of the Epistle, is contained the Apostles ordinary fare-well wish: wherein, designing those to whom he writeth by the name of <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> he wisheth unto them in particular, 1. <hi>Peace,</hi> that is, peace with God, with their own conscience, one with another, and all sort of prosperity. 2. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall love among themselves; for, Gods love to them is comprehended under <hi>grace</hi> in the following verse. 3. The grace of faith, the fountain of the former, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5. All which he wisheth <hi>from God the Father,</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding but including the Son and holy Ghost; (See upon <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 17. doct. 3.) and <hi>from Jesus Christ</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, through vertue of whose merit and intercession all saving benefits are conveyed unto the Elect. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Ministers, who would have their pains attended with successe towards the Lords people, ought to beg that from God by prayer to be wrought in them, which by their preaching they endeavour to inculcate on them: for, peace, love and faith, are the sum of all which he hath been presently instructing them in, and pressing upon them, and here he seeketh all from God by prayer; <hi>Peace be to the brethren.</hi> 2. A Ministers prayers for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Lords blessing upon his pains towards his flock, should be serious, servent, insisted upon, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inculcated untill a gracious answer thereof be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for, the Apostle began with this prayer, or wish, chap. 1. 2. and here he closeth with it; <hi>Peace be to the brethren.</hi> 3. Even Believers are not made perfect in


<pb n="480" facs="tcp:44180:408"/>
grace at the first, the Lord doth carry on that work by steps and degrees, that somewhat of Him may be seen in every step; and therefore as themselves are bound to grow in grace, by adding one grace to another, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6. and one degree of the same grace to the former, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. So, it is the duty of others to help them on towards growth by their prayers and wishes: for, those who were already regenerated among the Ephesians, had faith, love, and peace wrought in them at the first, and <hi>Paul</hi> wisheth here a further degree of, and growth in, those from God to them; <hi>Peace be to the brethren.</hi> 4. Though it be the duty of all to live in peace and love, yet a truely Christian and peaceable frame of spirit, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with love, which is not a meer moral vertue, but a saving grace flowing from the root of faith, is only to be found among true Believers, and should be sought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after by such especially; coldrifenesse of affection, and unpeaceable walking, being more unbeseeming them than any others: for, therefore doth he wish for <hi>peace and love to the brethren,</hi> that is, those chiefly who were brethren in Christ and born of God. 5. There cannot be a peaceable frame of spirit in any towards others, nor yet an harmonious walking with them, nor any thing else, except sinfull renting and shamelesse striving, but where the grace of love is; whereby the heart is armed against all irritations arising from the infirmities of others to break the bond of peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 2, 3. for, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth these two in his wish, <hi>peace,</hi> whereof, one branch is a peaceable frame of heart and harmonious walking, and <hi>love: Peace be to the brethren, and love.</hi> 6. As the graces of faith and love are different, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the one cannot be the form or essence of the other; So they are alwayes conjoyned; where one is, there the other must be also: for, he speaketh of them as two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent graces, whereof the one doth necessarily follow upon the other; <hi>And love with faith.</hi> 7. See what is already observed from <hi>Gal. 1. 3. Philip. 1. 2. Col.</hi> 1. -2. upon the persons from whom, and through whom

                  <p>HEre the Apostle wisheth for grace, that is, Gods free favour and love in Christ, the fountain and sum of all the former good things wished-for, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth his wish towards all Believers, described from this, that they <hi>love Jesus Christ in sincerity,</hi> or incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption (as the word signifieth) that is, not for a time only, but constantly, not in hypocrisie, or shew only, but sincerely and really; and so closeth up all with his <hi>Amen,</hi> as an evidence both of his affectionate desire and confidence of an answer. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though we may have a more particular eye to some than to others, by making mention of them expresly in our prayers because of our charge of them, present imployment about them, or other near relations towards them; yet, we ought not to exclude any, especially of these who have relation to Christ, but are to remember all such, at least in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and seek the same good things from God to them which we wish for others: for, the Apostle, having made expresse mention of the believing Ephesians, under the name of <hi>Brethren,</hi> ver. 23. doth here extend his charity and prayers towards all who love our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ in generall; <hi>Grace be with all them,</hi> saith he. 2. The more the heart is exercised in spirituall duties, especially in prayer, it groweth more warm and more enlarged to the exercise of all those saving graces, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in that duty, and especially to publick-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the exercise of charity towards the Saints, and of faith in Jesus Christ: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> continuing his prayers and wish untill this verse, getteth his charity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged in the exercise of it, towards all Christians in generall, and his faith strengthened to the owning of Christ as his own; <hi>Grace be with all that love our Lord.</hi>


                     <pb n="482" facs="tcp:44180:409"/>
3. Gods grace, or free favour, is the sum of all which a man needeth to wish, either for himself or others, it is virtually all things, so that the man that hath it, wanteth nothing; he hath all good and necessary things in their cause and fountain, he doth also possesse all such things in that measure God seeth fitting for him: for, in this part of his wish, which relateth to all lovers of Christ in generall, he doth only make expresse mention of <hi>grace,</hi> as virtually comprysing peace, love and faith, which he wished to the brethren, ver. 23. <hi>Grace be with all them that love our Lord.</hi> 4. Love to Jesus Christ, is a sure mark of those who have saving interest in the good things purchased by Him, and one of those marks which are best known to the person who hath it; love to Christ where it is, cannot be well hid: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> designing those who might plead interest in the good things pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed-for, describeth them by their love to Christ, as being a mark both sure and easily discerned; <hi>With all them that love our Lord.</hi> 5. The Lords Servants ought to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, that those, who are in a gracious state, and have right to the great and good things purchased by Christ, may know so much, and for that end would furnish them with the knowledge of such marks and evidences as may be most easily discerned where they are, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly prove the soul that hath them to be in a state of grace: for, <hi>Paul</hi> giveth such a mark of those who had interest in the good things prayed-for, even love to Christ, that they might know so much of themselves; <hi>With all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> 6. It is the duty of Ministers to lay hold on all occasions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this grace of love to Christ, by holding forth those many good and excellent things which do accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it, and are made evident to be in the heart by it, that so the Lords people may be the more incited to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow their love and heart upon Him: for, <hi>Paul,</hi> to stir them up to the love of Christ, recommendeth this grace, by making it the mark and evidence of the man that hath interest in all the good things wished-for; <hi>with


<pb n="483" facs="tcp:44180:409"/>
all them that love our Lord.</hi> 7. Though we are bound to pray even for those who are graclesse, that God may bestow grace upon them; yet the more speaking evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences there be of true grace in any, we may be the more encouraged to pray to God for them, and with greater confidence to expect a gracious return of our prayers upon them: for, <hi>Pauls</hi> wishes to God, to which he affixeth an <hi>Amen,</hi> in evidence of his confidence to be heard, are put up in behalf of those who do <hi>love our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> 8. As there are many who professe love to Christ, whose love is, and, when it is tryed, will be found to be but counterfeir, unsincere and not reall; So the good things promised to those who love the Lord Jesus Christ, do not at all belong to any of that sort, whatsoever their deluded hearts may sancie to the contrary, but to such only, who love Him really, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, and testifie their love into Him by keeping His commandments, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 15. and especially by loving those who are His, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 20, 21. for, the Apostle qualifieth that love to Christ, which is an evidence of interest in the good things wished-for, by sincerity: which implyeth there is somelove not sincere; <hi>That love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.</hi> 9. The more sincere a man is in the exercise of any grace, or practice of any duty, he will endure the longer; sincerity in good is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes attended with perseverance, but hypocrisie doth soon faint and wholly sit up at the last, <hi>Joh.</hi> 27. 8, 9. with 10. So much is implyed by the word, here rendered <hi>sincerity,</hi> as <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. -7. which also signifieth <hi>incorruption: That love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity,</hi>
