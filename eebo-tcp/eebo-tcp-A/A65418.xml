            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF one were to draw the Scheme of one of the most Despotick Governments in the World, he needed not go so far as <hi>Constantinople, Moscow,</hi> or some of the Eastern Courts, for a Copy to Design after; <hi>Scotland</hi> alone might sufficiently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him with all the <hi>Idea</hi>'s of Oppression, Injustice and Tyranny, concentred for the space of Twenty Years and upwards in that Kingdom. To display the Tragick Scene of these three Kingdoms in their most lively Colours, would require the imitation
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60533:5"/>
of that celebrated piece of Antiquity, <hi>the Sacrifice of Iphiginia,</hi> where every on-looking <hi>Graecian</hi> appeared sad, and the sadder as they stood in nearer relation to the Royal Victim: But the Painter, conscious of the weakness of Art, to express the grief of <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi> chose rather to draw a veil over a discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate Father's Face, than vainly to endeavour the tracing the sorrows of his Countenance by the Pencil. <hi>England</hi>'s dismal State, for some years past, requires to be exprest in mournful Characters, that of <hi>Ireland</hi> perhaps in more mournful yet; but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineate the unexampled misery of <hi>Scotland,</hi> surpasses the Power of History, or the Force of Eloquence. To look back upon <hi>Athens</hi> under the Government of the Thirty Tyrants, on <hi>Rome</hi> under the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virate, or on these three Kingdoms under the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> might surnish some weak draughts, to take up a Notion of the late condition of that Nation; but all of them would fall short of the <hi>Scotch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Original. It were in vain to attempt the History of <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the two last Reigns, in a Paper of this kind; the Materials being large enough for the most bulky Volume: And if ever I should venture upon it apart, it is more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, I might find that Maxim verified at my cost, <hi>Curae leves loquantur, ingentes stupent;</hi> and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I am not altogether able to divest my self so far of Humanity, as to forget my own share in the Ruines of my Country.</p>
            <p>My design, at present, is only to make some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections <hi>on a Proclamation issued out by the late King</hi> Iames, <hi>with relation to his pretended Subjects</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:60533:5"/>
               <hi>of</hi> Scotland, dated at <hi>Dublin</hi> the Fourth of <hi>May</hi> last, Signed by Himself, and countersigned by my Lord <hi>Melfort;</hi> in which it's hard to determine, whether ill Nature, or want of Politicks, takes most place, both of them outvying one another for Precedency. Only upon first view it will be found, that the late Conspiracy in that Kingdom, is the Native Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of this Proclamation; and though that Plot had amounted to a design of Assassinating their Majesties High Commissioner, and the whole Members of Parliament; yet the Actors of such a Villainy are not only by this Proclamation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnified, but fairly invited and required so to do.</p>
            <p>The Proclamation begins thus: <hi>Iames,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>To all our Loving Subjects of our ancient Kingdom of</hi> Scotland, <hi>Greeting. Whereas several of our Subjects, men of pernicious Principles and wicked Designs, have taken upon themselves, contrair to the Law of God, their Natural Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to Us their Lawful and Undoubted Sovereign, the Laws and Acts of Parliament of that Our ancient Kingdom, to meet in an Assembly, to call themselves the States of that Kingdom, and therein treasonably and wickedly to question Our Authority, and to judge of Our Proceedings; and finally to dispose of Our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown, which We hold from God alone, Usurping Our Power which is not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to any, whether single Persons, or Bodies Collective, without Our Authority be interposed thereto: And that these Wicked and Lawless</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60533:6"/>
               <hi>Persons still go on to oppress our People by heavy Burdens, Imprisonments, and other things grievous to Our Subjects, contrair to all Law and Equity, as well as to Our Royal Right and Prerogative, uniting themselves with the Prince of</hi> Orange <hi>and his Adherents.</hi> All these blustering Expressions might have a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable good Grace in the Mouth of the <hi>Grand Segniour,</hi> or <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> who vainly arrogate to themselves the High-flown Titles of <hi>King of Kings;</hi> but if they can be at any rate excusable in King <hi>Iames,</hi> it must be upon the Supposition of these two Principles. First, <hi>That King</hi> Iames, <hi>as King of</hi> Scotland, <hi>was so far an Arbitrary and Despotick Prince, that he was not obliged to govern by Law, and could in no case forfeit his Right to the Crown.</hi> And Secondly, <hi>That he was unjustly, by the States of the Kingdom, laid aside.</hi> Now if it can be made appear, That in the first place, <hi>the Royal Dignity of</hi> Scotland <hi>is so far from being an Arbitrary and Despotick kind of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that it carries along with it, in its very Essence, a mixture of Interests betwixt King and People, and an obligation upon the King to govern, not by his own Edicts, or Will, but by the known Laws of the Land;</hi> which are indeed the two great hinges of the Government: And in the second place, <hi>That King</hi> Iames <hi>did forfeit his Right to the Crown, by subverting these two fundamental Hinges of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and thereupon that the States of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom did justly lay him aside:</hi> I say, if these two General Heads be made appear, then necessarily the other two supposed Principles fall in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, and the above mentioned Narrative of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60533:6"/>
the Proclamation as built upon them, must tumble with them.</p>
            <p>As to the First General Head, <hi>That the Royal Dignity of</hi> Scotland <hi>is so far from being an Arbitrary and Despotick kind of Government, that it carries along with it, in its very Essence, a mixture of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests betwixt King and People, and an obligation upon the King to govern according to Law.</hi> Here I shall not run up the length that our Histories have with any probability traced the Affairs of our Nation, where we may, upon the one Hand, find our selves one of the most Ancient Kingdoms of the World, under one Line of Kings; So on the other, we shall meet all along the clearest prints of a bounded and mixed Government: Nor shall we be able, in all the changes of our Monarchy, to instance one of our Kings, that pretended to such an Absolute Power over his Subjects, <hi>as every one of them was to obey without reserve;</hi> the new coining of these Words, and the making use of the thing signified by them, being reserved for the Reign of the late King <hi>Iames:</hi> Nor will I presume to pass Censure upon some Acts of Parliament made of late, that have stretch'd the Prerogative of the King, and the Obedience of the Subject beyond their ordinary limits; Acts of Parliament being, in my Opinion, only subject to the Censure of those that can unmake them. I shall only (to put this General Head beyond question) take a short hint of the Nature of the Government of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as it is agreed to by all Parties; and then fix upon that particular Constitution, by which the King is obliged to govern according to the Laws of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60533:7"/>That the Government of <hi>Scotland,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the Acts of Parliament made in the last two Reigns, in favour of the Prerogative, was and is a mixed sort of Government, is clear from this part of its constitution, That the three Estates of Parliament, and every one of them, are equally as necessary and essential to the making of Laws, as the King is. It is the King, and the three Estates of Parliament all together, that make Laws, and not the King alone, nor the three Estates, nor the King with any one or two of the three Estates: Here there is one Negative Vote lodged in the King, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lodged in the Parliament; for albeit the King, or his Commissioner, should bring in a Bill in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, stampt with the Royal Assent, the Estates of Parliament, by their Negative Vote, may deny their Concurrence, and thereupon it proves an Abortive; so on the other hand, what-ever Sanctions are enacted by the Estates of Parliament, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount no higher than so many dead Letters, till once the King withdraw his Negative, and imprint upon them his enlivening Assent.</p>
            <p>This being the Native uncontroverted Constitution of our Government, I would fain know what becomes of our new coin'd <hi>Absolute Power, which all were to obey without reserve;</hi> since a Power in the People, to deny their Concurrence with the King, in making of Laws, is an uncontroverted essential part of the Original Constitution.</p>
            <p>And to place this in as clear a light as possible, let us suppose the King should cause be presented to the Parliament, somewhat in form of an Act, and should back it with a Command to the Estates, to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60533:7"/>
give their Concurrence; in this case, by <hi>the Absolute Power we are to obey without reserve,</hi> the Parliament is directly obliged to concur; and thereby <hi>that essential part</hi> of the Government, which gives them a Negative Vote in making of Laws, is totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinged: Yea farther, though the King should, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consulting his Parliament, lay his Commands upon his Subjects, in matters that natively require a Parliamentary Sanction, such as Taxes, and the like; this late assumed <hi>Absolute Power</hi> does as much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force obedience thereto, as if there were an Act of Parliament concurring; because, if it should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that such a Sanction is illegal, as not done in Parliament; that very pretence it self is a <hi>reserve</hi> upon their Obedience, and <hi>all reserves</hi> whatever, King <hi>Iames</hi> was pleased to exclude. In fine, if a Man be obliged to obey without reserve, then all Laws and Acts of Parliament, cease <hi>ipso facto</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obligatory, when once the King takes it upon him, by Vertue of this Absolute Power, to command the contrary.</p>
            <p>As the Government of <hi>Scotland</hi> is in it self a <hi>mixed Government,</hi> so likewise our Ancestors have been so careful to preserve it in an equal poize, that they have thought fit <hi>ex superabundante,</hi> to bind up the King from invading the fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, or venturing on an unlimited Power, by the most Sacred Tye among Men, a <hi>Solemn Oath</hi> and Promise at his Coronation, <hi>to govern according to the Laws of the Land,</hi> that is, these made by the

King and Parliament: And <hi>this Obligation upon the the King to govern according to Law,</hi> I take to be <hi>the second fundamental Hinge</hi> of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>That there was a Contract betwixt the King and People, equivalent to a Coronation Oath, at the very first founding of our Monarchy, we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Vestiges in our History: And in <hi>Corbred</hi>'s time, he is said to have Sworn, <hi>Se majorum consiliis aquieturum:</hi> i. e. <hi>That he should be determined by the advice of the Elders;</hi> which at that time must needs be something of the Nature of Parliaments: And <hi>Gregory,</hi> named the Great in our Antiquaries, was Sworn <hi>to maintain the Liberties of the Christian Religion:</hi> And <hi>Mackbeth</hi> another of our Kings, is said to be Sworn <hi>to maintain the Commons of the Realm.</hi> Yea, the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> were so far from pretending to an unlimited Power over their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, That we find in <hi>Finnanus</hi>'s Reign, the Tenth of our Kings, a formal Stipulation betwixt him and the People in these<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Words, <hi>That the Kings in time coming, should do nothing of any great Concernment without the Authority of their publick Counsel; that he should manage no publick business which belonged to the Kingdom, without the advice and conduct of the Elders, nor should make Peace or War, nor enter into Leagues, or break them by himself, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of these Elders, and the Heads of the Tribes.</hi> This continued a fundamental Law of the Kingdom for a great many Ages; and the breach of it prov'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60533:8"/>
fatal to a great many succeeding Kings. This I mention, not because that I approve so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row boundaries of the Royal Prerogative, as to be divested of the Power of entring into Leagues, and of making Peace and War; but to evince, that there was an express Contract betwixt the King and People, and that the King did not pretend to hold his Imperial Crown of <hi>God alone,</hi> as the Penner of King <hi>Iames</hi> his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration expresses it.</p>
            <p>The Coronation Oath of <hi>Scotland,</hi> during the time of Popery, was express, <hi>as to gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the People according to the Laws of the Land;</hi> but because it also contained an obligation to maintain the Heirarchy and Errors of <hi>Rome,</hi> it was altered at the Reformation, and made to relate to the Reformed Religion, as then esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished by Law, and was enacted to be taken by all the succeeding Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation: By it <hi>they are to Promise and Swear, as in the presence of the Eternal God, That they shall during the whole course of their Life, serve the same Eternal God, according as he is revealed in his most Holy Word; and shall, according to that same Word, maintain the true Religion, the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Word, the due Administration of the Sacraments, <hi>Now received and preached within the Realm of</hi>
               </hi> Scotland; that is, upon the matter, the same as to Swear to be of the Reformed Religion, since that Religion was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60533:9"/>
as the Religion of the Nation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to this Act. Thereafter the King is to Swear by the same Oath, <hi>That he shall rule the People committed to his charge, according to the Command of God, and <hi>according to the Laws and Constitutions received in this Realm.</hi>
               </hi> Here I must confess my own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in the point of the late King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the Crown; for my reason could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver persuade me of any Right he could justly claim to it, as long as this Act of Parliament, enacting this Coronation Oath to be taken by all succeeding Kings, was in force; since he neither did, nor could Swear it.</p>
            <p>Thus the two fundamental Hinges of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Scotland,</hi> being First, That <hi>the Laws the People are to be governed by, are such as are made by the King and Parliament:</hi> And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That <hi>the Government be administred by the King according to these Laws from the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of a Coronation Oath:</hi> If either the King alone, or the three Estates by themselves, take upon them to make Laws, then the <hi>one Hinge</hi> is broken off; and if the Government be not administrated by the King according to these Laws, then the <hi>other Hinge</hi> is broken off also; and in either or both of these Cases, the Constitution is at an end and our Legal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ceases.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60533:9"/>Before I come to the other General Head pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, There is one Objection that lies natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in my way, which I judge necessary to be removed. When I speak of Laws being only made by the King and the Three Estates of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, it will be told me by a certain sort of Men, That this late Act of Parliament of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Majesties Reign, <hi>Abolishing Episcopacy,</hi> seems to infringe that fundamental Constitution; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause one of the Three Estates is thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Bishops. This is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily answered, when I have told them, That before the Reformation, the Three Estates of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament were thus reckon'd up, the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbats, Priors, and Commendator of the Order of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> made up the First Estate, and were named the <hi>Lords Spiritual;</hi> the Temporal Lords made up the Second; and the Representatives for Counties and Burroughs together, made up the Third: But at the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, in respect of our being reformed by Presbyters, and of the great opposition of the Bishops to the Reformation it self, the Parliament was pleased not only to abolish the Errors of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> but also the Hierarchy of Bishops, with all their Privileges and Honours, whereof that, of being the First of the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Three Estates, was one. The Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> having continued under the Government of Presbyters, for a great many years, King <hi>Iames</hi> the First of <hi>England,</hi> sound a way to restore Episcopacy, in spight of the strugling Genius of the Nation: And albeit at that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60533:10"/>
time the Bishops, by a <hi>tacit consent,</hi> took their places in Parliament; yet, whether by <hi>neglect</hi> or <hi>design</hi> I know not, they were never restored to that Privilege<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of being accounted one of the Three Estates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Parliament; but were ever since re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to make up but a part of one Estate, in conjunction with the Temporal Lords; the Second being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Representatives of Counties; and the Third these of the Burroughs. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I judge the fitter to give, that a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who have not the occasion of being acquainted with the Constitution of our Country, are incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to think, that our reckoning up of the Three Estates, is parallel with that of <hi>England;</hi> when indeed there can be nothing more different. <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> owed its Reformation to Bishops, whereof some of them had the Glory of Sealing it with their Bloud; and that Order has ever since af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded the greatest Luminaries of the Church. When Popery was abolished in <hi>England,</hi> the Heirarchy of Bishops was so far from being laid aside, that it continued in the same State, as to all its Privileges, and particularly that <hi>of being the first distinct State of Parliament,</hi> as they found it at the Reformation. What I have advanced in point of the present reckoning up of the Three Estates of <hi>Scotland,</hi> will appear farther beyond all doubt, if we consider, That in most of the Parliaments of King <hi>Iames</hi> the First his Reign, there was none of the order of Bishops, the Hierarchy being not yet restored; and yet the Validity of these Parliaments were never
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60533:10"/>
called in question, in any of the succeeding Reigns.</p>
            <p>I come now to the Second General Head pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, <hi>viz. Whether or not the late King did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit his Right to the Crown, by subverting the above-mentioned two fundamental Hinges of the Government, and if thereupon the Estates did just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay him aside.</hi> In inquiring into this, I shall not give the Reader the trouble of enumerating the several Cases, in which the greatest Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of Regal Prerogative allow, Kings may forfeit their Right; though such a digression might be pardonable, being that King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Proclamation insinuates fairly, that <hi>in no case it can happen.</hi> I confess, I am so great a Friend to Monarchy, as being the best of Governments, and most suitable to the Genius of our Nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I could not wish it <hi>Precarious,</hi> nor the Royal Prerogative sunk below what our Parliaments, preceding the two last Reigns, have determined it: And I think the late King <hi>Iames</hi> had reason to say of the Laws of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the same he was pleased to say of these of <hi>England,</hi> That <hi>they were sufficient to make the King as great a Monarch as he could wish.</hi> There are a great many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that inforce the unreasonableness of that Opinion, That Kings may be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for every mis-management; and indeed, it would seem much safer for the People, many times, to lie under the incroachments of their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60533:11"/>
Princes, then to endeavour a redress by a Remedy, that proves often worse than the Disease: And therefore it is not mis-managements in general, though many and great, that unmakes a King, but only such as shake and subvert the Essence of the Government, and unhinge the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Constitution of the Kingdom. And if mis-managements of this kind can be justly charged upon the late King, it follows necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that immediately upon his so doing, our Constitution is at an end, and our Legal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dissolved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thereupon He ceased to be our King, and We to be his Subjects. And how far the late King is thus chargeable, will appear in the following Considerations.</p>
            <p>That the First Fundamental Hinge of our Constitution, <hi>viz. That the Laws the People are to be governed by, be made by the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> was subverted by the late King, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, in his assuming a Power <hi>to annul and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Laws,</hi> by his two Proclamations <hi>for a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Anno</hi> 1686. For a Power <hi>to ease, annul, and disable</hi> Laws, is as much a part of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislature,</hi> as a Power to <hi>make</hi> Laws; since pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, none can unmake Laws, but those that made them; Yea, it would seem, that Power to annul Laws, should be greater than that which made them, considering that all Nations by their Practice have agreed to this, as a Principle in Politicks,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60533:11"/>
That to abrogate an ancient Custom or Law, is one of the greatest stretches of the <hi>Legislature,</hi> and should be the Result of the most deliberate and sedate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations. So that the Late King, by assuming a power to <hi>annul Laws,</hi> made by King and Parliament, did at the same time arrogate to himself a power, at least as great, if not greater, than that of both King and Parliament together. Moreover, That the annul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Laws is equivalent to the making of Laws, is plain, in the Case before us; for there are a great many Laws incapacitating <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> to enjoy publick Offices and Benefices: Now when King <hi>Iames</hi> assum'd a power to annul these Laws, and from an absolute Power, <hi>which every one was to obey without reserve,</hi> was pleas'd to capacitate these Persons, whom the Laws made by King and Parliament had incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, This was equivalent, in the opinion of both the Giver and Receiver, and had the same effects, as if there had been an Act of Parliament expresly made in their favours.</p>
            <p>But not only did the Late King in his Declarations for Liberty of Conscience, by annulling of Laws, take upon him a power equivalent to that of making of Laws, but did in <hi>a direct and express manner</hi> invade the <hi>Legislature</hi> lodged in King and Parliament, <hi>by his imposing on his Subjects an Oath contrary to Law,</hi> and, which even the King and Parliament together could not impose, because it was in it self a subversion of the Constitution, as being an obligation to support a Power directly destructive to <hi>both the fundamental hindges</hi> of the Government. By this Oath the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were oblig'd <hi>to the utmost of their power, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, assist, and maintain the King and his Successors in the exercise of their Absolute Power;</hi> and thus, as the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60533:12"/>
Oath was created by this Absolute Power, so the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Power must be supported by this Oath, and thereby all the remnants of natural Liberty, or a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Government, were extinguish'd, being the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were oblig'd by oath to maintain the exercise of that which plainly destroy'd them.</p>
            <p>Some have been at a loss to find out the Reason of the difference of Styles in the Late King's <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for liberty of Conscience in England,</hi> and that of <hi>Ours;</hi> the Imperial Language of <hi>annulling and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of Laws</hi> being left out in the <hi>English</hi> one, and in their stead, the softer words of <hi>dispensing with Laws,</hi> made use of. I confess I know no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of this different Conduct, but that we were brought to that state of Slavery, that it was not worth the while to dissemble his Designs against us; and the <hi>English</hi> requir'd to be somewhat better smooth'd over, because they had not been so fully accustomed to an Arbitrary Government.</p>
            <p>Thus I have made out, that King <hi>Iames,</hi> both <hi>by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence,</hi> and <hi>directly,</hi> did invade <hi>the Legislature,</hi> which is <hi>the main hindge of the Constitution,</hi> and thereby sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the Government: And if the Government was subverted, it must necessarily follow, that the Kingly Power was subverted with it; and all our Tyes of Allegiance, whether founded <hi>upon oath,</hi> or otherwise, are extinguish'd, when the Constitution we were oblig'd to maintain, is dissolved; and the King of himself had divested himself of that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which we were to defend and obey. And if it be necessary to determine the time when this Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happen'd; I answer, That albeit for these many years our Slavery was design'd, and a great many steps made to it, which, perhaps, taken all together,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60533:12"/>
might amount to <hi>a Consequential Subversion</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; yet without all doubt, in that Declaration <hi>for Liberty of Conscience,</hi> dated the 12th of <hi>February</hi> 1686<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which asserted an Absolute Power, <hi>which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one was to obey without reserve;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a power to <hi>disable Laws,</hi> the Late King finisht his Design, and our Ruine: And from that <hi>Critical Moment</hi> I must fix the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the Subversion of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Government.</p>
            <p>But because there are some People so ridiculously fond of Slavery, that they cannot endure to hear that any of the Kings of <hi>Scotland</hi> can forfeit his Right, which I beg leave to say, is nonsense to deny, in the case of a total subversion of the Government, as this in question is. I would sain know why such a thing as <hi>forfaulture</hi> should be lookt upon as so monstrous in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> We find that the Late King did not only as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume a Prerogative to annul and disable Laws, and such a power as we were not only to <hi>obey without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</hi> but <hi>to swear to maintain.</hi> We find that by virtue of this Prerogative and Power thus assumed, He did actually <hi>annul and disable</hi> a great many Laws for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of our Religion. Now suppose he had been pleas'd to impose Taxes upon his People without a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and had levied them by his own Army or Dragoons borrowed from <hi>the Invincible Monarch,</hi> and had to boot annulled all our Laws made for the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Rights and Properties: And in fine, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he had been pleas'd to lay aside the whole body of our Laws, by one of these Royal Edicts, <hi>which all were to obey without reserve.</hi> I would willingly know of these Gentlemen, By what name to call such Practices; and whether in this case, we are pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to suffer a King to subvert the whole frame of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60533:13"/>
our Government, and to render Bondslaves those that were born free Subjects to the protection and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of Laws. And such suppositions are both pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and, perhaps might have been actually exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent, if <hi>some</hi> had continued at the Helm a year or two longer.</p>
            <p>I might here resume some things with relation to this Absolute Power assum'd by the Late King; and the word <hi>Invincible necessity,</hi> mention'd in his first Declaration for Liberty of Conscience, which I had occasion to hint at in my Answer to the late Declaration to his Pretended Subjects of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> but I am not so fond of my own Notions, as to repeat them twice; and the rather, that the entertainment the World was pleas'd to give that Paper, infinitely beyond what it deserved, makes me think, that This can come to the hands of few, who have not seen the other. Only I must say this, I take no pleasure to aggravate the faults of any, or make the Consequences of them look more ghastly than they are in themselves; much less would I be guilty of such a thing toward Crown'd Heads. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I am not able to alter the just appearance of this, That the publick Safety can never be secured in any Constitution whatsoever, and that the Ends of the Government are quite lost, if the Person who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts it, doth not at the same time destroy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit his own share in it.</p>
            <p>I come to the second member of the second gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Head, <hi>viz. To inquire whether or not the Late King</hi> Iames <hi>did subvert that other main hinge of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Scotland, <hi>which I have explain'd to be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to govern by the Laws made by the King and Parliament;</hi> and thereupon, <hi>if the Estates of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:60533:13"/>
               <hi>did justly lay him aside?</hi> This Inquiry is indeed no difficult, though an ungrateful and meloncholly task. For what man that loves his Countrey, can look back upon its ruines, without emotions of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! To enumerate all the dismal Instances of the subversion of <hi>this hinge</hi> of our Government, for the space of many years, requires such a Pen as sung the Fall of <hi>Troy,</hi> or the Destruction of <hi>Thebes.</hi> And as the Subject merits to be set beyond the power of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion, I cannot but hope that this fertile Age will produce some one, that shall dare to imitate <hi>Sueton</hi>'s Character, by writing the Lives of <hi>some of the Great, tanquam ipsi vixerint;</hi> and handle down to Posterity the fatal Methods us'd for enslaving a free-born Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And rather than the memory of these Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions should perish for want of a better Historian to perpetuate them, I may perhaps be induc'd to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture my own Reputation in doing it, short of what the Tragick Theme may bear, than that it shoud not be done at all.</p>
            <p>But to confine this Head to as few words as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; It's equally evident, that the Late King <hi>Iames</hi> did subvert this Fundamental of the Government, as well as the former; For so far was he from governing according to the Laws made by King and Parliament, that his whole Government, especially since the time of his assuming a <hi>dispencing</hi> and <hi>annulling Power,</hi> was a continned downright opposition to Laws. Here I need do no more, but refer the Reader to the Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Instrument of Government</hi> for setling the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> upon their present Majesties; in which we have contain'd a Summary of the Late King's more palpable and gross breaches of this Fundamental of the Constitution, and which I shall only explain a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60533:14"/>
little, for the benefit of those that are Strangers to our Countrey.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> did not only lay aside a great many Laws and Acts of Parliament made against <hi>saying of Mass<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and against <hi>Iesuits</hi> and <hi>Seminary Priests,</hi> but would needs, in the greatest and most publick Cities of the Kingdom, erect <hi>publick Schools</hi> and <hi>Societies</hi> for Iesuits and Seminary Priests, and did apply no inconsiderable part of the Publick Revenue to that use. And farther, He was pleas'd frankly to invade the Property of the Subjects, by inverting summar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any previous Sentence, several Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Churches and Chappels into publick Mass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, and particularly the great Church of <hi>Holly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roodhouse</hi> within the Capital City of the Kingdom, the ancient Burying-place of our Kings, that had been a Paroch Church ever since the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In spite of Law, He not only caus'd to be erected Popish Printing-houses for printing Popish Books, but refus'd to allow the Printing of Protestant ones, merely <hi>because<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were against the King's Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He not only did Invade the Laws of the Land, but the most Tender part of the Law of Nature, in taking Protestant Noblemen and Gentlemens Children from their Parents and Friends, to be Educated in Foreign Popish Universities: As<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> particularly the Earl of <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and his only Brother, two of the most hopeful Gentlemen, and one of the Noblest and Ancientest Families of <hi>Scotland,</hi> were Ravish'd from the Arms of their Mother the Countess of <hi>Crawford,</hi> where neither the Prayers nor Tears of the young Noblemen
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60533:14"/>
themselves, nor the Generous Offer of the Earl of <hi>Crawford,</hi> to Educate them upon his own Charges, were able to prevent so hard a Fate, <hi>Lundie,</hi> one of the most Antient Families of the Gentry of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and who had the honour to be among the first Reformers from Popery, tho of an Age that made him Master of himself, was searched for, in order to be sent the same Errand; and that in a manner only becoming the Action.</p>
            <p>In open Defiance of a great many Laws to the contrary, the Late King <hi>Iames</hi> was pleased to fill up some of the most Important Places of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> such as <hi>Chancellor, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries of State, Commissioners of the Thesaury, Lords of Privy-Council, Session, and Exchequer.</hi> He was pleased to commit the Great Magazine of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Government of the Castle of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and the Custody of the <hi>Regalia,</hi> to one of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and to fill up a great many Important Places of the Army, with the same Men that the Laws had render'd Incapable.</p>
            <p>Our Laws have wisely adapted the measure of Punishment to the Nature of the Crime; some infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the loss of Chattels, and others the loss of Life and whole Estate, whether in Lands or Chattels; and this last, our Law calls a <hi>Forfaulture,</hi> and is only inflicted upon the most Attrocious Criminals; King <hi>Iames</hi> did so far Subvert this Reasonable part of our Constitution, that some of his Ministers did impose upon some Thousands of People, Fines that far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded their whole Estates, and consequently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to a Forfeiture; and all this, upon such Imaginary Crimes as this, Because the Wife went not to Church once in three Weeks, tho the Husband did
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60533:15"/>
it; and I am able to instance above 400 thus Fin'd, or rather Forfeited, for the like <hi>Minute Crimes,</hi> within the Bounds of one single County.</p>
            <p>It's an uncontroverted Principle of our Law, That no man can be condemn'd to die, but upon his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found guilty of the Crime by a Iury of Fifteen Men. Notwithstanding of this great Security of our Lives and Fortunes, King <hi>Iames</hi> was pleased to grant Commissions to Military Officers, impowering them to put to Death without either Iury, Tryal, or Record; and which Commissions were as boldly put in Execution.</p>
            <p>Nothing seems more directly founded on the Law of Nature, than that a Man should not be depriv'd of his Liberty, without showing him a Cause for it; yet how many hundreds have been in a manner buried alive in a sort of Dungeons, for several years, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being told to this very day, what was their Crime.</p>
            <p>The Burroughs of <hi>Scotland</hi> were always reputed as one of the Estates of the Kingdom, and by their Charters ratified in Parliament, were Vested with a Power to Elect their own Magistrats; yet King <hi>Iames</hi> did so far trample upon the Liberties of this Third E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, that without the pretence of either <hi>Surrender, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> or <hi>Sentence,</hi> he was pleased to Impose upon them for Magistrates, those that were Strangers, and not Free of their Corporations, and a great many of them <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were in vain to endeavour to confine to this Paper, all the Instances of King <hi>Iames</hi> his Subverting <hi>this Hinge</hi> of our Constitution, <hi>viz. The obligation to Govern according to Law:</hi> I shall conclude with one Paramount Instance, that entails an Eternal Blot
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60533:15"/>
upon the Government of the Late King, and upon the late Iustice of our Nation; I mean, the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of high Treason against that <hi>Noble Person</hi> the late Earl of <hi>Argyle;</hi> of whom, to say too much were impossible; and to say too little, were a Crime. It's true, this Affair was Transacted in the Late King <hi>Charles</hi> his Reign, but it justly merits the glory of being accounted one of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Managements, since he was his Brother's Commissioner, and upon the place at the time, and the source and promoter of that great Person's Ruine. One would think that it needs must have been some horrid Crime that could obliterate all the eminent Services done by this Nobleman to the Crown, even in its lowest figure, that could provoke Iustice to convict him of no less than High Treason, <hi>to taint his Blood,</hi> and declare his Family <hi>Ignoble;</hi> to forfeit his Estate; to extinguish his Honour, the first of its Rank in the Kingdom; and to sentence Himself to die the death of a Traytor, and all this to happen within a few weeks after that he had been seen to move in the highest Orb of favour, and to entertain the then Duke of <hi>York</hi> with the greatest magnificence at his House in <hi>Stirling.</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> had reason to call this Crime of the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi>'s, a Metaphysick kind of Treason, and a thing he could never make sense of. But that those who are strangers to our Kingdom, may have a short hint of this <hi>unintelligible Affair,</hi> I beg leave to inform them, That in the Parliament, where the Late King <hi>Iames</hi> represented his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as High Commissioner, there was an <hi>Oath</hi> or <hi>Test</hi> enacted to be taken by all Persons in publick Offices; in which <hi>Test,</hi> there were some things
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60533:16"/>
contained so hard of digestion, and of <hi>apparent contradiction in it self,</hi> that a great many Persons of all Ranks, scrupled it upon that score. Yea, the universal dislike of it at first was such, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd the Bishop of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and afterward the <hi>Privy Council it self,</hi> to emit a publick explanation of this <hi>Test,</hi> and therein to piece up, in the best manner possible, the seeming Contradictions contained in it. Notwithstanding of all this, and that most of the Clergy, especially of the North, did take this Test and Oath, with, and under <hi>express Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations,</hi> and were by Authority allowed them; yet the Earl of <hi>Argyle</hi> had his Life, Honour, and Fortune sacrific'd, for venturing on that which the meanest Countrey Minister was permitted. But that the Ages to come, may know <hi>the very words,</hi> wherein this Chymereal Treason lay, and thereby be the better capacitate to have a true value of the Learning and Integrity of those Gentlemen that had the honour of finding it out. I shall repeat the very Expressions which were declared by the plurality of his judges to be in themselves High-Treason: which are these, according as they are set down in the Indictment, upon which he was found guilty. <hi>I have considered the Test, and am very desirous to give obedience as far as I can. I am confident the Parliament never intended to impose contradictory Oaths, and therefore I think no man can explain it but for himself, and reconcile it as it is genuine, and agrees in its own sense; and I take it in so far as it is consistent with the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and it self: And I do declare, I mean not to bind up my self in my Station, and in a lawful way,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:60533:16"/>
               <hi>to wish, and endeavour any alteration I think to the advantage of Church or State, and not repugnant to the Protestant Religion, and my Loyalty; And this I understand as a part of my Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Behold the transcendent Crime that brought one of the Greatest and Ancientest Families of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ruine, and at last, one of the greatest and best of its Subjects to the Block; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an unexampled Instance of an Arbitrary Power, that scorn'd to be bounded by the mean and weak Bonds of Iustice and Law, but could boldly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon all that uses to be sacred among men, when it was found needful to sacrifice to Revenge any that might have the honour to oppose the Design of introducing Popery, and Arbitrary Power. It's to be regretted, that Death has exempted from a Temporal Bar the rest of this Nobleman's Iudges, that gave their vote against him, and has left us behind but one of them; <hi>B. of F.</hi> a Person Iustice must stoop to, before she can meet him; and whom Heaven has denied any Qualities that might render him a suitable Victim for the atonement of so Illustrious Blood.</p>
            <p>Here it is but reasonable, that I should mention with honour a great many noble and generous Persons, who merit to have their Names affixt <hi>on the Temple of Fame</hi> to After-ages, for the glory of daring to make what opposition they could to the enslaving their Countrey: Some of whom, neither <hi>Places of Preferment,</hi> nor the <hi>honour of sitting at the Council-board,</hi> and <hi>on the Bench,</hi> could tempt to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60533:17"/>
betray the Liberties of the Nation; and of whom others were proof against <hi>the Frowns of Princes,</hi> and could not be frighted by the loss of Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Disgraces, from their Duty. But this fertile Subject I leave to a better Pen.</p>
            <p>Thus, I hope, I have made it appear, That the two great Hinges of the Government of <hi>Scotland</hi> are, <hi>that the Laws the People are governed by, be made by King and Parliament:</hi> And <hi>that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be administred according to these Laws.</hi> I have also prov'd, That the Late King <hi>Iames has sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted both these two Hinges of the Government;</hi> and thence, that <hi>our Constitution was dissolv'd,</hi> and our Obligations of Obedience, and <hi>Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi> to that King, are extinguish'd, and at an end. From all which it must follow by a necessary Consequence, without necessity of proving it, That the Estates of the Kingdom did justly fill up the Throne, vacant by the dissolution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and thereby the above-mentioned Narrative of King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Proclamation has now no more force than a Bull of Excommunication in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys where the Thunders of the <hi>Vatican</hi> have lost their force.</p>
            <p>There is but one Objection that can be made with any shadow of reason against King <hi>Iames his obligation to govern by Law,</hi> and it is so trivial, that it scarce requires an Answer; and it's this, That he never took the Coronation-Oath, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be charged with unhinging that part of our Constitution, <hi>To govern according to Law.</hi> To this,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60533:17"/>
all I shall say, is <hi>first,</hi> He was obliged to take it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Oath enacted to be taken by all the Kings of <hi>Scotland;</hi> and it were most unreasonable, that his Fault in not taking it, should put him in a better Condition, or us in a worse, than if he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whoever accepts the Regal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in right of Succession, is thereby understood to assume the Government with, and under the same Conditions and Limitations that his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors were under: So that King <hi>Iames,</hi> by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Crown of <hi>Scotland</hi> in Right of Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to his Brother, That very Right that entail'd upon him the Crown which was once his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, does at the same time entail also upon him the necessary and Essential Conditions of the Government, as they were stated in his Brother's time.</p>
            <p>The rest of the Proclamation runs thus. <hi>By all which they have incurr'd the guilt and pains of High-Treason</hi> (meaning the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as mentioned in the former part) <hi>and Rebellion against Us, and Our Authority. Therefore We hereby declare the saids wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Persons assembled, as aforesaid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to such Proceedings, Rebels and Traytors: Willing and requiring you, and all our Good Subjects to take notice hereof, that you give them no obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concourse, or assistance; But that to the utmost of your power you rise in Arms against, assault, attach and destroy them, their Assistants and Abettors, and to take</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:60533:18"/>
               <hi>and apprehend them, and bring them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign punishment, according to the Laws and Acts of Parliament of that Kingdom; their Estates and Goods to seize, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy for Our use, or your own subsistence, in Our Service. And for whatever shall happen in prosecution of this Our Will and Pleasure, This shall be to you, and all others concern'd, a sufficient Warrand and Command: And for all blood-shed, slaughter, mutilation, fire-raising, or other damage done to these Rebels, their Accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Assisters, Abettors, their Lands, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances, Goods, or Possessions, a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Indemnity, Pardon, Warrand and Approbation, for now and ever: The which all our Iudges are to explain in the most favourable and extensive sense the words can bear, in favours of Our saids Subjects, obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Our said Order as aforesaid. Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, We will make good to Our Subjects whatever We promis'd them in Our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations in favours of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Liberty of Conscience, to all who will live peaceably, and Rights and Properties of our People.</hi> Given at <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin; &amp;c.</hi> I would not have been at the pains to transcribe these Expressions, if I did not think that the very reading of these unexampled Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to Slaughter, Fire-raising, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a just horror in the minds of all men, of what we are to expect, if ever Heaven, for the punishment of our Ingratitude, should suffer
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60533:18"/>
us to fall under the Power of the Prince that uses them. And I have chose rather to pass them over with a bare repeating of them, than by such an Answer as perhaps they require, add Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon a Prince, who has his Fortune too much sunk already, and whom a great many Considerations obliges me always to treat with all possible Respect.</p>
