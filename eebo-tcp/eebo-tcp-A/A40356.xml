            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the beginning of this Chapter the Apoſtle exhorts Chriſtians to holineſs in general, by ſetting before them a perfect pattern, <hi>Be ye followers of God as dear Children, and walk in love.</hi> The favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Heaven muſt imitate their Father, and like <hi>Gideons</hi> brethren, reſemble the Children of a King; The precept is, <hi>Be ye holy, be ye perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect:</hi> Then he goes on to preſs this great duty, more particularly upon all their ſeveral relations, which he urgeth by many Arguments. And in the Text he ſeemeth to point out the opportunity, to put thoſe and other Chriſtian duties into practiſe. See that you walk circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the time.</p>

               <p>Doct. <hi>The beſt of Saints, or the redeemed of God, have need to redeem the time:</hi> This Epiſtle was written to a very famous flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Church in the pureſt times of the Goſpel, amongſt whom they were called <hi>Saints, and faithful in Chriſt Jeſus, Chap.</hi> 1. 1. and <hi>choſen of God in Chriſt, before the foundation of the world, Verſ.</hi> 4. and really converted, and brought into a ſtate of life.

               </list>
               <p>Firſt, When is time redeemed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> When time and duty like thoſe two twins, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> take hold one of another; or as two loving yoak-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, go hand in hand; when duty attends time, as the ſhadow the body, or as the Maiden her Miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>This is to fill up time with duty, and to take opportunity by the fore-lock, or in Scripture phraſe, to do the work of the day, in the day. And to this end opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities or ſeaſons are to be deſired, as they offer an occaſion of ſervice, and of doing our duty. This we may ſee in holy <hi>David, Pſal. 122. 1. I was glad when they ſaid unto me, come, let us go up to the houſe of the Lord.</hi> When there was a way open to Worſhip God in the beauty of Holineſs, <hi>David</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced to ſee the true Worſhippers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their opportunity, to go to that City, the name of which was <hi>Jehovah Shammah,</hi> the Lord is there, <hi>Eze.</hi> 48. 38.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95564:5"/>
And the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> brings in the Saints of God rejoycing in the ſame things, <hi>Zech. 8. 20, 21, 22. Let us go ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to pray before the Lord, and ſeek the Lord of Hoſts in</hi> Jeruſalem: <hi>I will go alſo.</hi> The Saints of old were wont to rejoyce when the Sabbath came, becauſe of the holy and heavenly duties of that day: Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and duty are always to be joyned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 10. This is to live according to the wil of God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 2. and to walk cirſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, redeeming the time, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 15, 17.</p>
               <p>2. When we are truly careful to make up former negligence with double diligence, redeeming the time, we recover our loſs. Time, according to this phraſe ſeemeth to be <note place="margin">Qui quid atotiis retro eſt, mors tenet: <hi>Sen. in. Epiſt.</hi>
                  </note> taken captive, and we muſt redeem it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptions are made by purchaſe; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem a thing is to buy it for a price; the price we redeemed it with is labour, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, faithful and ſerious diligence, and greater activity and vigour in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our duty. When what of time or ſeriouſneſs hath been wanting in one day or duty, is made up and ſupplied in the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95564:5"/>
next; this is the way to repair our ſad ſoul-damages. <hi>For the time paſt of our lives may ſuffice us to have wrought the will of the will of the Gentils, 1 Pet.</hi> 4. 3. Chriſtians, our ſins have been many and mighty, but our ſervices few and mean, therefore put the beſt leg before. Be not as the ſluggard, like the door upon the hinges, but as the Sun in the heavens, that rejoyceth to run his race. <hi>The hand of the diligent maketh rich, Prov.</hi> 10. 4. I heard of one, who being a priſoner in a dark dungeon, when the light was brought to him for a little time to eat his diet, would pull out his Bible and read a Chapter, ſaying, he could find his mouth in the dark, but no read in the dark. An Argument that he made conſcience of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming his time. Sirs, to be watchful, diligent, laborious in the faithful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all your time, talents, gifts, graces, is the thing here intended. The precept is for labour, <hi>Luke 13. 24. 2. Pet.</hi> 1. 10. And the diligent in duty hath the promiſe of the Glory, <hi>Heb. 11. 9. To them who by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life, Rom.</hi> 2. 7.</p>

2. What time muſt be redeemed?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> All time.</p>
               <p>Time is ſo precious that not any of it muſt be loſt. The whole time of our life muſt be imployed either about our ſouls in the ſervice of God, or in the works of our callings, or in order thereunto. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly.</p>

go about the grand affair and work of thy dear and never dying ſoul before thou doſt ingulf thy ſelf in the cares of this world.

In the bright morning of thy life match thy ſoul to the King of glory, and become his Bride be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art defloured, and defiled, by ſin and the World. If the Celeſtial ſeeds of grace be ſown in the morning, the pleaſant and ſweet flowers ſpringing out of theſe ſeeds, will invite the Lord Jeſus to come and walk in his Garden, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1.

               <p>You young-men, and young-women, know, that the infinitely gracious God holds out the Golden Scepter, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viteth you to come unto him.

thine we are, thine we will be; come now, and take thine own, God will accept you, and take it kindly, his arms and boſom are open to you, <hi>Jer. 2. 2, 3.

If a man had a buſineſs of great concernment, or a matter of life and death, that requireth time, ſtrength, and diligence for the doing of it, and ſhould omit it until he were ſtricken in years, or until ſickneſs and weakneſs invade him, every one would be ready to charge him with folly.</p>

               <p n="5">5. <hi>The time of the Sabbath or Lords day</hi> muſt be redeemed: we muſt have a ſpecially care of ſanctifying that day, it being the Sabbath of the Lord our God. This golden day from morning to night muſt be ſpent in the ſervice and worſhip of our Lord, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in publick, private, or ſecret duties, and no part of it muſt be loſt. Take no liberty upon that day for fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, vain and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <note place="margin">The youth that lately was hang'd for murdering his Fellom Servant, confeſs'd that his Sabbath breaking made way for all his other prodigious ſins.</note> diſcourſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, or to ride, buy, ſell, or work. This dreadful, God provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin of Sabbath-breaking, is a ſin in faſhion; hundreds in this Nation ſerve the Devil more upon the Lords day then on other dayes; Then men are at leiſure to ſerve the Devil, and ſatisfie their luſts, to go to the Ale-houſe, or to exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſports and paſtimes. O that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, Miniſters, Maſters of Families, and Parents, would look to it, <hi>Neh.</hi> 13. 17. The Lord of the Sabbath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee, that <hi>thou and thy Son, thy
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95564:10"/>
Daughter, thy man ſervant, and all within thy gate, keep that day holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Sabbath is called a holy convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 2. and the Lord of the day is an infinitely holy, juſt, and jealous God. The Sabbath heretofore was called <hi>Regina dierum,</hi> the Queen of days; in the New Teſtament it is called the Lords day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. a day in which we commemorate the greateſt mercy, <hi>viz.</hi> the glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of our crucified Lord, and that which the pureſt Chriſtians in the pureſt times did carefully obſerve.</p>
               <p>In the Primitive times, a ſerious and ſtrict obſervation of the Lords day, was a trial or badge of Chriſtianity. When the queſtion was propounded, <hi>Servaſti Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum?</hi> haſt thou kept the Lords day, the anſwer was turn'd, <hi>Chriſtianus ſum, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittare non poſſum.</hi> I am a Chriſtian, and cannot intermit it. It was a ſaying of an eminent Divine, that he would judge of a mans Religion according to the reverence and care he had of keeping the Sabbath. Chriſtians, you are to keep your Lords reſt, and perform the holy duties of his worſhip chearfully, reverently, ſpiritually, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 24. If ever you think to celebrate
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95564:10"/>
an eternal Sabbath with God in glory, be careful of this duty. To enforce it, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p n="1">1. How ſtrictly the holy God impoſeth it, and to what, end it is, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it Holy, Exod.</hi> 20. 8. This bleſſed day for communion with God, is to be premeditated upon before it cometh; therefore in the evening before the Sabbath, let all your neceſſary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions be done up, that you may have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what becometh the work of that day: Be like <hi>David's</hi> good man, <hi>Pſ. 112. 5. ordering your affairs with diſcretion,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially your Spiritual affairs. If you expected the company of ſome worthy friend, would you be found in a ſluttiſh poſture, or ſweeping and cleanſing your houſes on that day, and all out of order? On the Lords day you ſhould vehemently expect the approach and preſence of the King of glory, therefore make all ready to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Remember the excellent Epithetes and Titles of this bleſſed day, it is called <hi>a High day, a Holy day, the holy of the Lord, honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, Iſa.</hi> 58. 13. Therefore let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, loſe no more Sabbaths.</p>

3. Conſider the bleſſings and ſoul bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of that day, if it be rightly obſerved. It is your Lords Market day, in the which you have the precious Oyl, the Golden Mines and treaſures of grace opened that day. There are ſpiritual dainties for your hungry ſouls, to which you are by Chriſt invited that day, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 1. The Holy Ghoſt doth breath and blow that day, by the ſecret and ſweet gales whereof, Saints mount up toward Heaven. The great God comes down, and gracious ſouls aſcend that day, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 10. And the Eunuchs that keep Gods Sabbaths have the promiſe of a name in his houſe for ever, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. 4, 5. I might add the ſevere threatnings, and Gods ſignal judgements upon the propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Sabbath, or Lords day. The man that was found gathering ſticks upon the Sabbath, by an immediate command from God, was ſtoned to death, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15. 32, 34, 35, 36.</p>

This is the white in the mark we ſhould aim at, the thing we ſhould purſue reſolutely, vigorouſly, with all our might. Whether we Pray, or Preach, or read, or hear, or celebrate Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, or converſe, exhort, or reprove, or indeed buy, ſell, plow, ſow, eat, drink, let it not be done for the World, or the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the fleſh: We ſhould have ſuch a high eſteem of God, and ſuch ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and ſtrong affections to him, that the pleaſing, praiſing, and magnifying of of God in all our ways, might be our main endeavour.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians, you are choſen out of the World to be Gods witneſſes, if you do not appear for God, his honour and intereſt, none will: All (ſaith the holy Apoſtle) ſeek their own, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 21.

Let me ſay to thee as the Angel to <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 19. 16, 17. when in danger of being burned, <hi>Eſcape for thy life, ſtay not, leſt thou be conſumed.</hi> The life and ſalvation of thy ſoul, cannot be ſecured without this. <hi>Acts 11. 18. 2 Cor. 7. 10. Luke</hi> 13. 3. Therefore labour to know

the plague of thy heart, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 38. and plow up the fallow ground; ſow in tears, and ſet about it this inſtant, before this day be ended, this Sermon ended; leſt it ſhould be ſaid of thee, as of that woman <hi>Jezabel, Rev. 2. 21. I gave her ſpace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and ſhe repented not; and ſo Gods fury fury come forth like fire, and burn, and none can quench it, Jer.</hi> 4. 3, 4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By making it your great buſineſs to ſecure an intereſt in Chriſt, getting your evidences for heaven bright and clear. Chriſtians, till you have gotten the pledges and tokens of Gods love to your ſouls, till you are aſſured of the truth of your faith, and the ſincerity of your repentance, and hereby of the pardon of ſin, and of your interſt in the Lord Jeſus, you can have little comfort in your ſouls, or boldneſs towards God. Therefore, with might and main work out your ſalvation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 12. Make your calling and election ſure, that upon certain grounds you may ſay as the Church, <hi>Lam. 3. 24. The Lord is my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, faith my ſoul. Doubtleſs thou art our Father, Iſa.</hi> 63. 16. Or as holy <hi>Job</hi> in his deep affliction, <hi>Job 19. 25. I know my Redeemor liveth: I am thine, ſave me,

Pſal. 19. 91. Truely I am thy Servant, I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine, Cant.</hi> 2. 16. Chriſtians, this aſſuring-Faith is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable; pray for it, and vigorouſly preſs after it, that you may be ſealed up unto the day of redemption, that ſo an entrance may be miniſtred unto you, into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11. And O how well have they redeem'd their precious time, that have ſecured their never-dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls. Know this, that aſſurance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires both diligence and perſeverance; therefore you muſt be conſtant in the uſe of means, and lay hold on every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of enjoying the Goſpel. This your Lord commendeth in <hi>Mary,</hi> calling her attendance on the Word preached, a chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the good part, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 42. There you will taſte the Chryſtal ſtreams, and view the golden Mines of ſound Doctrine, and Wells of Salvation. This is the place of ſpiritual wonders, where the Dead are raiſed, the Lepers cleanſed, the eyes of the Blind opened, and the Devils eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Goſpel Ordinances are the Golden galleries, where the King of glory Walketh: The Bed, where immortal ſouls are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotton
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95564:16"/>
unto God, and in which the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearts do travel till Chriſt be formed in them. Through theſe Golden Pipes, the Water of Life is poured out upon thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty panting ſouls, for the chearing of their ſpirits. Here is the Doctrine preach'd and words whereby thou muſt be ſaved, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. Here Chriſts Mother found him, it being the place where the Bridegoom and the Bride meet and ſolace themſelves together, Do not forſake the ſolemn Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies: remember what <hi>Thomas</hi> loſt by being abſent when Chriſt came. O come to the Poſts of Wiſdom's doors, and with empty Pitchers ſet your ſelves under the Spouts of the Sanctuary. 'Tis upon theſe waters the Angel moves, and ſouls are healed: This is the School where all Gods children are taught of God, and inſtructed unto the Kingdom of heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>By improving the preſent means of Grace, for your ſpeedy growth in Grace,</hi> that ſo the grain of Muſtard-ſeed might become a great Tree, <hi>Math.</hi> 13. 52. The Chriſtian courſe is compared to a Race, a walk, to the morning light, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 24. Rom.</hi> 8. 1. and therefore you muſt go on, and be progreſſive whilſt you live.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:95564:16"/>
Believers ſhould be as greedy of grace, as the men of the World are of gain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one grain of Grace is more worth then a houſe full of Gold, yea better then Rubies. You are compared to Stars, to fruitful Trees planted by the Rivers of Water, and you ſhould gliſter and ſhine in this dark night of helliſh profaneneſs, and live down, and convince this accuſing debauched generation. The Trees of the Lord ſhould be full of ſap, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 16. being grafted in the true Olive, and under the ſweet dews of Heaven, you ſhould flouriſh in the Courts of the Lord, and bring forth fruit in old age, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. 12, 13, 14. Chriſtians, keep your Lamps burning, and hold on your way, that the <hi>David</hi> of grace may wax ſtronger and ſtronger. Make no ſtop, but ſtrain to get and keep before, that you may win the prize. Growth of Grace is required of the higheſt Gyants, as well as the loweſt Dwarf in Grace. They ſay of the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile, he groweth as long as he liveth; and when he ceaſeth to grow, he ceaſeth to live. How many poor creeping Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are there, who can hardly keep life and ſoul together, being like the door upon
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95564:17"/>
the hinges, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 14. and why but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, they are come to a pitch, and paſt growth, as ſoon as ſprung up above ground. If there be the truth of grace, there will be an endeavour after the ſtrength of grace; where is life; there is growth, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. 2.

And if you do theſe things, you ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall, 1 Cor. 15. verſ. laſt, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 5, 6, 7, 1.</p>

The neglect of Family-duties is a dreadful and provoking ſin, and that (as a Godly Miniſter ſaid) which will untile the houſe, and cauſeth God to rain curſes upon the Table.

If you are Chriſtians indeed, let a conſtant courſe of reading in the

Word, Catechiſing, and Prayer, be kept up in your houſes; for when death hath ſeparated you and your relations, it will grieve you to the heart, that you did no more to further the good of their precious Souls, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 2, 30.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By taking all occaſions, where-ever you are, or come, to further the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of periſhing ſinners. If you have taſted that the Lord is gracious, and are taken out of the Iron Furnace, as fire brands out of the burning, where is your pity and bowels to ſouls in perils? Can you be contented to be happy, <hi>Jud.</hi> 22. and to go to Heaven alone, &amp; to endeavour by your prayers, counſels and examples, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and draw others into Heavens way? Wicked men are active for the Devil, who like Snails leave their ſlime behind them, where ever they come; and are empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poyſon of ſin one into the other, and ſo furthering their damnation. What multitudes do you ſee weltring in their blood, and making poſt-haſt to Hell, whoſe deſperate and deplorable caſe ſhould excite your compaſſion, and cauſe you to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Your Dear Lord, whom you

He improved his opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <hi>(John</hi> 4.) to convert a notorious ſinner; though weary and thirſty, was not careful of haſtning the meat, becauſe he preferred the opportunity to bring her ſoul out of Satans ſnare, and ſo ſave her. When at your Tables, or buying, or ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or travelling, opportunity may be taken to ſpeak of God, and the things of God, and to leave ſome conviction upon the company. Thus <hi>Philip</hi> falling in with the Eunuch whilſt he was riding on his way homewards from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> cloſed with him, and was an inſtrument to ſave the ſoul of him he never ſaw before, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. And by the heavenly diſcourſe that drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from the mouth of Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> Paſtour of <hi>Brainford</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> a Gentlewoman was converted while ſhe was waiting on him in his Chamber, warming his Bed. A Word ſpoken in ſeaſon through Gods bleſſing may ſave a ſoul; and it is our duty to endeavour it. Mr. <hi>Ignatius Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> was exceeding inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal this way; who would go from houſe to houſe, to put his neighbours in mind of their Soul-concerns. Holy <hi>David</hi> was not

afraid or aſhamed to ſpeak of God hefore Kings, and to tell what God had done for his ſoul: and ſaid he, <hi>I will teach tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors thy ways, and ſinners ſhall be converted unto thee, Pſal.</hi> 5. 13. for, <hi>he that convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſinner from the error of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, Jam.</hi> 5. 20. When at any time your neighbous are ſick, and under the hand of God, take that oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to viſit them, to put them in mind of Death and judgment, and to make them ſenſible of the neceſſity of Faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, without which there can be no hope of Heaven. Our Proverb is, <hi>To ſtrike while the Iron is hot.</hi> Upon a bed of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, when death looks men in the face, they ſeem ſerious, and fit to receive the impreſſion of faithful counſel for their ſouls. To which joyn ſerious prayer; for, <hi>The prayer of faith</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſhall ſave the ſick,</hi> and it may ſave the ſoul.</p>

God will not forget it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 10. The Lord Jeſus will certainly reward it, <hi>Mat. 25. 40. A well done,</hi> from Chriſt hereafter, will compenſate all the ſervice of <hi>well doers</hi> here, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 31.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>By labouring to keep up conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muniou with God in all holy duties.</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, you may loſe time in the very ſervice of God; if you are not careful therein to converſe with him. Take heed of a ſlight ſpirit in ſerious performances. God looks upon the heart, and moſt there. Some ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preparation is neceſſary, before you approach the preſence of the high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhav'd himſelf before he would come into <hi>Pharaohs</hi> preſence. Let your heaven-born ſouls in every duty, with the love-ſick Spouſe go out to meet your Lord; and taken up with nothing elſe.

'Tis not the picture of the husband, but the preſence of the husband, that can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the truely loving longing ſpouſe. It is a bleſſed ſight to ſee ſouls working to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, gaſping and panting after the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1, 2. O labour for ſuch a frame of heart, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail a narrow and contracted ſpirit. Do not perform duties for duties ſake, ſo as to make duties the end of duties: but as the <hi>medium,</hi> by which thy ſoul may draw nigh to God and meet with him: The counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and preſence of God in a duty is the very Suburbs of glory, yea, the very gate of Heaven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Pſal.</hi> 84. 2. Duties are only the outward Court, but the form, ſhell, and carkaſs of Religion, as Pipes without Water, Breaſts without Milk, as Sails without Wind, or as a Body without a Soul, that hath no life. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of your grace and holineſs depends
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95564:21"/>
upon your acquaintance and communion with the God of grace. It was <hi>Moſe</hi> his being in the Mount, that made his face to ſhine; and the Kings being at his Table, that cauſed the Churches <hi>Spikenard</hi> to ſend forth the ſwell thereof, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 12. The preſence of the glorious God on a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, the preſence of God in prayer, or at a Sacrament, will be unto thy ſoul as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and fatneſs, and that which will make thy hands to drop with Myrrh, and thy fingers with ſweet-ſmelling Myrrh. Thus it was with the Spouſe, when her Beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 4, 5.</p>

The Rod hath a <hi>Voice,</hi> Beaſts

may feel the rod, but the believer hearts the rod. God's rod ſhould make us like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s rod, bud, bloſſom, and to bring forth the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11. Now if you would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by affliction, endeavour to do three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To underſtand the meaning or mind of God in them, for what ſins committed, or duties neglected, they are ſent: Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are Gods Meſſengers, and we ſhould never be quiet till we know their Errands, <hi>Job</hi> 10. 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. See the hand of God in all thoſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. So did <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 39. 10. and holy <hi>Job 1. 11. Hoſ.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Labour to anſwer the end of God in your ſtraits and troubles; that you might be made more humble, more holy, more heavenly before; that we may ſay, and find, that it hath beed good for us to be afflicted. We have as much reaſon to ſeek unto God for a bleſſing upon our <hi>daily Rod</hi> as upon our <hi>daily Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Time muſt be redeemed by caſting up your accounts every day, and ſo to make even with God, and not get further into his

debt.</hi> This will be the way to get an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance, to procure a pardon, before you are called and forced to an account. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret duties, if well done, are the ſweeteſt duties; and yet ſadly neglected by Saints themſelves. You ſhould retire every night, and ſpend a little time in ſelf-examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and when you ſit alone, commune with your hearts, and call over the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages and actions of the day paſt. We read <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 63. That <hi>Iſaac</hi> went out in the evening tide to meditate; a precious duty, but rarely practiſed. Chriſtians ſhould ſpend void ſpaces of time in ejaculatory Prayer, and holy Meditation. And O how hard it is to aſcend this Mount of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Meditation! 'Tis very eaſie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſom to think of the World, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Sin, Friends, Riches, Worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, but to Meditate on God, Heaven, Eternity, the inſufficiency and vanity of the creature, the bitterneſs of ſin, the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of death and judgement, (the very inwards of Religion) is very difficult. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you lye down upon your beds at night, call your ſelves to an account by ſuch queſtions as theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:95564:23"/>
1. I have lived many years in the world; What have I been doing all my days? have I anſwered the end of my being?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Have I had a holy awe of God in the midſt of my Worldly buſineſs this day? What thoughts of death and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have I had? Where hath my heart been?</p>
               <p n="3">3. How have I performed duties this day? What hath been the ſins of this day, the mercies of this day, that I may beg the pardon of the one, and bleſs God for the other?</p>
               <p n="4">4. What aſſiſtance and communion with God have I had this day in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his worſhip? have not God and my ſoul been ſtrangers this day, and many days together?</p>
               <p n="5">5. What have I done or ſpoken for God and his Glory this day, in my Family or elſe-where? have I demean'd my ſelf like a child of God this day? this is to make Religion our buſineſs, or to walk in the fear of the Lord all the day.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Improve your time by endeavouring to order every days work with reference to your laſt day.</hi> The end of every duty, and the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95564:23"/>
great reaſon of redeeming time, lies here, namely, that we may be fit to dye, and ſtand before God. Therefore muſt we glorifie the infinitely holy God, and make him our friend. Hence it is that we muſt ſecure our ſouls, and ſpeedily get into Jeſus Chriſt, and grow in grace, do good to others, call our ſelves to an account, and clear our title unto heaven, that all our work may be done up while it is day, and none left to do, let death call when it will.</p>

               <p>Reaſ. 1. <hi>Becauſe the days are evil.</hi> This is the Apoſtles own argument to enforce the duty. Precious time, and evil days run parallel; therefore no part of a little time muſt be loſt. I ſhall inſtance in a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, to make it appear.</p>

Thoſe old and damnable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies that have been condemned and expun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of the Church of God, are greedily embraced and ſwallowed down by more then a few, 2 <hi>Tim. 3. 1. and 4. 3. 2 Pet. 1. 12. Ye therefore, Beloved, ſeeing ye knew theſe things before, beware leſt ye alſo being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs, 2 Pet. 3. 17. 2 Tim.</hi> 1. 13.</p>

Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity abounds, wickedneſs is in credit, and Religion under diſgrace. Many hate the power of Godlineſs, but are not aſham'd to wear the Devil's Livery. May we not complain with the Prophet, and ſay as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea 4. 12. There is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the Land. By Swearing, and Lying, and Killing, and Stealing, and committing Adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood; therefore ſhall the Land mourn.</hi> And as <hi>Iſa. 12. 15. For our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions are multiplyed before thee, and our

               <p>Reaſ. 2. <hi>Redeeming the time, will render us truly wiſe. See that you walk circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the time, Eph. 5. 15.

Whatever Learning, Parts, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, men have, they are not wiſe unleſs they redeem the time. The men of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> were of great account with <hi>David,</hi> becauſe they <hi>had underſtanding of Times, to know what Iſrael ought to do, 1 Chron.</hi> 12. 32.

This is that which is either beleiv'd or fear'd by the beſt and worſt of men: O that it might have a deep and laſting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon all your hearts.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>The opportunity of time is a very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous privileage.</hi> To have a gale of opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to convey us to glory, or the white flag upon the wall, inviting us unto our work, to ſue out our pardon before it is to late.

'Tis a ſhameful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſight, to ſee a man profeſſing Godlineſs in a Lethergy, and not proſe-Caſt

               <p>5. <hi>If the beſt of Saints ſhould redeem their time, what have ſinners need to do?</hi> You that have been ſlumbring and ſleeping all your time, and not gone one ſtep in the way to Heaven, but many in the way to Hell, had need up and be doing, or elſe you will be eternally undone. <hi>Whilſt it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to day, if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</hi> Do not ſpend ſo freely of this ſwift and precious ſtream of Time, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry drop of which, hath an influence upon Eternity. <hi>Knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of ſleep.

               <p>6. <hi>If Time, and every part and moment of it, muſt be improved; this ſerves to confute thoſe that reproach ſerious diligence in Duty, as a needleſs thing.</hi> If the buſineſs of our immortal ſoul, did not require great care and diligence, why doth <hi>Paul</hi> here enjoyn us to walk circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe? Chriſtians. 'tis your wiſdom to know your work, and the time to do it. There's no trifling about eternity; now is the day for the things of your peace, let it not be hid from your eyes. It will be very ſad when you are paſſing into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, to ſee that you have all your life time been ſowing the wind.</p>
               <p>Uſe 2. Examination, <hi>Try whether you are redeemers of time, or not.</hi> Reflect upon what I have ſaid, and thy Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will tell thee, thou haſt ſpent more of thy time in ſin and vanity. How
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95564:28"/>
fruitful are thy duties? Are thy hours for God? Do Time and Duty go hand in hand? Maiſt thou not cry out, many a time, <hi>Diem perdidi!</hi> daily I loſe a day. Examine your ſelves, don't ſilence ſtop the mouth of Conſcience; if ſo, it will cry aloud another day.</p>
               <p>Let me ask you theſe few queſtions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Have you ſeriouſly bewail'd the loſs of time, and begg'd the pardon of it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Have your ſouls ſincerely cloſed with Jeſus Chriſt, and freely and fully given up, and reſigned your ſelves to him to be his for ever?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do the great concerns of Gods glory, and your ſalvation, bear down all before them? Canſt thou ſay, though I follow my Calling, and take care for my Family, yet I am moſt ſolicious about my everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition? whether they be pleaſures or profits, I can ſay, Pleaſures of ſin be gone, world ſtand by. There is a God to ſerve and honour; I have a ſoul muſt be ſanctified and ſaved, I have a ſhort time to redeem, I have a debt to pay, an account to give, a Sentence to receive, an Eternity
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95564:28"/>
to live. This is not to be ſlighted; I muſt and will ſave my ſoul, Hell iI moſt intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable and eternal.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Will you now promiſe and ſtand to it, that for the future you will trade more for eternity, and get better evidences for Heaven? Go about the work of Faith and repentance ſpeedily; leſt death ſhould call, and you not ready.</p>
               <p>Uſe 3. Of Lamentation, <hi>That Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors ſhould bo ſo far from redeeming of time, or of doubling their diligence, that they neglect their duty.</hi> I may cry out with the Prophet, call for the mourning wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, for who is not guilty in this kind? <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 16. Sirs, for this ſhould our ſouls mourn in ſecret places; the ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of which is enough to fetch blood from our hearts, and flood of tears from our eyes. How little care is taken in ſpending that well, which when it is gone, we have no hope it can be reſtored to us again. Do not you complain of the want of time, ſeeing you waſte time. There are many poor frivolous excuſes: the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant will ſay, that he hath a hard, cruel Maſter; the wife complains of her wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Husband, the Child of his Ungodly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95564:29"/>
Father; another, of the poverty of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; he can ſpare no time. Whoever pretends the want of time, let me tell thee, Thou haſt a carnal, dead, ſinful, ſlothful heart, the cauſe of all. Haſt thou not time for every other thing, namely, a time for eating, drinking, ſleeping, potting, piping, playing, and none for Heaven? Can you riſe early, go to bed late, and eat the bread of carefulneſs, to get the meat that periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and find no time for God and your Souls? will this excuſe thee another day, thou careleſs, ignorant, deluded ſoul? Your Corn, Cattel, your Sheep, your Swine, your Hawks, your Horſes, and Dogs are cared for; but for the better part, there's no care at all. Wilt thou tell the great and terrible Judge, at the laſt day, I would have been ſaved, but I had no time? There are many that eat their bread by the ſweat of their brows, that take time for their ſouls, who will be brought in as witneſſes againſt you at the laſt day. Will you ſquander away your time, and the days evil, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities for your ſouls hardly come at? O conſider, it's high time to awake out of ſleep.</p>

               <p>Uſe 4. You have heard what it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem time, and how time muſt be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Now let all reſolve, without delay, to put this ſo neceſſary a Duty into practiſe.</hi> Let young ones reſolve upon it, and the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged, with the hoary-heads. Tender unto thy God the cream and flower of thy age, and time, and think it not too ſoon. In things of far leſs moment, you are for haſt and ſpeed. If you were ſtarving for want of bread, you would think every hour long, till you had a ſupply. If your bodies were tortured and tormented with pain and ſickneſs, would you think that eaſe and health might come too ſoon? If a man were in the Sea near ſinking, can a Boat come to ſoon? Or, can a condemned Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor receive his pardon too ſoon? haſt thou lived without God, and Satan's Slave, and in danger of dropping into Hell, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or twenty years, and canſt thou get into Chriſt to ſecure thy immortal ſoul too ſoon? Haſt thou not been the Devils too long already? Suppoſe thou hadſt dyed in thy Chriſtleſs ſtate, where had
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95564:30"/>
thy ſoul been? Is is not better to be the Lord's ſervant, then Satan's Slave? Ask the Godly man that hath made tryal, and he will tell thee. The ſooner thou art in a ſtate of Grace, the fitter thou wilt be for glory. Make ſpeed in thy work, do thy ſpiritual buſineſs; thy wages is ſure, and thou ſhalt be bleſſed. Conſider there was never any one repented (living or dying) that they were the Lords, and converted betimes.</p>
               <p>And for you that have paſt the time of youth, in the ſatisfying youthful luſts, and liv'd, it may be, thirty, forty, or fifty years in a courſe of ſin and vanity, is it not more then time for you, to bethink your ſelves? In ſo many years you have made ſad work; who can tell how often you have offended, that have been profane Swearers, Drunkards, Lyars, Sabbath-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers; ſo long, if you were certain of living ſo many years to come, yet the Devil, the World, and your Helliſh luſts, have had half your time. O let the time paſt ſuffice. Know your times are in Gods hands, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 15. So that you are not certain of a day to come: therefore begin and make ſpeed in you work.</p>
               <p>

And for the gray-headed, againſt whom death hath raiſed his batteries, you can have but a few ſands in your glaſs, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting hour cannot be far, your Candle is within the ſocket, and it may be is come to a ſtinking ſnuff: Do you not ſee the Keepers of the old rotten houſe begin to tremble, and the ſtrong men bow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Expect the next blaſt, the houſe to fall. If you that are leaning on your ſtaves, and looking through your ſpectacles, being ready to enter upon Eternity, don't mind your work immediately, Wo, wo be unto you for ever. If God ſhould work a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Miracle, in converting and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an old grey-headed Sinner, that hath been idle till the leventh hour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 6. would it not be matter of amazement, and wonder to Men and Angels? For the Devil to be caſt out of poſſeſſion after he hath an Inhabitant threeſcore years, and more, for ſuch an one to be born again, would be ſtrange indeed. I have heard of an old man, who being really converted, not long before his death cauſed this to be written on his Tomb: <hi>Here lyeth a very aged man, of Three Years Old;</hi> He reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned all his time and life before, as loſt,

If at the day of judgement we muſt give an account for every idle word, much more for ſo great a Talent, ſo rich a Treaſure as Time. A Heathen could ſay, that every wiſe man muſt <hi>tam otii quam ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottii rationem reddere,</hi> give an account of his buſineſs, and of his idleneſs. You may,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95564:32"/>
like fools, waſte your time, neglect your duty, and ſtand out againſt the call of God; but it will coſt your dear, <hi>Eccl. 11. 9. Rejoyce, O young man in thy youth, and let thine heart chear thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes: but know thou, for all theſe things God will bring thee unto judgement.</hi> The great Landlord of your time, is at great expence to continue it. Thoſe Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Heaven, over your heads; and principally, the Prince of all the lights of Heaven, the Sun, that glorious and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Gyant, the Prince and Crown of all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Creatures, do tire, and waſte (as it were their Celeſtial vigour, to beget and give Time. Time is ſo rich a Jewel, that God would have one man value it to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If one man had hurt another, he was to pay both for his cure and loſs of time, <hi>Exod,</hi> 21. 18, 19. So muſt you at the great day of account, for all your time, for every Sermon you have heard, for every Sabbath and Sacrament you have had all your days.</p>
               <p>Motive 3. <hi>You have all promiſed to redeem your time.</hi> The Vows of <hi>Jehovah</hi> are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. Say with <hi>David, I will pay my
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95564:33"/>
Vows.</hi> If the Godly man will perform his promiſe to his hurt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 4. Much more ſhould you for your profit. Take the Counſel of the Wiſe Man, <hi>Eccleſ. 5. 4, 5. When thou voweſt a vow unto God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not to pay it: pay that which thou haſt vowed: better it is that thou ſhould not vow, then to vow and not pay.</hi> How often you have engaged your ſelves to leave your known ſins, and to live ſoberly, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, and Godly in this preſent World, let Conſcience witneſs. If you that have reſolved to read, pray, ſanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould ſtill waſte and trifle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the time, it will not only be a breach of promiſe; but a ſin againſt light, for which thy heart will reproach thee; <hi>and if thine heart condemn thee, God is greater then thine heart, and knoweth all things, 1. John</hi> 3. 20. Remember the promiſes thou didſt make at ſuch a Sacrament, or when ſtruck at the heart by ſuch and ſuch a Sermon, or when death was at thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, or thy ſelf near unto it; and defer not to perform thy Covenant: God, who is a God of truth, will not be mocked; and that you ſhall know ere it be long. <hi>Jeptha</hi> would perform his vow to God; <hi>I have,</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:95564:33"/>
ſaid he, <hi>opened my mouth unto the Lord, I cannot go back, Judg. 11. 34, 35. Herod,</hi> for his Oath ſake, murdered <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt, Matth.</hi> 14. 9, 10. How many times haſt thou engageſt to dedicate and devote thy ſelf to God and his Service? therefore ſay, <hi>Lord, for my promiſe ſake, I will ſacrifice my ſelf, and become thine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming my time for thy glory, and mine own Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Motive 4. Conſ. <hi>Men take and improve opportunities for other things.</hi> The fitteſt and beſt time is taken for buying, ſelling, plowing, ſowing, and gathering into Barns; and eſpecially in evil and hard times. Men will riſe early, run, ride, and labour, in the very fire, as the Prophet ſpeaketh. <hi>Redeeming the time,</hi> 'tis a Metaphor taken from Merchants, that will be early in the Market, leſt the opportunity of buying the beſt Commodities ſhould be loſt. The Proverb is, <hi>that Time and Tide, ſtay for no man;</hi> and that <hi>we muſt make Hay while the Sun ſhineth.</hi> There's none but the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard will ſleep in Harveſt; the diligent Husband-man will not loſe a day then. Chriſtians, in this great affair of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, immortal and never-dying ſouls, do
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95564:34"/>
as men about other things: Millers and Marriners obſerve and improve every gale of wind; yea, the Stork in the Heaven, the Turtle, the Crane, and the Swallow, know and obſerve the time of their coming, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 7. They that ſay, to day or to morrow we will go into ſuch a City, and buy, and get gain, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 2. will as we ſay, turn every ſtone, and loſe no time to buy a good bargain, to make a rich purchaſe, and ſhall we redeem our time, and make the beſt of our ſpiritual markets, to make proviſion for our ſouls, that are more worth then all the world?</p>
               <p>Motive 5. <hi>Satan, that Enemy, and grand Soul-deluder, is always buſie.</hi> He is an active Devil, and he loveth to find us idle. Chriſtians, this old Serpent is never more at work, then when we are idle: for idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs layeth a man open to all his Helliſh Snares and temptations, and then if temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations come, you are out of Gods way; and if Satan find you on his ground, he will be too hard for you. The Apoſtle tells us he goeth about, and ſtill offers temptations for the waſting of our time. This roaring Lyon hath a large circuit; for ever ſince
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95564:34"/>
he was caſt out of Heaven, he hath been going to and fro in the Earth, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and down in it, <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. His grand deſign is to devour, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8. This black Prince loves to prey upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſouls; the ſoul being that ſweet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel he is ſtill gaping at. This Adverſary hath his ſeveral walks, he is in the Shop, in the Market, in the Street, in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, in the Cloſet, and every where where ſin is, and he is alſo in the Congregation among the Aſſemblies of the Saints, when they are about ſpiritual ſervice. When <hi>Joſhua</hi> the High-Prieſt ſtood before the Lord, Satan was ſtanding at his right hand to reſiſt him, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3. 1. This dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enemy was with Chriſt, and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples at the Paſsover, for there he entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Judas, John</hi> 13. 26, 27. Therefore, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, we have need to work and watch too. The devil, that hates you and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, doth beſtir himſelf; he goeth forth into the broad way of prophaneneſs, and there he tenders and tempts men with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual objects, and he entreth in the by-path of error, appearing as an Angel of light, and enticeth wanton wits to ſuck down the poyſon of his damnable doctrine. And
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95564:35"/>
when once he hath injected his poyſon into the head, how much time is ſpent in writing and diſputing to defend his delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? We read, that it was while men ſlept, this enemy (Satan) came and ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tares among the Wheat, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 25. 39. He is a working, buſie Devil, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at leiſure, but is always ſpreading his Baits, and caſting his Snares and Nets to catch ſouls. Therefore be ye ſober, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, and watch unto prayer, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy this talent of precious time well. Idleneſs is Satans Shop and the Mother of Miſchief. <hi>David</hi> was at leiſure, and on the roof of his houſe, when Satan pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed by that ſad temptation, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 3. Therefore ſet God alwayes before you, keep in his way, and be doing your duty; that you may be kept from his fiery darts The flying Bird is ſeldom ſhot. The cautious, diligent, active ſoul is moſt ſecure.</p>
               <p>Motive 6. <hi>Time once gone cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called.</hi> Time paſt, is gone for ever; Time preſent (if we may ſo call it) is going; fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Time is moſt uncertain; neither Men or Angels can hinder, or ſtop it; turn, or
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95564:35"/>
bring it back again. If opportunities be not now taken, they may never be had. Be good husbands of your time, and work now, or you may never work. Time's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, may be your ſalvation, therefore follow and improve the light, before dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs overtake you. You all know that yeſterday, or the laſt hour, will never come again. If thou hadſt as much treaſure in thy cuſtody or power, as the whole world is worth, it cannot purchaſe one minute of time paſt. You that are old, may as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily call back your youth, or become young again, as recover any part of this precious time <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 42.</p>
               <p>Motive 7. <hi>The nature of ſaving-Grace, is working and ſpringing up,</hi> which turneth all the powers and faculties of the Soul Heaven-ward. Such is the activity and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of this gracious nature, that it will bring a man to a <hi>What wilt thou have me to do? Acts 9. 6. Epheſ.</hi> 2. 10. 'Tis not a lazy and languid thing, but full of life and power. The ſtate of ſin in Scripture, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by death and darkneſs, which are a ceſſation and privation of life, and light, and motion: and the ſtate of Grace is
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95564:36"/>
deſcribed by life, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. which is power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and moſt vivacious, like the Sword of the Lord, and <hi>Gideon,</hi> doing great things. It is no wonder to ſee the men of the world, that are born after the fleſh, to be dull, ſluggiſh and unactive. But you that have a Divine Nature, and a Spirit of life and power in your hearts, ſhould be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and laborious, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 6. Rom.</hi> 8. 2. This living principle of Grace, made the holy Apoſtle, who excited others to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem their time, ſo to employ his Talent; the Grace of God in him, made him labour more then they all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. The ſtreams of grace that flow into the Soul, are called Rivers of Living Water, <hi>John</hi> 7. 31. and a Well of water ſpringing up unto eternal life, <hi>John</hi> 4. 14. So that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have greater advantage of doing good, and of living to Gods glory. Therefore ſtir up the grace of God that is in you; caſt off ſlothfulneſs, and put on diligence; and laying aſide every weight, rejoyce (as the Son) to run the Race that is ſet before you.</p>
               <p>Motive 8. Conſider, <hi>How highly they prize time, that have loſt it. and are come to the end of it; and who, with the loſs of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95564:36"/>
time, have loſt themſelves.</hi> We have many dreadful Examples that ſtand as ſo many Sea-marks, to warn us to take heed.</p>
               <p>The poor Jews were utterly undone by it. The Lord only knowns how many of them are now in flames, that ſuffer the vengeance of Eternal Fire, for not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the day of Grace, <hi>Luke 19. 42. Matth.</hi> 23. 37. The fooliſh Virgins hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt the opportunity of buying Oyl, came too late to the door. And <hi>Eſan</hi> ſtaid too long to get the bleſſing. Moſt do things when it is too late. Men go to bed late, riſe late, go to Market late, come to Church late, and make peace with God when it is too late. The old <hi>Iſraelites</hi> marched towards <hi>Canaan</hi> when is was too late, and ſo loſt that good Land. O how dreadful will mercy ſlighted and time loſt be, to the awakened ſoul, when it comes to dye, ſeeing it ſelf in a Chriſtleſs ſtate! It was a ſpeech once of a woman in terror of Conſcience, when divers Miniſters and others came to her in a way of comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her; ſhe looks with a ghaſtly counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance upon them, and gives them this anſwer, <hi>Call back time again; if you can,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95564:37"/>
call back time again, then there may be hopes for me: but time is gone.</hi> Another great Lady upon her death-bed, cryed out, <hi>All too late, all too late; a World of Wealth for an inch of Time.</hi> Another Gentlewoman, (of whom I have heard) who was wont to employ this precious Talent of Time, in playing at Cards, and ſuch like-Games, coming from her ſport late in the night, finding her Waiting-maid (that was reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious) reading in a good Book, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her eyes in the Book over the Maids ſhoulder, ſpeaks theſe words, or to this effect: <hi>Thou poor melancholly ſoul! whut always reading, and ſpending thy time thus! wilt thou take no comfort in thy life?</hi> The Gentlewoman retiring to her Chamber went to bed. The maid lodging in the ſame room, perceived her Miſtreſs under great dſquiet and perturbation of Spirit, ſighing and groaning bitterly. The Servant hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, ſeveral times called to her to know the reaſon ſhe could not ſleep: the Maid urging of her, at laſt ſhe cryed out &amp; ſaid, <hi>I read this word ETERNITY in thy Book, which hath ſo pierced my heart, that I believe I ſhall never ſleep more, till I have a better aſſurance of mine Eternity.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95564:37"/>
wanton Lady, that hath waſted her time in ſenſuallity, who dyed not many weeks paſt, told her vicious Mother, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by her bed-ſide, That <hi>it was too late to ſpeak of God to her; for you have undone me, and I am going to Hell before, and you will certainly come after.</hi> It is common with men dying and going into the other World, ſadly to bewail the loſs of time. When they fear Mercy is going, Patience expiring, and the time reſpited for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, over, then they prize opportunities at another rate. And O what would the damned in Hell give to be admitted into the World, if they might but enjoy one day, or hour, to deliver themſelves from that dreadful place of torment, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 27, 28.</p>
               <p>Motive 9. Conſider, <hi>God hath joyned Time and Duty together:</hi> that in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In reſpect of Aſſiſtance.</item>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. God hath joyn'd Time and Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in reſpect of Aſſiſtance: and what Infinite Majeſty hath joyned, muſt not by any means be ſeparated. Work, and Time, Opportunity and Duty; muſt go
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95564:38"/>
together. <hi>Adam</hi> had his work in Paradice before the fall. And ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> was always in action, to the end of his days; His meat and drink was to do the will of his Father. <hi>Nullus mihi per otium dies exit,</hi> I have no day for idleneſs, was the language of a Heathen. Chriſtians, do your work in ſeaſon, and you ſhall have Aſſiſtance. God's opportunity is as wind to the Sails, or as Oyl to the Wheels, which will make you glide through diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult duties with much facility. If we work in God's time, God will work with us, and we ſhall be workers together with him. Goſpel-time is in order to Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work; ſpiritual Opportunities are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and continued for ſpiritual Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The work of faith, repentance, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of ſin, the plucking out right eyes, the chopping off right arms, fighting and wreſtling with the Powers and Prince of darkneſs, are exceeding difficult: but God whoſe arm is potent, will give power: and how eaſily will great work or ſervice be done, when there is great aſſiſtance in the doing of it? A burden that is too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy for one to lift, by the help of another will come up eaſie. This <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>Phil. 4. 13. I can do all things through

Chriſt which ſtrengthneth me.</hi> The feeble <hi>Jews,</hi> by the help of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> raiſed the Walls of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from its very rubbiſh, and that in ſpight of all oppoſition, <hi>Neh.</hi> 3. 2, 3. and 6. 15. they plying the work, the Lord was with them by his great power and ſtrong hand: they made their prayer unto God, when ſtrength was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt decayed, and laboured in the work from the riſing of the morning, till the Stars appeared; and ſo the Wall was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. Let time be redeemed, and then a great deal of work may be done in a little time: God's opportunity will make believing and repenting eaſie, <hi>Luke 19. 6. Acts 2. 37. 41. Acts</hi> 16. 14. 34. O there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while it is day, work out your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for <hi>it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do, of his good pleaſure, Phil.</hi> 2. 12, 13.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God hath joyned Time and Duty, in reſpect of Acceptance. Every time is not an accepted time, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2. The <hi>Iſruelites</hi> that refuſed to march up to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> at Gods command, loſt their oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and afterward he would neither <hi>aſſiſt</hi> them nor <hi>accept</hi> them. If thou ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt till God's time be paſt and gone, art
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95564:39"/>
thou ſure God will accept thee hereafter? There is a time when God will not be found, will not be ſpoken withal, <hi>Iſa. 55. 6. Eſau</hi> ſought the bleſſing with tears, and it was denied him, <hi>Heb. 12. 17. Prov.</hi> 1. 29. Do not ſay, what need ſo much ſpeed? what need ſo much impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of time, ſo much reading, hearing, praying, preaching? but reſolve upon thy now or never.</p>
               <p>Motive 10. Laſtly, Conſider, <hi>That on the preſent moment of time eternity depends.</hi> This deep and heart-affecting Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould even ſwallow us up, and cauſe us to haſten unto our work. Let go Time's opportunity, and you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ruin'd to all Eternity. The Painter being asked why he was ſo exact in drawing his Lines, anſwered, <hi>I paint for Eternity.</hi> Conſider, that thou muſt believe and repent for Eternity, hear and pray for Eternity, fear, love, obey for Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. A work of <hi>infinite moment,</hi> depends on a <hi>moment of Time.</hi> This day thou mayeſt throw thy laſt Caſt for Eternity. This ſwift Poſt will not ſtop, no not for a moment. Secure ſoul! doſt thou ſee E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity before thee, even at thy door, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95564:39"/>
that there is but a ſtep between thee and an endleſs ſtate, and wilt thou not be more induſtrious for thy Soul, and Heaven? If a man were to run or wreſtle for his Life, or for a Crown, or Kingdom, how would he ſtrain, and ſtrive, and that with all his might? If a man were to go over Sea for his life, and had but one gale of wind in his Life-time, would he come to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſide and loſe it; If a Malefactor had but a day appointed him to ſue out his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, would he not improve it? This is all our caſes: God hath given us but a day to work; when the day is ended, it will be night for ever, <hi>Luk. 19. 19, 42. John</hi> 9. 4.

Prayer without fervency, is as a Bullet without Powder, or as a Bird with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wings, that cannot mount up into the Air. Holy fire muſt be put to the daily Sacrifice. God anſwers by Fire. He that looks upon the heart, regards the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of your Prayers, more then the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of your prayers. Cold, ſlight mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling over a few Petitions, either out of cuſtom, or to ſtop the mouth of conſcience,

Numbring the People was <hi>David's</hi> ſin, but numbring his days a duty. 'Tis common for men to number their Sheep, their Cattel, Houſes, Lands, Wares, Money, but to number our days, is a rare kind of numbring: for the neglect of which, what arears are we fallen into, with the great Land-lord of our time? Chriſtians, divide your time into parcels, and conſider how little God hath; how much time was ſpent in thy Infancy and Child-hood, before thou hadſt the uſe of reaſon, how much is ſpent in our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Employments about the world, how much in Eating and Drinking and unprofitable diſcourſe, beſides all this, half, or more, is ſpent in ſleeping: ſo that in the work of God, and about our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſouls, we employ but a very little.

Dial paſſeth from one hour or figure to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, from the Sun riſing to its ſetting, though its ſpeedy tranſient motion is not obſerved: So man paſſeth from infancy to Child-hood, from child-hood to youth, from youth to middle age, and ſo to old age, and the Grave; and we take little or no notice of it. Again, he goeth irreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, neither men nor Angels, Phyſick or Phyſitian can keep him here; it is as eaſie to obſtruct the whole courſe of Nature, or to hinder Gods Covenant of day and night: a man may as well reſtrain the Sun from riſing, the Sea from flowing, or the wind from blowing, as keep man from dying and going to the place appointed for all living. We are but of yeſterday, <hi>Job</hi> 8. 9. It was but as it were yeſterday, and we were in the womb of nothing, had no being, and it will be but as it were to morrow, and we ſhall diſappear, and be (as to this world) as if we had never been. We are cruſhed before the moth, <hi>Job</hi> 4. 19. And in a moment we go down to the Grave, and ſhall come up no more.

            <p>This heart-affecting meditation, had a very great influence on a great <hi>Perſian</hi> King, who taking a view of his huge vaſt Army, wept to think that within a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years not one man of them would be left alive. Sinners, you are to look beyond the grave, becauſe after death, the judgment, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27.

            <p>There the timerous fearful cowardly Apoſtate and back-ſlider in heart, who for fear of a little outward hardſhip, declin'd his profeſſed principles, and turn'd his bach on Chriſt, and his perſecuted little Flock, may be heard to wiſh, that either he had never known the way of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees, or that he had been faithful unto the death.</p>
            <p>Secure, and ſadly deluded ſouls, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider you are not far from this direful gulf, where multitudes of ſouls lament and weep day and night; and certainly, if the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and amazing cries and yellings of thoſe infernal ſpirits were ſounding in your ears, you would not reſt quiet in your Beds or Houſes.</p>
            <p>There were ſad and aſtoniſhing out-cries when the world was drown'd. when <hi>Sodom</hi> was burn'd, to ſee the Clouds ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly

He lives not, that knoweth, where, when, or how he ſhall dye; ſome have gone to bed well, and dyed the ſame night; others have dropt dead from their Horſes; ſome have died at their Tables, whilſt the meat hath been in their mouthes; others have died in their full ſtrength, being wholly at eaſe and quiet; with breaſts full of milk, and bones moiſtned with marrow: others die in the bitterneſs of their ſoul, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver eat with pleaſure. They ſhall lye down a like in the duſt, and the worms ſhall cover them, when they are brought
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95564:62"/>
to the grave, and to remain in the tomb. Sirs! There are many dreadful inſtances in the word of God of the ſad and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den approach of this mercileſs meſſenger death, which ſtand as ſo many Sea-marks to give you warning, leaſt death ſhould come in an hour you look not for it, and find you unprepared. The King of the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> in his greateſt jollity, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not a thought of death, ſaw a hand-writing on the wall, which was very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, and the ſame night was ſlain. <hi>While he was feaſting and drinking wine, and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Gods of Gold and Silver: in the ſame hour came forth fingers of a mans hand, and wrote over againſt the Candleſtick upon the Plaiſter of the wall of the Kings Pallace, and the King ſaw the part of the hand that wrote. Then the Kings countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, ſo that the joynts of his loynes were looſed, and his knees ſmote one againſt another,</hi> Dan. 5. 3, 4, 5, 6. and 30. Death is the King of terrours, and terrour of Kings. Good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſudden ſummons for death, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 1. which made him turn his face to the wall, pray, and weep ſore, and to chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter like a Crane, and mourn like a Dove, in the bitterneſs of his ſoul, becauſe he
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95564:63"/>
was to go to the gates of the grave, and to the pit where there is no hope. The firſt born in <hi>Egypt</hi> were ſlain at midnight, which made a great cry, <hi>Exod. 29. 30. Korah</hi> and his wicked company were ſwallowed up in the midſt of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, <hi>Numb. 16. 30, 31. They went down quickly into the pit, and all</hi> Iſrael <hi>fled at the cry of them.</hi>

            <p>There dyed ſuddenly of the men of <hi>Bethſhemeſh</hi> fifty thouſand, and threeſcore and ten, becauſe they looked into the Ark, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 19. And God many times taketh away the deſire of our eyes with a ſtroak, as he did <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Wife, <hi>Ezek. 24. 16. Job's</hi> children died at their banquet, <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> was ſmitten and died in his ſleep, <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> being Huſband and Wife, died within three or four hours one of the other with a lie in their mouths, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 5, 10. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge many times ſhoots an arrow ſuddenly at wicked men, who dye in the act of ſin, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 64. 7. When they are about to fill their bellies, the Lord doth caſt the fury of his wrath upon them, as he did upon the choſen men of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Pſ. 78. 30, 31. Many times, God, to execute his fierce wrath, ſends out his deſtroying
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95564:63"/>
Angels, who will make dreadful work in a little time, for in one night in the Camp of the <hi>Aſſirians,</hi> the angel of the Lord ſmote a hundred and fourſcore and five thouſand, that in the morning were all dead Corpſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 36. How ſhort and uncertain is our life, ſubject every moment to the ſtroak of death, &amp; which the leaſt crumb or flye may put an end unto, as it hath to many. And as our end may be ſudden, ſo alſo it may be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; a mortal diſeaſe may invade both Heart and head, and poor dying creatures many times are ſo diſtreſſed and diſtracted, that they cannot think of any thing but their tormenting pain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uncapable to ſay any thing to God or men about their ſouls! O how ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and unſenſible do many ſouls make their paſſage into the other world! like <hi>Nabal,</hi> or like a man in a lethargy; or as ſo many ſtocks or ſtones, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake till they awake in the flames of hell. The rich man dyed, and in hell he lift up his eyes; his firſt and ſecond death was very unexpected. All you obdurate ſinners! ſtand here and wonder at the matchleſs mercy, and infinite pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of the great God, in delaying the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95564:64"/>
King of terrors ſo long; God hath not dealt ſo kindly with thouſands of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that are gon before unto judgement, and who went down to the pit in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, witneſs the late dreadful Plague, by the means of which a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſouls were ſent into Eternity. O let not <hi>London,</hi> nor <hi>England</hi> forget that, and other tremendous judgments, which our ſins have called for, leſt a worſe then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yet ſhould come upon us. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of our latter end is a deadly and provoking ſin, and that which will haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en judgement. <hi>Her filthineſs it in her skirts, ſhe remembred not her laſt and: therefore ſhe came down wonderfully, ſhe had no comforter.</hi> Lam. 1. 9.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Conſider, <hi>That where death cometh to ſtrike the ſtroake, your ſouls are ſtated, your Eternity is caſt without change for ever:</hi> Then your immortal ſouls are for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or damnation, for an eternal life, or eternal death, for an eternal heaven, or an eternal hell. You ſadly beſotted ſouls! know and remember, while you have a day, before the golden threed of life be

cut, that if you be found without Chriſt, Faith, Repentance, Holineſs, but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after death, you are undone to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. After death all means and hopes fail, there is no work or device in the grave, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. God will be then irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable, ſin unpardonable, heaven not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable, and your ſouls loſt irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. And then the Devil your bloody ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary will have his deſigne upon you; he knoweth, that if you be his in life and death, that you are his forever, and that he and you ſhall never part. Sinners! this is certain, as the tree falleth, ſo it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; as is the ſeed, ſo will be the harveſt: if you do the Devils work, you muſt have the devils wages, if you march under the command and conduct of the Prince of Darkneſs, and ſuffer him to lead and hurry you hither and thither at his will, whil'ſt you live, you will be his priſoners and ſlaves in that dreadful dungeon of diſmal darkneſs after you are dead.</p>
            <p>Conſider, the Land of darkneſs is no place for ſervice, there's no repenting in the grave, no Lord have mercy on us written upon Hell Gates, no Sabbaths, no Sermons, no Miniſters there. 'Tis in the time of life that you are to labour,

and make preparation for life eternal, becauſe according to your work and choice in this world, will be your ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting lot in the world that is to come. It is appointed for you once to dye, and after death the judgement, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 7. The pale horſe death goeth before, and hell followeth after, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 8. there will be no change of your condition; the eternal ruine, or eternal welfare of your precious ſouls depends on thoſe few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes; this ſwift ſtream of mans life, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it once turneth or declineth, ever run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with a perpetual ebb, never floweth again: ſo that all that you leave undone now, will be undone for ever. If you die unbeleivers, you will be unbeleivers for ever; if you dye under the guilt and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſin and wrath of God, you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under the guilt of ſin and wrath of God for ever: but if you dye holy, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, mortified, ſincere ſouls, you will remain holy, heavenly, and in the favour of God for ever: <hi>Rev. 21. He that is filthy, will be filthy ſtill, and he that is holy will be holy ſtill:</hi> but the inpenitent unpardoned ſinner, though he live a hundred, or a thouſand years in ſatisfying his luſt, will be accurſt at laſt.

               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Is taken from God, <hi>Becauſe the only wiſe, gracious, moſt indulgent, and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſionating God, wiſheth it, and that moſt vehemently. O that they were wiſe!
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95564:68"/>
that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end:</hi> Sirs, in this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical Option, or deſire, there is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tender bowels of God, this is the very language of his heart, and it is, as if he had (after the manner of men) ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thus to his faithful ſervant <hi>Moſes.</hi> I have but one wiſh, or requeſt, and all is comprehended in this one, <hi>viz.</hi> that thou ſhouldſt go and tell them from me, that they muſt be wiſe to conſider this, to remember the dayes of old, and the years of many Generations, what I have done for them in chuſing them above all the Nations of the world to be my treaſure, portion, and peculiar people; and becauſe I love them, I have delivered them, wrought wonders for them in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Red Sea, and in the wilderneſs, and have kept them as tenderly as the apple of mine eye, carrying them upon Eagles wings; but yet let them know, that they have forgotten me, provoked me, and that their end is like to be miſerable, for afire is kindled in mine anget, and unleſs, they do ſpeedily conſider, it will burn to the loweſt hell.</p>
            <p>Now you ſouls in peril, which is beſt? to thwart, croſs, and greive your well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſhing,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95564:69"/>
deareſt, beſt and only friend, or to pleaſe and geatifie your proſeſſed, deadly, implacable enemy? your adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the Devil can't endure that you ſhould think of death or dying; for if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan that old Serpent would permit, and ſuffer you to look into hell, he could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drag nor draw you thither at his pleaſure. And will you go on in the wayes of ſin and death? or bethink your ſelves whoſe you are, what you have done, whither you are going, and what is like to become of you when your breath is gone, what proviſion you have made for your other world, that ſo the great buſineſs between God and your ſouls may be made up.</p>
            <p>Sinners! if the infinitely holy, juſt, and righteous God, did deſire or deſigne your ruine and deſtruction, he would not have excited you to this ſolemn and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration of the end of ſin, death, and Eternity, until it were too late, and you left without remedy; ſo that what is here intended hath a tendency to make you happy, if it be regarded, <hi>O that they were wiſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:95564:69"/>
Reaſ. 2. <hi>Becauſe a deep, ſerious, and heart-affecting conſideration of death and the grave, will both realize it, and repreſent it as near, even at the door, and make it to ſtand in open view:</hi> Whereas things look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon at a diſtance, whether they be good, or whether they be evil, have but a little, if any influence: Now a fixed and hearty conſideration, will give as it were a being to future things, and bring them near, ſo that you may really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with thoſe things.</p>
            <p>A truly godly man, that hath a veiw of unſeen things by divine contemplation here, upon the wings of faith and hope, he may aſcend up into heaven, and walk a turn in the golden ſtreets of the New <hi>Jereuſalem,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was in the Viſions of God at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in his mind, when his body was by the River <hi>Chebar</hi> among the Captives in the Land of the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> ſo likewiſe thoſe ſadly wounded ſpirits, who through fear of death are all their life-time ſubject to bondage, being exercis'd with ſoul-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts, and under powerful cutting and killing convictions of ſin and miſery, or
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95564:70"/>
have ſuch dark and diſmal thoughts and apprehenſions of hell and the wrath of God, which make them ever and anon to enter into the Chambers of death, and viſit the priſoners of the pit, and look upon that black guilt and fiery furnace to be ſo near, that they are on the brink of it falling down continually. This hath been the caſe of many of Gods precious ones, who are now in heaven above all theſe fears and frights that were once more bitter then death. And O how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny travailing with theſe pangs and ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of ſoul are ready to cry out with holy <hi>Job, Chap. 6. 4. The arrowes of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty are within me, the poyſon whereof drinketh up my ſpirit, the terrors of God do ſet themſelves in array againſt me:</hi> Such is the nature of meditation, or conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it will cauſe future and remote things to have a real, powerful, and deep impreſſion on our minds. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>A Merchant in <hi>India,</hi> by his medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or contemplation, may converſe with his Affairs, his Wife, Children, and Friends in <hi>England,</hi> or a Merchant that's walking on the Exchange in <hi>London,</hi> may have his mind and thoughts in <hi>Spain,</hi> or
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95564:70"/>
               <hi>Italy,</hi> or elſe where; a Malefactor caſt into Priſon for ſome notorious Crime, may, long before the Aſſizes, converſe with all the ſad circumſtances of his tryal, he may (in his thoughts) ſee him ſelf brought to the bar, ſtanding before a terrible Judge to heare his indictment read, the Charge prov'd, his doom and ſentence pronounced, and ſee (as it were) himſelf at the place of his execution, with the rope about his neck, which muſt immediately hang him: and if you would in good earneſt ſet your ſelves to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your latter end, you may really and heart-affectingly converſe with old Age Weakneſs, Sickneſs, your death-Bed, ſhort-Breathing, cold ſweats, dying Pangs, and Groans, Winding-ſheets, Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins, and ſee your ſelves (as it were) ſtreched out, nail'd up, and on the ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of men carrying to the grave, where Worms and filthy Vermine muſt feed upon you.</p>
            <p>The Servants of God, and Saints of old, have done this with great ſucceſs, &amp; ſoul advantage, and ſo ſhould you. They have reckoned or counted their Lives by dayes, becauſe they were every day lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Death, and expected it daily.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95564:71"/>
               <hi>Teach us to number our dayes,</hi> ſaid <hi>Moſes,</hi> Pſal. 90. 12. <hi>Few and evil have the dayes of my life been,</hi> ſaid old <hi>Jacob. For man that is born of a woman, is of few dayes,</hi> Job 1. 1, 5. <hi>All the time of which</hi> (ſaid <hi>Job) will I wait till my change come,</hi> Job 14. 14. <hi>For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the houſe</hi> (a dark houſe) <hi>appointed for all living.</hi> And Chapter the 17. 1. he ſaid <hi>my breath is corrupt, my dayes are extinct, the Graves are ready for me;</hi> where-ever he went or came, he was looking for a Grave. Again, by conſideration we may not only look to the Grave, but beyond it, to the great Tranſactions, and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing things that ſhall be after death. We may converſe with the worlds burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chriſt's coming, the Trumpets ſounding, the Graves opening, the Deads riſing, the Wickeds roaring, who (as jolly as they are) ſhall then cry to dead and deaf Mountains and Rocks to fall on them to hide them from the dreadful face of the now ſlighted Son of God; for in that great day of his fierce and terrible wrath, they will not be able to ſtand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 16. 17.</p>
            <p>By realizing this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we may ſee the Judge ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95564:71"/>
the door; and the Son of God (as it were) ready to break forth out of the Clouds with power and great Glory, as <hi>Hierom</hi> did, who ſaid, whether I eat or drink, I hear this voice in mine ears, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe ye dead and come to judgement:</hi> Now if a right conſideration of the great things to come be ſo penetrating, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awakening, let death, which alwayes, dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth you at your heels, be often upon your thoughts, your heads and hearts too ſhould be much upon it; every night you lye down, and every morning you ariſe, let there be ſome ſerious and awful thoughts of death and Eternity. That which many have engraven on their Rings, <hi>viz, Remember to dye,</hi> let it be by the Pen of a Diamond written on your hearts. It's ſtoried of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> that he laid a charge upon one of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to come every morning into his chamber, and proclame this, that he was mortal; and if a Heathen were ſo careful of keeping the memory of his mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, much more ſhould a Chriſtian: we ſhould alwayes remember the dayes of darkneſs, and keep life and death, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and hell before us, there being but a ſtep between us and death. The neglect
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95564:72"/>
and want of this, was <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin, and <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> too, <hi>She did not remember her laſt and, therefore ſhe came down wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Lam. 1. 9. And this God, who would have us remember, and conſider, doth ſadly complain ofby the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 3. calling heaven and earth to witneſs for him, <hi>Hear O heavens, and give ear O earth, the Oxe knoweth his owner, and the Aſs his Maſters crib, but</hi> Iſrael <hi>doth not know, my people do not conſider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reaſ. 3. <hi>A ſerious conſideration of your latter end (through grace) will prove an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and ſoveraign Antidote to expel the greateſt evil (yea, a means to eſcape an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite loſs)</hi> viz. <hi>ſin, and the dreadful effects, and conſequences of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is the cauſe of that inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and ſea of wickedneſs, and moſt prodigious ſins, that are now in the world, and in this Nation, in every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Town, and Place, and in the moſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, among all ranks and degrees of men, <hi>viz.</hi> Magiſtrates, Miniſters, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Parents, Children, Maſters, Servants,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95564:72"/>
but this, their not duly, and deeply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their latter end; this we find laid down in the word of God to be one main ground of all ſin, and of the neglect of all duties.</p>
            <p>You careleſs ſouls! did you beleive and remember that you muſt die and come to judgement, that your naked ſouls, and naked ſins, muſt ſhortly ſtand before the moſt tremendous, direful Judge of quick and dead, the reflection hereof would be as a knife at your throats, as a ſword at your breaſt, or as a hand-writing on the wall, to retard and hinder your conſtant and deſperate courſe of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>O what horrid, helliſh outrages are, now committed, and that deliberality, impudently, obſtinately, even againſt the light of nature, Conſcience, Scripture? What Curſing, Lying, Swearing, Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheming. Sabbath-breaking, Cheating, Couzening, Stealing! what wantonneſs, filthineſs, uncleanneſs, ſwiniſh drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, covetouſneſs, earthly-mindedneſs! what mocking, ſcoffing, wrath, envy, malice, pride, paſſion, and ſpiritual wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs too, as unbeleif, a theiſm, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, hypocriſie, apoſtacy, hatred of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:95564:73"/>
God, his people, miniſters, wayes, and ordinances every where aboundeth! Men declare their ſins like <hi>Sodom,</hi> and are not aſhamed of the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and why? but becauſe they doe not ſet their minds and hearts upon their latter end.</p>
            <p>Poor dying ſinners (Let me! out of tender compaſſion to your bleeding, and almoſt ſinking ſouls) intreat you as for the Lords ſake, to goe down to the grave, to go down to hell in your thoughts, and ſtop here, and think of the King of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, the worm of Conſcience, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Devils, the burning lake, the bottomleſs pit, the loſs of God, of Chriſt, of Heaven, and your precious ſouls; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, thoſe fiery, ſcorching, endleſs flames, the preſence and company of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, Reprobates and damned ſpirits; and your ſweet morſels will be gall and wormwood to you: theſe amazing things being truly reflected on, will be as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in your eyes, as thunder in your ears, as thorns, darts, and ſwords in your fleſh, as poyſon in your bowels, as fire in your bones, to compel and force you ſpeedily tocurb and check the reins of your helliſh luſts, that you ſo might five from wrath to come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:95564:73"/>
Did you but view that dark and cold grave, and hot hell that is ſo neer, you would rather ſtarve or dye then run to that exceſs of riot; you could not ſleep, and ſnort, dance and ſport upon the pits brink under ſuch a conſideration.</p>
            <p>But forget all this baniſh the thoughts of God, death, and hell, and you will run and ruſh into ſin, as the horſe into battel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 45, crying peace, peace, till danger, death and deſtruction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
            <p>This was that mighty ſin that ripened <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for ruine, and brought her down wonderfully: her filthineſs is in her skirts, ſhe remembreth not her laſt end. The Lord complaineth by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiab</hi> of the ſame thing, <hi>Iſrail</hi> doth not know; my people doth not conſider; but what follows, ah ſinful Nation, a people la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with iniquity, a ſeed of evil doers, they have forſaken the Lord, they have provoked the holy one of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> compare <hi>Lam. 1. 9. Iſa.</hi> 1. 3. 4:</p>
            <p>But he that doth that which is lawful and right, ſhall ſave his ſoul alive; who is that? he that conſidereth and turneth away from all his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, he ſhall ſave his ſoul,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95564:74"/>
whoſoever doth periſh, that man ſhall never periſh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 14. 28.</p>
            <p>Reaſ. 4. <hi>The conſideration of your latter and, will be a powerful incentive to make you exert and put forth the greateſt induſtry in a way of duty,</hi> yea, it will certainly have an influence upon all our duties, and upon all our graces; for conſidering and doing are frequently joyn'd together, <hi>Pſal. 41. 1. Prov. 31. 16. ſhe conſidereth a field, and buyeth it: I thought on my wayes, or conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my wayes, and turned my feet unto thy teſtimonies, Pſal. 119. 59. Lam. 3. 40. Heb.</hi> 10: This, if any thing, will make you ſerious, diligent, and conſtant in any duty, and to work while it is day, before the night cometh wherein no man can work. The Apoſtle exhorts to conſider one another, to provoke to love and good works, and ſo much the more as ye ſee the day approaching, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 24, 25. The remembrance of the day of our death, and of our paſſing into eternity, with a deep impreſſion of it upon the heart, will be as a voice of thunder, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſecure ſenſleſs ſinner, awake,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95564:74"/>
awake thou that ſleepeſt, open thine eys, ſtand upon thy feet, and behold and ſee what a ſea of blood and wrath is here. See and beleive, beleive and conſider, conſider and fear, fear and fly, and make haſt in thy work: Thy work is great and weighty, diverſions are many, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries are ſtrong, thy ſtrength is ſmall, thy time is ſhort, thy account is great, death and judgement are at the door, therefore up and be doing, now, or never.</p>
            <p>You ſlow and ſlothful ſouls! Let your apparent and inevitable danger ſuddenly provoke and ſpur you unto your duty, to ſeek the Lord in a time accepted, before the door of life beſhut, God with-drawn, and mercy quite gone.</p>
            <p>The prophaneſt Sea-man, will ſigh, mourn, pray, promiſe, vow, if death and danger looks him in the face; when the ſhip was like to be broken, and death threatned immediately to ſurprize them, the Marriners were ſore afraid, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every one to his God. And this, the very light of nature dictated to the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter (though a Heathen) that then it was no ſeaſon to ſleep, what meaneſt thou O ſleeper? ariſe and call upon thy
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95564:75"/>
God, if ſo be that God will think upon us that we periſh not, <hi>Joneh</hi> 1. 6. and the moſt notorious thieves and murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers will pray in priſon, or when they come to the Gallows, the place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>When the moſt righteous Judge ſent his deſtroying Angels to the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and other places in the year 65. for the dreadful fear of which many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands did flye, and many thouſands did fall, <hi>viz.</hi> the carkaſes of men like dung upon the ground, and as handfuls after the Harveſt man. When death did knock at a thouſand doors in one night, Owhat confeſſing of ſin, faſtings, crying, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate knocking was there at the throne of grace (and it may be by many perſons &amp; families, that prayed but little before or ſince) that God would pity, pardon, and remove that amazing, ſweeping judgement, which is now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgotten. Upon an unwakening ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of <hi>Ninevehs</hi> fatal ruine, the King and his Nobles decreed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a Faſt, and injoyned every one to cry mightily to God, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. 7.</p>
            <p>Sinners, were you but truly ſenſible of your peril, you would pray to purpoſe,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95564:75"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> more ardently, more in wardly, more deeply, more affectionately then ever you have done. It was a ſuppoſed danger, and that of death, that cauſed <hi>Jacob</hi> to weep and make ſupplication, for <hi>Eſau</hi> hated <hi>Jacob,</hi> and ſaid in his heart, the dayes of mourning for my Father are at hand, then will I ſtay <hi>my</hi> brother <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 27. 42. and <hi>Jacob</hi> was greatly afraid and diſtreſſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 7. Which made him ſo importunate with God for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and he prevailed, <hi>Gen. 31. 11. Hoſ.</hi> 12. 4. Poor ſinners! your caſe is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous (I will not ſay deſperate) but you are ignorant of it; you do not know that you are poor, miſerable, blind, and naked; were you but ſenſible that you are liable to the wrath of God, the ſtroke and ſting of death every moment, it would conſtrain you to cry mightily to God for pardon. Holy <hi>Job,</hi> when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of Death and Judgement, ſet prayer to work, and ſaid, <hi>Why doſt thou not pardon my tranſgreſſion, and take away mine iniquity for now ſhall</hi> I <hi>ſleep in the duſt: O that thou wouldeſt hide me in the grave, that thou wouldeſt keep me ſecret until thy wrath be paſt, that thou wouldeſt appoint me a ſet time, and remember me,</hi> Job 7, 21. <hi>&amp;.</hi> 14. 13.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95564:76"/>
This alſo made thoſe two gracious Kings <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> to weep and pray in the bitterneſs of their ſouls: <hi>In thoſe dayes was</hi> Hezekiah <hi>ſick unto death, and</hi> Iſaiah <hi>the Prophet came unto him, and ſaid, thus ſaith the Lord, ſet thine houſe in order, for thou ſhalt dye, and not live; then</hi> Hezekiah <hi>turned his face to the wall, and wept ſore, and prayed to the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 28. 1, 2, 3. <hi>David,</hi> when the ſorrows of death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed him, and paines of hell got hold of him, then (ſaid he) I <hi>called upon the Lord, O Lord, I beſeech thee deliver my ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 116. 3, 4. <hi>Jonah</hi> that could ſleep in the ſhip, prayed in the Whales belly, <hi>Out of the belly of hell</hi> I <hi>cryed, and thou heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt my voice,</hi> Jonah 2. 2. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> and Chriſt himſelf preſſeth pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from the conſideration of the end of the world. <hi>The end of all things is at hand, be ye therefore ſober, and watch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prayer,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 7. and <hi>pray</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that you may eſcape all theſe things, and ſtand before the Son of man,</hi> Luk. 21. 36. Neither doth our dear Lord Jeſus preſs that on us, which he did not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; for being ſenſible of the bitter and moſt dreadful cup of his Fathers wrath, prayed, <hi>Father, if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

            <p>Sinners! let me tell you, as ſecure and ſenſleſs as you are, an awakning impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of approaching death and judgement upon your ſouls; would be as the cry at midnight, to excite and ſtir you up, to get in your Oyle, and to trim your lamp. The Virgins, both wiſe and fooliſh, were all aſleep and ſecure enough, until that ſudden and amazing cry was heard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Bridegroom cometh, go you forth to meet him, <hi>Math. 26. 6. Then they all aroſe, and trimmed their Lamps.</hi> 'Tis the ſtorm and rain that haſtens the Bee into the Hive, that brings the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller into his Inn, the Ship into the Hare bour; ſo likewiſe the ſenſe of death, the dead and drouſie Profeſſor unto his prayer; <hi>in their afflictions they will ſeek me early,</hi> Hoſ. 5. 15.</p>
            <p>Anh eart-affecting meditation of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable eternity, will be as a voice from the clouds, crying, <hi>haſt ſinner haſt, poſt haſt, haſt as for thy life in the work of faith and repentance, in parting with ſin, and cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt, without which there will be no hope. Noah</hi> was moved with fear, and prepared and got into the Ark, to the ſaving of his houſe, when the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

deluded world died by the deluge, <hi>Heb. 11. 7. Knowing the terrour of the Lord we perſwade men,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 11.</p>
            <p>You wretched ſinners, that will not beleive or conſider until you are juſt dropping into the pit, if you had but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cranny to look into the other world, how violent and reſolute would you be in the ſpeedy proſecution of your known duty; you would examine, prove, and try your ſelves; you would read, hear, meditate, watch, pray, repent, fear, love, obey more then ever. Did you ſee, the night will come, is coming, and that the dayes of darkneſs ſhall be many, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you do, you would do it with your might, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9. 10. Now before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree bring forth, before the day paſs as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord come upon you, ſeek ye the Lord; for how ſhall you eſcape if you neglect ſo great ſalvation, <hi>Zeph. 2. 23. Heb.</hi> 2. 3.</p>
            <p>Reaſ. 5. <hi>You are to conſider your latter and, becauſe there lyeth your higheſt wiſdom. O that they were wiſe, &amp;c.</hi> If you would
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95564:77"/>
be ſo wiſe as to exceed all the Wiſe men; great Statiſts and Polititians in the world, it muſt be in conſidering of, and preparing for your end.

'Tis true wiſdome to underſtand this, <hi>viz.</hi> to be wiſe to that which is good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 19. to be wiſe in Chriſt; to ſecure the cheifeſt good, is the beſt wiſdom.</p>
            <p>There are many worldly wiſe men, who while they live provide for every thing but death, and they are often ready to dye, before they begin to live (in a ſpiritual ſenſe) and is it not a very unfit and ſad ſeaſon, to prepare for death when its a burden to live? And indeed ſuch are the many evils attending old age, that men can have no pleaſure in them, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12. 1, And ſhall theſe be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the only wiſe men, that are but wiſe in their Generation to get the world, to purſue lying vanities, and forſake their own mercies, to hew out ciſterns, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ciſterns rhat can hold no water, and forſake the fountain of living water? this is to prefer Pebbles before Pearls, to gain
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95564:78"/>
Larth, and to loſe Heaven, <hi>Jer. 2. 13. Jonah 2. 8. Math.</hi> 16. 26. To be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for a time, and miſerable to eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>True wiſdom, and ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is exerciſed about things good &amp; evil, yea it is converſant about the beſt good, how it may attain it, and about the worſt evil, how it may impede, avoid and eſcape it, chuſing the moſt adequate and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual means to bring it to paſs. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent divine wiſdom is proper and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to direct, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 10. and ſo it doth every conſidering godly man while he lives, firſtly and firmly to ſecure that which he hath of greateſt value, <hi>viz.</hi> a precious ſoul, more worth then any thing he ſtands poſſeſſed of: If all the Rocks were Pearls, all the earth and Heaven Gold, or if all the water in the vaſt Ocean were converted into Cryſtal, or the moſt precious ſtones in the world, and put all into one ſcale, and the ſoul into the other ſcale, the ſoul would weigh it all down. Our dear Lord tells us, that the gaining of the whole world is an invaluable conſideration to the loſs of our ſoul, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. So that he muſt be wiſe indeed, that hath gotten a Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95564:78"/>
for this rare incomparable Jewel, where it will be for ever ſafe. He that winneth ſouls is wiſe, ſaith the wiſeſt of a meer man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 30, and ſure then he is ſo that ſaves his own. Again, he that conſidereth his end, is in the very way to procure and make the beſt friend, that will certainly ſtand him in ſtead to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and in the greateſt peril, <hi>viz.</hi> God, Chriſt, Angels, Saints, Conſcience, Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, his real friends. When once the breach is made up between God and the poor ſoul, who can harm or hurt it? <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>I will lay me down and ſleep in peace,</hi> Pſa. 14. 8. Moreover, he provideth againſt the greateſt wants, by the laying up for a ſpending time. There was not a man to be found in all <hi>Egypt</hi> ſo wiſe as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who fore-ſeeing their want, filled the ſtore-houſes againſt the years of Famine. He that gathereth his meat in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> is wiſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 5. Conſider the time of youth is your Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; old-age, a ſick-bed, is not a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, but a ſpending time, and you are not wiſe, wiſe towards God, wiſe for your precious ſoules, that do not make it your buſineſs to Trade, and lay up a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95564:79"/>
ſtock and ſtore againſt that time. Many a ſilly ſoul like the wanton Graſhopper, leaps and ckips, chirps and ſings all the Summer, and when the Winter cometh periſheth for want: But the truly ſerious and conſidering ſoul, like the laborious Bee or Ant, toils and labours in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: And that man might put off ſloth, and learn his duty, and ſo provide for time to come, <hi>Solomen</hi> ſends him to the Ant, <hi>Go to the Ant thou ſluggard, conſider her wayes, and be wiſe, which provideth her meat in the Summer, and gathereth her food in Harveſt; Prov.</hi> 6. 6, 8. And ſo the wiſe in heart, that trade for eternity, lay up, the beſt ſupplies againſt the evil day which are the favour of God, an intereſt in Chriſt, pardon of ſin, peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, a ſtock of prayers, rich and choice experiences, and love-tokens of their fathers favour, the evidences for their heavenly Country. This is the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and heavenly treaſure of the godly man, who only is called the man of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 9.</p>
            <p>Beſides, he preventeth the worſt evils, <hi>viz.</hi> the guilt of ſin, the ſting of death, ſorrows of hell, terrours of Conſcience; the wrath of God, the loſs of God, his
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95564:79"/>
ſoul, and heaven. This infinite and irreparable evil or loſs he ſhall never ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain, becauſe this timely conſideration of death and judgement, will be a means to fit him for it. <hi>They that were ready went in to the Marriage,</hi> Matth. 25. 10.</p>
            <p>But for you that are careleſs of your immortal ſouls, that think not of death, that will not conſider your latter end (if infinite mercy doth not ſpeedily prevent) you will certainly dye without wiſdom; if you do not ſeaſonably ſecure your ſouls, make God and Chriſt your friends (while the poor people of God lay up a treaſure in heaven, a good foundation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the time to come.) <hi>You will treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the righteous judgement of God,</hi> Rom. 2. 5. And this is the doleful caſe of many worldly wiſe men, &amp; of thoſe too whoſe office and imployment is to keep (if it might be) others alive, <hi>viz.</hi> to cure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and prevent death. It is obſerved concerning <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> a great Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, a man very skilful in Chymical Experiments, that he bragged and boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he had attained to ſuch wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in diſcerning the conſtitutions of men, and in ſtudying remedies, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95564:80"/>
did follow his rules, and keep his directions, ſhould never dye by any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, caſually he might, and of age he muſt, but he would undertake to ſecure his health againſt diſeaſes. A bold and moſt preſumptuous undertaking: But he who by Art promiſed to protect others, could not by his art make himſelf a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in the prime of his age, who died before, or when he had lived but thirty years.</p>
            <p>Poor mortals! ſith that thou cant pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent death, it is your wiſdome to prepare for it, and foraſmuch as you cannot by any means, power or skill, keep off the ſtroak of death, get while you may a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy or Antidote againſt the ſting of Death, that when you dye you may not dye unpreparedly, or dye without wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>For man in honour that underſtandeth not, is like the beaſt that periſheth,</hi> Pſal. 49. 20. So died that miſerably miſtaken rich man, who (though by himſelf or others judged wiſe) in the account of the only wiſe God was a very fool: who provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding only for the time of life, and not for death, did deſerve the name of <hi>thou fool,</hi> This night ſhall thy ſoul be requir'd, <hi>Lu.</hi> 12. 20. a dark and dreadful night indeed,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:95564:80"/>
in which he loſt both worlds at once, earth and heaven too. And will you ſay, that you are wiſe, and not conſider what your end will be. The five Virgins are called fooliſh Virgins; but why? becauſe they did not make proviſion for the Bridegroom's coming, and when they came to the Door it was ſhut upon them; ah! ſad and dreadful diſappointment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 10.</p>
            <p>But the diligent and prepared ſoul, that hath gotten in his oyl, and made all ready, is in a capacity to look upon Death with a ſmiling aſpect, becauſe the deadly poyſon and ſting is out, and it can but kill the body, 'tis not able to hurt the ſoul: But the ſleepy ſecure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will be dreadfully ſurprized as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi> was by the hand writing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on the wall, the terrifying and amazing ſight of which changed his countenance, and troubled his thoughts, ſo that neither his Wine, his wives, or Concubines could comfort him: who had lifted up himſelf againſt the Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>Sinners! Conſider the King of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours is a terrible ſight, and none more, then to thoſe that have their heaven here,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95564:81"/>
it will be to ſuch as the tearing their caul from their very hearts, worſe then cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off a Member from the body; for many have ſuffered the loſs of Members, to ſave their lives; <hi>O death, death, death, how bitter, bitter, is the remembrance of thee to the man that is at eaſe in his poſſeſſion.</hi> And let me tell you, evils and dangers, by how much the more ſudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected they are, by ſo much the more dreadful and aſtoniſhing they are. What a ſad and hidious cry was there in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gygt,</hi> when at midnight God ſmote their firſt-born, and alſo when the Earth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened her mouth and ſwallowed up <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> and his curſed company, that went down alive into the pit, inſomuch that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> fled at the cry of them, for they ſaid, leſt the earth ſwallow us up alſo, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 31, 32, 34. And how terrible was that ſudden ſhower of fire and brimſtone upon filthy <hi>Sodom,</hi> after a bright Sun-ſhine morning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 23, 34 So when grim and ghaſhly. Death cometh in a black night, and draweth the curtain, and looketh upon the ſecure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, it will be very formidable, for who can look Death in the face, that dare not look God or his own conſcience in the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:95564:81"/>
face? But the ſincerely godly man, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for death, may look and live above the fear of Death, and Hell, and welcome Death, as old <hi>Jacob</hi> did the Waggons, that his ſon <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſent to fetch him down to <hi>Egypt;</hi> when he ſaw the waggons the ſpirit of <hi>Jacob</hi> their Father revived, <hi>Gen.</hi> 46. 27. Death, though a grim Porter, will open the gate of Glory to every Beleiver, and let them into their Fathers houſe, for both life and death are theirs, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 22. Bleſſed are the dead, that dye in the Lord,</hi> Rev. 14. 13. <hi>To me to live is Chriſt, and to dye is gain,</hi> Phil. 1. 11. <hi>Whoſo is wiſe will obſerve theſe things.</hi> Theſe are the reaſons why your latter end muſt be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

Now that your bodies are not laid up in that dark and diſmal priſon of the Grave, and your dear never-dying ſouls, bound, fettered, and chained in that direful, painful, priſon of hell, is matter of the greateſt wonder in all the world.

How little do the living lay to heart this great buſineſs of their Mortality, inſomuch that when they would deny a thing with greateſt confidence, they will commonly ſay they thought no more of it then of their dying day, as if death were not a matter of any moment, but rather a meer toy, or trifle, not to be regarded. <hi>She remembred not her laſt end.</hi> Lam. 1. 9.</p>
               <p>You ſelf deſtroying ſinners!

If you have forgotten it, the all-ſeeing and heart-ſearching God remembers it. Know and conſider in thy heart, that death that did but warn thee
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95564:86"/>
then, by ſending his ſummons, will ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come himſelf.</p>
               <p>Forgetful of Death! and made of duſt, born of a woman, and under a Decree not to be revoked by men or Angels! <hi>Heb. 6. 27. Job 14. 3. As for man, his dayes are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou haſt appointed his bounds, that he cannot paſs.</hi>

What, no more ſerious thoughts of death! and ſo many pieces and parcels of your ſelves gone before to this long home; ſo many Relations and Children now a ſleep in the duſt of death? are they buried in perpetual oblivion, never to be remembred any more?</p>
               <p>What Sinner! What not think of Death! and Death at thy very heels, and before thine eyes, whither can you direct your eyes; and not ſee that which preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth or repreſenteth Death? all the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Death is on the Trees, in our Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, in every flower; At your Table every day you feed on the fleſh of dead Creatures, to tell you that you muſt die; and is not death in your beds every night? what is ſleep but the picture and image of cold Death? and your beds but the repreſentation of your dark graves?</p>

preſent pain, poverty, ſickneſs, and other worldly troubles and perplexities, not rightly conſidering how terrible death is, or what are the dreadful conſequences of it. Now that we may be convinced of this ſin and folly, give me leave to tell you, that between the worſt, longeſt, and deepeſt miſeries and calamities of this life, and thoſe after death, there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, but an exceeding diſtance.</p>
               <p>Poor deluded ſouls! what is the bite of a flea, to the ſting of a Serpent? or a ſcratch on the hand, to a ſtab at the heart? what's the heat and ſmart of a little can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, to a hot fiery furnace, or a devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flame? What's a drop of gall, to a Sea, or Ocean of poyſon? or what is pain, forture or anguiſh for an hour, to intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable miſery time without end, into which to the unconverted death will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be the door? and are you ſo mad to imagine that there is nothing in the other world to be feared, or felt worſe then outward preſſures, perils, pains, which are but bodily miſeries, and that but for a moment? This ſin not only the prophane world are guilty of, but ſome of thoſe that profeſs the Name of God. <hi>Rebecah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iſaac, I am weary of my
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95564:88"/>
life becauſe of the Daughters of Heth,</hi> Gen 27. 46. <hi>Rachel</hi> cryes out, <hi>give me Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or elſe I dye,</hi> Gen. 30. 1. <hi>Eliſha</hi> being threatned by <hi>Jezabel</hi> ſaid, <hi>O Lord, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way my life,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings 19. 4. Jonah</hi> for the loſs of a poor gourd, ſaid, <hi>its better for me to dye then to live,</hi> and told God to his very face, that <hi>he did well to be angry, even unto death,</hi> Jonah 4. 9. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they wanted water wiſht they had died in the wilderneſs. Theſe and the like wicked wiſhes are in the mouths of many poor ignorant, diſcontented per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who long to be out of this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world.</p>
               <p>Now by way of conviction, I ſhall lay down theſe following particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What think you of theſe inward, and ſoul-ſtraits, and conflicts with which Gods poor afflicted people are ſadly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd. And were you but ſenſible of the guilt and weight of ſin, a wounded ſpirit, the wrath of God, and thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting burnings; it would quickly ſwallow up your outward miſeries, though never ſo many. This is evident in the example of the Jaylor, who for the loſs of his priſoners was ſo tormented, that he would have kill'd himſelf before
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95564:89"/>
he was convinced of the dreadful ſtate of his ſoul that was in danger of ruin, <hi>Act. 16. 27, 28, 29, 30. Then he fell, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, Sirs, what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To wiſh for death, becauſe of the evils attending this life, is very wicked, and dangerous, interpretatively, and in effect it is to wiſh your ſouls in hell.</p>
               <p>Conſider and mind this alſo, that your preſent ſorrowes, croſſes, troubles, of what kind or degree ſoever they be, are the fruits of your ill-doings, and fatleſs then you deſerve, for its a wonder you are not in hell! and will you dare to be ſo audacious, as to flye in the face of your faithful Creator, when you ſhould be deeply ſenſible of your horrible wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and humble under Gods hand, and accepting of the puniſhment of your ſin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ye ſhould repent and turn to God; take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the cauſe, and the effect will ceaſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You can pleaſe and gratifie the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil your deadly adverſaty in nothing more; you wiſh for death, ſo doth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil too; if you are his now, you muſt be his then; his here, and his for ever: He waits, and longs that your breath were gone, your ſouls ſeparated, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would have you poyſon, hang
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95564:89"/>
drown, ſtarve, or ſtob your ſelves that you might be dead, damn'd and burn'd with him in hell.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, if you were dead you would ſuddenly repent, and change your mind, and, if it might be, give the world to be alive again, with all the wants, pains, and greif you now endure. Had you but a peeping hole into hell, to ſee and here what they endure, you would confeſs your ſins, judge your ſelves, and cloſe with Chriſt before you dye, that ſo you might not come into that dreadful place of torment. Now that you may hear, and fear, and do no more ſo wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, Let me ask you.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What think you of the ſting and bitterneſs of death, when a man comes to dye, Conſcience being awakened, roaring like a Lyon, death the King of terrours ſtanding by, when the guilt of paſt-ſins and loſs of precious time, will be as ſo many fiery darts, and ſtinging ſcorpions, biting and gnawing on the heart? What think you it will be to dye unconverted, to dye in a ſtate of ſin, and wrath, a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to God, in a ſtate of unbelief and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency (the ſoul-damning ſins) to dye with an evil heart, an accuſing conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95564:90"/>
ſelf condemn'd, caſt in your own breaſt, to dye, which is worſt of all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What think you of the ſadneſs and amazing terrour of approaching judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſecond death, when a man comes to take a dreadful view of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, and begins to reflect and think. Wherefore was I born, what have I been doing, are all theſe my ſins? O where ſhall I leave them? or how ſhall I be rid of them, now I am dying? whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther am I going? what will be my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? where ſhall be the place? and how near am I to it? what muſt I endure? and how long? how long? and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will anſwer, to all eternity, miſery without end. This will amaze, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and overwhelm the ſoul with fear, and perturbation, when it ſees that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is loſt, and that it muſt down, down to the Region of darkneſs, and company of Devils, in that ſtate of everlaſting wo. The killing thoughts of which made a great man wiſh, that he might live, though bur the life of a Toad.</p>
               <p n="3">3. What think you of the impartia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Judge, that will not ſpare the guilty, muſt and will Judge and ſentence according to the fact, and reward every
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95564:90"/>
man according to his works? He would not ſpare the Angels that ſinn'd, but caſt them down to hell, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. not <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> but caſt him out of paradiſe, and ſet a flaming (word againſt him, neither will he ſpare any impenitent ſinner in the day of his wrath; juſtice obliges him to juſtifie the righteous, and condemn the wicked.</p>
               <p n="4">4. What think you of the impoſſibility of having any appeal? There will be no <hi>Moſes</hi> to mediate, no mediator to plead, no <hi>Daniel, Noah,</hi> or <hi>Job</hi> to intercede or to ſtand in the gap, not an Interceſſor in Earth or Heaven to be found to ſpeak a word. There can be no appeal to God, his Calls and Councels have been refuſed, his Intereſt oppoſed, his Enemies counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced, his laws violated, his Anger will burn like fire. No appeal to Jeſus Chriſt, his Government hath been ſlighted, his Grace and Perſon rejected or to the, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, he hath been quencht and greived: or to angels or Saints; all will be againſt you.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whar think you of the reſignation of ſoul and body to the executioner and tormentor, the red dragon? 'tis ſad to ſee a poor malefactor committed to the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95564:91"/>
Jaylor or Hangman, but O how much more dreadful will it be for ever-living ſouls in the face of men and Angels, to be delivered into the hands of that raging, roaring Lyon, the Devil? When God the righteous Judge ſhall ſay in ſight of the whole world, here are the men that brak my Statutes, prophaned my Sabbaths, that hated my Saints, that ſerved the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, in the ſatisfying their Luſts, the open and profeſſed Adverſaries to my Name and Intereſt, that would not, though I often intreated them, come at my call, accept of my love, receive my Son, or endure a life of holineſs, or by any means be drawn and perſwaded to think of and prepare for death and judgement, though they had time and opportunity enough: Now take them devil, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to hell with them; for my ſoul ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors them. Thy Covenant ſervants and voluntary ſlaves they were in time, and thy priſoners in chains of darkneſs they ſhall be eternity, to be tormented day and night for ever. <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 10.</p>
               <p n="6">6. What think you of eternal ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment and ſeparation from God, Chriſt, Angels, Saints, Heaven? This is
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95564:91"/>
the puniſhment of loſs, and the worſt of hell, <hi>Matth. 25. 41. Then ſhall he ſay unto them on the left hand, depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels: O terrible, terrible!</hi> to be doom'd or ſentenc'd to lye under the wrath and hatred of the infinitely great and dreadful God for ever and ever, as long as God ſhall live, whoſe being is to eternity, as long as there is a Devil to torment, or to be tormented, ſhall their plagues laſt. The fearful and unbeleiving, and the abominable, Murderers, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, Lyars, Dogs, Sorcerers, carry all their ſins down to hell with them, the fuel that feeds the wrath of God, ſo that the Oyl of ſin cauſes the Lamp of wrath to burn &amp; flame everlaſtingly. The debt of ſin can never be paid, juſtice never ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, for the damn'd ſoul remains impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and God implacable, ſo that there can be no hope of pardon. The ſentence is ſtrict, unchangeable, irreverſable, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. O eternity! eternity! this ſtings, plagues, and augments, and aggravates the moſt intollerable puniſhment of the damn'd. After an innumerable thouſands of years they ſhall think it but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their ſorrows, and ſhall be
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95564:92"/>
ſo far from an end, as if they had been in hell but an hour. It will be everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and the glory of his power, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 9. In compariſon of which, all the rendings, rackings, tearings, torturings of mens bodies here, by the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite torments upon racks, gibbets, wheels grid-irons, boyling lead, boyling oyl, and other bloudily invented engines and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of amazing cruelty, are but a flea-biting.</p>
               <p>Sinners! 'tis <hi>hell, hell,</hi> that will make the ſadly tormented ſoul ſeek death, wiſh, and long for that which ſhall never be, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 6. And will you deſire and wiſh for the woeful day? God forbid! now your condition may be changed, then it will be ſtated. <hi>Wo, wo</hi> unto you that deſire the day of the Lord, to what end is it for you? <hi>The day of the Lord is darkneſs, and not Light,</hi> Amos 5. 18. <hi>A day of glosmineſs, a day of clouds, and of thick darkneſs, at which the people ſhall be much pained, and all faces ſhall gather blackneſs, the inhabitants of the Land ſhall tremble, for the day of the Lord is very terrible, Joel</hi> 2. Now therefore do not wickedly wiſh it, but wiſely conſider and prepare
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:95564:92"/>
for it: And bleſſed is that ſervant whom when his Lord cometh, findeth ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>3. It reproves the <hi>ſelfc-onfident and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous,</hi> who conclude upon a fitneſs and preparedneſs for death and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon very ſlight and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grounds, namely, becauſe they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the notoriouſly wicked, are not prophane, make a profeſſion, ſhew ſome legal ſorrow for ſin, run the round of duty, though carnal and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs enough in thoſe duties, from hence they eaſily perſwade themſelves that all is well, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are the Children of God, in a ſtate of grace, and going to Heaven, and as fit to dye as the very beſt. How many thouſands are there in the Chriſtian world, that ſecurely ſleep and dream of an intereſt in Chriſt, that hope and promiſe themſelves a future and glorious felicity, who are but meet moral men, and worſe, or rotten paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hypocrites at the beſt, having only a form of Godlineſs, reſtraining,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:95564:93"/>
counterfeit, or common grace? Such were the Scribes and Phariſees, &amp; the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Virgins, &amp; yet confident to the very laſt; they came to the door with <hi>a Lord, Lord, open unto us.</hi> They had blazing Lamps, but no oil in their Lamps or Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, no real union with Jeſus Chriſt, no precious faith, no ſincere love or evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical repentance, the root of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not in them.</p>
               <p>You that have a name to live, take heed you be not deceived; if you are not truly united unto Jeſus Chriſt, he will certainly diſown you. The Lord Jeſus tells us of ſuch ſadly deluded ſouls, that ſhall ſtand up at the laſt day, and challenge a reward in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to whom he will proteſt, <hi>I know you not, Matth.</hi> 7. 23. they never ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly knew him, had never any uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or communion with Chriſt in the world. Many are called, but few cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, the Children of the kingdome (ſaith Chriſt) ſhall be caſt out. And I muſt tell you, who-ever comes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, will miſs many there which they thought to find, and find others there they little expected. The Sinners in <hi>Sion</hi> are more then a few, the Goates
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95564:93"/>
more then the Sheep, the Tares more then the Wheat, more reprobate ſilver then pure tryed gold. The pure in heart and truly godly man that mourns and bleeds for ſin, that loves God, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes Chriſt above the world, is many times full of feares and doubts about his ſoul, and the eternal condition of it: O what would he not give to be aſſured that all is well between God and him? to know that God and Chriſt is his, that he is fit to live or die, becauſe a miſtake here is very dreadful, and of an infinite conſequence? But on the contrary, the fooliſh, diſobedient, and that are deceived, ſerving divers luſts and pleaſures, living in ſin, and alienated from the life of God, having no hope, and without God in the world, are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confident, and ſtrongly perſwaded that it ſhall go well with them in the world to come. I knew a poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant prophane wretch, being told on his death bed (and but a little before he entred into eternity) that death was come; replied, where is it, i'le go forth and meet it? putting his legs over the beds ſide, in a little time gave up the Ghoſt. Therefore in this great ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affair,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95564:94"/>
let none be ſo fool-hardy, as to truſt without tryal. <hi>But let every man prove his own work, and then ſhall he have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in himſelf, and not in another, for every man ſhall bear his own burthen,</hi> Gal. 6. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> If the conſideration of our lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end is a matter of ſuch moment, <hi>why do men and women that have immortal ſouls think no more of it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The great cauſe is from that horrid curſed atheiſm and unbeleif, which is deeply rooted and riveted in mens minds and hearts. They do not credit that wonderful and aſtoniſhing Doctrin of the other world, according to the beleif of which they muſt live or die to all eternity.</p>
               <p>If we ſhould take a ſerious proſpect of endleſs eternity, &amp; of thoſe great things men ſeem to beleive, namely, that they muſt dye, that in every mans body there is a never dying ſoul, that there will be a different and unchangeable eſtate of men after death, and that without holineſs, real holineſs of heart &amp; life, no man ſhall ſee the Lord; and compare the lives and practiſes of thoſe that pretend to beleive theſe things, &amp; we may ſee them as buſie
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:95564:94"/>
as a company of Ants in a ſunny day; and that the general courſe of men, hath no tendency towards this end, but indeed a ſad and woeful incongruity.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond cauſe is want of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and divine wiſdom. It was for want of that wiſdom which is from above that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did not conſider, <hi>O that they were wiſe!</hi> ſaid God. <hi>They are a Nation void of counſel, neither is there any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in them,</hi> Deut. 32. 28. If men were wiſe for their precious and eternal ſouls, they would conſider what is here to be done, and what is like to be their condition in the other world. The pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent man fore-ſeeth the evil, or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the evil, and hideth himſelf. When God by the mouth of <hi>Moſes,</hi> threatned to plague the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by the Peſtilence, Haile, and Fire, he that beleived and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the word of the Lord, amongſt the ſervants of <hi>Pharoah,</hi> made his ſervants and cattel flee into the houſe, and were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 20. So the ſoul that is truly wiſe to conſider of the danger of beingde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the grievous hail and fire of Gods wrath, will flee into the hiding place <hi>viz.</hi> under the wing of the great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Mediator, where alone there is true
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:95564:95"/>
ſuccour. But he that did not fear or conſider of the danger, left his ſervants and cattle in th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> field, and were deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9. 21, 25.</p>
               <p>3. The third hindrance is ſenſuality, worldly pleaſures, and cares, theſe carry away the heart from the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> confluence of creature-comforts, cauſed them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake and to forget God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 14. 15, 16, 17 18. The old world was eating, drinking, marrying, and giving in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, not conſidering of their danger till the flood came and took them all away, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 38, 39. The men of the earth do ſo mind earthly things, that their hearts are ſurfeited and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with the care of it, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 34. And while mens minds and thoughts are carri'd ſo vehemently after the world to make proviſion for their life, they can think but little of their death, <hi>Luk</hi> 12. 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>4. The fourth obſtruction, is a plague upon the heart, and deſperate ſecurity proceeding from it. No bonds next to death are ſo ſtrong to keep men under, as ſecurity and ſenſleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit. So dead a ſleep poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95564:95"/>
more of the ungodly world, that they are paſt feeling, and become ſo ſtark dead, that the voice of God in the dreadful threatnings of his word, and the alarum of his amazing tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous judgement, and deſolating provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences prevail not to awaken them. The Lord hath poured out upon them the ſpirit of a deep ſleep, and hath (in judgement) cloſed their eyes that they can ſin in the very face of the Judge, at the very brink of hell, at the very mouth and entrance into that great gulf of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
               <p>5. A fifth hindrance to mens conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their latter end, is a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion of heart, or ſatanical ſuggeſtions. The old ſerpent, and deſperatively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded hearts, make them dream that God is all love, that they ſhall have a long life, that preparation for death and Eternity is a ſhort work; and that it may be done at any time, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they have done with the world, when they are old, or lying on a ſick bed. They ſay in their hearts, 'tis but beleiving or repenting, and ſaying, Lord have mercy upon me, let me die the death of the righteous. Under this
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95564:96"/>
deadly deluſion they dream of heaven, and go laughing to hell, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
               <p>And that which doth much encreaſe this ſtupidity, may be the want of, or neglect of a powerful and ſoul ſearching miniſtry, whoſe office, as watchmen, is to foreſee the danger, and to warn and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken ſecure ſinners, crying aloud to them in the name of the Lord, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 14. But ſom cannot endure that Miniſters ſhould be ſo ſevere, plain and peircing in their Doctrin, ſo as to thunder and lighten in the eyes and ears of ſleepy ſouls; They are well contented to ſit under thoſe that daub with untempered mortar, and who ſow pillows for their arm holes, under whoſe miniſtry they may take a nap and ſleep it out. But they hate him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth in the Gate, that galls, cuts, and wounds their Conſciences, juſt like the gall'd-backt horſe, that bites and kicks at him that would heal him.</p>
               <p>A perſon of no mean quality ſpeaking his opinion of ſeveral miniſters, ſaid, ſuch a man I can hear, and ſuch a one I can hear very well, but for the third he
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95564:96"/>
mentioned, that was wont to lay the ax to the root of the Tree, and grapple with the heart; I cannot endure to hear him, for he alwayes grates upon my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>6. Men do not conſider their latter end, becauſe they are afraid to do it,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, to wanton ſinners, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of death is a bitter Pill that will not ſuffer the pleaſures of ſin to go down ſo ſweetly. Therefore they ſay to the thoughts of Death, as the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to <hi>Paul, Go thy way for this time, when I have a convenient ſeaſon I will ſend for thee.</hi> Serious thoughts of death and Judgement to come, as the hand-writing on the wall, will damp the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and mar the mirth of the greateſt Prince or gallant in the world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They fear to think of death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have made no preparation for it, <hi>(viz)</hi> They have not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, repented, liv'd a life of holineſs, ſo as to make God their friend. A bankrupt that oweth many hundred pounds more then he is worth, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to caſt up his Accompts; ſo poor and impenitent ſinners, that are indebted to God, that owe him ten thouſand
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95564:97"/>
talents, are unwilling to think of death, becauſe death will ſay unto them, come give an account of your Stewardſhip, for you muſt pay the utmoſt farthing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They are afraid to think of death, by reaſon of the dreadful conſequences of death, as it relates to both worlds. The change that death makes as to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world, is very amazing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It brings unavoidable diſſolution or ſeparation of ſoul and body; theſe two dear companions, that have lived and converſt together, and ſin'd together for many years, muſt then part, and a living man will become a dead Carcaſe, fit for nothing but a grave, and the ſoul muſt have another habitation, <hi>Job 17. 13, 14. Job</hi> 19. 26. Well might Death be called the King of terrours.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is matter of fear to leave this world that hath been ſo pleaſing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſom, and for which we have toyl'd and labour'd ſo many years, in one night to looſe it all! For when the departing hour cometh, you may take a view of all your comforts which you have had under the Sun, and helps for
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:95564:97"/>
heaven, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Husbands, Wives, Parents, Children, Kinsfolk Friends jolly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, Gold, Silver, Houſes, Lands, ſweet and delicate Banquets, pleaſing Bargains, and ſay, we muſt now part, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for ever: We ſhall never ſee or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy you more, we ſhall never eat, drink, or converſe more, buy or ſell more: all our fleſhly and ſenſual delights are ended; our joy, our mirth is ceaſed, and all the bleſſed advantages for our ſalvation now will terminate. Farewel the means of grace, and all the golden opportunities for our ſouls, farewell all thoſe faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that we have heard, farewel all thoſe powerful awakening Sermons that have ſounded in our ears, farewell all the bleſſed Sabbaths, farewell all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Examples, Reproofs, Prayers of our ſerious and religious friends and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we ſhall never ſee the face of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter more, or hear a Sermon more, never have the door of grace and life opened to us any more for ever. And what remains, but a doleful remembrance of thoſe good things that are paſt and gone, and a ſevere ſtrict account that is yet behind?</p>
               <p>O dreadful change and loſs indeed to
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95564:98"/>
them that make the world their home, that have their heaven on this ſide hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and no proviſion or portion beyond the grave. The thoughts of which made a wicked young man (very thriving in the world) to utter theſe words, If I <hi>live</hi> I <hi>ſhall be a rich man, but this is the plague of it</hi> I <hi>muſt die;</hi> which accordingly came to paſs not long after.</p>
               <p n="3">3, No wonder death is ſo terrible, for after death the judgement. Death is a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant that ſummons guilty ſouls to com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>end give an account at Gods dreadful bar. And what more terrible to the Maleſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorthen the ſight and preſence of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Judge. While <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoned of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Felix</hi> trembled, and bid him be gone; that Doctrine did ſo gall him that he could not endure it, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. The ſecond uſe is to exhort, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, and ſtir you up, to put this duty of ſo great and infinite concernment into practice. O Sirs, I beſeech you to entertain ſome timely thoughts of your dying hour, that death and you may be more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar. The beſt friend you have in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth longs to ſee it done, <hi>O that therewere ſuch an heart in them:</hi> Now if
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95564:98"/>
you would do any thing in this bleſſed work, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to prepare for death and judgement, it muſt be done, 1. <hi>Suddenly. 2. Seriouſly. 3. Effectually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It muſt be done <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> its a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that importance that muſt not be neglected or delay'd for a moment of time Did you but ſee that you are upon the confines of eternity, and in danger every day of being undone for ever, you would quickly come to a reſolution: To further and encourage you, conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Life (as dear and precious as it is) is very uncertain. What a nothing is this life? a wind, a vapour, a dream, a breath, a bubble.</p>
               <p>How ſoon may the Thread be cut, the Glaſs run, or this bright burning Lamp be dim and out; when, how or where this ſhort dying life will terminate thou doſt not know? Whether at home or abroad, among they friends or ſtrangers, in the field or houſe, at thy table or in thy Bed, who can tell?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Death may come ſuddenly. When the paſe horſe will ſet forth, whether in the morning, or at mid-day, or midnight, no man can tell thee. There is a fatal hour
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95564:99"/>
which none can paſs, <hi>Luk. 12. 20. Pſal. 73. 18. 19. Pſal. 64. 7. 1 Theſ.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When death comes it ſtrikes ſure. This King of terrors on the pale horſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways rides the circuit, and doth execution where-ever he cometh, no ſhield, or buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or armour of proof can defend us, no not an army of guard of men or Angels. If dreadful death finds a King on, his Throne, or a beggar on the dunghil, it's all a caſe. The ſtrength of man, though a <hi>Sampſon,</hi> this great Leviathan Death counts but a ſtraw; death doth his work ſpeedily, eaſily, witneſs the laſt plague. I ſhall adde here.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Death, calls warnings and alarums are very frequent, not one of you, but have had many a call and knock to mind you of death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Deaths commands are peremptory he brings his warrant a long with him. Death coms in the name of the terrible Judge, &amp; takes his Commiſſion out of the court of heaven in order to the accompliſhment and execution of an eternal &amp; irrevocable decree, ſo that he muſt doe his work, will have his Errand: If a man had Mines of Gold and Silver to give, it cannot deliver
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95564:99"/>
from the arreſt of this inexorable Serjeant.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Deaths Conqueſt is great. I know thou wilt bring me to death, and the place appointed for all living. What man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee death? Thou haſt ſet his bounds that he cannot paſs. They that have conquer'd Kingdoms and Countries, and carried all before them have been ſubjected by death: when death comes and takes a man by the throat, though the proudeſt, ſtouteſt, ſtrongeſt in the world, he muſt go, willing or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, 'tis all one to death. 'Tis obſervable, that of bad men, their ſouls are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, but taken away. What is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his ſoul, <hi>Job</hi> 27. 8, 20. A tempeſt ſtealeth him away in the night. This night ſhall thy ſoul be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, death will not ſtay a night. Tis in vain for them that are ſtrong and lively, to ſay to death, go to the wrinkled faces, to the gray heads to the pile cheeks, to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked backs, the dry bons, to the dry breaſts, meddle not with this young man, ſtrike not this comely beautiful woman, that is in the flower and prime in nature. Go to yonder conſumptive, declining decaying,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95564:100"/>
dying old man, go to that weak wither'd old woman. Let me alone or be excus'd: O but death regards it not. For this great Conquerour death, knocks as often at the young mans door, as at the door of the old woman. Death arreſts and carrieth away the ſtrong, the healthy, the rich, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, the learned, priſoners to the grave, as often as the weak the ſickly, the poor, the baſe and ignorant.</p>
               <p n="2">2 You are to do it <hi>ſeriouſly,</hi> with thy ſoul: The living will lay it to heart, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 2. The dead cannot, there's no device in the grave; Then go about it now in good earneſt, before old age and death cometh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Do it effectually, go thorow with the work, leave it not undone, or but done to halves; let every luſt be mortified, every duty performed, every grace exercis'd. As good never a whit, as never the near. Now you have opportunity before you, the day of grace is continued, Chriſt is at the door, open to him, and make all ſure; for if ever thou be juſtified, pardoned, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, it muſt be now. The conſiderations to perſwade you are theſe following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:95564:100"/>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 1. Conſider there's an abſolute and indiſpenſible neceſſity for the doing of it, a preſent neceſſity, an infinite and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal neceſſity, other things may be done this muſt be done, and its more then time this great work were done and finiſhed 'Tis the grand buſineſs of your life timely and truly to prepare for death and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It were better that all your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns in the world were wholly neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed namely, Husband, wife, Children, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſelling, ſeed-time, harveſt omitted, &amp; let all run to ruine, then to hazard, loſe and undo your ſouls, for this will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruine body and ſoul for ever.</p>
               <p>O ſeriouſly mind how little you have done in the time of your life paſt, and how uncapable you will be to do any thing at the end of time, when you come to take up your lodging in a grave. O remember the dayes of darkneſs, they will be many, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 1. 18. They that have been in the Grave a thouſand years have done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, neither can you when you come there, <hi>Eccl.</hi> Now for you that have lived
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95564:101"/>
ſome twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore years, and done nothing in order to a preparation for your everlaſting ſtate, it is high time to begin the work.</p>
               <p>The moſt of you are ſo ſenſleſs, as not to conſider, or entertain a thought of death, till you hear the Bell, or ſee a Grave or Coffin or till death comes within your walls and knocks at your beds head; when you ſee a Friend, a Child, a brother, a Husband or Wife, gaſping and dying, till you ſee him bedewed with his cold ſweats, and groaning with dying pangs; till your eyes thus affect your hearts, your hearts are ſeldom affected with the ſence of your mortality: Now ſith it muſt be done and done ſuddenly, reſolve in ſpight of men and devils, and all the world to ſet about the work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Motive</hi> 2. Conſid. <hi>It may be done,</hi> you are in a capacity to do it adored for ever be free grace.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Time and opportunity is yet before you. The Torch burns, the Sun ſhines, yet it is day, though not morning, ſome ſands
<pb n="991" facs="tcp:95564:101"/>
are behind, though not a whole glaſs. Some of you are old, lame, deaf, but not dead; others weak, ſick, langiſhing, but alive: If the Sun were ſet, the Candle out; the Glaſs run, farewell all hope of heaven, or of altering your condition for ever. They that are gone down to the dead and among the damned, may and do reflect with torment upon the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiesonce offered to make them happy, but can call back none: that's impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God is willing to help if you go to him; <hi>Thine is the power,</hi> and he gives it to them that have no ſtrength, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. Duty is ours, aſſiſtance and ſucceſs is Gods. That God who hath given you a conſidering ſeaſon, can alſo give a conſidering ſoul; go to him upon thy knees, and beg as for thy life his a ſpeedy aid, ſay as the woman to <hi>David, Help O King,</hi> or as the Father for the diſtreſſed Son, <hi>Mark 9. 22. If thou canſts do any thing, help us;</hi> Chriſt did help; 'tis his promiſe, ſeek and you ſhall find. But it cannot be ſaid ſo of ſeparated ſouls, becauſe time and meanes from them is gone for ever.</p>

Then in the name of the Lord, quit your ſelves like men, Wiſemen, that are endued with precious, rational, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls, that difference you from bruits. Let that noble faculty of reaſon be exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in conſidering your latter end. For conſideration is a ſerious, eager, &amp; lively act or exerciſe of the underſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things to be done, or not to be done, furthering or impeding the execution of them as it ſees good.

If the doing of it be your higheſt wiſdom, the not doing muſt needs be the greateſt folly; this will make you like <hi>Ephraim,</hi> a ſilly Dove without an heart. Do you know that you muſt die, and die but once? and will you not indeavour to do that well which cannot be done the ſecond time? As <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid to his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, <hi>You can kill me but once, ye are not able to raiſe me to life again, and kill me the ſecond time:</hi> So ſay I to thee, O thou ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, ſinner when thy breath is gone, it will return no more.</p>
               <p>O conſider with a trembling heart, how much depends upon this dying once, namely the gaining or loſing of thy dear precious ſoul, the gainingor looſing of the favour of God, the fruition of God, the joyes of heaven, or the torments of hell hangs upon it.</p>

O Sirs, if you would but trace them to a ſick bed, a death-bed, from thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternity, and to Gods dreadful tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, you might eaſily determine, <hi>Ier. 17. 11 Luke 12. 19, 20.

               <p n="1">1 <hi>Awakening Ordinances</hi> will have an end. The faithful, powerful Miniſters of the Goſpel that watch for your ſouls, and whoſe office it is to fire the Beacons, and give the alarum, will, we know not how ſoon, finiſh their work.

preach the dreadful and amazing Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of death and judgement, and that with loud and earneſt cries, tears and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of ſpirit, to make you ſenſible of your ſin and danger, will ſhortly be called home. <hi>Moſes</hi> that great Prophet, after he had compoſ'd this excellent Song (of which my Text is a part) was gathered to his Fathers. <hi>Noah</hi> that Preacher of Righteouſneſs, after he had for many years together warned the old world, was called into the Ark and they had never a Sermon more, till the wrath of God came upon them, and there was no remedy; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.

You cannot rationally expect alwayes to hear the pleaſant noiſe of <hi>Aarons</hi> Bells, or the ſound of the Silver Trumpet, the Sun will go down over the Prophets; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while the watchmen are upon the walls take warning, and finiſh your work while you have the light: O Sirs, improve for your eternal advantage thoſe plain and powerful Sermons which you hear
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:95564:104"/>
and read, and let it not be accounted le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal preaching. Who were more ſevere in their preaching then our Lord and his fore-runner? whom we ought to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, otherwiſe we draw the horrible ſin of bloud-guiltineſs upon our ſouls; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 18, 9. 'Tis obſerv'd, that there are more dreadful doctrines ſcatter'd up and down in the New Teſtament then in the Old, the powerful application of which is very neceſſary both for ſecure ſinners and drowſie Saints, Holy <hi>David,</hi> after his fall, fell into a deep ſleep and did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake until <hi>Nathan</hi> came and told him plainly and particularlly of his ſin. And of the Virgins we read, while the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom tarri'd they all ſlumbred: and ſlept, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. O how many ſleepy ſouls are there in the world, and in many Cities, Towns and Pariſhes in this Nation that will either living, dying or after death, ſadly bewail the not improving the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of their faithful Paſtors.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All your <hi>awakening Providences,</hi> by which God warns and calls, will have an end. The great and glorious God for a long time together hath been ſpeaking and calling to us by his Word, and of late
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95564:104"/>
year she hath ſpoken by his dreadful Rod, and that very terribly. The Sword, the Plague, the Fire, the decay of trade and other Judgements, are the loud voice of an angry God. Thoſe afflictions on our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, Relations, Eſtates, Perſons, are in order to awakening us out of ſleep, and ſo for our profit. When <hi>Manaſſch</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the thorns, &amp; bound with fetters, &amp; carried into <hi>Babylon,</hi> he be ſought the Lord and humbled himſelf greatly, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33. 11, 12, 13. After <hi>Ephraim</hi> was chaſtiſed, he awaked, turned and repented, for the bonds and cords of affliction do open the car to inſtruction; then he ſheweth them their work, and their tranſgreſſion, and commandeth that they turn from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, <hi>Jab 6. 9, 10. Jer.</hi> 13, 18, 19. Now to have a deaf ear to the rod and word, to be hardned and ſecure, and go on in ſin under awaking and amazing providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is a dreadful judgement, &amp; that which ripens men for ruine, 2 <hi>Chron. 28. 22. This is that King Ahaz,</hi> who in the time of his diſtreſs did treſpaſs yet more againſt the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Your <hi>awakening Convictions</hi> will have an end too. Thoſe ſecret and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95564:105"/>
workings, ſtrivings and ſtruglings of the Spirit of God under the rod and in the word will be ſuſpended. Chriſt will not always be at the door calling, knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his Spirit that is ſo much greived and oppos'd, will not alwayes ſtrive and ſtruggle with your hearts and conciences, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. Now ſinners, if you have any love or regard to your immortal ſouls, before all theſe helps be taken away, be wiſe to conſider, and prepare for your end: Leſt God ſhould ſpeedily reſolve, and ſay to you as to the Jews, <hi>Iſa. 1. 5.

               <p>You that will not ſeek God betimes, and make ſupplication to the Almighty, that will not pray while you have time to pray, helps to pray, health to pray, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to pray.</p>

No, ſaith the holy God, though they ſeek me early, they ſhall not find me. Here note, That there is a two fold early, namely, Gods early, and mans early.

               <p>Would you haue ſin as hell, and be more truly holy, <hi>Conſider your latter end.</hi> This is moſt certain that all the evil an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents, and dreadful conſequences of death, ſpring and grow out of this bitter root; what is it that wounds, ſtings, paines and kills? what is it that brings Diſeaſes &amp; threatens death? that murders the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and that damns and burnes the ſoul? What is that doth neceſſitate the to make uſe of Phyſick &amp; Phyſicians whilſt alive? and bringeth thee to a Coffin and Grave when thou art dead? is it not ſin which thou embraceſt in thy boſom?</p>
               <p>You poor, blind, deluded ſouls, as little and as lovely as ſin looks in your wanton eyes, it is the Mother and Nurſe of all your miſeries, hacht in hell, the Devils ſpawn or excrement. <hi>He that committeth ſin is of the devil, 1 Joh.</hi> 3. 8. This is that
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:95564:108"/>
evil thing and bitter that hales death and hell at the heels of it, yea, that arms death, devils and hell againſt us. Were it not for this black, ugly, fierce, ouer and bloudy adverſary, Law or Juſtice could not condemn us, Death could not kill us, Devils could not torment us, Hell could not burn us.</p>
               <p>Sin is the Traitor and Murderer of your immortal ſouls, and thoſe nails that will ſhortly dig your Graves: &amp; will you hug, hide and hold it faſt? Will a woman put that knife into her boſom, that hath kill'd or murder'd her dear Child or Husband? no by no means, it muſt be broken and caſt away for ever. Now Sirs, if ſin be the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, uſe it as an enemy or murderer, kill it, take the ſacrificing knife and cut the throat of it, or ſtrike the heart vein, and let it bleed until it dies.

Did you think ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly of death and hell, you would hate it to purpoſe, and ſay, away to hell with it, from whence it came; and it would put you upon a deſire and earneſt endeavour after holineſs: Being expos'd to a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, what manner of perſons ought ye to be in all holy converſation and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

               <p>Poor worldlings! that make gold your hope, whoſe plottings and ploddings are for earth. If death and eternity were more in your thoughts, you would let go that in your affections which you cannot hold in your poſſeſſion, and love that but a little that will be loſt, and which you cannot love long; Riches have wings, and they will be gone. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how little the things of the world will ſtand you in ſtead in the evil day: your gold and ſilver cannot keep you from diſeaſes while you live, nor from

So many wealthy worldlings that tire them ſelves to get and carry worldly treaſure, when death cometh, its taken, from them and they for their ill getting or ill uſing of it, are thruſt down to hell: the rich man dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in hell lift up his eyes.</p>
               <p>And if you would deaden your hearts to this empty earth, and look after a treaſure above, a happineſs beyond the grave, that ſhall laſt as long as your ſouls ſhall laſt; think often of death, this would divert your worldly cares and projects.</p>
               <p>Remember from this day to your laſt day cannot be long, your Journey or Voyage is ſhort, and a little Proviſion is enough; neither Poverty nor Riches, but food convenient, is the deſire and choice of a Citizen of <hi>Sion.</hi> Converſe more with death, and be often looking

               <p>We be unto him that is alone, that is alone in life, and alone in death, that hath no Chriſt to befriend him, or ſtand by him in that woeful day, that cometh to lye down in the death-bed without peace or pardon, who ſhall go into a Grave, and ſtand before the Ba without an Advocate to plead for him.</p>

And when thou doſt think upon thoſe millions of ſouls that are hanging up in hell, reflect upon thy ſelſ; and expect thy turn ſpeedily. Suppoſe every day thy laſt, every meal thy laſt, every journey thy laſt, every duty, Sacrament, Sermon, thy laſt. And when the Lords day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, think with thy ſelf this will be the laſt ſpiritual market, that I ſhall have to buy the ſpiritual Oyl of grace and to provide for the Bridegrooms co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; after this day is ended, I may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more hear the Lord Jeſus ſpeak to me by the mouths of his faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, never be invited to come to Chriſt, or to beleive, repent, part with ſin, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a pardon more, and ſo demean

thy ſelf every day, and in every duty, as if thou ſhould'ſt be called to Gods Bar, and give up thine account at night. In all thy thoughts, words and actions, ſay to thy ſelf, would I do thus, and thus, <hi>viz.</hi> would I eat, drink, ſleep, converſe, buy, ſell, preach, hear, pray; or worſe, if I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly knew this day would be my laſt. O let that Motto, <hi>Memento mori,</hi> which ſome carry in their Rings, be engraven on your hearts, it being the great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our lives. This is that which God people, and ſome of the heathen too, have been careful to remember: King <hi>Aſia</hi> made his Sepulcher in his life time, 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 16. 14. and ſome in their Gardens, and places of ſolace and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, as <hi>Joſeph of Arimathea, John</hi> 19. 41. And ſome of the Heathen were wont to walk among the Graves, to put them in mind of death; ſome have had their Graves alwayes before their Gates, other a dead mans skul preſented every day at their Tables; and ſhall we that beleive the doctrine of the other world, put off the ſerious thoughts of death? <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſeth us to go to the houſe of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, telling us it is better becauſe the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:95564:119"/>
living will lay it to heart. When you hear the tidings of the death of your Friends, relations, or Neighbours, go thither, though not perſonally, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatively, in your minds &amp; thoughts, go, and put your ſelves in their ſtead. And think thus, a living man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is become a dead Corps, or cold clay, the ſoul is gone to its everlaſting habitation; but to what place whether to be comforted or tormented, who can tell? If he were a godly man, he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly gone to heaven, if thou art ſuch a one, thy ſoul will ſhortly be with him: but if an ungodly man he is certainly gone to hell, and now among the Devils: and if thou art ſuch a one, thou ſhalt erelong be there too. 'Tis true the dead can have no thoughts of the living: but the living (ſaith <hi>Solomon)</hi> know that they muſt die.

1. When a man is truly conſcious to himſelf that he hath ſincerely, and with much brokeneſs of heart repented of all his known ſins committed before or after converſion, ſo that there is no freſh or former guilt remaining on him. This godly ſorrow, is the godly mans pleaſure, he delights to be ſowing in tears, loves with his ſoul a wet ſeed-time; for they that ſow in tears, ſhall reap a harveſt of joy, which is a time of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rom the preſence of God, compare, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. 5, 6. and <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When ſin is ſo great a bur den, that he is weary of this body of death, and willing the infected houſe ſhould be pulled down, that the Leproſie might be cured, that ſo he might never ſin or offend his Father more. The ſerious thoughts, and ſence of which is a heavy burden, and matter of greif, that makes him groan and complain.

               <p>When ſin is pardoned, and the pardon ſealed, <hi>i e</hi> when the clamorous noiſe of the guilt of ſin in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is calmed and ſilenced, by the blood of ſprinkling, and his evidences for heaven, bright and clear, ſo that his better country is within view, and the gate of glory wide open, namely abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant entrance into the everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Pet. 1. 11.

Do you know your ſelves in a ſtate of grace, that you are new born, that your evidences for heaven are clear and certain? is your work done? do your Lamps burn? and have you a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded aſſurance, that you are in the Number of thoſe, to whom death will be a priviledge? <hi>Phil.</hi> 21.</p>

I have often warned you by ſending my Deputies, and and that this ten, twenty or forty yeares, every Coffin, every, dead Corps or Grave you have ſeene, was ſo many intimations of my coming. Now (ſaith death) I am come, look here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my commiſſion, ſee my dart, and my ſting. This dart muſt kill the body, and ſend thy ſoul unto eternity. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee this moment to bid adieu to and take thy leave of Friends, Relations, Houſes, Lands, pleaſures of ſin, once for all. Thou ſhalt never ſee or jnjoy them more, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 19. 20. O how can you think of your dying, the worlds burning, the trumpers Sounding, the deads riſing and ſtaunding at the Bar, and not fear and tremble? You Sons and Daughters of pleaſures! did you conſider what horror and aſtoniſhment dogs you as the heels, which will inevitable come upon you, as travel on a woman with child, you would not ſay unto God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and treaſure up wrath, lay up ſcoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and ſcorpions for your diſtreſſed ſouls againſt the laſt day.</p>

               <p>You ſay you muſt dye and come to judgement; but how ſtands the caſe as to the other world? If you look downward to this world, its well; but how is it within with your precious ſoul? Do you beleive that Atheiſts, Unbeleivers, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Swearers, Murderers, Thieves, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, Lyars Sabbath-breakers, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, worldlings, are going ſwiftly to hell? Do you beleive that Chriſts flock is little, and not fear your ſelves? Do you think that <hi>Eſau, Judas, Ahab, Agrippa, Herod, Simon Magus,</hi> the fooliſh Virgins are in hell, and yet confident of your go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to heaven? Theſe have out done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you, <hi>Eſau wept and cryed for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Heb.</hi> 12. 17. Ahab <hi>humbled himſelf</hi> 1 Kings 12, 29.

                  <hi>The Scribe was not far from the kingdom of God,</hi> Mark 12. 34. The fooliſh Virgins were not prophane, they took care to trim their Lamps, and knock at the door. Now what ſins have you leſt? what grace have you exercis'd what duties have you performed? and how? Take heed you be not deceived; <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, for many will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able,</hi> Luk. 13. 24.</p>

God will not, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 26, 27. Chriſt will not, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. 27. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Saints, Miniſters will not, all will ſay, <hi>away with them,</hi> let them be damn'd.</p>
               <p>And O what a killing and amazing ſight will Chriſts coming in the clouds be to all that either denied his coming, or who would not prepare for it. His incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was terrible, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 3. His Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion was more terrible, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 44. 45, 47. 48, But his being on the tribunal, will be moſt terrible. Then ſhall the tribes of the earth mourn, <hi>Math.</hi> 24. 3. And men cry to the rocks and mountaines to

fall on them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 15, 16. When they ſhall ſee ſo many thouſands and millions of men and women dragged down with all the Devils of hell, to that burning lake of fire and brimſtone. How will they then mourn for ſorrow of heart, and howl for vexation of ſpirit, and with bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of ſoul wiſh they had never heard of Chriſt, that they had been born among the Heathen or never had a being or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd a life of pleaſure upon the Earth! How will the wretched ſinner beat his breaſt, pluck off his hair, tear his bowels, crying out (when he ſees all hope is gone) O that I had now no ſoul! or that this immortal ſoul were mortal! that I might now dye and breath no more! or that my ſentence might be but to lodge with Devils in this burning lake ten thoſand years, that ſo I might not remain in a ſtate of baniſhment from the face and preſence of God to all eternity.</p>
               <p>O then pray! that ſerious thoughts of death may be alwayes upon thine heart, and whethere thou goeſt let them go, and where thou lodgeſt let them lodg that thou mayeſt ſpeak of it to thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and Family, when thou ſittteſt in

thine houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lyeſt down, and when thou riſeſt up. O let theſe great things of death and judgment, be bound as a ſigne upon thine hand, and write them upon the poſts of thine houſe and on thy gates: that they may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways before thine eyes and for thy good alwayes; that thou may'ſt beware leaſt thou forget the Lord thy God, and the everlaſting concernments of thine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſoul and gods anger be kindled againſt thee, and deſtroy thee ſuddenly with a mighty deſtruction.</p>
