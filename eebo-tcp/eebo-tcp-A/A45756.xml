            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For you ſee that your Open-hartedneſs in this kind hath provoked another Friend of mine of very pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique deſert in the Common-wealth of Learning, to impart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me his Obſervations of the ſame nature. And although his Annotations now and then, are Animadverſions rather then Enlargements, yet it is not unprofitable to the Publique, nor diſadvantageous to us; that our errours and miſtakes (for who can pretend to be without them:) be laid open and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. I ſuppoſe you would be as loath as I, that any by your meanes or mine, ſhould be led into a by-way, and inſtead of gaining become a loſer, in making triall of what we offer for his advantage.

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording to your deſires, I have ſent you what I have obſerved in <hi>France,</hi> about the ſowing of a Seed called commonly, <hi>Saint Foine,</hi> which in <hi>English</hi> is as much to ſay as <hi>Holy-Hay,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as I ſuppoſe, of the excellency of it. It's call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Parkinſon</hi> in his <hi>Herball,</hi> where you may ſee a perfect deſcription of it, <hi>Cnobrychis Vulgaris,</hi> or <hi>Cocks head</hi>; becauſe of its flower, or <hi>Medick Fetchling:</hi> By ſome it is called <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gala</hi>; becauſe it cauſeth cattel to give abundance of milk. The plant moſt like unto it, and commonly known, being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>ſown</hi> in Gardens, is that which is called <hi>French Honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckle,</hi> and is a kind of it, though not the ſame. <hi>France</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ſuppoſed, to want the feweſt things of any <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> in <hi>Europe:</hi> yet it hath no ſmall want of <hi>Hay,</hi> eſpecially about <hi>Paris</hi>; which hath neceſſitated them to ſowe their dry and barren lands with this ſeed. Their manner of ſowing it, is done moſt commonly thus: When they intend to let their Corn-lands lye, becauſe they be out of heart, and not ſcituate in a place convenient for manuring, then they ſowe that land with <hi>Oats,</hi> and theſe Seeds together about equal parts: the firſt year they onely mowe off their <hi>Oats,</hi> leaving the <hi>Saint Foine</hi> to take root and ſtrength that year: Yet they may if they pleaſe, when the year is ſeaſonable, mowe it the ſame year it is ſown, but it's not the beſt way to do ſo: the year following they mowe it, and ſo do ſeven years together; the ordinary burthen is about a load, or a load and a half in good years, upon an <hi>Arpent,</hi> (which is 100 ſquare Poles or Rods,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55779:12"/>
every Pole or Rod being 20 foot) wuich quantity of ground being nigh a 4th part leſs then an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Acre; within a league of <hi>Paris,</hi> is uſually Rented at 6 or 7 s. After the land hath reſted 7 years; then they uſually break it up, and ſowe it with corn till it be out of heart, and then ſowe it with <hi>Saint Foine</hi> as formerly: for it doth not impoveriſh land, as <hi>Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Plants</hi> do; but after ſeven years, the roots of this plant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great and ſweet, as the roots of <hi>locoriſh,</hi> do rot, being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by the Plough, and enrich the land. I have ſeen it ſown in divers places here in <hi>England</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Cobham-Park</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> about 4 miles from <hi>Graveſend</hi>; where it hath thriven extraordinary well upon dry Chalky Banks, where nothing elſe would grow: and indeed ſuch dry barren land is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for it (as moiſt rich land for the great <hi>Trefoile</hi>) or great <hi>Clover-Graſs</hi> (although it will grow indifferently well on all lands) and when the other Graſſes and Plants are deſtroyed by the parching heat of the Sun; becauſe their roots are ſmall and ſhallow; this flouriſheth very much, having a very great root, and deep in the ground, and therefore not eaſily to be <hi>exſiccated</hi>; As we have obſerved <hi>Ononis</hi> or <hi>Reſt-Harrow</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to do on dry lands; but if you ſowe this on wet land, the water ſoon corrupts the root of it. This Plant without queſtion would much improve many of our barren lands, ſo that they might be mowen every year once, at leaſt ſeven years together, and yield excellent fodder for cattel, if ſo be that it be rightly managed: otherwiſe it cometh to nothing, as I have ſeen by experience. I therefore councel thoſe who ſowe this, or the great <hi>Trefoile,</hi> or <hi>Clover-Graſs,</hi> or any other ſort of graſſes, that they obſerve theſe Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they do make their ground fine, and kill all ſorts of other graſſes and plants; otherwiſe they being Native <hi>Engliſh</hi> will by no means give way to the <hi>French</hi> ones; eſpecially in this moiſt climate: and therefore they are to be blamed, who with one ploughing ſowe this or other ſeeds; for the graſs preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly groweth up and choaketh them, and ſo their negligence, and ill Husbandry diſcourageth themſelves and others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let them not be too ſparing of their ſeeds; for the more they ſowe, the cloſer and thicker they will grow, and preſently
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55779:12"/>
fully ſtock the ground, that nothing elſe can grow. And further the ſeeds which come from beyond the Seas, are oftentimes old, and much decayed, and therefore the more ſeed is required.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Not to expect above 7 years profit by it; for in that time it will decay, and the naturall graſs will prevail over it; for every plant hath its period: ſome in one year, ſome in 2. As Would, Cole, Rape, Wade, &amp;c. Others in 3. as the common <hi>Thiſtle,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore after 7 years let them either plough the Land up, and ſowe it with that ſame ſeed again, or with other Grain as they do in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Let not <hi>ſheep</hi> or other cattel bite them the firſt year, that they may be well rooted; for theſe graſſes are far ſweeter then the ordinary graſſes; and cattel will eat them down, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the other; and conſequently diſcourage their growth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The beſt way, if men will be at the charge, is to make their ground very fine, as they do when they are to ſowe <hi>Barley,</hi> and harrow it even, and then to howe theſe ſeeds in alone without any other grain, as the Gardiners do <hi>Peaſe</hi>; yet not at ſo great a diſtance; but let them make the ranges about a foots breadth one from another, and they ſhall ſee their graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes flouriſh as if they were green <hi>Peaſe,</hi> eſpecially if they draw the howe through them once or twice that ſummer to deſtroy all the weeds and graſſes: And if they do thus, the great <hi>Clover</hi> and other ſeeds may be mowen even twice the firſt year, as I have experimented in divers ſmall plots of ground.</p>
            <p>There is at <hi>Paris</hi> likewiſe another ſort of fodder, which they call <hi>La Lucern,</hi> which is not inferior, but rather preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this <hi>Saint Foine,</hi> for dry &amp; barren grounds; which hath bin lately brought thither, and is managed as the former; and truly every day produceth ſome new things, not only in other Countreys, but alſo in our own. And though I cannot but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much commend theſe plants unto my <hi>Countrymen,</hi> knowing that they may be beneficial to this <hi>Nation</hi>; yet I eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend unto them a famous kind of graſs growing in <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> 9 miles from <hi>Saliſbury,</hi> at <hi>Maddington,</hi> which may better be called one of the wonders of this land, then the <hi>Hawthorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree</hi> at <hi>Glaſſenbury,</hi> which ſuperſtition made ſo famous: for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the ſame kind are found elſewhere. You may find this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55779:13"/>
graſs briefly deſcribed in a Book called <hi>Phytologia Britannica,</hi> (which lately came forth, and ſets down even all the plants which have been found naturally growing in <hi>England) Gramen Caninum Supinum Longiſſimum,</hi> which groweth 9 miles from <hi>Salisbury,</hi> at Mr. <hi>Tuckers</hi> at <hi>Madington</hi>: wherewith they fat <hi>hogs:</hi> and which is 24 foot long, a thing almoſt incredible; yet commonly known to all that ſhire. Now without queſtion, if the ſeed of this graſs, be ſown in other rich Meadows, it will yeild extraordinarily: though perchance not ſo much, as in its proper place. I wonder that thoſe that live thereabouts, have not tryed to fertilize their other Meadows with it: for it is a peculiar <hi>ſpecies</hi> of graſs: and though ſome ingenious men have ſound about 90 <hi>ſpecies</hi> of graſſes in this <hi>Iſland:</hi> yet there is none like to this, that can by any means be brought to ſuch an height and ſweetneſs. And truly I ſuppoſe, that the through examination of this graſs, is a thing of very great importance, for the improvement of <hi>Meadows</hi> and <hi>Paſtures</hi>; and it may excel the Great <hi>Trefoile, Saint Foine, La-Lucern,</hi> or any <hi>exotick</hi> plant whatſoever. And though I am very unwilling to exceed the bounds of an Epiſtle; yet I cannot but certifie you, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Husbandry</hi> of this <hi>Nation</hi> in other particulars (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) is greatly deficient, which I will do as briefly as may be: and likewiſe, how ingenious men may find <hi>Remedies</hi> for theſe <hi>deficiencies.</hi>

I ſuppoſe all know, that it would be an extraordinary benefit to this Countrey, if that 1 or 2 horſes could plough and draw as much as 4 or 6, and further alſo, that there is no ſmall difference in <hi>ploughs,</hi> and <hi>waggons,</hi> when there is ſcarce any ſure rule for the making of them; and every Countrey, yea almoſt every County, differs not onely
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55779:13"/>
in the <hi>ploughs</hi>; but even in every part. Some with wheels, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without; ſome turning the <hi>Reſt</hi> (as they call it) as in <hi>Kent, Picardy,</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> others not: ſome having <hi>Coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of one faſhion, others of another; others as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> having an iron wheel or circle for that purpoſe; ſome having their <hi>ſhears</hi> broad at point, ſome not; ſome being round, as in <hi>Kent,</hi> others flat: ſome tying their horſes by the tail, as in <hi>Ireland.</hi> So, likewiſe <hi>Waggons</hi> and <hi>Carts</hi> differ: ſome uſing 4 wheels, others 2 only; ſome carrying timber on 2 wheels in a Cart, others with 4 wheels, and a long pole only between, which is the beſt way: ſome plough with 2 horſes only, as in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and beyond Seas, in <hi>France, Italy,</hi> where I never ſaw above 3 horſes in a <hi>plough,</hi> and one onely to hold and drive: But in <hi>Kent</hi> I have ſeen 4, 6, yea 12 horſes and oxen; which variety ſheweth, that the <hi>Husbandman,</hi> who is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ignorant in <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> is even at his wits end in this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, which he muſt neceſſarily uſe continually. Surely he ſhould deſerve very well of this <hi>Nation,</hi> and be much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by all, that would ſet down exact Rules for the making of this moſt neceſſary, yet contemned <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> and for every part thereof: for without queſtion there are as exact Rules to be laid down for this, as for <hi>Shipping</hi> and other things. And yet in <hi>Shipping,</hi> how have we within <hi>theſe</hi> 6 <hi>years</hi> out-ſtripped our ſelves, and gone beyond all <hi>Nations?</hi> for which Art ſome deſerve Eternal honour. And why may we not in this? I know a Gentleman, who now is beyond Seas, where he excels even the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> in their own buſineſſe of draining; who promiſeth much in this kind, and I think he is able to perform it; I could wiſh, he were called on to make good his promiſe. In <hi>China,</hi> it is ordinary to have wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons to paſs up and down without horſes or oxen, with Sails as Ships do: and lately in <hi>Holland</hi> a waggon was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which with ordinary Sails carried 30 people 60 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles in 4 hours. I know ſome excellent Scholars, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe much by the means of <hi>Horizontal ſails (viz)</hi> to have 3 or 4 Ploughs together, which ſhall likewiſe both ſowe and harrow without horſes or oxen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:55779:14"/>I dare not being ignorant in theſe high ſpeculations, engage my ſelf to do much thereby; but wiſh theſe Gentlemen, whom I know to be extreamly ingenious, would attempt ſomething, both for the ſatisfying of themſelves and others. There is an ingenious <hi>Yeoman</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> who hath two ploughs faſtened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether very finely, by the which he plougheth two furrows at once, one under another; and ſo ſtirreth up the land 12 or 14 inches deep, which in deep land is good. Near <hi>Greenwich</hi> there liveth an <hi>Honourable Gentleman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. Blunt.</note> who hath excellent Corn, and yet plougheth his land with one horſe, when as uſually through <hi>Kent</hi> they uſe 4 and 6. Theſe things ſhew that much may be done in this kind; and I hope ſome in theſe active times, will undertake and accompliſh this work of ſo great importance.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2</hi> Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of land, Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Howing in of corn.</note>There is a Book long ſince printed, made by Sir <hi>Hugh Plattes,</hi> (the moſt curious man of his time) called <hi>Adams Art revived,</hi> wherein is ſhewed the great benefit which would accrue to this Nation, if all land which were ſit to be digg'd, were ſo ordered, and their corn ſet. Mr. <hi>Gab. Plattes</hi> likewiſe hath written much of this kind, and promiſeth that men ſhall reap 100 for one; all charges born which are very great. That this may be true, he bringeth ſome probable Reaſons, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that leſs then a peck of <hi>Wheat,</hi> will ſet an Acre, I dare not promiſe ſo much as theſe <hi>Gentlemen</hi> do, neither can I commend Mr. <hi>Gab. Plattes</hi> ſetting Inſtrument: For I know there are many difficulties in it, which he himſelf could never wade through; but concerning digging, and ſetting, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of corn, theſe things I dare maintain.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is a deficiency in <hi>Husbandry,</hi> that it is uſed no more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That one good digging, becauſe it goeth deeper then the Plough, and buryeth all weeds, killeth the graſſes; is as good as three Ploughings, and if the land be mellow, not much more chargeable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That it would imploy many thouſand of people, that a third part of the ſeed might be ſaved. As I have found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that all the weeds and graſſes, might be more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed thereby, and the ground better accommodated for other crops; and to conclude, the crop conſiderably great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55779:14"/>
Yet thus much I muſt further ſay, concerning ſetting of Grain, That great <hi>Beans</hi> are even of neceſſity to be ſet, and that ſmall <hi>Beans</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and other places, are likewiſe ſet with profit, for the reaſons above mentioned; that to ſet <hi>Peaſe</hi> (unleſs <hi>Haſtevers,</hi> and <hi>Roncivals) Oats, Barley,</hi> is a thing even ridiculous: that <hi>Wheat</hi> although in divers grounds it may be ſet with profit: yet to <hi>how it in</hi> (as the <hi>Hardiners</hi> ſpeak) as they do <hi>Peaſe,</hi> though not at the ſame diſtance, but about a foot the ranges one from another, is better then ſetting for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe to ſet Corn is an infinite trouble and charge; and if it be not very exactly done, which children neither can nor will do, and theſe muſt be the chief ſetters; will be very prejudicious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If worms, froſt, ill weather, or fowls, deſtroy any part of your ſeed, which they will do; your crop is much impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ground cannot be ſo well weeded, and the mould raiſed about the roots by the <hi>how.</hi> Which 3 inconveniences are remedied by the other way.</p>
            <p>Further, I dare affirm, that after the ground is digged or ploughed and harrowed: even it's better to <hi>howe Wheat</hi> in, then to ſowe it after the <hi>common way</hi>; becauſe that the weeds may be eaſily deſtroyed by running the <hi>howe</hi> through it in the Spring, and the mould raiſed about the roots of the Corn, as the <hi>Gardiners</hi> do with <hi>Peaſe,</hi> it would ſave much Corn in dear years, and for other Reaſons before mentioned. Yea, it is not more chargeable; for a <hi>Gardiner</hi> will <hi>howe in</hi> an Acre for 5 s. and after in the Spring for leſs money run it over with a <hi>howe,</hi> and cut up all the weeds, and raiſe the mould: which charges are not great, and you ſhall ſave above a buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el of ſeed, which in dear years is more worth then all your charges.</p>
            <p>Further, 1 s. 6 d. or 2 s. an Acre for the ſowing and harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Acre in <hi>Kent,</hi> is accounted a reaſonable price, and may be ſaved; but if any fear charges, let him uſe a <hi>Dril-Plough,</hi> with one horſe, which is commonly known at <hi>Fulham,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>London.</hi> I therefore cannot but commend the <hi>howing in</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:55779:15"/>
of <hi>wheat,</hi> as an excellent piece of good <hi>Husbandry,</hi> whether the ground be digged or ploughed; not only becauſe it ſaveth much Corn, imployeth much people, and it is not chargeable; but it alſo deſtroyeth all weeds, fitteth grounds for after crops and cauſeth a greater increaſe, and in my apprehenſion is a good <hi>Remedy</hi> againſt <hi>Smut</hi> and <hi>Mildew.</hi> There is an Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Italian,</hi> who wondreth how it cometh to paſs, that if one ſetteth a Grain of Corn, as <hi>Wheat, Barley,</hi> &amp;c. it uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth 300 or 400. yea, 1000, 2000, as I have tryed: yet if you ſow <hi>Wheat</hi> after the ordinary way, 6 or 8 for one is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a good crop: what becometh of all the Corn that is <hi>ſown,</hi> when as the 50th part, if it do grow, would be ſufficient? For anſwer to this.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay much Corn is ſown which nature hath deſtinated for the <hi>Hens</hi> and <hi>Chickens,</hi> being without any conſiderable ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative faculty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Worms, Froſts, Floods, Crows and Larks, (which every one doth not conſider) do devour not a little.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Weeds, as <hi>Poppy, May-weed,</hi> and the graſſes growing with the Corn do deſtroy much.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, When Corn is ſo ſown after the ordinary manner, much is buried in the furrows; eſpecially if the ground be grazy: much is thrown on heaps in holes, and conſequently ſtarve and choak one another. Moſt of theſe Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, are to be remedyed by this way of ſetting and howing in of Corn.</p>

            <p>Some old men in <hi>Surrey,</hi> where it flouriſheth very much at preſent; report, That they knew the firſt <hi>Gardiners</hi> that came into thoſe parts, to plant <hi>Cabages, Colleflowers,</hi> and to ſow <hi>Turneps, Carrets,</hi> and <hi>Parſnips,</hi> to ſow <hi>Raith,</hi> (or early ripe) <hi>Peaſe, Rape,</hi> all which at that time were great rarities, we having few, or none in <hi>England,</hi> but what came from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi> Theſe <hi>Gardiners</hi> with much ado procured a plot of good ground, and gave no leſs then 8 pound <hi>per</hi> Acre; yet the <hi>Gentleman</hi> was not content, fearing they would ſpoile his ground, becauſe they did uſe to dig it.

Theſe diſtempers in Corn, are not onely in our Countrey;<note place="margin">Helmont.</note> but alſo in other places. A learned Authour ſaith, that <hi>Smuttineſs</hi> of Corn, which maketh it ſmell like a <hi>Red Herring,</hi> was not known in <hi>France,</hi> till about 1530. at which time the great foul diſeaſe began to break forth in thoſe parts very hotly, which he conceiveth from hence to have ſome original; as alſo the camp-diſeaſe. <hi>Mildews</hi> are very great in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which oft ſtick to the ſithes of thoſe that mow graſs and corn: and (God be thanked) we are not troubled with <hi>Locuſts,</hi> which is a great flying <hi>Graſs-hopper,</hi> nor <hi>Palmer-worms,</hi> which is a kind of great black <hi>Cater-piller,</hi> (which I have ſeen deſtroying much in <hi>New-England</hi>) nor with great <hi>hail</hi> in Summer, nor with great <hi>drought,</hi> which ſtifleth the ear in the ſtalk; which <hi>Calamities</hi> in <hi>hot Countreys,</hi> do very
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55779:16"/>
oft totally deſtroy the honeſt and patient <hi>Husbandman's</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: neither are we troubled with extream <hi>colds,</hi> which in <hi>New-England</hi> and other cold <hi>Countreys,</hi> doe oft deſtroy the Corn. But to return to our purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And firſt, briefly to ſhew you my opinion concerning the <hi>Cauſes of Smuttineſſe.</hi> I deſire not to fetch <hi>Cauſes</hi> afar off, and to tell you of the ſad <hi>Conjunctions</hi> of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> (for I think <hi>Quae ſuprae nos,</hi> belong not to us) when as we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough at home: This is certain, that there are many evident cauſes of this corruption of Corn.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A moiſt ſeaſon about <hi>Kerning</hi>-time: which moiſture ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupteth the roots of the Plant, or the nouriſhment of it, or the ſeed in its <hi>Embrio:</hi> or perhaps in ſome meaſure all theſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Low, moiſt, foggy ground, for the reaſons above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Dung'd land. In <hi>Vineyards</hi> it's obſerved, that dung cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth more increaſe in quantity, but leſs in goodneſs, ſo that the ill-taſte of the dung may eaſily be diſcerned; becauſe wine hath an high taſte, without queſtion the ſame happeneth to other Plants, although it be not ſo eaſily diſcerned; for the ferment or ill odour of the dung, cannot be over-maſtered by the Plants, as we ſee alſo in <hi>Animals,</hi> that corrupt diet cauſeth unſavory taſts in the fleſh: ſo <hi>hogs</hi> in <hi>New-found-land,</hi> where they are nouriſhed by <hi>fiſh,</hi> may by their <hi>taſts</hi> be called rather <hi>Sea-porpuſſes,</hi> then <hi>Land-ſwine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſowing of <hi>Smutty</hi> Corn oft produceth <hi>Smuttyneſs</hi>; the ſon like unto the father: I account <hi>Smutty</hi> Corn an <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> or <hi>ſick</hi> Grain, and ſuppoſe that by a <hi>Microſcope</hi> the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection may be diſcerned.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The ſowing of the ſame ſeed oft on the ſame field, cauſeth <hi>Smuttyneſs</hi>; becauſe that <hi>nitrous juice,</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the nouriſhment of the Grain, hath been exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the precedent years; and therefore it is excellent <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry</hi> every year to change the <hi>ſpecies</hi> of Grain, and alſo to buy your Seed-Corn, from places far diſtant. I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> who did ſowe ſome <hi>Wheat</hi> which came from <hi>Spain,</hi> where the Grain is uſually very hard and flinty,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55779:17"/>
and as it were tranſparent, and far weightier then ours (as it appeareth by a meaſure at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> which holdeth about 3 buſhels, and in our <hi>Wheat</hi> of the <hi>Northern</hi> parts weigheth 160, whereas the <hi>Southern</hi> Corn weigheth ſomtimes 180, 200, 220.) and had a crop beyond expectation.</p>
            <p>The uſual <hi>Cures</hi> of <hi>Smuttyneſs,</hi> beſides thoſe mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, are theſe</p>
            <p n="1">1. To lime your ground, which warmeth and dryeth the Land.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To lime your Corne, which is done thus. Firſt, Slack your lime, and then moiſten your Corn or lime, and ſtir them together, till your Grain be as big as a ſmall <hi>Peaſe.</hi> This liming preſerveth Corn likewiſe from birds and worms, and is found a very good <hi>Remedy</hi> againſt this diſeaſe: others make a ſtrong lye with common ſalt, and ſteep their Corn in it all night, and then draw away their lye for further uſe; which ſeldom faileth of its deſired effect. Whether this ſtrong lye doth by its <hi>corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs,</hi> mortifie the weak and imperfect Corn, ſo that it will not grow; Or whether it be a <hi>Remedy,</hi> to cure the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions thereof, is worth the enquiry? I ſuppoſe this lye doth <hi>exſicoate</hi> the <hi>ſuperfluous humidity,</hi> which is the cauſe of this corruption. If Corn be brought into the Barn very <hi>Smutty,</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> they uſually threſh it on dry floors, planked with boards; by which means, the <hi>Smuttyneſs</hi> is beaten away, and ſticketh not to the Grain, onely a little blackneſs appeareth about the eye, but if it be threſhed on a moiſt floor, the blackneſs ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Grain, which therefore appeareth dark, and is ſold at a lower rate to the Bakers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mildew</hi> is without queſtion an <hi>unctuous</hi> dew, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth from above about <hi>Midſomer</hi>; it aboundeth in dry years, as <hi>Smuttyneſſe</hi> in moiſt. I cannot think that there is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily any Malgnity in this dew, but it produceth its effect by manifeſt cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> from an <hi>oily viſcuous</hi> quality, which ſtoppeth the <hi>pores</hi> of the husk wherein the <hi>Wheat</hi> lyeth, and depriveth it from the Ayre, and conſequently from nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for the Ayre is the life of all things. I have heard, and do believe, that if you ſtreak any ear of <hi>Wheat</hi> with oyl,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55779:17"/>
it will produce the ſame effect. I am ſorry that I never tryed, that I might better underſtand the nature of this ſad calamity which often undoeth the Induſtrious <hi>Husbandman:</hi> and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth great ſcarcity in this <hi>Iſle.</hi> It is to be obſerved further, that <hi>Wheat</hi> onely ſuffereth conſiderable damage by <hi>Mildew</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it lyeth in a chaffy husk, which other Grains do not. The <hi>Grounds</hi> moſt ſubject to <hi>Mildew,</hi> are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe that are <hi>encloſed</hi> with <hi>Trees</hi> and <hi>high Hedges.</hi> And truly this is the onely great <hi>Inconveniency</hi> I find by <hi>enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Low Valleys:</hi> I have ſeen very oft in the ſame field, the banks fine bright Corn; and all the <hi>lower</hi> parts, though great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in <hi>ſtraw</hi>; yet little worth by reaſon of the <hi>Mildew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Dung</hi> made of <hi>ſtraw,</hi> I have obſerved to diſpoſe much to <hi>Mildew,</hi> and <hi>Sheeps dung</hi> to be a kind of <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt it: as alſo <hi>Pigeons-dung</hi>; becauſe, as I conceive, theſe 2 laſt ſorts abound much in <hi>Niter,</hi> which produceth a firm, hard, bright Corn, not eaſily to be putrefied; but the other being more oily and <hi>Sulphureous,</hi> cauſeth a dark <hi>Spungy</hi> Corn, ſoon corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. And 2. becauſe <hi>ſtraw</hi> and <hi>dung</hi> is a part of the ſame kind corrupted, which is always in ſome meaſure hurtful to the ſame <hi>ſpecies,</hi> both in <hi>Animals,</hi> and all <hi>Vegetables,</hi> and therefore <hi>rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſticks,</hi> or the <hi>earth</hi> proceeding from them, is found hurtful to the <hi>roots</hi> of <hi>trees</hi>; and <hi>trees</hi> will hardly grow, where <hi>Roots</hi> of other <hi>trees</hi> have formerly been <hi>corrupted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Remedies</hi> for this <hi>Accident,</hi> briefly are theſe. (Not to ſpeak of <hi>Bees,</hi> who queſtionleſs make moſt of their <hi>Honey</hi> from theſe <hi>Honeys</hi> or <hi>Mildews:</hi> for they gather very little, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that which falleth.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. The beſt way is to cut down the trees about your ground, and your hedges low, that the wind may <hi>ventilate</hi> your Corn.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſowe early; that your Corn may be full <hi>Kerned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Culp.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe <hi>Mildews</hi> fall. I am informed, that an Ingenious <hi>Knight</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> did for curioſity ſowe <hi>Wheat</hi> in all months of the year, and that the Corn ſown in <hi>July,</hi> did produce ſuch an increaſe, that it is almoſt incredible; and truly I think it a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55779:18"/>
great fault in many places that they ſow late, for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: I am ſure in <hi>France,</hi> they uſually ſowe before <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Some uſe (and with good profit) to draw a line over their Corn, and to ſtrike off the <hi>Mildew,</hi> before it be <hi>inſpiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by the Sun; This ought eſpecially to be done before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing: two men in an hour will eaſily run over an Acre; the <hi>Mildews</hi> uſually fall like a <hi>thick fog,</hi> or a <hi>Miſty rain</hi>; if you go to your <hi>Bees,</hi> you will ſoon perceive it by their extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary labour, very early in the morning.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The uſe of a kind of <hi>bearded Wheat,</hi> is an excellent <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy:</hi> for the beard ſhooteth off the <hi>dew,</hi> that it doth not ſo eaſily inſinuate it ſelfe into the <hi>ear,</hi> and likewiſe cauſeth the <hi>ear</hi> to ſhake by the leaſt wind. There is a kind of <hi>Wheat</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire</hi> called <hi>Red-ſtraw-Wheat,</hi> which is much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: it's a ſtrong-ſtalked <hi>Wheat,</hi> and doth not ſoon lodge, and therefore excellent for <hi>Rank</hi> Land where Corn is apt to lodge, and conſequently to <hi>Mildew</hi>; but I queſtion whether it hath any property againſt <hi>Mildew.</hi> This I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry confident of, that if this <hi>Wheat,</hi> or any other, were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Chaffy husks expoſed bare to the Aire; as <hi>Barley</hi> and <hi>Rie</hi> are, <hi>Wheat</hi> would not be afflicted with <hi>Mildew.</hi> Perhaps ſuch Grain may be found by diligent enquiry. I have caſually picked out of a <hi>Wheat</hi>-field ſome ſtalks, which had two ears on them: and though <hi>Barley</hi> uſually hath but 2 ranges in the South of <hi>England,</hi> yet I have ſeen ſome ſorts with 4, 6, and there are many great varieties in grains not yet diſcovered. Truly if any knoweth better ways then theſe, how to cure this Malady of <hi>Mildew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>5.</hi> Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Apples, Pears, Cherries, &amp; Plums.</note> he is much to blame, if he do not publiſh it for the good of his <hi>Countrey-men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not here ſet down the divers manners of <hi>Graftings</hi> and <hi>Inoculations,</hi> which nevertheleſs is an Art abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in Planting; for every Book of <hi>Husbandry</hi> doth ſhew it, and every <hi>Gardiner</hi> can teach it thoſe who are deſirous to learn it: Neither will I ſet down all the ſorts of <hi>Apples, Pears, Cherries, Plums,</hi> &amp;c. For it would be too tedious a diſcourſe; and Mr. <hi>Parkinſon</hi> hath already very excellently done it, in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55779:18"/>
his Book called <hi>Paradiſus Terreſtis,</hi> where at leaſure you may read it. I will only point briefly at the <hi>Deficiencies,</hi> which I find in this part of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> and the beſt ways to <hi>Remedy</hi> them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay, that it is a great <hi>Deficiency</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that we have not more <hi>Orchards</hi> planted. It's true, that in <hi>Kent,</hi> and about <hi>London,</hi> and alſo in <hi>Gloceſterſhire, Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Worceſter,</hi> there are many gallant <hi>Orchards,</hi> but in other <hi>Countreys,</hi> they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare and thin: but if there were as many more, even in any <hi>Countrey,</hi> they would be very profitable. I know in <hi>Kent,</hi> that ſome advance their ground even from 5 s. <hi>per</hi> Acre, to 5 pound by this means, and ſo proportionally; and if I ſhould relate what I have heard by divers concerning the profit of a <hi>Cherry-Orchard,</hi> about <hi>Sittenburn</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> you would hardly believe me; yet I have heard it by ſo many, that I believe it to be true: Namely, that an <hi>Orchard</hi> of 30 Acres of <hi>Cherries,</hi> produced in one year above 1000 pound, but now the Trees are almoſt all dead; it was one of the firſt <hi>Orchards</hi> planted in <hi>Kent.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> reporteth, that King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner,</hi> firſt began to plant <hi>Flemiſh Cherries</hi> in thoſe parts, which in his time did ſpread into 32 other <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> and were at that time ſold at greater rates then now; yet I know that 10, or 15 pound an Acre hath been given for <hi>Cherries</hi>; more for <hi>Pears,</hi> and <hi>Apples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a great <hi>Deficiency</hi> in the ordering of <hi>Orchards,</hi> in that they are not well pruned, but full of <hi>Moſs, Miſletoe,</hi> and <hi>Suckers,</hi> and oftentimes the ground is packed too thick of Trees; for they ſhould ſtand at leaſt 20 foot aſunder; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ill husbands beſtow dunging, digging, or any other coſt on <hi>Orchards,</hi> which if they did, might pay half their Rents in ſome places. One told me for a Secret, a Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for to make Trees bear much and excellent fruit, which was this: Firſt, in an old Tree, to <hi>ſplit</hi> his root; then to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a <hi>Compoſt</hi> made of <hi>Pigeons</hi> dung, <hi>Lees</hi> of wine, or ſtale <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> and a little <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> (to deſtroy the worms) it hath ſome probability of truth: for by experience I know that a buſhel of <hi>Pigeons</hi> dung hath cauſed a Tree to grow and bear,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55779:19"/>
which for divers years before ſtood at a ſtand; but concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>ſplitting the roots,</hi> I know not what to ſay. Some old <hi>Authours</hi> affirm this ought to be done; becauſe that the roots may as well be hide-bound, as other parts of the Tree, and not able to attract his nouriſhment, and when the Root is ſplit, it will ſpeedily ſend forth divers ſmall <hi>fibrous</hi> roots; which are the principall <hi>Attractors.</hi> It were good that ſome would give us an account exact of this <hi>Experiment.</hi> But ſome will object againſt <hi>Orchards,</hi> that they ſpoyl much ground, and therefore ought to be planted only in <hi>Hedges.</hi> To this I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>Plumtrees</hi> and <hi>Damſius</hi> may very well be planted in hedges, being ordinarily thorny Plants; this is uſed very much in <hi>Surrey</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> where the <hi>Plums</hi> uſually pay no ſmall part of their Rent; yet I never ſaw in theſe Southern parts of <hi>England,</hi> any <hi>Apples</hi> or <hi>Pears</hi> thrive in an <hi>Hedge,</hi> unleſs a <hi>Crab,</hi> or a <hi>Wilden,</hi> or ſome <hi>Sweeting</hi> of little worth. How they thrive in <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> and thoſe places, I know not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Inconveniences</hi> of <hi>Orchards</hi> planted at 20 or 30 foot diſtance, is not worth ſpeaking of: for this is the uſual courſe in <hi>Kent,</hi> when they plant any ground, they exactly place them in rank and file, and then plough their Lands many years, and ſowe them with Corn, till the <hi>Orchard</hi> beginneth to bear fruit; then they lay them down for <hi>paſture,</hi> which <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture</hi> is not conſiderably <hi>ſoure</hi>; but hath this advantage above other <hi>Paſtures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is ſooner grown by 14 dayes in the Spring than the <hi>Medows,</hi> and therefore very ſerviceable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In <hi>Parching Summers</hi> here is <hi>plenty,</hi> when other places have ſcarcity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are great ſhelters for Cattel, eſpecially <hi>ſheep,</hi> who will in thoſe places, in great Snows ſcrape up meat, which in other places they cannot do: and if the paſture were <hi>ſour,</hi> yet the loſs is not great; for it will be a convenient place for the <hi>Hogs</hi> to run in, who muſt have a place for that purpoſe, where there are no Commons.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:55779:19"/>4. I ſay, that the <hi>Benefits</hi> are ſo many by <hi>Orchards,</hi> that you ought not like an ungratefull man to thruſt them up to the hedge: for they afford curious walks for pleaſure, food for cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, both in the Spring early, and alſo in the <hi>parching Summer,</hi> and <hi>nipping ſnowy Winter:</hi> They afford fuel for the fire, and alſo ſhades for the heat, phyſick from the ſick, refreſhment for the ſound, plenty of food for man, and that not of the worſt, and dink alſo even of the beſt, and all this without much labour, care or coſt, who therefore can juſtly open his mouth againſt them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Deficiency</hi> is, that we do not improve many excellent Fruits, which grow amongſt very well, and that we have as yet many fruits from beyond Seas, which will grow very well with us. I paſſe by the generall and great Ignorance, that is amongſt us, of the variety of <hi>Apples,</hi> of which there are many ſorts which have ſome good and peculiar uſes; moſt men contenting themſelves with the knowledge of half a ſcore of the beſt, thinking the vertues of all the reſt are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in them: as alſo of the variety of <hi>Pears,</hi> which are incredibly many. A <hi>Friend</hi> of mine near <hi>Graveſend,</hi> hath lately collected about 200 <hi>ſpecies.</hi> I know another in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> (Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>) who hath nigh the ſame number. I hear of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> not inferiour to theſe. In <hi>Northamton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> I know one, who hath likewiſe collected very many. So that I dare boldly ſay, there are no leſs in this <hi>Iſland</hi> then 500 <hi>ſpecies</hi>; ſome commended for their early ripeneſſe; ſome for excellent taſtes; ſome for beauty; others for greatneſs; ſome for great bearers; others for good Bakers; ſome for long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, others for to make <hi>Perry,</hi> &amp;c. But to our purpoſe: I ſay many rare fruits are neglected: To inſtance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>Small-nut</hi> or <hi>Filberd,</hi> which is not much inferiour to the beſt and ſweeteſt <hi>Almonds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The great <hi>Damſin</hi> or <hi>Pruin-plum,</hi> which groweth well, and beareth full in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Almonds,</hi> which groweth well and beareth good fruit, as I have ſeen divers buſhels on one Treee in my Brothers <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:55779:20"/>4. <hi>Walnuts,</hi> which is not a fruit to be deſpiſed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Vines</hi> and <hi>Mulberies,</hi> but of theſe preſently in another place. I might likewiſe adde <hi>Currants, Raſpeſes,</hi> of which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent drinks may be made.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Quinces,</hi> Of the which I cannot but tell you that a <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> at <hi>Prichenel</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> who had a Tree from beyond Sea, hath the beſt in <hi>England,</hi> and hath made above 30 pound of a ſmall piece of ground planted with them, as I have heard from his own Wifes mouth. And therefore it is by reaſon of our ill <hi>Husbandry,</hi> that we have <hi>Quinces</hi> from <hi>Flaunders, Small-nuts</hi> from <hi>Spain, Pruins</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> and alſo <hi>Walnuts</hi>; and <hi>Almonds</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Cheſtnuts</hi> (which I had almoſt forgot) from <hi>Portugal.</hi> And now I cannot but digreſs a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, to tell you a ſtrange and true ſtory, with my opinion of it. In divers places of <hi>Kent,</hi> as at and about <hi>Graveſend,</hi> in the Countrey and elſewhere, very many of the prime <hi>Timbers</hi> of their old Barns and Houſes are of <hi>Cheſtnut-wood,</hi> and yet there is ſcarce a <hi>Cheſtnut-Tree</hi> within 20 miles of that place, and the people altogether ignorant of ſuch Trees. This ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that in former times thoſe places did abound with ſuch timber; for people were not ſo fooliſh ſurely in former times, to run up and down the World, to procure ſuch huge maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey Timbers for Barns and ſuch Buildings when as there was plenty of <hi>Oakes</hi> and <hi>Elmes,</hi> at their doors: And further, it ſheweth, that theſe Trees will grow again with us to a great bigneſſe. This putteth into my mind the Story of the <hi>Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logs,</hi> which are found in divers places of the North of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Moors</hi> many foot deep; which logs are long and black, and appeare to be a kind of <hi>Fir</hi> or <hi>Pine</hi>; and yet in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, people are altogether ignorant of theſe Trees, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey not producing any of theſe <hi>ſpecies.</hi> The firſt Story of <hi>Kent,</hi> which I know to be true, cauſeth me to wonder the leſſe at the latter: for I ſee that a <hi>ſpecies</hi> of wood, may be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even totally in a place. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. I know, that in <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> that <hi>Pines,</hi> and <hi>Firs</hi> and <hi>Cedars,</hi> do grow wonderfully thick in ſuch <hi>Moors</hi> or <hi>Swamps,</hi> and being light wood, and eaſily wrought,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55779:20"/>
they are continually uſed, while they laſt, for buildings. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I ſuppoſe theſe <hi>Moors</hi> are <hi>Commons,</hi> to the which the poor have uſed to reſort for ſiring, and how ſoon great woods will be conſumed by them, every one making what havock he pleaſeth, all men know. As concerning their being ſo deep in the ground, and their blackneſs; I ſuppoſe that when wood was abundant in thoſe places, every one did cut what they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and left what was not for their turns, which being in moiſt places, was ſoon glutted with moiſture, and made pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous; by which means it ſoon buried it ſelf, as Ships do, on Quickſand, or perhaps the <hi>Turf</hi> (which hath a peculiar facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vegetative, for where it is exhauſted, it ſoon groweth again) in time hath grown over them; the people permitting it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that wood, once <hi>ſobbed</hi> in wet, is of little uſe, as we ſee by <hi>Piles</hi> on the <hi>Marſhes</hi>-ſide, ſcarce any man vouchſafing to carry them home. The blackneſs of this wood proceedeth, as I ſuppoſe, from the ſooty fume, or <hi>evaporation</hi> of the black <hi>turf,</hi> (which endeavoreth, as all earths do) to reduce all things into its own nature; which though it be not able fully to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh; yet it introduceth divers diſpoſitions, and qualities, as blackneſs in the Wood. Some ſuppoſe, that theſe <hi>Moor-logs</hi> have lain there ever ſince the <hi>flood,</hi> with whom I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; ſeeing that any wood, if it be kept from the Aire conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually moiſt or dry, will endure even thouſands of years with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putrefaction.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Deficiency,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>6</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Fruits.</note> is the <hi>Not-improving</hi> of our <hi>Fruits</hi> for the beſt ends and purpoſes. <hi>Normandy,</hi> which produceth but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wine, maketh abundance of <hi>Cider, Perry,</hi> which they eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate equally to wine, if it be made of good fruit. The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>Perry</hi> is made of <hi>Choaky Pears,</hi> very juicy, which grow along by the high-way-ſides, which are not to be eaten raw. In <hi>Biſeay</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> where wine is ſcarce, they make <hi>Cider</hi> of a certain ſweet <hi>Apple,</hi> which hath a little <hi>bitterneſſe</hi> in it, and is like to our <hi>ſnouting,</hi> and the <hi>Cider</hi> is very good. And truly here in <hi>England,</hi> if we would make <hi>Cider</hi> and <hi>Perry</hi> of the beſt ſorts of Fruits, which is rarely done, (for we think any fruit good enough for that purpoſe) we might make drinks,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55779:21"/>
no wayes inferiour to the <hi>French-wines,</hi> which are uſually ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before they come over the Seas to us, their Spirits ſoon evapourating. There are two wayes of making <hi>Cider</hi> and <hi>Perry:</hi> one, by bruiſing and beating them, and then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to put them into a veſſel to <hi>ferment</hi> or work (as it is uſually called) of themſelves: The other way is to boil the juice with ſome good <hi>Spices,</hi> by which the rawneſſe is taken away, and then to ferment it with ſome yeſt, if it work not of it ſelfe, this is the beſt way: and I have taſted <hi>Cider</hi> thus made of an excellent delicate taſte. Neither let any complaine of the windineſſe; for it is onely want of uſe: When I had for two or three years continually drunk <hi>wine</hi> beyond Sea, the ſtrongeſt Beer for two or three weeks was as windy to me, as <hi>Cider</hi> will be to any; and afterwards when I went to <hi>Paris,</hi> the <hi>wine</hi> of that place was as troubleſome as <hi>Engliſh beer</hi> for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time: how much wine might be ſaved, and alſo <hi>Malt</hi> if <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> did take theſe good courſes, which other <hi>Nations</hi> do, and conſequently how much advantage would this <hi>Iſland</hi> reap thereby? If I were an houſe-keeper in the Country, I would make excellent <hi>Beer, Ale, Cider, Perry, Metheglin,</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> of our own <hi>grapes,</hi> and if my Friends would not drinke theſe, they ſhould drink water, or go away a thirſt: I would ſcorn to honour <hi>France</hi> ſo much as men do uſually; and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> ſhould not laugh at us, and ſay that we can as well be without <hi>Bread,</hi> as their <hi>Wines, Currants, &amp;c.</hi> Thus may many more excellent <hi>Drinks</hi> be made out of our <hi>Fruits:</hi> not to ſpeak of thoſe which are made of our <hi>Grain,</hi> as <hi>Barley, Wheat,</hi> &amp;c. yet I muſt tell you, that I know an <hi>Ingenious</hi> man, who can without malting <hi>Barley,</hi> make a <hi>Drink</hi> not inferiour to <hi>Wine,</hi> and a greater quantity of <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> out of them, and with leſſe coſt, then by the ordinary way, by a peculiar <hi>Fermentation</hi> of his own; which time will diſcover. There is another <hi>Ingenious</hi> man, who out of <hi>Damſins</hi> and other fat and ſweet <hi>Plums,</hi> can make a <hi>Drink</hi> not inferiour to the beſt <hi>Wines,</hi> and abundance of <hi>Aqua-vitae.</hi> Many <hi>Ladies</hi> know how to make <hi>Cherry, Raſpes</hi>-wines; and Sir <hi>Hugh Plattes</hi> in his <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi> for <hi>Ladies,</hi> diſcloſeth many Secrets of this kind; as alſo
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55779:21"/>
for <hi>Conſerves, Marmalades,</hi> which are things both delightfull and profitable. I have a kinſman, who can even out of <hi>Black-berries,</hi> make a very pleaſant <hi>Drink,</hi> which curioſity he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to publiſh. <hi>Glauber</hi> an excellent <hi>Chymiſt</hi> hath divers ſecrets of this kind, even to the advancing of <hi>Haws, Heps,</hi> or <hi>Canker-berries, Slows,</hi> to excellent <hi>Aqua-vitae's, Drinks, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> which he himſelf firſt invented. In <hi>Ruſſia</hi> in the <hi>ſpring-time,</hi> it's an uſual cuſtom to pierce the Bark of the <hi>Birch-trees,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Helmont.</note> which at that time will weep much <hi>liquour,</hi> and yet like children be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the worſe, this the poor ordinarily drink for neceſſity, it's a pleaſant healthful drink; and alſo the rich men, becauſe it's an excellent Preſevative againſt the ſtone.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Means</hi> to advance this profitable and pleaſant Work are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To advance <hi>Nurceries</hi> of all ſorts of <hi>Apples, Pears, Plums, Cherries,</hi> which <hi>Gentlemen</hi> may do for a ſmall matter, and then plant out theſe Trees, when they are grown great enough. The beſt and cheapeſt wayes to raiſe all <hi>Nurcery</hi> Wares, is done thus. <hi>Plums</hi> may be raiſed either of <hi>ſtones,</hi> which when you have eaten the <hi>plums,</hi> may be preſently pricked into the ground, or by <hi>ſlips,</hi> which you will find about the old Trees: <hi>Apples</hi> may be raiſed from <hi>Kernels, (Crab-Kernels</hi> are the beſt) which ought to be preſerved in dry ſand, till the <hi>ſpring,</hi> leaſt they grow mouldy: or <hi>Crab-ſtalke</hi> may be fetched out of the woods, and grafted. Some Trees, as <hi>Sweetings, Codlings, Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> will grow very well of <hi>ſlips. Cherries</hi> are very well raiſed by <hi>ſtones,</hi> (the <hi>Black-Cherries</hi> are the beſt) which ſo ſoon as you have eated them, are to be howen into Beds made very fine, the ranges a foot diſtant; beware leſt you let them heat, and take heed of the Mouſe. I have ſeen <hi>Cherry-ſtones</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple-kernels</hi> grow two foot and a half in one year; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in few years they would be fit to be tranſplanted. The <hi>Art of Grafting, Inoculating</hi> a Gentleman will learn in two hours.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the advancing of <hi>Ingenuities</hi> in this kind, as that making of <hi>Vinous-Drinks</hi> out of <hi>Apples, Plums,</hi> &amp;c. I counſel all <hi>Ingenious Gentlemen</hi> to try divers <hi>experiments</hi> in theſe kinds; with theſe <hi>Cautions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:55779:22"/>1. That he attempt not great quantities at firſt, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance will be chargeable and troubleſome; for by a Gallon he may have as much certainty, as by a Hogſhead.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Not to be diſcouraged, if they ſucceed not well at firſt daſh: for certainly there are many <hi>Ingenuities</hi> in theſe fruits which time will diſcover.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Proceed by <hi>Fermentation:</hi> for every liquour which will ferment, hath a <hi>vinous</hi> ſpirit in it, and without <hi>Fermentation,</hi> even the beſt fruits will have none.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Fermentation</hi> is done either <hi>in liquido,</hi> or <hi>humido</hi>; and herein conſiſts ſome Myſtery. I have forgot to ſpeak of <hi>Apricoks, Peaches, Melicotons,</hi> which are fine pleaſant fruits, yet very dangerous; and therefore called by the <hi>Italians, Mazz-franceſe,</hi> that is, <hi>Kill-Frenchman</hi>; and wiſh Ladies, and others to take heed of ſurfeiting by theſe.</p>
            <p>I cannot without much tediouſneſſe, relate the divers ſorts of <hi>Vines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>7</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vines.</note> which are even infinite; <hi>Rome</hi> baving in it uſually, 40 or 50 ſorts of <hi>Vines</hi>; and all very good: Other places of <hi>Italy, Spain, France,</hi> have alſo great varieties; I therefore paſſe them by, as alſo the manner of managing them, becauſe it is deſcribed in the <hi>Countrey-Farm,</hi> and alſo by <hi>Bonovil</hi> a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> who at the Command of King <hi>James,</hi> wrote a ſhort Treatiſe of <hi>Vines</hi> and <hi>Silkworms,</hi> for the inſtruction of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Virginia.</hi> I ſhall only according to my Method ſhew you the <hi>Deficiencies</hi> amongſt us in this particular Plant, and the beſt <hi>Remedies</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>And firſt, although I think that the <hi>Vine</hi> is the great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, which <hi>Hot Countreys</hi> eſpecially enjoy, as <hi>tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Countreys</hi> doe <hi>Milke, Butter, Cheeſe,</hi> in abundance, and the coldeſt and <hi>Barreneſt Fowl,</hi> and <hi>Fiſh,</hi> in an incredible number; God of his goodneſſe diſtributing ſome peculiar bleſſings to every Countrey: Notwithſtanding I dare ſay, it's probable, that <hi>Vineyards</hi> have formerly <hi>flouriſhed</hi> in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and that we are to blame, that ſo little is attempted to revive them again. There are many places in <hi>Kent</hi> called by the names of <hi>Vineyards,</hi> and the grounds of ſuch a Nature, that it ſeemeth probable they have been ſuch. I hear further by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55779:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
divers people of credit, that by Records it appeareth, that the Tythes of <hi>wine</hi> in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> was in divers Pariſhes conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably great; and remaining about 300 years in their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> writes ſo much; as alſo <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> who lived 600 years ſince. But at length <hi>Gaſcony</hi> coming into the hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> from whence cometh the moſt of the <hi>ſtrong French Wine,</hi> call'd <hi>Highc-Country-wine,</hi> and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms being ſmall, <hi>wine</hi> was imported into <hi>England</hi> from thence, better and cheaper then we could make it, and it was thought convenient to diſcourage <hi>Vineyards</hi> here, that the greater trade might be driven with <hi>Gaſcoine,</hi> and many ſhips might find im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment thereby.</p>
            <p>Some Aſtrologers have conceited, that the Earth being grown older, and therefore colder hath cauſed the Sun to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend many thouſand miles lower to warm and cheriſh it, and one Argument which they bring for this opinion is, that <hi>Vines</hi> and <hi>Silkworms</hi> are found in thoſe Countreys, wherein former times they were unknown: But if theſe fond men had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the good <hi>Husbandry</hi> in theſe times, with the bleſſing of God on it, they had not run into ſuch fooliſh imaginations. This is true indeed, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, who had <hi>Alſatia</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them to live in, which is one of the beſt and moſt Southern places of <hi>Germany,</hi> mutined, becauſe they thought it ſo <hi>cold,</hi> that <hi>Vines</hi> would not grow there, &amp; that therefore they ſhould be deprived of that delectable liquour; whereas we find at this preſent day <hi>Vines</hi> flouriſhing many hundred miles more toward the North, both in <hi>France, Lorain,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Germany</hi>; and that they are crept down even to the <hi>Latitude</hi> of <hi>England</hi> for the <hi>Rheniſh-wines</hi> grew within a degree of the Weſt-Southern pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Iſle, and <hi>Paris</hi> is not two degrees South of us, yet <hi>Vines</hi> grow threeſcore miles on this ſide <hi>Paris,</hi> as by <hi>Beaumont, Beauvats,</hi> &amp;c. by the way of <hi>Picardy</hi> near 20 leagues; as alſo by the way of <hi>Pontoyſe</hi> through <hi>Normandy,</hi> at <hi>Artes,</hi> 35 leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> and 5 from <hi>Diep</hi>; yea the <hi>Vines</hi> of theſe places are the moſt delicate; for what wine is preferred before the Neat <hi>Rheniſh</hi> for Ladies, and at Table; and truely in my opinion, though I have travelled twice through <hi>France</hi>; yet no <hi>wine</hi>

pleaſed me like <hi>Vin D'ache,</hi> and of <hi>Paris</hi> eſpecially about <hi>Rueill,</hi> which is a very fine <hi>brisk wine,</hi> and not <hi>fuming</hi> up to the head, and <hi>Inebriating</hi> as other <hi>wines:</hi> I ſay therefore that it is very probable, that if <hi>Vines</hi> have ſtept out of <hi>Italy</hi> into <hi>Alſatia,</hi> from them to theſe places, which are even as far North as <hi>England,</hi> and yet the <hi>Wines</hi> there are the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that they are not limited and bound there. For an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles more or leſſe cauſeth little alteration in heat or cold, and ſome advantages which we have will ſupply that defect. But not to inſiſt too long on <hi>probabilities,</hi> I ſay, that here in <hi>England</hi> ſome <hi>Ingenious Gentlemen</hi> uſually make <hi>wine</hi> very good, long laſting, without extraordinary labour and coſts. To inſtance in one, who in Great <hi>Chart,</hi> in the <hi>Wilde</hi> of <hi>Kent,</hi> a place very moiſt and cold,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sir</hi> Peter Ricard.</note> yearly maketh 6 or 8 Hogſheads, which is very much commended by divers who have taſted it, and he hath kept ſome of it two years, as he himſelfe told me,<note place="margin">Captain <hi>Tucker.</hi>
               </note> and hath been very good: Others likewiſe in <hi>Kent</hi> doe the ſame: and lately in <hi>Surrey</hi> a <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> told me, that they having many <hi>Grapes,</hi> which they could not well tell how to diſpoſe of, ſhe, to play the good <hi>Houſe-wife,</hi> ſtampt them to make <hi>verjuice</hi>; but two months after drawing it forth, they found it very fine <hi>brisk-wine,</hi> clear like <hi>Rock-water,</hi> and in many other places ſuch <hi>experiments</hi> have been made. I therefore deſire <hi>Ingenious</hi> men to endeavour the raiſing of ſo neceſſary and pleaſant a commodity: eſpecially when <hi>French-Wine</hi> is ſo dear here, and I ſuppoſe is likely to be dearer; I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion not, but they ſhall find good profit and pleaſure in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that the <hi>State</hi> will give all encouragements to them: and if the <hi>French Wine</hi> pay <hi>Excize</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms,</hi> and the <hi>Wines</hi> here be <hi>toll-free,</hi> they will be able to afford them far cheaper, then the <hi>French</hi> can theirs, and ſupply the whole <hi>Iſle,</hi> if they proceed according to theſe <hi>Rules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To chooſe the beſt ſorts of <hi>Grapes,</hi> which are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for this <hi>Iſle,</hi> and though there are many ſorts of <hi>Grapes</hi> amongſt <hi>Gardiners,</hi> yet I commend four ſorts eſpecially to them; and I deſire that they be very carefull in this particular: for it is the foundation of the work; if you fail in this, you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55779:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
fail in all; for I know that <hi>Burdeaux-Vines,</hi> which bear very great <hi>Grapes,</hi> make <hi>verjuice</hi> onely at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that the tender <hi>Orleans-Vine</hi> doth not thrive there.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſort is the <hi>Parſely Vine,</hi> or <hi>Canada-grape</hi>; becauſe it firſt came from thoſe parts, where it grows naturally; and though the Countrey be intolerably cold; yet even in the woods without manuring, it ſo far ripeneth his fruits, that the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> make <hi>wine</hi> of it for their Maſs; and <hi>Racineè</hi> (which is the <hi>Juice</hi> of the <hi>Grape</hi> newly expreſt, and boiled to a <hi>Syrupe,</hi> and is very ſweet and pleaſant) for their Lent-proviſion, as you may read in their <hi>Relations:</hi> and this <hi>Vine</hi> ſeemeth to be made for theſe Northern Countreys, becauſe it hath its leaves very ſmall and jagged, as if it were on purpoſe to let in the Sun, and it ripeneth ſooner then other <hi>Grapes,</hi> as I have obſerved in <hi>Oxford-Graden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Sort of <hi>Vine</hi> is the <hi>Rheniſh-Grape</hi>; for it groweth in a temperate Countrey, not much hotter in the Summer then <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>; and the <hi>wine</hi> is excellent as all know.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sort is the <hi>Paris-grape</hi>; which is much like the temper of <hi>England,</hi> onely a little hotter in Summer: this <hi>Grape</hi> beareth a ſmall bunch cloſe ſet together, very hardly to endure <hi>froſts,</hi> and other <hi>inconveniences,</hi> and is ſoon ripe; ſo that the <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> is ſooner ended then that of <hi>Orleans</hi> or <hi>Burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux</hi>; and though it be not ſo delicate to the taſte, as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Grapes:</hi> yet it maketh an excellent brisk <hi>wine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Sort is the <hi>ſmall Muskadell</hi>; which is a very fine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <hi>Grape,</hi> both to eat, and to make <hi>wine.</hi> In <hi>Italy</hi> it uſually groweth againſt their houſes walls, and of this they make a ſmall pleaſant <hi>wine,</hi> a Month or two before the ordinary <hi>Vintage.</hi> It is a tender plant in reſpect of the other <hi>Vines</hi> in the fields: theſe <hi>Vines</hi> I know are the moſt convenient for this Iſle; becauſe they bear ſmall bunches, and <hi>Grapes</hi> ſoon ripen, and are hardy to endure froſts and ill wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To chooſe convenient places. For this end, I counſel them, Firſt, to plant <hi>Vines</hi> on the South-ſide of their <hi>dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Houſes, Barns, Stables,</hi> and <hi>Out-houſes.</hi> The <hi>Gentleman</hi> of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55779:24"/>
               <hi>Kent,</hi> whom I mentioned before, uſeth this courſe: and to keep the <hi>Vines</hi> from hurting his tiles, and that the wind may not wrong his <hi>Vines,</hi> he hath a frame made of poles, or any kind of wood, about a foot from the tiles, to the which he tyeth the <hi>Vines</hi>; by this means his <hi>Vines</hi> having the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the yard, ſides of the houſes, and tiles do ripen very well, and bear much; ſo that one old <hi>Vine,</hi> hath produced nigh a Hogſhead of <hi>wine</hi> in one year: and I wiſh all to take this courſe; which is neither chargeable, nor troubleſom, but very pleaſant; and if all in this <hi>Iſland</hi> would do thus, it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, what abundance of <hi>wine</hi> might be made, even by this petty way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If that any <hi>Gentleman</hi> will be at the charge of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> let him chooſe a fine ſandy warm hill, open to the <hi>South-Eaſt,</hi> rather then to the <hi>South-Weſt:</hi> for though the <hi>South-Weſt</hi> ſeemeth to be hotter; yet the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> ripeneth better, as I have ſeen in <hi>Oxford Garden</hi>; becauſe the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> is ſooner warm'd by the Sun in the morning; and the <hi>South-Weſt</hi> winds, are the winds which blow moſt frequently, and bring raine, which refrigerate the plants: and ſuch a place is very requiſite; for in other places <hi>Vines</hi> do not thrive, even in <hi>France:</hi> for if you travel betwixt <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Orleans,</hi> which is above 30 leagues, yet you ſhall ſcarcely ſee a <hi>Vineyard,</hi> becauſe it is a plain Champion-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. So likewiſe betwixt <hi>Fontarabia</hi> to <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> in the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern parts of <hi>France,</hi> for an hundred miles together; becauſe the Land is generally a barren ſandy Plain, where only <hi>Heath</hi> abounds, and <hi>Pine-trees,</hi> out of which they make <hi>Turpentine</hi> and <hi>Rozen,</hi> by wounding of them; and <hi>Tar</hi> and <hi>Pitch,</hi> by the burning of them: and if any find ſuch a fine warm hill, and do dung and fence it well, he hath a greater advantage of moſt of the <hi>Vineyards</hi> of <hi>France</hi> by this conveniency, than they have of our <hi>Iſle,</hi> by being an hundred miles more South; for moſt of their <hi>Vineyards</hi> are in large fields not encloſed, on land that is ſtony, and but indifferently warm. But ſome will ſay, that wet weather deſtroyes us. It's true, that the wet will deſtroy all things; <hi>Sheep, Corn,</hi> &amp;c. yet no man will ſay,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55779:24"/>
that therefore <hi>England</hi> will not produce and nouriſh theſe Creatures; and if extraordinary wet years come, they ſpoil even the <hi>Vines</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> but take ordinary years and our moiſture is not ſo great, (though ſome abuſe us, and call <hi>England Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula Coeli)</hi> but the <hi>Vines,</hi> eſpecially thoſe I have mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, will come to ſuch perfection as to make good <hi>wine:</hi> and if extraordinary rains fall: yet we may help the immatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> as I ſhall tell you anon: or at worſt make <hi>vineger</hi> or <hi>verjuice,</hi> which will pay coſts.</p>
            <p>Further theſe advantages we have of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This <hi>Iſle</hi> is not ſubject to nipping froſts in <hi>May,</hi> as <hi>France</hi> is; becauſe we are in an <hi>Iſle,</hi> where the Aire is more groſs then in the <hi>Continent</hi>; and therefore not ſo piercing and ſharp, as it plainly appeareth by our <hi>winters,</hi> which are not ſo ſharp as in <hi>Padua</hi> in <hi>Italy:</hi> neither are we ſubject to ſuch ſtorms of <hi>hail</hi> in <hi>Summer,</hi> which are very frequent in <hi>hot Countreys,</hi> and for many miles together do ſpoil their <hi>Vines,</hi> ſo that they cannot make <hi>wine</hi> of the <hi>Grapes</hi>; for thoſe <hi>Grapes</hi> which are touched by the <hi>hail,</hi> have a <hi>Sulphureous</hi> and a very unpleaſant taſte, and onely fit to make <hi>Aqua-vitae.</hi> Further, Sometimes in <hi>France,</hi> cask for their <hi>wines</hi> is ſo dear, that a <hi>tun</hi> of <hi>wine</hi> may be had for a <hi>tun</hi> of <hi>cask:</hi> and the <hi>cuſtome</hi> and <hi>excize</hi> which is laid on <hi>wines</hi> here, is as much again as the poor <hi>Vigueron</hi> in <hi>France</hi> expects for his <hi>wine.</hi> Not to ſpeak of the ill managing of their <hi>Vines,</hi> eſpecially about <hi>Paris,</hi> where poor men uſually hire an Acre or 2 of <hi>Vines,</hi> which they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage at their ſpare hours, and moſt commonly pack in ſo many plants of <hi>Vines</hi> on their ground, for to have the greater increaſe, that the ground and <hi>Vines</hi> are ſo ſhaded by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I have wondered, that the Sun could dart in his beams to mature them; and therefore I cannot but affirm again, that we may make abundance of <hi>wine</hi> here with profit, the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of an Acre of <hi>Vineyard</hi> not being ſo great as of <hi>Hops:</hi> an hundred ſets well rooted, at <hi>Paris</hi> coſt uſually but 4 or 6 <hi>Sous</hi> or pence, where I have bought many: 2000 will plant an Acre very well: 50 s. a year is the ordinary rate for the three diggings with their <hi>crooked Inſtrument</hi> called <hi>Hoyau,</hi> and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55779:25"/>
the increaſe uſually four tuns for an Acre, which will be profit enough: and though I refer all to <hi>Bonovil,</hi> and others, who have written of the <hi>managing of Vines</hi>; yet I counſel to get a <hi>Vigneron</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> where there are plenty, and at cheaper rates than ordinary ſervants here, and who will be ſerviceable alſo for <hi>Gardening.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I will briefly tell what I have ſeen. In <hi>Italy</hi> through all <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which is for the moſt part plain and <hi>Champian,</hi> their <hi>Vines</hi> grow in their <hi>Hedges</hi> on <hi>Walnut-trees,</hi> for the moſt part: in which fields, they ſpeak of three Harveſts yearly, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Winter-Corn,</hi> which is reaped in <hi>June,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Vines</hi> and <hi>Walnuts,</hi> which are gathered in <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>

Buck-wheat, Frumentone,</hi> or that which we call <hi>Virginia-Wheat, Turneps,</hi> which they ſowe in <hi>July,</hi> when their <hi>Winter-Corn</hi> is cut and reaped, they reap in <hi>October.</hi> In <hi>France,</hi> their <hi>Vines</hi> grow three manner of wayes; In <hi>Prove<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. About <hi>Orleans,</hi> and where they are more curious, they make frames for them to run along.</p>
            <p n="3">3. About <hi>Paris</hi> they tye them to ſhort poles, as we do hops to long ones. In <hi>France</hi> they uſually make trenches, or ſmall ditches, about three or four foot from one another, and therein plant their <hi>Vines,</hi> about one foot and an half deep, which is a good way, and very much to be commended; but if we here in <hi>England,</hi> plant <hi>Vines</hi> as we do hops, 4 or 5 foot diſtant, it will do very well, but let them not be packt together too thick, as they do in <hi>France</hi> in many places, leſt they too much ſhade the ground, and one another. In <hi>Italy</hi> when they tread their grapes with their feet in a Cart, they pour the juice into a great Veſſel or Fat, and put to it all their husks and ſtones which they call <hi>Graſpe,</hi> and let them <hi>ferment,</hi> or (as we ſay) <hi>work</hi> together 12 or 14 days, and uſually they put one third of water to it, this maketh a <hi>wine</hi> leſs furious, <hi>Garbo</hi> or rough, and therefore a good

ſtomack <hi>wine</hi>; but it ſpoileth the colour, and taketh away the pleaſant brisk taſte. In <hi>France</hi> ſo ſoon as they have preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed out their liquour with their feet, they put it in hogſheads, and after in their Preſſe ſqueeze out what they can, out of the <hi>Graſpe</hi>; which ſeemeth to fill up their Hogſheads while they work, which is uſually three or four dayes, and then ſtop them cloſe: this is alſo the way uſed in <hi>Germany,</hi> and is the beſt, for it maketh a fine Gentile <hi>wine</hi> with a curious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. In <hi>Germany,</hi> when their <hi>Grapes</hi> are green, they make fire in their Sellars in Stoves, by the which means, their <hi>wines</hi> work extraordinarily, and do digeſt themſelves the better: This courſe we muſt alſo take here in <hi>England</hi> ſome years; for it helpeth the rawneſſe of all liquours very much. There is an <hi>Ingenious Dutchman,</hi> who hath a Secret, which as yet he will not reveal, how to help <hi>Maturation</hi> by a <hi>Compoſt</hi> applyed to the roots: The <hi>Compoſt</hi> which I have ſpoken of before, made of <hi>Brimſtone: Pigeons-dung</hi> is very excellent for that <hi>purpoſe,</hi>

He alſo knoweth how to make <hi>ſour Grapes</hi> produce <hi>good wine</hi>; I <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe</hi> his way to be this. Firſt, all juice of <hi>Grapes</hi> newly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is ſweet, and which may by it ſelfe alone be made into a <hi>ſweet ſyrup,</hi> by boiling, which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Racineè.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Evaporation</hi> of <hi>liquors,</hi> which have not <hi>fermented</hi> or wrought, the watery part goeth away firſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Fermentation</hi> giveth a <hi>vinous</hi> taſte, and maketh a liquour full of ſpirits.</p>

            <p>For there is ſo much irrationality in ſome profeſſions, that they muſt be forced even like Bruits to underſtand their own good· In King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth days ſomething was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted to this purpoſe, as I am informed. In <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth days, there was a Law enacted that every man ſhould ſow his lands, and that no man ſhould encloſe his lands, leſt he ſhould turn it to <hi>Paſture</hi>; for we have had great dearth in <hi>England</hi> through the neglect of <hi>Tillage</hi>; which Laws even as yet ſtand in force; yet there is not, nor needeth there be any force to compel men to till and ſow their lands; for they have at length found the ſweetneſſe, and willingly go about it for their own profits ſake, and now we ſuppoſe (and not without cauſe) that <hi>Encloſing</hi> is an <hi>Improvement:</hi> and ſo concerning <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax</hi>; I ſay, if they were once accuſtomed to ſow them, they would never leave it, as I ſee <hi>Farmers</hi> do in <hi>Eaſt-Kent</hi>;

The charitable deeds of our forefathers, ought to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after, that they be not miſplaced, as uſually they are, but be really beſtowed for the good of the poor, that are laborious, (as in <hi>London</hi> is begun) and if there be any that will not work, take Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> rule, who beſt knew what was beſt for them. I dare not adviſe to take it in part of <hi>Commons, Fens,</hi> &amp;c. and to improve them for this uſe, leſt I ſhould too much provoke the rude mercileſſe multitude. But to return to my diſcourſe. I ſay, that ſowing <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax,</hi> will be very benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the Owners of Land: for men uſually give in divers
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55779:27"/>
places 3 l. <hi>per</hi> Acre, to ſow Hemp and <hi>Flax</hi> (as I have ſeen at <hi>Maidſtone</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> which is the only place, I know in <hi>England</hi> where <hi>thread</hi> is made: and though nigh an hundred bands are imployed about it; yet they make not enough for this <hi>Nation</hi>) and yet get good profit. How advantageous will this be to thoſe who have drained the <hi>Fens,</hi> where queſtionleſſe <hi>Hemp</hi> will flouriſh, and exſiccate the ground: for <hi>Hemp</hi> deſireth ſtiff moiſt land, as <hi>Flax</hi> light and dry) and likewiſe to thoſe in the North of <hi>England,</hi> where land is very cheap? I hope in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time <hi>Ireland</hi> will furniſh us with theſe commodities, if we be idle; for there land is very cheap, and thoſe ſeeds need no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incloſure; for Cattle will not touch them, except Dear, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it fear the plunderer, either in the field or barn.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It's profitable to the ſower. I know that they uſually va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue an Acre at 10 or 12 l. which coſteth them uſually but half the money. Whether there be <hi>Flax</hi> that will yeild 30 or 40 l. <hi>per</hi> Acre as ſome report, I know not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To the place where it is ſown; becauſe it ſets many poor to work. I wiſh it were encouraged more in the North than it is; becauſe there are many poor, who could willingly take pains, and though <hi>ſpinning of linnen</hi> be but a poor work; yet it is light, and may be called <hi>Womens recreation,</hi> (and in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>beſt Citizens Wives</hi> think it no diſgrace to go about <hi>ſpinning</hi> with their <hi>Rocks</hi>) and though in ſome part the poor think it nothing to earn 4 or 6 d <hi>per</hi> day, and will as ſoon ſtand with their hands in their pockets, as work cheap; yet in the North they account it well to earn 3 d. or 4 d. by <hi>ſpinning,</hi> which they may do.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It would be very beneficial to this <hi>Nation,</hi> and ſave many thouſand pounds, I may ſay 100 thouſands, which are expected either in caſh, or good commodities; and we ſhould not be beholding to <hi>Holland</hi> for <hi>fine linnen</hi> and <hi>Cordage,</hi> nor to <hi>France</hi> for <hi>Poldavices, Locrams, Canvaſes, Nets,</hi> nor to <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> for <hi>thread:</hi> but might be ſupplyed abundantly with theſe neceſſary commodities even at our own doors.</p>
            <p>There is no ſmall <hi>Deficiency</hi> in dunging and manuring lands, both becauſe all that manner of manuring and amending lands,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55779:27"/>
is not known to every one,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>9.</hi> Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning dunging and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring Lands.</note> and alſo that they do not imploy all they know to the beſt uſe. I will therefore ſet down moſt of the wayes I have ſeen here in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>beyond Seas,</hi> by which Land is improved, and the beſt wayes to uſe the ſame.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To begin with <hi>Chalk,</hi> which is as old a way as <hi>Julius Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars</hi> time, as he himſelf reporteth in his <hi>Commentaries. Chalk</hi> is of two ſort.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>hard, ſtrong, dry Chalk,</hi> with which in <hi>Kent</hi> they make walls, burn lime, and make whiting for houſes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Kind is a <hi>ſmall unctuous Chalk:</hi> this is the <hi>Chalk</hi> for land, the other helpeth little; onely it maketh the Plough go eaſier in ſtiffe lands: broomy land is accounted the beſt land for <hi>Chalke</hi> and <hi>Lime,</hi> but it helpeth other lands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; eſpecially if you <hi>Chalke</hi> your ground, and let it lye a year or two, which is the way uſed in <hi>Kent</hi>; that it may be matured and ſhattered by the Sun and rain, otherwiſe if it be turned in preſently, it is apt to lye in great clods, as I have ſeen it twenty years after. <hi>Chalk</hi> alſo ſweetneth <hi>paſture,</hi> but doth not much increaſe it, and killeth <hi>ruſhes</hi> and <hi>broom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Lime,</hi> which is made of divers forts of <hi>ſtones,</hi> is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing for moſt <hi>Lands,</hi> and produceth a moſt pure grain: 160 buſhels is uſually laid on an Acre, but I ſuppoſe that if men did lay but half the dung on the ground, as they uſually do, as alſo <hi>Lime</hi> and <hi>Chalke,</hi> and <hi>Dung</hi> and <hi>Lime</hi> it oftener, it would be better <hi>Husbandry:</hi> for much <hi>dung</hi> cauſeth much <hi>weeds,</hi> and cauſeth <hi>Corn</hi> to lodge; and too much <hi>Chalk</hi> doth too much force the land, ſo that after ſome good crops, it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth barren many years. It's good <hi>Husbandry</hi> likewiſe to lay down lands before they be too much out of heart; for they will ſooner recover: otherwiſe not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Ordinary Dung,</hi> which every one knoweth; but let it not be expoſed to the Sun too much, nor let it lye in an high place: for the rain will waſte away it's fatneſs. It's obſervable, that earth the more it is expoſed to the Sun, it's the better; as we ſee that land is much bettered by oft ploughings: for the Sun
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55779:28"/>
and dew engender a <hi>nitrous</hi> fatneſſe, which is the cauſe of <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility</hi>; but dung is exhauſted by the Sun, as it appeareth by the <hi>folding</hi> of <hi>ſheep,</hi> which profit little, if it be not preſently turned in; therefore a <hi>Shepherd,</hi> if his time would permit, ſhould turn up the ground with an How for to ſow <hi>Turneps,</hi> as <hi>Gardiners</hi> do for to ſow. I have ſeen <hi>Ordinary Dung</hi> on dry lands in dry years to do hurt, and it oft cauſeth weeds and trumpery to grow.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Marle,</hi> It's of divers kinds: ſome ſtony, ſome ſoft, ſome white, ſome yellowiſh, but moſt commonly blew. It's in moſt places in <hi>England,</hi> but not known by all: the beſt marks to know it, is to expoſe it to the Aire, and to ſee if the Sun or Rain cauſe it to ſhatter, and break in ſquare pieces like dice, and if it be <hi>unctuous,</hi> or rather to take a load or two, and lay it on the midſt of your fields, and to try how it mendeth your lands. It's excellent for <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Paſture,</hi> eſpecially on dry lands. In <hi>Eſſex</hi> the ſcouring of their ditches they call <hi>Marle,</hi> becauſe it looketh blew like it, it helpeth their lands well.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Snaggreet:</hi> which is a kind of earth taken out of the <hi>Rivers,</hi> full of ſmall ſhels. It helpeth the barren lands in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts of <hi>Surrey.</hi> I believe it's found in all <hi>Rivers</hi>; It were well, if in other parts of <hi>England,</hi> they did take notice of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Owſe</hi> out of Marſh ditches, hath been found very good for white <hi>Chalky</hi> land: as alſo <hi>Sea-mud</hi> and <hi>Sea-Owſe</hi> is uſed in divers parts of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Suſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Sea-weeds</hi> of all ſorts rotted.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Mr. <hi>Carew</hi> in his <hi>Survey</hi> of <hi>Cornwall</hi> relateth, that they uſe a fat <hi>Sea-ſand,</hi> which they carry up many miſes in ſacks, and by this they have very much improved their barren lands. It were worth the while to try all manner of <hi>Sea-ſands:</hi> for I ſuppoſe, that in other places they have a like <hi>fertilizing</hi> fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Folding</hi> of <hi>Sheep,</hi> eſpecially after the <hi>Flaunders</hi> manner, <hi>(viz.)</hi> under a covert, in which earth is ſtrawed about 6 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches thick, on which they ſet divers nights: then more earth muſt be brought and ſtrawed 6 inches thick, and the <hi>Sheep
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55779:28"/>
folded</hi> on it, and thus they do continually <hi>Winter</hi> and <hi>Summer.</hi> I ſuppoſe a ſhepheard, with one horſe, will do it at his ſpare hours, and indeed ſooner then remove his <hi>fold</hi>; and this <hi>fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is to be continued, eſpecially in <hi>Winter,</hi> and doth the <hi>ſheep</hi> good; becauſe they lye warm and dry: and truly if I am not miſtaken, by this means we may make our <hi>ſheep</hi> to enrich all the barren dry lands of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Aſhes</hi> of any kind, <hi>Sea-cole-aſhes</hi> with <hi>Horſe-dung,</hi> the Gardiners of <hi>London</hi> much commend for divers uſes. It's great pitty, that ſo many thouſand loads are thrown into waſt places, and do no good.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Soot</hi> is alſo very good, being ſprinkled on <hi>ground,</hi> but it's too dear, if it be of <hi>wood:</hi> for it's worth 16 d or 2 s a buſhel.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>Pigeons</hi> or <hi>Hens-dung</hi> is incomparable: one load is worth 10 loads of other <hi>dung,</hi> &amp; therefore it's uſually ſown on <hi>Wheat,</hi> that lyeth afar off, and not eaſie to be helped: it's extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary likewiſe on a <hi>Hop-Garden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. <hi>Mault-duſt</hi> is exceedingly good in <hi>Corn-land: blood</hi> for <hi>trees</hi>; alſo <hi>ſhavings of horns,</hi> which are carried many miles from <hi>London</hi> for this purpoſe, as alſo the duſt of mault.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Some commend very much the <hi>ſweeping</hi> of a <hi>ſhip</hi> of <hi>ſalt,</hi> or <hi>droſſy ſalt</hi> and <hi>brine:</hi> it's very probable; becauſe it killeth the worms, and all <hi>fertility</hi> proceedeth from <hi>ſalt.</hi> At <hi>Nant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> they uſe the droſs or refuſe of <hi>ſalt</hi> for their Meadows with very good ſucceſs.</p>
            <p n="15">15. I have ſeen in <hi>France,</hi> poor men cut up <hi>Heath,</hi> and the <hi>Turf</hi> of the ground, and lay them on an heap, to make <hi>mould</hi> for their barren lands. <hi>Brakes</hi> laid in a moiſt place, and rotted, are uſed much for <hi>Hop-Grounds,</hi> and generally all things that will rot, if they were ſtones, would make <hi>dung.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="16">16. In <hi>New-England</hi> they <hi>fiſh</hi> their ground, which is done thus: In the <hi>ſpring</hi> about <hi>April,</hi> there cometh up a <hi>fiſh</hi> to the freſh <hi>Rivers,</hi> called an <hi>Alewife</hi>; becauſe of its great belly: and is a kind of <hi>Shade,</hi> full of bones; theſe are caught in wiers, and ſold very cheap to the Planters, who uſually put one or two cut in pieces into the hill where their Corn
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55779:29"/>
is planted, called <hi>Virginia-Wheat,</hi> for they plant it in hills, 5 Grains in an hill, almoſt as we plant <hi>Hops,</hi> (in <hi>May,</hi> or <hi>June:</hi> for it will not endure Froſts) and at that diſtance; it cauſeth fertility extraordinary for two years, eſpecially the firſt: for they have had fifty or ſixty buſhels on an Acre, and yet plough not their Land, and in the ſame Hills doe plant the ſame Corn for many years together, and have good Crops: beſides abundance of <hi>Pompions,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Kidney beans.</hi> In the North parts of <hi>New-England,</hi> where the fiſher men live, they uſually <hi>fiſh</hi> their Ground with <hi>Cods-heads</hi>; which if they were in <hi>England</hi> would be better imployed I ſuppoſe that when <hi>ſprats</hi> be cheap, men might mend their <hi>Hop-grounds</hi> with them, and it would quit coſt: but the <hi>dogs</hi> will be apt to <hi>ſcrape</hi> them up, as they do in <hi>New-England,</hi> unleſs one of their legs be tyed up.</p>
            <p n="17">17. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</hi> In <hi>Holland</hi> they as carefully preſerve the <hi>Cowes <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> as the <hi>Dung</hi> to enrich their land: old <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine</hi> is excellent for the <hi>Roots</hi> of <hi>Trees.

            <p n="18">18. <hi>Woollen-rags,</hi> which <hi>Hartfort-ſhire</hi> men uſe much, and <hi>Oxford-ſhire,</hi> and many other places: they do very well in thin <hi>Chalky</hi> Land in <hi>Kent</hi> for two or three years.

            <p n="3">3. That when we lay downe Land for <hi>Meadow</hi> or <hi>Paſture,</hi> we doe not ſowe them with the Seeds of fine ſweet graſſe, <hi>Trefoils,</hi> and other excellent <hi>herbs.</hi> Concerning this you may read a large <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the <hi>Countrey-Farmer</hi>; for if the Land be rich, it will put forth <hi>weeds</hi> and trumpery, and perhaps a kind of ſoure graſſe little worth, if it be poor, ye ſhall have thiſtles, <hi>May-weed,</hi> and little or no graſſe, for a year or two. I know a Gentleman, who at my entreaty, ſowed with his <hi>Oats</hi> the bottome of his <hi>Hay-mow,</hi> and though his Land were worne out of heart, and naturally poor; yet he had that year not onely a Crop of <hi>Oats</hi>; but he might if it had pleaſed him, have mowen his graſſe alſo, but he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, which was well done, till the next year, that it might make a <hi>Turffe,</hi> and grow ſtronger. By this <hi>Husbandry</hi> Lands might be well improved, eſpecially if men did conſider the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of graſſes, which are ninety ſorts, and three and twenty of <hi>Trefoil:</hi> I know a place in <hi>Kent,</hi> which is a white <hi>Chalky Down,</hi> which ground is ſometimes ſown with Corn a year or two, and then it reſteth as long or longer: when it is laid down, it maintaineth many great <hi>Sheep</hi> and very luſty, ſo that they are even fit for the <hi>Butcher</hi>; and yet there doth ſcarce appear any thing that they can eat, which hath cauſed divers to wonder, as if they had lived on <hi>Chalk-ſtones:</hi> but I more ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the matter, throughly viewed the ground, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the ground naturally produceth a ſmall <hi>Trefoil</hi> which it ſeemeth is very ſweet and pleaſant; it's commonly called <hi>Trifolium luteum,</hi> or <hi>Lupilinum,</hi> that is, <hi>yellow,</hi> or <hi>Hop-Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foil:</hi> and I am perſwaded, if that the Seed of this <hi>Trefoil</hi> were preſerved, and ſowne with <hi>Oates,</hi> when they intend to lay it down, it would very much advance the <hi>Paſture</hi> of that place; therefore I deſire all <hi>Ingenious</hi> men, ſeriouſly to conſider the nature of the <hi>Trefoils,</hi> which are the ſweeteſt of graſſes, and to obſerve on what grounds they naturally grow: and alſo the nature of other graſſes, which (as I have ſaid before) are no leſs then ninety ſorts, naturally growing in this Iſle; ſome on

watry places, ſome on dry, ſome on clay, others on ſand, chalk, &amp;c. Some on fruitful places, others in barren; by the which means, I ſuppoſe a ſolid foundation might be laid, for the advancing of <hi>Paſture</hi>-lands of all ſorts, through this <hi>Iſland?</hi> for I know ſome plants, as the <hi>Orchis</hi> call'd <hi>Bee-flower,</hi> &amp;c. which will thrive better on the <hi>Chalky</hi> barren banks, then in any Garden, though the Mould be never ſo rich and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and the Gardiner very diligent in cheriſhing of it: and why may not the ſame propriety be in graſſes? for we ſee diverſe <hi>beuty</hi> graſſes to thrive, eſpcially on barren places, where ſcarce any thing elſe will grow.

I dare not ſay this is true; but hope if it be ſo, that it will be mended. For of late much hath been done for the advancement of theſe kinds of land; yet there are as yer great <hi>Deficiencies.</hi> In the times of <hi>Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</hi> all in this <hi>Iſland</hi> were either <hi>Souldiers</hi> or <hi>Scholars: Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> by reaſon of the great honours, priviledges, and profits, (the third part of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> belonging to them) and <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,</hi> becauſe of the many and great Wars with <hi>France, Scotland, Ireland, Wales.</hi> And in thoſe times <hi>Gentlemen</hi> thought it an honour to be careleſſe, and to have <hi>Houſes, Furniture, Diet, Exerciſes, Apparel,</hi> &amp;c. yea all things at home and abroad, Souldier-like: <hi>Muſick, Pictures, Perfumes, Sawces,</hi> (unleſſe good ſtomacks) were counted, perhaps unjuſtly, too effeminate.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55779:33"/>
That God hath given us ſuch a fruitful land, that without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour we have plenty:<note place="margin">Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of Engliſh Laws.</note> whereas <hi>France</hi> muſt dig and delve for what they have. And I ſuppoſe, that I could maintaine two things which are thought great <hi>Paradoxes, (viz.)</hi> that it were no loſſe to this <hi>Iſland,</hi> if that we ſhould not plough at all, if ſo be that we could certainly have Corn at a reaſonable rate, and likewiſe vent for all our <hi>Manufactures</hi> of <hi>Wool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe that the Commodities from Cattel are far more ſtable then Corn: for <hi>Cloths, Stuffs, Stockins, Butter, Cheeſe, Hides, Leather, Skins, Wool, Tallow,</hi> are certaine even every where: Corne ſcarcely in any place, conſtantly in none.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Paſture</hi> imployeth more hands, which is the ſecond <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox:</hi> and therefore <hi>Paſture</hi> doth not <hi>depopulate,</hi> as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid: for <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Picardy</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> where there are <hi>Paſtures</hi> in a good meaſure, are as populous as any part of <hi>France</hi>; and I am certaine, that <hi>Holland, Friezeland, Zealand, Flaunders,</hi> and <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which rely altogether on <hi>Paſtures,</hi> are the moſt populous places in <hi>Europe.</hi> But ſome will object and ſay, that a ſhepherd and a dog formerly hath deſtroyed divers Villages. To this I anſwer, that we well know what a ſhepherd and a dog can do, <hi>(viz)</hi> look to two or three hundred ſheep at the moſt, and that two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Acres will maintain them, or the land is extreamly bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren; and that theſe two or three hundred Acres being bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, will ſcarcely maintain a Plough, (which is but one man and two boyes,) with the horſes: and that the <hi>mowing, reaping,</hi> and <hi>threſhing</hi> of this Corne, and other Work about, will ſcarcely maintaine three more with work through the whole year. But how many people may be imployed by the <hi>Wool</hi> of two or three hundred <hi>Sheep,</hi> in <hi>Picking, Sorting, Carding, Spinning, Weaving, Dying, Fulling, Knitting,</hi> I leave to others to calculate. And further if the <hi>Paſtures</hi> be rich <hi>Meadows,</hi> and go on <hi>dai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing,</hi> I ſuppoſe all know, that an hundred Acres of ſuch land imployeth more hands then 100 Acres of the beſt Corr-Land in <hi>England,</hi> and produceth like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55779:33"/>
better exportable Commodities. And further, if I ſhould grant, that formerly the ſhepherd and his dog did <hi>depopulate,</hi> that I may not condemn the wiſdom of former Ages; yet I will deny, that it doth ſo now: for formerly we were ſo unwiſe, as to ſend over our <hi>Wool</hi> to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and other places, where they were <hi>Manufactured</hi>; by which means one pound oft brought ten <hi>unwrought</hi> to them; but we ſet now our own poor to work, and ſo ſave the <hi>depopulation.</hi> Yet I ſay, it's convenient to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Plough; becauſe that we cannot have a certainty of Corn, and carriage is dear both by ſea and land, eſpecially into the <hi>Inland-Countreys,</hi> and our Commodities by <hi>Wool</hi> do cloy the Merchants.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Ruſhy</hi>-lands. <hi>Blith</hi> telleth us good Remedies for theſe <hi>Inconveniences, (viz.) making deep trenches, oft-mowings, Chalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Liming, Dunging</hi> and <hi>Ploughing.</hi> I know where hungry gueſts Horſes ſoon make an end of them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Furze, Broom, Heath,</hi> theſe can hardly be ſo deſtroyed, but at length they will up again; for God hath given a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar propriety to every kind of earth, to produce ſome peculiar kinds of Plants, which it will obſerve even to the Worlds end, unleſſe by <hi>Dung, Marle, Chalk,</hi> you alter even the very nature of the earth. In <hi>Gallitia</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> where ſuch barren lands do very much abound, they do thus: firſt, they grub them up as clean as they can; of the greater Roots and Branches they make fire-wood; the ſmaller ſticks are either imployed in fencing, or elſe are burnt on the ground; afterwards the Land being ploughed twice at leaſt, they ſowe <hi>Wheat,</hi> and uſually the Crop is great, which the <hi>Land-lord</hi> and <hi>Tenant</hi> divide according to a compact; then the ground reſteth, and in three or four years, the <hi>Furze</hi> or <hi>Brooms</hi> will recover their former growth, which the painfull <hi>Husbandman</hi> grubbeth, and doeth with it as formerly. I ſet this down, that you may ſee how laborious the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is in ſome places, the poverty of the Countrey compelling him to it.</p>
            <p n="7">7. There are other <hi>Inconveniences</hi> in the Land, beſides weeds
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55779:34"/>
and trumpery (<hi>viz.) Ill Tenures,</hi> as <hi>Copy-hold, Knight-ſervice,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that the <hi>Poſſeſſour</hi> cannot cut any Timber down, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſent of the <hi>Lord</hi>; and when he dyes muſt pay one or two years rent, perhaps more; becauſe there is no certaine Fine, but is at the Land-Lords mercy. But theſe are not in the power of the poor <hi>Husbandman</hi> to remedy; I therefore paſſe them by: yet hope that in little time we ſhall ſee theſe <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences remedied:</hi> becauſe they much diſcourage <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and are (as I ſuppoſe) <hi>Badges</hi> of our <hi>Norman</hi> ſlavery.</p>
            <p>To conclude, It ſeemeth to me very reaſonable, and it will be a great encouragement to laborious men, to <hi>improve</hi> their barren lands, if that they ſhould have recompence for what they have done, according as indifferent men ſhould judg, when they leave it, as is the cuſtome in <hi>Flaunders.</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ncies</hi> in <hi>Woods,</hi> which I ſhall briefly declare, with the beſt way to <hi>remedy</hi> the ſame.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's a great <hi>fault,</hi> that <hi>generally</hi> through the <hi>Iſland</hi> the <hi>Woods</hi> are deſtroyed; ſo that we are in many places very much neceſſitated both for fuel, and alſo for timber for building, and other uſes; ſo that if we had <hi>Coals</hi> from <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and <hi>Boards</hi> from <hi>Norwey, Clap-boards, Barrel-ſtaves, Wainſcot,</hi> and <hi>Pipe-ſtaves,</hi> from <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> we ſhould be brought to great extremity: and many <hi>Mechanicks</hi> would be neceſſitated to leave their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Deficiency,</hi> is that our <hi>Woods</hi> are not ordered as they ſhould be; but though <hi>Woods</hi> ſhould be eſpecially preſerved for timber, for building and ſhipping; yet at this time it's very rare to ſee a good <hi>Timber-tree</hi> in a <hi>Wood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That many of our <hi>Woods</hi> are very thin, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with ſuch ſorts of <hi>Woods,</hi> as are convenient for the place.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That we ſell continually, and never plant or take care for poſterity.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Deficiencies</hi> may be thus <hi>Remedyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To put in execution the <hi>Statutes</hi> againſt <hi>grubbing of Woods,</hi> which are ſufficiently ſevere. It's well known, we have good
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55779:34"/>
Laws; but it's better known, they are not executed. In the <hi>Wilde of Kent,</hi> and <hi>Suſſex,</hi> which lies far from the <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> and formerly have been nothing but <hi>Woods,</hi> liberty is granted for men to grub what they pleaſe; for they cannot want firing for themſelves, and they are ſo ſeated, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fire-wood, nor timber can be tranſported elſewhere. I know a <hi>Gentleman</hi> who proffered there good <hi>Oak-timber</hi> at 6 s. 8 d. <hi>per</hi> tun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Land in thoſe parts in general is very good. About <hi>Tunbridge</hi> there is Land which formerly was <hi>Wood,</hi> is now let for 30 s. <hi>par</hi> Acre; ſo that to keep ſuch lands for <hi>Wood,</hi> would be both loſſe to the <hi>owner,</hi> and to the <hi>Iſland:</hi> But in other parts of the <hi>Iſland</hi> it is otherwiſe, and men are much to be blamed for deſtroying both timber and fuel. I have ſeen at <hi>Shooters-hill</hi> near <hi>London,</hi> ſome <hi>Woods</hi> ſtubbed up which were good ground for <hi>Wood,</hi> but now are nothing but <hi>furze,</hi> which is a great loſſe both to the <hi>owner,</hi> and to tbe <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</hi> For the Land is made worſe then it was formerly. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there are Lands, which are as naturally ordained for <hi>Woods, viz. Mountainous, Craggy, uneven-land,</hi> as <hi>ſmall hills</hi> for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he <hi>Vines</hi> and <hi>Olives; plain lands</hi> for <hi>Corn</hi>; and <hi>low moiſt lands</hi> for <hi>Paſture:</hi> which lands if they be ſtubbed, do much preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the <hi>Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That all <hi>Woods</hi> ſhould have ſuch a Number of Timber-trees <hi>per</hi> Acre, according to the <hi>Statute.</hi> There is a good Law for that purpoſe, but men delude both themſelves and the law, that they every <hi>Felling</hi> cut down the <hi>ſtanders,</hi> which they left the <hi>felling</hi> before, leſt perchance they ſhould grow to be <hi>Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and leave twelve ſmall <hi>Standers,</hi> that they might ſeem to fulfil in ſome meaſure the <hi>Statute</hi>; but it's a meer falacy; and cauſeth the <hi>Statute</hi> to fail of it's principal end, which is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Timber.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="2">2. Our <hi>Honey</hi> is the beſt in the World, and <hi>Wax</hi> a ſtable Commodity.

Now I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, how it cometh to paſſe that there is ſo great ſtore of <hi>Honey</hi> in <hi>Muſcovia,</hi> conſidering the Winters are extream cold, and alſo very long: and I am credibly informed that firſt, the Spring when it beginneth, cometh extraordinary faſt, that the dayes are very long, and the Summers far dryer then ours here in <hi>England,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Bees</hi> are not hindered by continual <hi>ſhowers</hi>; as they are ſome years here in this <hi>Iſle:</hi> And laſtly, that the Countrey aboundeth much with <hi>Firs,</hi> and <hi>Pine-trees:</hi> which the Inhabitants uſually cut, that the <hi>Gum, Roſinous,</hi> or <hi>Turpentine</hi> ſubſtance may ſweat forth, to which places the <hi>Bees</hi> do come, and preſently fill themſelves, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn laden: and perhaps for theſe very reaſons, <hi>Bees</hi> thrive very much in <hi>New-England.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. We are <hi>Deficient</hi> in the ordering of them.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55779:39"/>
eſpecially the latter, hath written ſo exactly, and upon his own experience that little can be added to it: onely in a point or two I differ from him; of the which I will ſpeak briefly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we muſt take and deſtroy all the <hi>Bees</hi> for their <hi>Honey,</hi> and not drive them, as they do in <hi>Italy</hi> once or twice yearly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That if a <hi>Swarme</hi> be poor with little <hi>Honey,</hi> that that <hi>Swarme</hi> ought to be taken, becauſe it is poor; ſo that the rich ſtocks are deſtroyed, becauſe they be rich, and the poor Swarmes, becauſe they be poor: ſo that be they rich or be they poor, they muſt be deſtroyed. An <hi>Italian</hi> reporteth, that in the City of <hi>Askaly,</hi> there was a Law made, that none ſhould deſtroy a <hi>Swarme</hi> of <hi>Bees,</hi> unleſſe he had a juſt cauſe; accounting it a part of extream injuſtice and cruelty, to take away without cauſe, both the goods and lives of ſuch good and faithfull ſervants. I am credibly informed, that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman beyond the Seas, getteth many an hundred pound yearly, by keeping <hi>Bees</hi> after a new and Ingenious Manner, which is thus. He hath a room made very warm and cloſe; yet with Glaſſe-windows, which he can open at his pleaſure, to let the <hi>Bees</hi> fly abroad when he pleaſeth, where he keepeth his <hi>Bees,</hi> and feedeth them all Winter; with a <hi>ſweet Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> made of <hi>Moloſſoes, Flowers, ſweet Wine, Milk, Raiſins,</hi> &amp;c. (for with ſuch things as theſe, they uſually feed <hi>Bees</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi>) and often times in Summer, when the weather is rainy, windy, or ſo diſpoſed, that the <hi>Bees</hi> cannot conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently go abroad, he feedeth them at home with divers ſweet things, and gathereth divers flowers, and layeth them amongſt them, and ſticketh up many freſh boughs in divers places of his Rooms, that in <hi>ſwarming-time,</hi> they may ſettle on them; by theſe means he preſerveth all his Swarms, and gathereth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible quantity of <hi>Honey</hi> and <hi>wax</hi>; and truly this way ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be very profitable: for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We know the <hi>Bees,</hi> (even as we ſay of the <hi>Aunts</hi>) will work continually, even night and day, Winter and Summer,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55779:40"/>
if that they were not hindered by darkneſſe, cold, and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>Bees</hi> do not only make <hi>Honey,</hi> (for I ſuppoſe, that they have a peculiar propriety of making <hi>Honey,</hi> as the <hi>Silk-worms Silk</hi>) out of <hi>Mildews</hi> or <hi>Honey,</hi> but alſo out of all ſweet things, as <hi>Sugar, Moloſſoes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That many ſweet things may be had far cheaper then <hi>Honey</hi>; which (I ſuppoſe) the <hi>Bees</hi> will tranſmute into perfect <hi>Honey.</hi> This way, I conceive, would be very advantageous to us in <hi>England,</hi> for the preſerving of <hi>late ſwarms,</hi> and alſo for the enriching of <hi>old ſtocks,</hi> ſo that we need not deſtroy them, but might drive them from <hi>hive</hi> to <hi>hive,</hi> and ſet them to work again; and truly I think there is no place in the World ſo convenient for this purpoſe as <hi>England</hi>; becauſe that though our Winters be long, yet they are not very cold; but <hi>Bees</hi> would be ſtirring in them: and further our Summers are ſo ſubject to winds and rains, that many times there is ſcarce a fine day in a whole Week: and further <hi>Moloſſoes, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe-Sugar, Sweet-Woort, Milk,</hi> &amp;c. may be had at reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable rates.</p>
            <p>I hope ere long to give an exact account of this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deſire thoſe who have any Ingenuities in this kind, freely to communicate them. I have not obſerved many things more of importance concerning <hi>Bees</hi> in my travels; onely in <hi>Italy</hi> they make their <hi>Hives</hi> of <hi>thin boards,</hi> ſquare in two ar three partitions, ſtanding either above one another, or very cloſe ſide to ſide, by the which means, they can the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter borrow part of their <hi>honey</hi> when they pleaſe. In <hi>Germany</hi> their <hi>hives</hi> are made of ſtraw, to the which they have a ſummer-door, as they call it, which is nigh the top of the <hi>Hive,</hi> that the <hi>Bees</hi> when they are laden, may the more eaſily enter and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves of their burthens.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are to blame, that we do not imploy our <hi>Honeys</hi> in making <hi>Metheglin:</hi> It's true, that in <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> there is ſome quantity of this liquor made; but for want of good cookery it's of little worth; but uſually of a browne
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55779:40"/>
colour, of an unpleaſant taſte: and as I ſuppoſe common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made of the <hi>refuſe honey, wax, dead Bees,</hi> and ſuch ſtuffe, as they ordinarily make it elſe-where: for the good houſe-wife thinks any thing good enough for this purpoſe; and that it is pity to ſpoyl good <hi>Honey</hi> by making <hi>Mead:</hi> but I know that if one take <hi>pure neat Honey,</hi> and ingeniouſly clarifie and ſcum and boyl it, a liquour may be made not inferiour to the beſt <hi>Sack, Muskadine,</hi> &amp;c. in colour like to <hi>Rock-water,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ill odour or ſavour; ſo that ſome curious Pallats have called it <hi>Vin-Greco, rich and racy Canary,</hi> not knowing what name to give it for it's excellency. This would bring very great <hi>Profit,</hi> not onely to the <hi>Publique,</hi> by ſaving many a thouſand pound disburſed for <hi>Wines</hi> through all the world; but would be very advantageous to private families, who uſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain their friends very nobly, <hi>Wines</hi> being at preſent intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably dear and naught; I hope therefore ere long to ſee it put in execution. An excellent drink not much unlike this may be made of <hi>Sugar, Moloſſoes, Raiſins,</hi> &amp;c. of the which I have already ſpoken, yet think it fit to put you in mind of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>

I ſuppoſe this <hi>Silk-worme</hi> of <hi>Virginia</hi> is produced by the corruption of the <hi>Mulberry-tree,</hi> as <hi>Cochin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal,</hi> from <hi>Ficus Indica,</hi> or <hi>Indian-figtree</hi>: for ſome ingenious &amp; curious men who have ſtrictly obſerved the generation of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects,</hi> do find that every Plant hath an <hi>Inſect</hi> which groweth
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55779:41"/>
out of its corruption, (as divers ſorts of lice from <hi>Animals</hi>) and that theſe <hi>Inſects</hi> do uſually feed on that Plant, out of which they were made, as <hi>Lice</hi> on the ſame <hi>Animals</hi> from whence they were engendred. I know a Gentleman here in <hi>London,</hi> who hath three or four hundred <hi>Inſects,</hi> and can give a very good account of their original feedings.<note place="margin">Maſter Marſhal.</note> And alſo Mr. <hi>Moriney</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> hath a large Book of the ſame ſubject. But to return to our purpoſe: I ſay that we had <hi>Silkworms</hi> firſt from <hi>Perſia.</hi> In <hi>Juſtinian's</hi> time about 1000 or 1100 years ago, ſome Monks preſented a few to him at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>; where in his time they began to plant <hi>Mulberies:</hi> from thence it came to <hi>Italy,</hi> about three or four hundred years ſince: for the <hi>Auncient Writers</hi> of <hi>Husbandry,</hi> as <hi>Cato, Pallad, Columell,</hi> do not ſo much as mention theſe creatures: and at length theſe have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over the Mountains into <hi>France</hi> within an hundred years; where they flouriſh ſo much, that if we will believe our own <hi>Authours,</hi> they bring greater profit then the <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Corn</hi> of that large <hi>Countrey.</hi> But be it ſo or no, I know that <hi>France</hi> hath <hi>Silk</hi> enough to maintain their exceſſe of apparel, and to export <hi>Pluſhes, Velvets,</hi> &amp;c. Now then if that theſe worms can thrive, not onely in the parched <hi>Perſia,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Greece, Italy,</hi> yea in <hi>France</hi>; which differeth not much from the temper of <hi>England</hi>; why ſhould we think, that they are confined to that place, and muſt move no further Northward? for they have come many an hundred miles towards the <hi>North,</hi> why not one hundred or two more? And further we ſee that <hi>Mulberries,</hi> which is their food, thrive here as well as in any place. But ſome will object, that our Air is too cold and moiſt. To which I anſwer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That thoſe who write of <hi>Silkworms,</hi> ſay, that you muſt take heed, that you make not the place too hot: for too much heat may deſtroy; and therefore that you muſt ſet the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows open to let in the cold Aire.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We know, that Moiſtneſſe of Aire rather increaſeth <hi>Inſects,</hi> and nouriſheth them. Indeed if Moiſture hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it's becauſe that it too much corrupteth their food, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55779:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cauſeth a flux amongſt them: but this is eaſily prevented, as I ſhall ſhew you anon. But to be ſhort, it is not onely my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that <hi>Silkworms</hi> will thrive here, but the ſolid judgement of King <hi>James,</hi> and his Council, confirmeth the ſame: as you may ſee by his letter to the <hi>Deputy-Lievtenants</hi> of every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; wherein alſo many weighty reaſons are contained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince men of the ſame, which Letter followeth anon, with the Inſtructions for the increaſe and planting of <hi>Mulberry-Trees.</hi> Printed by <hi>Eliaz. Edgar,</hi> in the year 1609.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We find by experience, that <hi>Silk-worms</hi> will thrive here, and therefore the matter is out of queſtion: for divers <hi>Ladies, Gentlewomen, Scholars, Citizens,</hi> &amp;c. have nurſed up divers worms to perfection, though they have had little skill in the managing of them; and likewiſe not ſuch accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as are neceſſary for them; and more would they have done, if they could have had <hi>Mulberry-leaves.</hi> I am informed that one near <hi>Charing-Croſſe</hi> maketh a good living by them: as alſo another by <hi>Ratliff-Croſſe</hi>; yea, even in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> at <hi>Duckenfield</hi> they thrive &amp; proſper. And therfore if we can bring up 100, why not 1000, yea, 100000, if we had food for them? Truly, I know no reaſon to the contrary, neither could I ever find one that could ſpeak any thing to the purpoſe againſt the buſineſſe. And further I muſt tell you, that the ordering of this <hi>worme</hi> is very eaſie, none need to be bound Prentiſe to the trade; the ſpecial buſineſſe is to be carefull in feeding them, and keeping them ſweet; which things children uſe to do.

            <p>Firſt, Endeavour to get ſtore of <hi>Mulberry-trees,</hi> which are of two ſorts, the <hi>white</hi> and the <hi>black.</hi> The <hi>white</hi> groweth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and hath a fine leafe, and ſweeteſt, and therefore fitteſt for the young worms. This is eaſily propagated by <hi>Slips,</hi> as <hi>Quinces, Codlings.</hi> The <hi>Black-Mulberry</hi> is difficultly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by <hi>Slips</hi>; but muſt be raiſed from <hi>Seeds,</hi> ſown either at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> when the <hi>Mulberries</hi> are eaten: or kept in dry ſand till the Spring; and then ſowe or howe them in, as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55779:42"/>
other ſeeds and ſtones, and muſt be diligently weeded. This groweth not to be ſo great a Tree as the former: the leaves are rougher and harſher, and fitteſt for the greater worms. When they are ſtrong and ready to ſpin, when your Trees are grown to a good bigneſſe, you may plant them forth, as is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done for <hi>Walks</hi> or <hi>Orchards,</hi> or in waſte places, as they do in <hi>Italy,</hi> (for the <hi>Fruit</hi> is little worth, only the <hi>Leaves</hi> are uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,) where I have ſeen the Trees as bare of leaves at Mid-ſummer as at Mid-winter. There are two ſorts of <hi>Silk-worms,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> and <hi>Calabrian.</hi> The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> is the ſmaller and more tender, and maketh a finer ſilk. The <hi>Calabrian</hi> is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more hardy, and maketh more Silk, but coarſer. This ſort ſeemeth to be the beſt for this <hi>Countrey.</hi> When the <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry-trees</hi> begin to bud, take the <hi>egs</hi> of your <hi>Silk-wormes,</hi> and lay them on a piece of <hi>ſtuffe</hi> or <hi>Say,</hi> (ſome uſe to <hi>Bathe</hi> them firſt in warme <hi>Malmſy,</hi> and ſay that it maketh them ſtronger,) and carry them about you in the day in a <hi>Box,</hi> in the night lay them under your <hi>Bed,</hi> or in a warme <hi>Oven,</hi> till the wormes begin to come forth, then lay a piece of paper of the wideneſſe of the Pox, cut full of holes on them, and on the paper lay <hi>Mulberry-leaves,</hi> and as faſt as they hatch they will crawle forth, and ſtick to the <hi>Mulberry-leaves</hi>; which remove into other <hi>Boxes,</hi> till all be hatched: then when they paſt their ſecond ſickneſſe, feed them on <hi>ſhelves</hi> two foot broad, and eighteen inches one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the Roome where you keepe your Wormes, muſt neither be a low place, nor nigh the tiles; but a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Roome, warme and dry, yet ſometimes a little cold Aire is good.</p>
            <p>Take heed of <hi>Rats</hi> and <hi>Mice,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Hens, Robinred-breſts, Sparrows,</hi> and other birds; for they will eat them.</p>
            <p>They have four <hi>Sickneſſes,</hi> the firſt twelve dayes after they are hatched; and from that time at the end of every eight days: their ſickneſſe laſteth two or three dayes, and then they are to be fed but very little.</p>
            <p>The whole time that the wormes do feed, is about nine
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55779:42"/>
weeks: feed them twice daily at leaſt: at the firſt when they are ſmall, give them a few leaves; and as they grow greater, more, and feed them oftner. Let your leaves be dry and well aired upon a Table or Cloth before you give them; and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not your leaves, till the dew be off; and in dry ſeaſons, if you can poſſibly, you may keep your leaves gathered three or four dayes, or longer.</p>
            <p>Keep your <hi>ſhelves</hi> and <hi>boxes</hi> very clean: but take heed you touch not your wormes with your hands, when you remove them; but move them not when they are ſick.</p>
            <p>In cold moiſt weather, ſet a <hi>Pan</hi> of <hi>Coals</hi> in the Room, and burn a little <hi>Benjamin, Juniper,</hi> &amp;c. eſpecially when they are young, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the firſt five weeks; but afterwards, unleſſe it be extraordinary cold, give them Air, and keep them not too hot, and let the Room be well ſented with <hi>Herbs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let not your <hi>Wormes</hi> be too thick on the ſhelves: if any dye or be ſick, ſpeedily remove them, leſt they infect the reſt.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as by the clear Ambour-colour of your <hi>wormes,</hi> you perceive that they would ſpin; make <hi>Arches</hi> betwixt your ſhelves, with <hi>heath</hi> made clean, branches of <hi>Roſemary, Laven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> &amp;c. where the <hi>Worms</hi> will faſten themſelves, and make their <hi>bottoms</hi> in two or three dayes, and about twelve or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen days after will come forth; before which time, you muſt take away the <hi>bottome</hi> which you will uſe for <hi>Silk,</hi> and kill the worm within, by laying the <hi>bottoms</hi> in the ſun two or three days, or in an hot <hi>Oven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Bottom</hi> which you will keep for ſeed, lay in a warme place, till the <hi>worms</hi> come forth; which put on ſome pieces of old <hi>Say, Grogran, Velvet,</hi> made faſt to ſome wall: there they will engender, and the Male having ſpent himſelf falleth down and dyeth; ſo the Female, when ſhe hath laid her egs, which egs when they are <hi>gray,</hi> you may gently take them off with a knife, and keep them in a piece of <hi>Say</hi> in a dry place, till hatching time come.</p>
            <p>The winding of the <hi>Silk</hi> off the <hi>bottome</hi> requireth a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar wheel, which an <hi>Artificer</hi> muſt make: one pound and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55779:43"/>
two ounces of the bottom yieldeth from one ounce to three of <hi>Silk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An ounce of Spaniſh ſeed yieldeth ordinarily ſix, eight, or ten pound of <hi>Silk,</hi> and the <hi>worms</hi> will eat 250. <hi>li.</hi> of <hi>leaves:</hi> the <hi>Calabrian-worms</hi> being greater, do eat nigh 300. weight, and yeild eleven or twelve pound of <hi>Silk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, I deſire all men ſeriouſly to conſider, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage this buſineſs will bring to this <hi>Iſland,</hi> if it be brought to perfection. Truly I know nothing doth hinder the want of <hi>Mulberry-trees,</hi> which will in little ſpace come to a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable greatneſſe. And though I commend thoſe who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to advance this work in <hi>Plantations,</hi> and prefer it before Tobacco; yet I know that it cannot be for want of hands; whereas in <hi>England</hi> we have plenty of women, children, old folks, lame, decrepit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who are fit to be overſeers of this work. And I wonder Gentlemen do not go about a thing ſo pleaſant and profitable, (for three, four, or five at moſt, will attend as many <hi>wormes</hi> as will make forty or fifty pound worth of <hi>Silk</hi> in two or three months) and the <hi>worms</hi> eat only leaves, which are of no value: neither is there any conſiderable trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about the <hi>worms,</hi> unleſſe it be the 12 or 15 laſt days. I hope if that particular men will not endeavour to advance this work for their private profit, yet the <hi>States</hi> will for the <hi>Publique Good,</hi> it being the beſt way I know to ſet all the poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Widows, old and ſame people on work, and likewiſe will ſave this Nation many an hundred thouſand pounds <hi>per annum.</hi> And further, the way to accompliſh this work may be done without grievance to the Subiect, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to command every one to plant or ſow ſo many <hi>Mulberry-ſeeds,</hi> which may eaſily he procured from beyond Seas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I leave States-matters to States-men, I am none.</p>

And becauſe the buying of the ſaid plants at this rate may at the firſt ſeem chargeable to our ſaid Subjects, (whom we would be loth to burthen) we have taken order that in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April</hi> next, there ſhall be delivered at the ſaid place a good quantity of Mulberry-ſeeds, there to be ſold to ſuch as will buy them; by means whereof the ſaid plants will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered at a ſmaller rate then they can be afforded being carried from hence: having reſolved alſo in the mean time, that there ſhall be publiſhed in print a plain Inſtruction and Direction, both for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of the ſaid <hi>Mulberry-trees,</hi> the breeding of the <hi>Silk-worms,</hi> and all other things needfull to be underſtood, for the perfecting of a work every way ſo commendable and profitable, as well to the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as to thoſe that ſhall uſe the trade.

               <p>THe ground which ought to be appointed for this purpoſe, beſides the natural goodneſſe of it, muſt be reaſonably well dunged, and withal ſo ſcituated, as that the heat of the Sun may cheriſh it, and the nipping blaſts of either the North winde or the Eaſt, may not annoy it: the choice thereof thus made; that the ſeeds may the better proſper, and come up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they be ſown, you ſhall dig it two foot deep, breaking the clods as ſmall as may be, and afterward you ſhall divide the ſame into ſeveral Beds of not above five foot in breadth, ſo that you ſhall not need to endanger the plants by treading up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, when either you water or weed them.</p>
               <p>The Mulberry-ſeeds you ſhall lay in water for the ſpace of 22 hours, and after that you ſhall dry them again half dry, or ſomewhat more, that when you ſow them they may not cleave together: Thus done, you muſt caſt them upon the foreſaid Beds, not altogether ſo thick as you uſe to do other Garden-ſeeds, and then cover them with ſome fine earth (paſt through a Sive) about half an inch thick. In dry weather you ſhall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them every two days at the furtheſt, as likewiſe the plants that ſhall come of them: and keep them as clean from weeds as poſſibly you can.</p>
               <p>The time in which you ought to ſow them for your beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, is either in <hi>March, April,</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> when froſts are either altogether paſt, or at the leaſt not ſo ſharp, or of ſo long continuance, as to endanger their up-ſpring.</p>

               <p>WHen the leaves of Mulberry-trees begin a little to bud forth, take the Eggs of your Silk-worms, and lay them in a piece of Say, or ſuch like ſtuff, and in the day time carry them in ſome warm place about you, in a little ſafe box, but in the night either lay them in your bed, or between two warm pillows, until ſuch time as the Worms begin to come forth: then take a piece of paper of the wideneſſe of the ſaid box, and having cut it full of ſmall holes, lay it within the ſame upon the eggs, and upon that again ſome few Mulberry-leaves, to which the Worms as they are hatched, will continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally come. Theſe leaves with the Worms upon them, you muſt ſtill remove into other boxes, laying freſh leaves as well on thoſe that are removed as on the paper where the eggs are; and this is the courſe which muſt be duly kept and obſerved, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til ſuch times as all the Worms be come forth of their ſhels, ſtill keeping their boxes warm, as aforeſaid; but no longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout you, but until the Worms begin to come forth, out of which boxes you may ſafely take them, when once they have paſt their ſecond ſickneſſe, and feed them upon ſhelves of two two foot in breadth, and eighteen inches one above the other.</p>
               <p>The ſaid ſhelves are not to be placed in any ground-room, nor yet next unto the tiles, but in ſome middle room of your houſe which openeth upon the North and South, that you may the more conveniently give them either heat or aire, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the time and ſeaſon ſhall require. Beſides, you muſt not make them cloſe unto the Wals, but ſo as you may paſſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55779:47"/>
about them the better to look unto the Worms, and keep them from Rats and Mice, which otherwiſe might devour them. You muſt obſerve the times of their coming forth, and keep every one or two dayes hatching by themſelves, that you may the better underſtand their ſeveral ſickneſſes or ſleepings, which are four in the time of their feeding. The firſt commonly ſome twelve days after they are hatched, and from that time at the end of every eight days, according to the weather, and their good or ill uſage, during which time of every ſickneſſe, which laſteth two or three dayes, you muſt feed them but very little, as onely to relieve ſuch of them, as ſhall have paſt their ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before the reſt, and thoſe that ſhall not fall into their ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo ſoon.</p>
               <p>The whole time that the Worms do feed, is about nine weeks, whereof until they come unto their firſt ſickneſſe, give them young Mulberry-leaves twice every day, but few at a time, from thence until their ſecond ſickneſſe, twice every day in greater quantity; and ſo from their ſecond to their third ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, increaſing the quantity of the leaves, according as you perceive the Worms to grow in ſtrength, and clear of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: from the third until their fourth ſickneſſe, you may give them leaves thrice every day, and the fourth being paſt, you may let them have ſo many as they will eat, alwayes having a care that you give them none<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſuch as are dry, and well aired upon a Table or Cloth, before they be laid upon them, and withal gathered ſo near as may be; at ſuch times as either the Sun or Wind hath cleared them of the dew that falleth upon them.</p>
               <p>For the feeding of Worms you need obſerve no other order then this, lay the Mulberry-leaves upon them, and every two or three dayes remove them, and make clean their boxes, or ſhelves, unleſſe in times of their ſickneſſe, for then they are not to be touched: the leaves which you take from them when you give them freſh to feed upon, you muſt lay in ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place, and upon them a few new leaves, to which the Worms that lay hidden in the cold, will come, and then you may paſſe them with the ſaid new leaves to the reſt of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55779:47"/>
Worms: And now leſt any thing ſhould be omitted, which ſerves to perfect the diſcovery of ſo excellent a benefit, I will adviſe you to be very diligent in keeping clean their Boxes, or ſhelves, as being a ſpecial means whereby to preſerve them; wherefore when you intend to do it, you ſhall remove them together with the uppermoſt leaves whereon they lie, unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther boxes or ſhelves, for with your hands you may not touch them, till they have throughly undergone their third ſickneſs, and then may you paſſe them gently with clean hands, without doing them any harm: provided that the party that cometh near them ſmell not of Garlick, Onions, or the like. The firſt five weeks of their age you muſt be very carefull to keep them warm, and in time of rain or cold weather, to ſet in the room where they remain, a pan with coals burning in it, now and then ſome <hi>Juniper, Benjamin,</hi> and ſuch like, that yeildeth ſweet ſmells. But afterwards unleſſe in time of extraordinary cold, give them air, and take heed of keeping them too hot, being alwayes mindfull to ſtore the room with herbs and flowers which are delightful and pleaſing to the ſmell. As the worms increaſe in bigneſſe, you ſhall diſperſe them abroad upon more boards or ſhelves, and not ſuffer them to lie too thick together, and if you find any of them broken, or of a yellow gliſtering colour inclining to ſickneſſe, caſt them away, leſt they infect the reſt, and ſort ſuch as are not ſick, the greateſt and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt by themſelves, for ſo the leſſer will proſper the better.</p>

dayes after the worm beginneth to work them, you may take away; and thoſe which you are minded to uſe for the beſt ſilk, you muſt either preſently wind, or kill the worms which are within them, by laying the ſaid bottoms two or three days in the Sun, or in ſome Oven after the bread baked therein is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, and the fierceneſſe of the heat is alaid. The other bottoms which you intend to keep for ſeed, you muſt lay in ſome convenient warm place, untill the Worms come forth, which is commonly ſome ſixteen or twenty dayes from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their work: and as they do come forth you muſt put them together upon ſome piece of old <hi>Say; Grogeran,</hi> the backſide of old <hi>Velvet,</hi> or the like, made faſt againſt ſome wall, or hangings in your houſe.</p>
               <p>There they will ingender, and the Male having ſpent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, falleth down, and in ſhort time after dieth, as alſo doth the Female when ſhe hath laid her eggs, which eggs, when you perceive them upon the <hi>Say,</hi> or <hi>Grogeran,</hi> &amp;c. to be of a gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh colour, you may take them off gently with a knife, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put them in a piece of <hi>Say,</hi> or ſuch like, keep them in a covered box amongſt your woollen cloaths, or the like, till the year following: But not in any moiſt room, for it is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them, neither where there is too much heat, leſt the worms ſhould be hatched before you can have any food for them.</p>
               <p>The making of a Wheel, as likewiſe the way to winde the ſaid ſilk from the bottoms, can hardly be ſet down ſo plainly, as to be rightly underſtood: Wherefore when time ſhall ſerve, there ſhall be ſent into every County of this Kingdom, a wheel ready made, and a man that ſhall inſtruct all ſuch as are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to learn the uſe thereof:<note place="margin">

               <p>For there is no Countrey where they are ſuch ill Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but in ſome particular or other they excel: as we ſee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the ſeveral Counties of this Iſland, every County hath ſomething or other wherein they out-ſtrip their Neighbours. And that much profit may ariſe from hence in this Nation, is manifeſted by that excellent Treatiſe, which is publiſhed by you concerning the Husbandry of <hi>Flanders</hi>; wherein are brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down divers particulars very uſeful for us here in <hi>England,</hi> and formerly unknown.

which is a fruit as big &amp; as red as a Cherry, ripe only in the Winter, and growing cloſe to the ground in bogs, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe will grow? They are accounted very good againſt the Scurvy, and very pleaſant in Tarts. I know not a more excellent and healthfuller fruit.</p>
               <p>But ſome will object, that they will not grow here with us, our fore-fathers never uſed them. To theſe I reply, and ask them how they know? have they tryed? Idleneſſe never wants an excuſe; and why might not our fore-fathers upon the ſame ground, have held their hands in their pockets, and have ſaid, that Wheat and Barley would not have grown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us? and why ſhould not they have been diſcouraged from planting Cherries, Hops, Liquorice, Potatoes, Apricocks, Peaches, Melicotones, and from ſowing Rape-ſeeds, Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers, Great Clover, Canary-ſeeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and many more of this kind? and yet we know, that moſt of theſe have been brought to perfection, even in our days: for there is a viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in all things, and as many things are loſt which were known to our fore-fathers, as the Purple colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as you may read in <hi>Pancirol:</hi> ſo many things are found out by us, altogether unknown to them, and ſome things will be left for our poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For example, not to ſpeak of Gun-powder and Printing, nor of the New-world and the wonders there, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are but of a few hundred years ſtanding: I ſay twenty Ingenuities have been found even in our days, as Watches, Clocks, Way-wiſers, Chains for Fleas, divers Mathematical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, Short-writing, Microſcopes, by the which even the ſmalleſt things may be diſcerned, as the eggs, eyes, legs, and hair of a Mite in a Cheeſe: Likewiſe the Selenoſcope, which diſcovereth mountains in the Moon, divers Stars, and new Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, never ſeen till our days. But to return to our purpoſe, I ſay that in Husbandry it is even ſo; for the Ancients uſed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers plants which we know not; as the <hi>Cytiſus-tree,</hi> ſo much commended for Cattel; as alſo their <hi>Medick-fodder,</hi> which <hi>Colum</hi> ſaith endureth ten years, and may be mowen the four firſt years, ſeven times in a year, and one Acre he eſteemeth enough for three horſes.

ſweet and healthful, whereas the plants which are uſually call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Medicats</hi> with us, are annual plants, and have no ſuch rare proprieties. So we are ignorant what their <hi>Far</hi> or fine Bread Corn was, what their <hi>Lupine, Spury,</hi> and an hundred of this kind, as you may read in <hi>Mathiol.</hi> on <hi>Dioſcorides:</hi> ſo on the contrary, infinite are the Plants which we have, and they knew not, as well appeareth by their ſmall and our large Herbals: and daily new Plants are diſcovered, uſeful for Husbandry, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks and Phyſick; and therefore let no man be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from proſecuting new and laudable ingenuities. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire Ingenious Gentlemen and Merchants, who travel beyond Sea, to take notice of the Husbandry of thoſe parts <hi>(viz)</hi> what grains they ſow? at what times and ſeaſons? on what lands? how they plough their lands? how they dung and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them? what Cattel they uſe? and the commodities thereby? alſo what books are written of Husbandry, and ſuch like? and I intreat them earneſtly, not to think theſe things too low for them, and out of their callings; nay, I deſire them to count nothing trivial in this kind, which may be profitable to their Countrey, and advance knowledge.

The Oker Mines of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Gloceſterſhire</hi> are of great value, and ſo would others of that kind, if they could be found; ſo is the Black-lead Mine. Alſo the pits of Clay, Marle, Coale, Turffe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore I deſire all Country men to endeavour to know all ſorts of Stones, Clays, Earths, Oares, and to teach their Children the uſe of them, that they may know that this ſand is for building, this Loam is for Bricks, this Clay for Pots, this Marle for Corn-land: and if that they ſhall find any Stones, Earths, which they know not, that they would lay them up, till that they meet with ſome ingenious man, that can inform them. The richeſt Mines of the world have been found out by theſe means, if we will believe Hiſtories.

               <p>And the firſt Deficiency that I take notice of, is the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the ordinary ſeeds which are commonly ſown amongſt us: for uſually the Countrey-man contenteth himſelf with one or two ſorts, and knoweth no more, when as there are very great varieties; ſome of which agree with one ſort of ground, ſome with another: As for example, there are very many ſorts of Wheats, ſome called White Wheat, ſome Red Wheat, ſome Bearded; (which, as I have ſaid before, is not ſo ſubject to <hi>Mildews</hi> as others) others not: ſome ſorts with two rows, others with four, and ſix: ſome with one ear on a ſtalk, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with double ears, or two on the ſame ſtalk; Red-ſtalk Wheat of <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> Winter Wheat, Summer Wheat, which is ſown abundantly in <hi>New-England,</hi> in <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi>

and reaped ordinarily in three months; and many ſorts more. Not to trouble my diſcourſe with <hi>Spelt, Zea, Tiphine-Wheat,</hi> or <hi>Olew, Far, Sil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>go, Alica,</hi> which were uſed amongſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients; but now unknown not onely to the Countrey-man, but even to the learnedeſt <hi>Botanicks:</hi> ſo I may ſay that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Yeoman is ignorant of the diverſities of <hi>Barley's,</hi> for there is not onely the ordinary <hi>Barley,</hi> but big ſprat-Barley, which hath lately been ſown in <hi>Kent</hi> with good profit; alſo Winter-Barley ſowen in Winter, Barley with four, ſix rows, naked Barley, which require divers diſpoſitions in Land: ſome delighting in finer, others in ſtiffer grounds. So there is alſo Winter and Summer-Rie, and twenty ſorts of Peaſe, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Schew, the Raith or Early-ripe Peaſe, the Roncivals, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtivers, Hotarſes, Gray-Peaſe, Green-Peaſe, Peaſe without skins, Sugar-Peaſe, whoſe ſhels are ſweeter then the Peaſe it ſelf, and have been within theſe ten years plentifully ſowen in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire</hi> with profit; alſo <hi>Fulham, Sandwich</hi>-Peaſe, &amp;c. which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire divers ſorts of lands and ſeaſons: ſo alſo there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts of Oats, white, black, naked, which in <hi>New-England</hi> ſerveth well for Oatmel without grinding, being beaten as they come out of the Barn; <hi>Scotch, Poland,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo Buck-wheat, Lentiles; divers ſorts of Tares, of Hemp and Flax, altogether unknown to moſt Countrey-men, but I hope that hereafter they will be more inquiſitive after them: for divers of them may be of good uſe on their lands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Deficiency</hi> in this kind is, that they are ignorant of the Plants and Graſſes which naturally grow amongſt us, and their Uſes, which likewiſe were made for to be food for Cattel, and alſo for the ſervice of man. This ignorance cauſeth them to admire, and to eſteem even as miraculous, ordinary and trivial things; as for example, how it cometh to paſſe, that in one Meadow an Horſe thriveth very much and ſpeedily, and yet a Bullock will not in that place; and contrariwiſe in a Meadow cloſe by the former, the Bullock will thrive, and the Horſe not: ſo alſo how it cometh to paſs that Conies and Sheep will thrive well, where there is ſcarcely any paſture, and yet come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on Commons, where there is a greater quantity of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55779:53"/>
which proceedeth from this cauſe, that ſome kind of Plants are more agreeing and ſweeter to one ſort of Cattel then to another, and every Beaſt almoſt hath ſome Plant or other which they love exceedingly. I ſuppoſe, that the obſervances of this kind, might be very uſeful in Husbandry. Theſe <hi>Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> I will draw to three Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſay, that divers Plants (not to ſpeak of Fruits, becauſe we have already ſpoken of them) that grow naturally in our Iſland, may be very ſerviceable to the Husbandman, both for his Paſtures and Corn-lands. To inſtance in ſome few: we ſee that divers ſorts of wild Vetches, Chiches, Tares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> grow wild in divers places which though they bear not ſo great and large crops, as ſome others already uſed; yet who knoweth what they would do, if they were manured as other grains, and in land proper for them: for we ſee that the tranſplanting of plants into gardens, doth very much meliorate or better them; and without doubt all thoſe grains, which are in uſe with us, were at firſt picked out of the fields and woods; and by inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious men found uſeful for man and beaſt, and of late divers have been found not known to our fore-fathers, as Saint <hi>Foin, Lucern</hi>; and why may not we find divers Graſſes, Vetches, Medicaes, Wild Peaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which as yet are ſcarce taken notice of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There grow divers ſorts of wild Peaſe, but to ſpeak of two only.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sort which groweth on the ſtony Beaches of the Sea, where there is little or no earth, the roots are many foot deep in the ground. In Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes in a dearth, the poor people gathered divers ſacks full of them, and they were no ſmall relief to them, who hath tried whether they would thrive better on better land?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sort groweth on dry barren land, and is commonly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the everlaſting Peaſe; which continually groweth out of the ſame root. In Gardens I have ſeen it grow ten years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and larger at the ten years end, then at the firſt. I have alſo ſeen it flouriſh on barren grounds, where Oats were burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away: who knoweth but theſe and other Plants may be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55779:54"/>
ſerviceable, if not for man, at leaſt for beaſts or pigeons: for in <hi>New-England</hi> the great flights of Pigeons are much main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by theſe, I am ſure it were good to make experiments of theſe and divers others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Head, is the <hi>Ignorance of the Mechanical uſes of Herbs and Trees</hi>; for even for theſe uſes moſt Plants have ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar propriety. To inſtance in a few, We know that Elm is for Wheels; and the beſt wood to make Herrings red, Oak is for Shipwright, Joyner, Tanner; Horn-Beams, Beech, for Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright; Line-tree for Baſs-ropes; old Elder without pitch is very tough and fit for Cogs of Wheels, Tooth-Pickers; Pear-tree for Mathematical inſtruments and ingravers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oſiers for baskets; Walnut for Gunſtocks; Aſp for Hoops, Box, Aſh for an hundred uſes; and much more might be ſpoken of this kind, if time would permit. So likewiſe divers Plants are for Painters, as you may ſee in <hi>Battees</hi> experiments: ſome for the Dyers, but as yet we know but four, (<hi>viz.</hi> Woad, Would, Green-wood, and Madder) amongſt 1200 Plants and upward; which grow wild with us. I could wiſh ſome ingenious man would take the paines to ſearch out the Mechanical uſes of Plants; ſurely it were a good way to advance Mechanicks, who in their callings uſually go round; as horſes in a mill, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour very little to advance or know the cauſes of their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. I know a Gentleman, who promiſeth ſome things in this kind, and I hope will be as good as his word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Head, is the ignorance of the Phyſical uſes of the Plants for though many hundred Plants doe grow amongſt us: yet but few of them are uſed Phyſically: whereas there is ſcarce any one but may be uſeful in this kind. And truely in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion it is a great fault that we ſo much admire thoſe things, that are far fetched, and dear bought; when as often-times they are gathered in unſeaſonable times, and corrupted by long voyages by Sea, counterfeited by Merchants; yea we have very oft <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> and rank poyſons, and neglect thoſe medicines which God hath given us here at home. I am credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly informed that in former times, <hi>Virga aurea</hi> was in great uſe with us, and uſually ſold for eight pence <hi>per ounce,</hi> and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55779:54"/>
brought from <hi>France:</hi> but ſo ſoon as it was found growing plentifully in our hedges, it was caſt forth of the Apothecaries ſhops, as of little vertue. And though ſome will object that our Plants have little vertue: I ſay it's falſe; for God hath tempered them for our complections: and we ſee very oft that one ſimple medicine doth more good then the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Ancients, which are rather <hi>ad pompam,</hi> then for health, and ſeem to ſavour ſomewhat of the <hi>Mountebank,</hi> becauſe <hi>Opium</hi> is alwayes an ingredient. And further we ſee that where any Endemical or National diſeaſe reigneth, there God hath alſo planted a ſpecifique for it: As the <hi>Cochleare,</hi> or the <hi>Scurvy-graſſe</hi> for the <hi>Scurvy</hi>; in the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, where it is very frequent, and alſo in <hi>Holland, England.</hi> So in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> (from whence the great <hi>Pox</hi> firſt came, and where it reigneth very much, that not onely man but other Creatures are infected with it, ſo that even <hi>Dogs</hi> die of that diſeaſe in our <hi>Northern</hi> Plantations, perhaps catching this infection, by mingling with <hi>Indian Dogs</hi>) there grow the ſpecifiques for this Diſeaſe, as <hi>Gujacum, Salſaperilla, Saſſafras,</hi> and the <hi>Salvages,</hi> do eaſily cure theſe diſtempers. Further we ſee, that even the irrational creatures can find not only meat, but alſo medicines for themſelves; as the <hi>Dog, Couch-graſs</hi> for a vomit: the <hi>Dove, Vervein</hi>; the <hi>Weaſel, Rue</hi>; the <hi>Swallow, Celandine,</hi> the <hi>Toad Plantine</hi>; and where is our reaſon that we cannot?</p>
               <p>I therefore deſire all Country people, to endeavour to know theſe Plants which grow at their doors: (for God hath not planted them there for no purpoſe; for he doth nothing in vain) and to collect together the plain ſimple <hi>Medicaments</hi> of their <hi>Grandame</hi>; by this means they may ſave many a forty pence: I mean preſerve themſelves and Families, and Neighbours, in good health with little charge. Some ſmall Treatiſes have of late been written, to ſhew the uſe of our Plants in <hi>Phyſick</hi>; and I hope ingenious men will daily more and more communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the ſecrets of this kind, which they have in their hands for the Publique good.</p>
               <p>They that write of four-footed beaſts, do reckon about an hundred and twenty <hi>ſpecies</hi> of them half of them are ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p n="1">1. To begin with the <hi>Elephant,</hi> the greateſt, wiſeſt, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt lived of all Beaſts: which abound very much in the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of the world; as <hi>China, India,</hi> and are accounted very ſerviceable, both for the Warres, and for carriage, (fifteen men uſually riding on his back together) they are not charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to keep; why may they not be of uſe even here, when I am credibly informed, an <hi>Elephant</hi> lived divers years here in a a Park? ſo that they can endure the coldneſſe of this Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Buffle,</hi> which is as big as an <hi>Ox,</hi> and ſerviceable both for the Plough, and for their Milk: their skins make the beſt <hi>buffe,</hi> they will fare very hard and live in <hi>Fens</hi> and <hi>Bogs,</hi> where nothing elſe can. In the Duke of <hi>Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rences</hi> Countrey near <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> are many of them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The honeſt and patient <hi>Aſſe,</hi> which was very much uſed in the old time for carriage, (as the Horſe for War, and the Ox for the Plough,) and in many Countreys at this time; they will eat Thiſtles, and live even with nothing. They may ſave poor men (who are not able to keep an Horſe, becauſe he is a great feeder,) much labour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Mules,</hi> which is a very ſtrong and proud beaſt, and will carry far more then an Horſe, and are more ſure footed. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that they might be ſerviceable to the Carriers here, as they are beyond the Seas. In <hi>Ireland</hi> before the War, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman <hi>G. R.</hi> had divers, even in the <hi>North,</hi> and found them ſerviceable. Five <hi>Camels,</hi> which will carry great burthens: their hair is the ground of <hi>Mo-hair.</hi> Six <hi>Dromedaries,</hi> which go ſwiftly, &amp;c. Seven Black <hi>Foxes,</hi> may be profitable; whoſe skins have been ſold from 20 l. <hi>per</hi> skin, to 90 l. I might adde divers more of this kind: as <hi>Musk-Cats, Sables, Martines, Minkes, Musk-Squaſh, Guiney-Pigs,</hi> and a ſort of <hi>Cony,</hi> which ſome few have in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> whoſe <hi>Fur</hi> is worth 2 s. 6 d. or 3 s. <hi>per</hi> skin, being little inferiour to <hi>Beave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> &amp;c. but for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities ſake I paſſe them over: as alſo divers ſorts of Fowls, of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:55779:55"/>
good uſe; as a kind of Duck with a crooked bill, which layeth conſtantly as Hens do, as alſo Hawks of divers ſorts of good value, which perhaps the Countrey-man loveth not; becauſe they are enemies to his Poultry.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Deficiency</hi> is, That we doe not endeavour to advance the beſt kinds of the Cattel, which are amongſt us. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. To begin with Horſes. The <hi>French-man</hi> that writeth a Book called, the <hi>Treaſure-Polick,</hi> ſaith, that in <hi>England</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> days, we had not above three or four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Horſe worth any thing for the War, and thoſe onely in Noble-mens ſtables, which thing perhaps did the more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to invade us; but at this time we are known to have very many thouſand of Horſe not inferiour to the beſt in the world: yet I ſuppoſe, that we might much meliorate our breed by <hi>Spaniſh Jenneti, Barbary, &amp;c.</hi> And we are not ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to encreaſe good horſes as we ſhould be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are too negligent in our Kine, that we advance not the beſt <hi>ſpecies:</hi> for ſome ſorts give abundance of milk, and better then others: ſome ſorts are larger, more hardy, and will ſooner fat, <hi>&amp;c. Lancaſhire,</hi> and ſome few Northern Counties, are the onely places where they are a little careful in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are not curious in procuring the beſt ſorts of ſheep, for greatneſſe, ſoundneſſe, and fine wool. I wonder that ſome Sheep-maſters have not procured of thoſe exceeding fine-wooled ſheep of <hi>Spain</hi>; whoſe wool coſteth the Merchant nigh 10 s. <hi>per pound,</hi> before it is exported: I ſuppoſe that it would for a time mend our wool, if not continue ſo for ever: for theſe ſheep were firſt carried forth out of <hi>England,</hi> if we may believe ſtories, <hi>Spain</hi> not affording ſuch ſheep before. <hi>Dutch</hi>-ſheep are reported to have two or three Lambs ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. <hi>Turky</hi>-ſheep are very great, with great tails; but their wool is very courſe, not onely becauſe of their courſe feeding; but alſo becauſe in hot Countreys, they ordinarily mingle with Goats, and therefore in <hi>Venice</hi> ordinary Porters will ſcarce eat any Mutton. And here I cannot but relate, that all ſtrangers very much wonder at two things in our ſheep, (not to ſpeak of the fineneſs of wool.) And</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:55779:56"/>1. That our ſheep if they be ſound, ſeldome or never drink, even in Summer; though they go on the drieſt Chalky lands: as it plainly appeareth in <hi>Kent,</hi> where there is ſcarce water for the great Cattel, which proceedeth from the moiſture of our air, and abundance of rain and dews.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That our ſheep do not follow their ſhepheards as they do in all other Countries: for the ſhepheard goeth before, and the ſheep follow like to a pack of dogs, this diſobedience of our ſheep doth not happen to us, as Papiſts Prieſts tell their ſimple flocks; becauſe we have left their great ſhepheard the Pope; but becauſe we let our ſheep range night and day in our fields without a ſhepheard; which other Countries dare not for fear of Wolves, and other ravenous beaſts, but are compelled to guard them all day with great dogs, and to bring them home at night, or to watch them in their folds.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Deficiency</hi> in this kind, is the neglect of Fiſh-ponds, which are very profitable: for Fiſh uſually live by ſuch worms and flies as are ingendred in the ponds, and require no charge. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ordering of them, and profit of them, read Maſter <hi>Dubravin's</hi> Book of Fiſh-ponds tranſlated out of Latin into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh. And another ſhort Treatiſe called, Certain experiments concerning Fiſh, practiſed by <hi>John Taverner</hi> Gentleman, and by him publiſhed for the benefit of others. And ſurely it would be a great benefit to this Iſland if we had Fiſh at reaſonable rates. I cannot therefore paſſe by two extream abuſes, which exceedingly deſtroy Fiſh, and are in no wiſe to be permitted.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That divers poor men keep many Swine, and in nets, or otherwiſe catch many buſhels of the young fry of Fiſh, and feed their Swine with them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Fiſher-men in the River have the Meaſhes of their nets ſo ſtraight, that they take many ſorts of Fiſh, when they are too ſmall, and ſo deſtroy the young fry. I hope theſe abuſes will be reformed with all ſeverity. To this Head I may adde <hi>Decoys,</hi> which are very frequent in <hi>Holland,</hi> and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but very rare with us in <hi>England:</hi> yet it may be very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and delightful.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Deficiency,</hi> is the ignorance of the Inſects of this Iſland.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55779:56"/>
And though it may ſeem ridiculous to many, to affirm that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, Butterflies,</hi> ſhould be of any importance; yet I deſire them to conſider, that we have our Honey, the ſweeteſt of foods from <hi>Bees,</hi> which are Cattel of this kind: alſo our <hi>Silks, Sattins, Pluſhes,</hi> and bravery from the poor <hi>Silk-worm,</hi> which may be called a <hi>Magot, Caterpillar,</hi> or <hi>Butter-fly,</hi> &amp;c. the richeſt of our colours from the <hi>Cocheneile,</hi> which is one of this ſort <hi>Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac</hi> is made by <hi>Ants,</hi> ſome are uſed for food, as <hi>Locuſts,</hi> &amp;c. as you may read in <hi>Muſſet's</hi> Book <hi>de Inſectis.</hi> Many of theſe likewiſe are uſed in Phyſick, as <hi>Cantharides, Wood-ſowes, Lice,</hi> &amp;c. Some think, that Medicines tranſcending even in the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> may be had out of theſe; for every Plant, which hath a Medicinal vertue, is alſo ſublimed up into this living Quinteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: and therefore I commend divers ingenious men, as Mr. <hi>Marſhal</hi> and others, who have collected many hundred ſorts of theſe; and I hope they will communicate ere long their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments to the world.</p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>Deficiency concerning divers things neceſſary for the good of Cattel.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That we are ignorant of divers Diſeaſes of Cattel and their Cures. Not to run over all the diſeaſes of Cattel and their Cures, which would be too long, and you may read them in Maſter <hi>Markam's</hi> works, the Countrey-Farmer, and others. I will inſtance only in two, which ſome years ſweep away Cattel, as the Plague doth men, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Murrein amongſt great Cattel, and the Rot amongſt Sheep. And though divers have wrot concerning the Cures of theſe Diſeaſes; yet we doe not find that effect which we deſire: and therefore I hope ſome will attempt to ſupply this <hi>Deficiency,</hi> and write a good Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe about the Diſeaſes of Cattel. Of theſe two Diſeaſes, I ſhall briefly declare my mind: And</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the Murrein, which proceedeth from an inflamation of the blood, and cauſeth a ſwelling in the throat, which in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time ſuffocateth the Cattel. The eſpecial Cauſes of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, are a hot and dry ſeaſon of the year; which dryeth up the waters, or at leaſt doth ſo putrify them, that they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome; and alſo the letting of Carrion lie unburied. This
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55779:57"/>
Diſeaſe is thought to be infectious; but perhaps it may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one common cauſe, as the rottenneſſe of ſheep. The beſt way to keep your Cattel from this Diſeaſe, is to let them ſtand in cool places in Summer, and to have abundance of good water, and ſpeedily to bury all Carrion: and if any of your Cattel be infected, ſpeedily to let them blood, and to give them a good Drench, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By theſe means divers have preſerved their Cattel, when their Neighbours have periſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning the Rot of Sheep, not to ſpeak of the Pelt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot, or ſheep that are ſtarved; but of the ordinary rot, called by ſome the white rot, and is a kind of dropſie, their bellies are full of water, and their liver diſcoloured. I have ſeen out of the livers of ſheep tending to rottenneſſe, living Creatures, leaping like ſmall <hi>Flounders</hi>; which without queſtion in little tune will deſtroy the liver, and conſequently produce an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition not unlike to the Rot. The common people ſay, that theſe worms are cauſed by the over-heatings of ſheep, and that Rottenneſſe proceedeth from a Plant called <hi>Cotyledon,</hi> or <hi>Marſh-Penny-wort,</hi> which is of a very ſharp taſt, and therefore not likely that ſheep will eat it; but it may be a ſigne of wet rotten land, as broom is of ſound and dry land. This is certain that in wet moiſt years, ſheep dye very much of the Rot; and in dry years on the ſame ground, they hold ſound: and yet I have heard that in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is far moiſture then <hi>England,</hi> rottenneſſe of ſheep is not known ſo much. It were therefore well worth the labour of an ingenious man to inquire into the cauſes of theſe indiſpoſitions in ſheep.</p>
               <p>The means, which have been found very effectual for the curing of theſe Diſeaſes, are theſe: firſt, to drive your ſheep up to dry Lands, or to keep them in the fold, till the dew be off the graſs, or to feed them ſome days with fine dry hay, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of ſalt Meadow, or to put them into ſalt Marſhes: for in thoſe places ſheep never rot, or to drive them to ſome ſalt River, and there to waſh them, and make them drink of the water, this will kill the ſcab, and alſo the ticks, and faſten the wool: but if you have not the conveniences before ſaid, then rub their teeth with ſalt, or rather make a ſtrong pickle with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55779:57"/>
ſalt and water, and force them to drink thereof. Some dry pitch in an Oven, and adde to the pickle, and have found very good ſucceſs: for theſe Medicines do exſiccate the ſuperfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midities, open obſtructions, and kill worms. Some commend the Antimonial Cup, as a Catholick Medicine againſt all diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of cattel.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We are ignorant of divers ingenuities, concerning feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and fatting of cattel and other creatures. To inſtance in ſome; And</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Of the Horſe,</hi> who is a great feeder. In <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſortſhire</hi> they uſually cut all their <hi>Oats</hi> and <hi>Peaſe</hi> ſmall, and give them with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>haff; by this means the Horſes ſooner fill themſelves, and eat all the ſtraw up: ſome put the Horſe-meat into a bag, and ſo order it that a little only lyeth in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; which when that is eaten up, more falleth down, and not before; by this way Horſes do not blow their meat, nor throw it out of the manger with their Noſes. A further good piece of Husbandry they uſe, which is this, when their Horſes are well fed at night, they fill the Rack with Wheat or Barley-ſtraw, and ſo leave them; the Horſe perceiving that that which is in the Rack is not very pleaſant, lyeth down and taketh his reſt, which is as good to him as his meat: if he riſe in the night, and fall to the rack and manger, as he uſually doth, and findeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſtraw, he ſleepeth till the morning; but if it be Hay, Tares, or Peaſe, the Jade will pull it all down, and ſpoil it, and and likewiſe will be hindered from his reſt; by the which dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble damage doth inſue. <hi>Currying</hi> and dreſſing of horſes ought not to be forgot, it is half as good as their meat. <hi>Brimſtone</hi> and <hi>Elecampane</hi> roots are the eſpecial ingredients for this Phyſick. For <hi>Worms</hi> and <hi>Surfet</hi> are the two commoneſt Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Of the feeding and fatting of Cows.</hi> We uſuall feed cattel with ſtraw in racks in the yard, or turn them to the fields, and there let them feed as much and how they pleaſe; which hath many inconveniences: as firſt, Cattel ſpoil as much with their heels as they eat, eſpecially if the ground be moiſt, or if the fliebe very troubleſome and they blow &amp; ſtench, &amp; tumble much, and if the flie be buſie, they run up and down, and over-heat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55779:58"/>
and fat very little, ſo that often-times in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi> they fatten as little as at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and moſt of their dung is loſt by theſe means, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in <hi>Holland</hi> they do thus: They keep their Cattel houſed Winter and Summer; for the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proviſion, they lay in not only hay, but alſo grains, (which they buy in Summer, and bury in the ground:) and alſo Rape-ſeed, and Lin-ſeed cakes, and ſow Turneps, not only for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but their Cows alſo; with the which Turneps being ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and their tops, and Rape-ſeed cakes, and Grains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they make Meſhes for their Cows, and give it them warm; which the Cows will ſlop up like Hogs, and by this means they give very much milk. In the Summer time they mow the great Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-graſſe, and give it them in racks; ſo that their Cattel are not troubled with the pinching froſts, nor rains, nor with the parching Sun in Summer, neither with the Flie, nor do they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-heat themſelves or ſpoil half ſo much meat; and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways as fat as their Maſters, or Bacon-hogs. The Dung and Urine they charily preſerve, and thereby keep their Meadows of Clover-graſs, (which are conſtantly mowen twice or thrice yearly) in good heart: and indeed cattel ought not to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Clover-graſs, becauſe it uſually groweth with long <hi>Haum</hi> (as they call it) like Peaſe, which if it be broken will not thrive. In <hi>Bermudas</hi> they have a peculiar way of fattening their cattel, not uſed any where elſe that I know, which is with <hi>Green-Fennel,</hi> that groweth in that Iſland plentifully.</p>
               <p>There is a Plant in <hi>Eſſex</hi> called <hi>Myrchis</hi> or <hi>Cow-purſley</hi>; which groweth faſt and early in the Spring, which they give their cattel at the beginning of the year, and they eat it well.</p>
               <p>It is an ill cuſtom that is uſed almoſt every where, to let hogs lie in their dirt and dung, when they are fattening; for all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures generally do hate and abhor their own dung: and an hog i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> cleanlieſt of all creatures, and will never dung nor ſtale in his ſtie, if he can get forth, which other creatures will: and though he tumble in the dirt in Summer; yet that is partly to cool him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and partly to kill his lice, for when the dirt is dry, he rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth it off, and deſtroyeth the lice thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:55779:58"/>Sir <hi>Hugh Platts</hi> in his writings ſetteth down divers ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ways of fattening Poultry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and more may be found out daily. The <hi>Jews</hi> have a peculiar way of fattening Geeſe, with Milk, Figs, Raiſins, and other ſweet things, by which they make the liver of an extraordinary greatneſſe, and is a diſh much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by them, as it was alſo among the old <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>Moor-fields,</hi> there is one that keepeth many hundreds of Conies with grains and bran: and ſome others who keep the great laying Ducks, with theſe things and blood, to their great advantage. I have ſeen a Book tranſlated out of <hi>French,</hi> which teacheth how to gain divers hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> by fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pound ſtock in Hens. I ſuppoſe about <hi>London</hi> where Eggs are ſo dear, great profit might be made by them. Turkeys might be kept with good profit, where there are many Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows as in <hi>Suffolk.</hi> In <hi>Barkſhire</hi> many keep tame Pheaſants, and have gained well thereby.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We do not know how to improve the Commodities pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Cattel to the higheſt: as for example our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary butter might be better ſented and taſted: ſome Ladies have fine ingenuities in this kind. We cannot make Cheeſe comparable to the <hi>Parmiſan,</hi> nor ſo good as the <hi>Angelots</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> our ordinary Cheeſe is not comparable to the <hi>Holland</hi> Cheeſes, where alſo divers ſorts of Cheeſes are made of divers colours: but I cannot much commend their green Cheeſes, which are made of that colour by Sheeps-dung, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Deficiency,</hi> is, That Gentlemen try ſo few experiments, for the advance of this honeſt and laborious calling; when as many experiments might be made for a ſmall matter; for half a Pole ſquare, will give as certain a demonſtration, as an Acre; and a Pottle, as an Hogſhead.

               <p n="4">4. <hi>Deficiency,</hi> is, That we want a place to the which men may reſort for to find ſuch ingenious men, as may be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for their ends and purpoſes; and alſo know where to find ſuch ſeeds and plants as they deſire, as the great <hi>Clove-graſs, Saint Foi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I know a Gentleman, who yearly letting more and more of that land he uſed to keep in his hands, yet confeſſeth his Barns are fuller, becauſe he more diligently manageth what remaineth. 6. I will adde that either through the negligence or ignorance of moſt men, the enemies of the laborious Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen are not deſtroyed: <hi>viz.</hi> Crows, Rooks, which pluck up in light land preſently after the Corn ſpeareth, much Corn, and alſo devour much Corn when ripe: theſe are deſtroyed either by ſhooting, or by breaking their eggs in the Spring, or at leaſt may be ſcared with a little ſmoak, or with a few fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Larks alſo do much hurt, which may be taken in ſnares, or by day-nets, Low-belling, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What Corn is in the barn, and alſo in the field, Mice and Rats oft-times deſtroy much, which are eaſily deſtroyed either by Weaſils, which are far better then Cats (though ſomewhat miſchievous to eggs and poultry) for two of them will ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clear a Ship, though troubled with many hundreds; and therefore I know divers Maſters of Ships very inquiſitive for them, proffering five ſhillings for one with many thanks, ſo that it would be very beneficial both to Ships, and alſo to thoſe, who would take the pains to breed them tame, as many do in <hi>Ireland</hi> for their pleaſure; Rats alſo may well be deſtroyed by Ratſ-bane, which is white Arſenick, or with Sublimate and Butter. But theſe things will hardly be procured from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, becauſe they are ſomewhat dangerous: therefore Gardiners do uſe very much <hi>Nux vomica,</hi> which may be had every where, with a little butter, but take heed of the Dogs. Moals likewiſe do much hurt both to Corn and Paſture, and are too much neglected, though they may eaſily be deſtroyed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Moal-ſpade, or by finding their Neſts in <hi>March,</hi> which uſually are in ſome extraordinary hills, or elſe by putting a deep pot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Corporations, as <hi>York, Briſtol, Norwich, &amp;c.</hi> to be numbred, and a like proportion of Corn to be ſtored up for them, as in <hi>London</hi> perhaps in divers places, men conſidering the low va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of money, may be intreated to lend a conſiderable Sum for this good buſineſſe, if not, I know it is eaſie to command them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I would have all Market Towns, and all Hundreds like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to have their proportion ſtored up, and faithfully guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Neither let any be terrified, as if it would be extreamly chargeable. For firſt, Now money is low, trade little, and alſo the Corn which in cheap years is oft ſold for 2 s. 6 d. 3 s. or 3 s. 6 d. will commonly, in leſſe then ſeven years, be ſold for 5, 6, 7 s. <hi>per</hi> buſhel, which will abundantly ſatisfie for Loan, Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and other charges &amp; loſſes; but if that it ſhall be ſomwhat chargeable, yet conſider the profits that will redound to the Farmer, that he be not diſcouraged, and alſo to the Artificer, and poor Labourer, that he be not ſtarved; yea, to the whole people, that we may not be neceſſitated to devour one another, eſpecially ſeeing War begin to threaten on every ſide. And the Magazines of Corn beyond Seas, <hi>viz. France</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> are like to be locked up from us: yea, though peace ſhould be ratified with all Nations, yet even thoſe Nations themſelves may want, and if not, yet vaſt Sums of Gold and Silver muſt be exhauſted for bread, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the further Conſideration of theſe things I leave to them at the Helme of the State.</p>
               <p>And thus Sir, I have written to you very largely my thoughts concerning the Husbandry of this Iſland, and partly what I have ſeen in many travels. Good Sir, be not offended at my long and impertinent ſtories, my rude language, and unmetho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical diſcourſe. It was, if not to ſatisfie; yet ſomewhat to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the univerſal goodneſſe of your ſpirit, and care of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, which God hath enriched you withal. And theſe are only my firſt thoughts, which in haſt I have hudled up together. I hope (if the Lord will ſend me life and health) my ſecond thoughts ſhall be better: But whatſoever I have done, pray look on it, as coming from one who is deſirous to ſerve you, and to advance the Publick Good, according to the Talent the

               <hi>The ſeveral things obſerved and ſet down during my ſtay in the Countrey, are theſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I Learned the whole Way and Art of making and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Woad, <hi>viz.</hi> the time when they ſow it, when firſt they weed it, &amp; cut it. I ſaw the manner of their gathering it, grinding, balling, drying it, and after ſweating, and curing it. Informing my ſelf of the whole charge and profit of it: have made divers Annotations on it, and taken order for ſome ſeed to be ſent to me, for other more compendious and profitable trials, anſwerable to the Nature and Philoſophy of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This and ſome other things, gave me occaſion to make the beſt inquiry I could of Houſewives and of Fowlers, for all ſorts of dying weeds and lierbs, uſed in the dying of wool; or of nets, which I have carefully collected to improve to a more then ordinary uſe; ſome being very remarkable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Among other general inquiries &amp; adventures, I heard of one at <hi>Ware</hi> that carried Sea-coal; procured an errand &amp; commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations thither; went, was civilly uſed, and ſatisfied in the truth and manner of the thing, and found the Gentleman who was the firſt Authour of it to be one <hi>Airs,</hi> now dead, an ingenious
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55779:62"/>
man, a great Malſter, made much profit of it: it drying Malt as ſweet as if the Sun it ſelfe did it; it is cheaper then either wood or ſtraw; and may be many other wayes applyed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I went into the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> to ſee one of the <hi>Holland</hi>-mills for dreyning; though ſet up there and kept by certaine <hi>French-men.</hi> The Invention ſeemed to me but mean and rude, and Mr. <hi>Whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lers</hi> way much more ingenious.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I ſaw at <hi>Wickleſon</hi> the manner of your <hi>Holland-Sluces.</hi> The ruines alſo of a <hi>Gochlea,</hi> for the emptying drayning of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of which <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>baldus</hi> hath writ a whole Treatiſe. Likewiſe a pretty kind of <hi>Pinnace</hi> with Ordnance, ſomewhat like a cloſe <hi>Liter,</hi> but flat bottommed; which rowed with Wheels inſtead of Oars, imployed it ſeems formerly with admirable ſucceſſe, for the taking in of <hi>Crowland,</hi> and which gave me a proof of what I for many years have thought poſſible, and of very great uſe and ſervice, and ſtill think it of unknown value, if it were skilfully indeed framed, and applyed as it might be.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Lord <hi>F. W.</hi> aſſured me of a Gentleman in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> that made above 10000 <hi>l.</hi> ſterl. of a piece of ground, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yards ſquare, and yet there was neither Mineral nor Mettal in it. He after told me, it was only a ſort of fine Clay, for the making a choiſe ſort of earthen ware; which ſome that knew it ſee him dig up, diſcovered the value of it, and ſending it into <hi>Holland,</hi> received ſo much money for it: it is a ſtory not to be deſpiſed!</p>
            <p n="7">7. His Lordſhip told me the way of making of <hi>Spunk,</hi> or <hi>Touch-wood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. Mr. <hi>H.</hi> his Lordſhip's Bayliff. ſhewed me a ſmall plat of ground, ſcarce an Acre and half, wherein he aſſured me, he had in one year 21. hundred of <hi>Hops</hi>; and falling out then to be ſcarce in other places, he made of that ſmall parcel of ground fourſcore pound.</p>
            <p n="9">9. At <hi>Milton</hi> I ſaw a Spring, that might have been made big enough to ſerve a large Town; which my friend <hi>Wheeler</hi> had newly diſcovered, and broke up; every man oppoſing him in it, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eriding his confidence, till he made it appear, and ſhamed them. Hereupon he gave me ſeveral marks of knowing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55779:63"/>
and finding out Springs under ground.</p>
            <p n="10">10. From Springs we converted our diſcourſe to Pipes, for the carrying along of Water under ground to any Houſe or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>own; wherein he imparted ſome Secrets to me, both of the fitteſt Wood and Trees for Pipes, and preſerving them whole Ages from corruption, by ways extreamly rational, and not hitherto obſerved, or found out by any.</p>
            <p n="11">11. This drew on ſome diſcourſe of Woods, their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſeveral applications: in which he told me many ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar obſervations.</p>
            <p n="12">12. After this, I ſaw at <hi>Melton</hi> an excellent Model of a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Orchard, and Walks, and being further curious, my friend related a witty invention he once put in practiſe, to plant an Orchard in a Mooriſh place, where never grew a Tree.</p>
            <p n="13">13. I caſually met with one <hi>Boughton,</hi> a moſt ſingular rare man, in carving or cutting out Figures in ſmall or in great Stone; and for that reaſon Servant in ordininary to the late King; who acquainted me of many excellent ingenious men, and promiſed to ſeek me at my lodging.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Being in <hi>Cambridgeſhire,</hi> I examined more particularly the Husbandry, planting, ordering, and curing of Saffron.</p>
            <p>Some other things came in my way not without notice: but theſe are the chief. My own improvements and comments, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all which, I ſhall more at large give you, when we meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether being alwayes,</p>

               <p>J Thought to have ſent you nine pound of the ſeed of <hi>Lucern</hi> for the ſowing of three Acres, Doctour <hi>D.</hi> having told me, as heretofore I told you, that three pound would ſow an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent or Acre; But as I was going about it, I met with a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman an acquaintance of mine, who ſome years ſince (but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me hitherto) hath had ſome Acres of Meadow of <hi>Lucern</hi> upon his ground, to whom having caſually ſpoke of my buſineſs, and told him all that Doctour <hi>D.</hi> had told me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Lucern</hi>; he anſwered me, that Doctour <hi>D.</hi> was moſt groſly miſtaken in the quantity of the ſeed required for the ſowing of an Acre; and that it would not take up three pound, but two whole Sacks, each Sack containing the full load of a ſtrong Porter; after which rate the quantity of ſeed for the ſowing of three Acres would fill a great dry-fat, the ſending whereof by land would come to exceſſive great charges, and therefore neceſſarily to be ſent by Sea in my opinion. You will be pleaſed to impart theſe things to your friend, and to let me know his final reſolution upon them, the which ſhall be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accompliſhed by me; and in the mean while, I will get him a perfect and full aſſurance upon all his Queries, not from Doctour <hi>D.</hi> (whom I dare truſt no more in this buſineſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found him guilty of ſuch groſſe miſtakes about it) but from that other Gentleman, who told me he could himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve moſt of theſe Queſtions; but that for to be the ſurer, he thought it beſt to confer firſt with his Farmer about it. You make Apologies for putting me upon theſe Inquiries; but I pray you to believe, that at any time I ſhall moſt readily and chearfully perform any ſervice that ſhall lie in my power, for you or any of your friends, for your ſake.

               <p>THe Information about the <hi>Lucern</hi> that I have got from my Friend, being a very particular one, and containing a very
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55779:64"/>
full anſwer to all the Queſtions propounded by your Friend; is ſuch as followeth: It requireth a rich ground, but ſomewhat looſe and light, ſo as a ſtiff Clay, and ſuch other rough grounds, are no wayes fit for it; The ground muſt not be over-dry nor over-moiſt, but in a mean; yet ſomewhat more inclining to moiſture, then to the contrary. It muſt be ploughed three times, the firſt time in <hi>October,</hi> and the ſecond and third, towards the Spring. Naturally it doth not love Dung, and cometh much better in a ground that is ſufficiently rich of it ſelf, then that which hath been enriched by dunging; and where Dung is made uſe of, it muſt be very ſtale, and well rotten, and long before the ſowing time. It cannot endure the cold, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt not be ſown till the cold weather and all the danger of it be quite paſt, <hi>viz.</hi> about the beginning or midſt of <hi>April.</hi> The Quantity of the ſeed, is the ſixth part of Corn, that the ſame ground will require: ſo as only one Buſhel of <hi>Lucern</hi> is to be ſown on that ſpace of ground, which would require ſix Buſhels of Corn. It muſt be carefully weeded, eſpecially in the beginning. And to the end, that it may take the more firme root, ſome <hi>Oats</hi> muſt be mixed with it, but in a very ſmall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. It is to be cut as ſoon as it beginneth to flower, which in the hot Countries (<hi>Provence, Languedock,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>) it doth five or ſix times, and ſome years ſeven or eight times in a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but in this Climate it uſeth to be cut twice a year, about the end of <hi>June,</hi> and about the end of <hi>September.</hi> Being cut, it muſt be turned very oft, that it may dry the ſooner, and be carried off the ground the ſooneſt that may be; and it muſt be kept in cloſe Barns, being too tender for to be kept in Reeks, open to the Air as other Hay. It is good for all kind of Cattel, as Kine, Sheep, Goats, and as well for the young ones (Calves, Lambs, Kids,) as for the others; but above all it agreeth beſt with Horſes. It is much more feeding then any other Hay; inſomuch, as any lean beaſts will ſoon grow fat with it; and to the Milch-beaſts, it procureth abundance of milk: but it muſt never be given alone, eſpecially to beaſts that have not been long uſed to it: but muſt ever be mixed with ſtraw, or with ſome other Hay; for otherwiſe it over-heateth them, and filleth
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55779:65"/>
them too much with blood; and that ſo ſuddenly, as it greatly indangereth their health, and their life too; which it doth prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to Kine: to whom it is more dangerous, if too plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully given, then to any other Cattel. After the laſt cutting, you may let your Cattel graze on your <hi>Luc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rn</hi>-fields, and that all Winter long, until the beginning or middle of <hi>March.</hi> Of once ſowing you will have your Meadow continue good for ten or twelve years, and until fifteen, and afterwards too, it will ſtill continue to bear; but the Herb will then notably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay in goodneſſe. Wherefore it is beſt then to turn it to ſome other uſe. Kine muſt never eat of this Herb green; but onely dried, and that moderately too, as hath been ſaid. But Horſes eating their fill of it green in the Spring, are purged thereby, and grow fat by it in eight or ten days time: If one deſire to have of the Grain, one may let ſuch a proportion of the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow as one will, grow up to ſeed, after the ſecond cutting, any year, except the firſt only: and when the ſeed is ripe, the tops of the Herb, with the Cods wherein the ſeed is incloſed, muſt be cut in a dewy morning, and put into ſheets, for fear of loſing the ſeed, and muſt be beat out with Flails upon the ſame: when that it is well dried: and afterwards the remaining part of the Herb muſt be mown cloſe to the ground; after which it continueth to ſprout out again after the uſual manner. The Hay thereof will keep good two or three years; and on Acre is ſufficient to keep three Horſes all the year long.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THe Gentleman, who had given me the Note about the <hi>Lucern,</hi> hath told me ſince two particulars more, which he had forgot to put into it: The one, that not only to other Cattel, but even to the Horſes with whom that Hay agreeth beſt of all other beaſts; it is not to be given but in Winter, becauſe that in the Summer it will too much heat their blood: And the other, that this hay muſt be perfectly well dried, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be carried off the ground; and to that end turned very often: becauſe that being put up with any the leaſt moiſture,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:55779:65"/>
it will quite ſpoil much more then any other Hay. Now theſe and all the other particulars, which I have had from the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, have been confirmed to me by many others. And yet within theſe two or three dayes, I met with a Phyſician of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> who aſſuring me that the <hi>Lucern</hi> was very common in his Countrey, made me a relation of it agreeing with the former, onely in theſe three points, <hi>viz.</hi> That of once ſowing it will continue ten or twelve years; That it is cut twice a year, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving afterwards for Paſture all Winter, And that it wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fatteneth all kind of Cattel, but very much different from it in all the others, and in ſome of them point-blank contrary to it. For he ſaith, that it is to be ſown in the beginning of <hi>March</hi>; that it deſireth a temperate ground, but rather dry then wet, and no wayes fat nor clayiſh, but ſtony and gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that it need not be mixed with any other Hay, but may be given alone, and all the year long; in Summer as well as Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not onely to Horſes, but to Cows and other Cattel. He added, that the proportion of the ſeed, is the charge of a porter for four <hi>Arp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>BEing the other day among a knot of great Husbands, and telling ſtories of ſuch like Experiments and Improvements, I remembred ſomething that ſeemed very remarkable concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very fortunate attempt in Husbandry, made heretofore by Sir <hi>John Culpepper,</hi> who they commended at leaſt for a man very ſagacious in things of this nature. He it ſeems ſowed a round parcel of Wheat, about the Month of <hi>July:</hi> and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſheep afterwards to eat it, until about <hi>All-ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ontide,</hi> keeping it very low till the cold and winter began to come: And without doing any thing elſe to it, he gained ſo goodly and admirable a Crop of Wheat the next year, that <hi>Kent</hi> ſcarce ever ſaw the like, it growing in thoſe parts almoſt to a <hi>Proverb.</hi> As great a Crop as Sir <hi>John Culpepper</hi> had.</p>
            <p>Sir, This Story gave me an occaſion by my ſelf to meditate on your Friends. Mr. <hi>Dymock's</hi> great Experiment of his Peaſe and Barley, and remembring he did nothing to the ſeed, nor
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:55779:67"/>
to the ground, but ſomewhat after it was come forth of the ground; I began to conſider Analytically what it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for man to do to Plants after they were come out of the ground; And I ſatisfied my ſelf, that a man could but either dung them, water them, weed them, remove them, ſuccour them, keep them low by eating, pruning, or cutting them, or laſtly ſpread their Roots by rowling them. And though there be ſome other managements by Glaſſes multiplying of light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet I imagined they were too ſubtle and coſtly to take place here.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For dunging and watering them, they were clearly things done to the Ground it ſelf, as well as to the Plant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For weeding them, though this oft proved a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, and bettering of Plants, yet I ſaw not how it could make ſo great an increaſe or multiplication of the Grain, as was in Mr. <hi>Dymocks</hi> Experiment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For removing them, and taking off the ſuckers, though this be a very neceſſary management in taller Plants, and ſerves to make them much more vegete and luſty, yet I ſaw not how this could take more place in Barley, and ſuch ſmall grain, then grafting.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conſiderations made me pitch upon the two laſt, and of the two rather upon Rowling, or the like Art, for the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Roots of it, then upon the other, of eating, feeding, or cropping it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Becauſe the former Experiment of Sir <hi>John Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peppers</hi> ſeemed to me an improvement of the Plant, onely by the giving it opportunity, the better to faſten and ſpread its root. Which the length of time of its being in the ground, the cold of the ſeaſon, and trampling and lying down of the ſheep, ſeemed all to confer unto. All which Rowling I thought might in ſome meaſure perhaps ſupply.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is an Obſervation among ſome bigger Plants, that their Roots are anſwerable to their Heads, intimating that a ſmall root could not have a large and buſhy head, no more then a ſtrong and fairly ſpread root could have a ſmall and ſpindly head. And truly this Rule in greater Plants, ſeems more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55779:67"/>
in ſmaller: for how ſhould we think there ſhould be many ears or ſtalks from one Grain upon a ſmall and ſingle root; for where could there be a place for them? And how ſhould we think a Root to be ſtrong, ſpreading, and ſuccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and yet not endeavour Germination in the ſeveral parts and joynts of it; eſpecially in haſty, growing, Annual Plants?</p>
            <p>I therefore conclude ſuch a ſuper-fortation of ears muſt neceſſarily proceed from an improvement by the Root, where nothing was done either to prepare the Ground, or the Seed. And that this ſpreading of the Root is probable to be beſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by a Rowl, or ſome ſuch like thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I might adde to this Conjecture, the common Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Camomil, and ſome other low creeping Plants, being rowled in dry weather. As alſo an Experiment that I once heard of a Gardiner, who raiſed a great Eſtate by his Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of Turnips, which was by keeping them low for a certain time, by which they grew the ſooner big and ſweeter: The like is uſed in ſome Countries to Potatoes. To all which I might adde the plain defect of this Rowling in Husbandry to any ſort of Grain, which alſo may give the greater occaſion of finding a remarkable benefit and improvement upon the uſe of it.</p>
            <p>However Sir, Being ſo much ſatisfied as I was of the thing, I could not but give you this my Eſſay upon it, and Conjecture, the rather becauſe in the more dry or ſtiff Grounds, as alſo in ſeaſons indifferent for moyſture and drineſſe. If this have not been yet tryed, Me thinks it were ſit to be uſed.</p>

               <p>I Have received from you a Relation of a very great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful production or increaſe, which your Friend at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> relates to be done in <hi>France.</hi> I am far from leſſening the admirable greatneſſe of that perſons skil and ſucceſs. Only ſince I find my ſelf taken notice of by the ſame party, and the Experiment I made the laſt year of Barley, weighed in the ſcales with this, and found too light; I ſhall take leave to ſay, that (beſides all difference that is or may conceived to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſoyles; that of <hi>France</hi> hath a manifeſt advantage in the Elevation and powerful Operation of the Sun,) That it is probable he did uſe all poſſible means both to the Ground
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55779:68"/>
and Seed, to make them both fruitful, which I did not at all; but quite contrarily I choſe the worſt ſeed I could procure; and my ground was as barren as any whatſoever in the parts adjacent. I added nothing to either; all I did was after the blade was ſprung up. And whereas your friend mentions 600. out of 80. ears, thoſe ears contained one with the other at the leaſt thirty ſingle Corns, which 2400. That beſides that, <hi>Wheat</hi> is no whit inferiour to <hi>Barley,</hi> but rather more inclined to its proper nature to branch and ſpread: it is alſo allowed as long time again to grow, and therefore may better ſpread to many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ars then Barly. That my ears of <hi>Barley</hi> rated at thirty, one with the other, (which they were at leaſt, ſome having 38 a thing I ſuppoſe rarely (if ever) ſeen in <hi>England</hi> before) are full as high as his <hi>Wheat</hi> ears rated at 52. And the ſeeming great difference between 2400 and 6000. when looked into, will prove not to be in the number of ears, which differ no more then as fourteen to ten, but in the nature of the Grains, there being univerſally as many more in an ear of Wheat as in an ear of Barley. That if (as it is moſt like) he in <hi>France</hi> did only try concluſions, to what height Nature might poſſibly be ſcrued by Art, and that what is here related, was the effect of that trial; that holds not compariſon with mine, which is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practicable, without any conſiderable expence of time or ſtock more then in the common-way. Laſtly, I affirm, in all poſſible humble reverence and ſubmiſſion to Gods good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, power and providence; that when I ſhall make uſe of good Seed rightly prepared, good Land in right condition, and all other helps which I know and can uſe; I ſhall not doubt for ſmaller numbers of the ſame Grain, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Wheat, to produce 200 or 300 ears, and in them 10000. 12000. or 15000.

               <p>In the bottom of <hi>page</hi> 104. your friend ſpeaketh, as if the excellency of Butter and Cheeſe depended onely on the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, and that Cheeſe like to <hi>Parmeſan</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> Cheeſe, might be made in <hi>England,</hi> if the ſame induſtry were uſed there, as in thoſe Countreys which is nothing ſo: For though Art and Induſtry can do very much in this particular, as in moſt others, whereof I have ſeen moſt remarkable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet there is ſomething in the particular nature of different waters and different Soils, and of the food for Cattel thereon growing: and conſequently in that Cattels milk, and in the Butter and Cheeſe made thereof, which no Art nor humane skill can ſupply or imitate, no more then the ſame kind of Beer can be brewed in all places, or the ſame kind of Wine be made to grow on all grounds. And this is moſt manifeſt hereby, that in <hi>Holland</hi> it ſelfe there are made ſeveral ſorts of Cheeſes hugely different among themſelves; which difference is moſt remarkable in thoſe two excellent ſorts, (<hi>viz</hi>) the <hi>Edam</hi>-Cheeſe (being that kind which is ſo much tranſported into forraign Countrys, &amp; every where known by the general Name of <hi>Holland</hi>-Cheeſe) &amp; the <hi>Stolk</hi>-cheeſe. And if it ſhould be thought, that that diverſity proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent makings of cheeſe, uſed in the ſeveral parts of that country; I can aſſure you, that if you make <hi>Edam</hi> &amp; <hi>Stolk</hi> Boors exchange their habi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55779:79"/>
at home, but as uſed to be made in the places to which they are come. The like may be ſaid of the green cheeſes, made in <hi>Holland</hi> Sheeps milk, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Graveſand, Teſſel,</hi> and <hi>Grind</hi>; all three moſt excellent ones; and yet extreamly differing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves. And not to go for examples of this, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>England</hi> it ſelf; It were againſt all reaſon and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to think that, that notable difference betwixt <hi>Suffolke</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire</hi>-Cheeſes, commeth onely from the different way of making it. Another thing which I find fault withall in the ſame Diſcourſe, is, that the Authour nameth the <hi>French An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golots</hi> among the excellent ſorts of Cheeſe; whereas they are nothing ſo, neither in their qualities, nor in their price, they being ſold for two <hi>Sols</hi> a piece, whereas they uſe to weigh half a pound. I do likewiſe miſlike, that he for to inſtance in the beſt kinds of Cheeſe; he fetcheth <hi>Parmeſans</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi>-Cheeſes from abroad, without taking notice; that at home in ſeveral parts of the Land, and particularly in <hi>Mountgomery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> Cheeſe is made equal to the beſt of theſe kinds; and at <hi>Chedder</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> that which in my judgement is far to he preferred before them, and to any other Cheeſe in the world. <hi>Page</hi> 105. I cannot brook that he complaineth <hi>England</hi> hath but a <hi>Syſtema,</hi> or a compleat Book of all the parts of <hi>Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture</hi>; and reckoneth <hi>Markham</hi> among them, who have writ onely divers ſmall Treatiſes of it: whereas <hi>Markham</hi> hath comprehended in his works whatever belongeth to any part of Husbandry, and Houſewifery too; with very few and ſmall omiſſions; ſuch as in no wiſe can rob him of the name of a general writers; his works alſo having that excellency, that they are altogether ſquared for <hi>England,</hi> and go on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, rather then on probabilities, and hear-ſays; to the contrary of what our Authour ſeemed to tax in him, as well as in other writers of that kind; which maketh me ſuſpect, that either he hath not at all been converſant in <hi>Mankham's</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; or that in reading of him he hath been ſtrangely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, he being in my opinion, one of the moſt excellent of his kind; and in many particulars to be preferred before the moſt excellent of them all.

                  <hi>There were among the Ancient Romans ſome appointed to ſee that men did tell their Land as they ſhould</hi>; but that which follows: <hi>And if they did not, to puniſh them as Enemies to the Publique</hi>; is too hyperbolically ſpoken, there being a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt puniſhing one as an enemy to the Publique, and a ſimple fining of him, which was all the puniſhment inflicted for that fault, as you may ſee in the twelfth Chapter of <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> his fourth Book. In theſe words, <hi>page</hi> 107. <hi>He that turneth fruitful lands into barrenneſſe, as the Land of Canaan, very fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heretofore, but now a barren Deſart.</hi> Our Authour ſays no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what is common in the mouth and pens almoſt of every body, and yet the truth thereof is very queſtionable, as an obſervant Reader will eaſily find by the exacteſt and lateſt writers of that Countrey, among whom <hi>Eng. Royer</hi> is to be placed in the very firſt rank. By the way of addition to what heretofore I have told you upon that paſſage of your Legacy, which ſpeaks of tame Pheaſants, be pleaſed to take notice what I was told this week by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, <hi>viz.</hi> that many years ſince he hath known tame Pheaſants kept in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> eſpecially in a Village a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Wickham,</hi> where the people keep abundance; for to ſell them off to the Poulterers of <hi>London.</hi> And at the ſame time an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant told me, that above 25 years ago, he knew ſome kept at <hi>Middleberg</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> and that Mr. <hi>William Courtine,</hi> the Brother of Sir <hi>William Courtine,</hi> had above a dozen pair of them. The ſame perſon alſo aſſured me from his own experience, that the Inhabitants of the Iſland. <hi>Chios</hi> keep huge numbers of tame Partridges, the which flying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad moſt part of the day, do not fail to return every night each one to his own home, and likewiſe as oft as they are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Keepers, if they be any where within hearing of them. And he aſſured me, that they do this not onely in the places they are uſed to, but any where, inſomuch that if any man carry his Partridges twenty or thirty miles from his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and then letting them out of the basket, in which he hath brought them, throw ſtones among them, expreſly for to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, ſo as all of them do run or fly ſeveral wayes, they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:55779:80"/>
will all come to him, as ſoon as he calleth them, and let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves be taken up by him, the one after the other. And thus I make an end, having nothing to ſay to any thing contained in the following pages of your Legacy; the re-printing whereof with thoſe alterations and amendments I have hinted to you, I do moſt earneſtly wiſh for, it being indeed a moſt excellent piece; and from the beginning to the end fraught with moſt excellent obſervations and experiments.</p>

               <p>This Mine of Blacklead in <hi>Cumberland</hi> (as I am well inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is in the hand of ſome few men, as Maſter <hi>Bolton</hi> and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Bret,</hi> who live in <hi>Cornhil</hi> nigh the Exchange, and ſell Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, who once in ſeven years dig as much as they think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to ſerve, not to glut the Market, and then cloſe the Mine up again: I ſuppoſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Animadverſor were miſtaken, either through the

               <p>FIrſt, I ſee the Animadverſor is offended, though I hope without juſt cauſe, that I quote <hi>Glauber</hi> and <hi>Helmont,</hi> as men of learning and credit.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55779:81"/>
Further, I ſhould rejoyce to ſee an experimental Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher confute <hi>Glaubers</hi> Experiments by experience; till this be done, I cannot but account them ingenious men, and well deſerving of the Commonwealth of Learning; and I cannot but account it robbery, or at leaſt great ingratitude, to take any thing out of a learned Authour, and not to acknowledge it, but to the particular Exceptions.</p>
               <p>The Army diſeaſe (ſaith <hi>Helmont</hi>) came into <hi>France,</hi> as alſo ſmutting of Corn, 1530. And the firſt ſeemeth to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the latter; alſo at this time the Pox raged, which might alſo have ſome augmentation from this corruption of Corn. Although it never was my intention to defend other mens paradoxes, yet I cannot but ſo far defend him, as to ſhew that what is here ſpoken, hath conſiderable probabilities for truth.</p>
               <p>And firſt, That the Smuttineſs of Corn, and the Army diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe came both together in <hi>France</hi>; I am much miſtaken, if the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtory do not report the ſame, and the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſor ſeemeth to grant it. As for the Pox it broke forth violently at <hi>Naples,</hi> 1594. in the <hi>French</hi> Army, as <hi>Helmont</hi> and <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> affirm; and was even then in ſome meaſure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed in <hi>Franse,</hi> but after this ſmuttineſs of Corn, it might exceedingly more abound. As the Plague in <hi>London</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times lurks in divers corners many years, but breaketh not forth violently uſually, but after ſcarcity; by the which the humors of the body are more corrupted by ill dyet: But be it this or no, I will not further diſpute; but will affirm thus much, that it is not an abſurd and fooliſh conjecture, to ſay that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my my diſeaſe might proceed from ſmuttineſs of Corn, they both invading <hi>France</hi> at the ſame time; but the moſt probable I have yet ſeen, eſpecially if that other part be added, <hi>viz.</hi> The bodye corrupted with the pox; for I have oft ſeen in <hi>Italy</hi> an ordinary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eaver in ſuch bodyes to be at length not much unlike the fore-mentioned diſeaſe, (and this is that <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> eſpecially drives at in his Book <hi>de peſte,</hi> where he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth only the Pox by the by:) and who knows not that the corruptions of the aliments ſomtimes produce even the plague,

for the advantages of early ſowing are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The leſſer quantity of Seed is neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Corn is well grown, and ſtrong before the Winter, and therefore more able to endure the nipping froſts, which oft killeth Corn newly come up.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It getteth advantage in the Spring of weeds, graſs, wild oats, &amp;c. which choak much Corn, the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtocked with Corn ſo that there is no room for them to grow.

               <p>JN Mooriſh places two ſorts of wood are found, One very black like Ebony, and it is a kind of Oak: Another ſort leſſe black or dusky, and is a kind of Pine or Fir. In the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England I</hi> have ſeen it ſold publickly, being ſlit in ſmall pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to light Tobacco: it's not unlike the wood which in <hi>New-England</hi> is called Candle-wood or Pitch-pine. Concerning the blackneſſe of theſe woods <hi>I</hi> ſay, that it proceedeth from the turfy earth, wherein theſe Trees lye; which earths, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther earths (as <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe) and ſubterrany things in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per places hath an innate power to tranſmute other extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

things into their own nature: many examples of this hind we ſee in nature: to inſtance onely in putrifying ſpirits or juces which tranſmute not onely wood, but alſo ſhels, bones, mettals, into their ſtrong nature without deſtroying the external form: ſo (<hi>I</hi> ſay) this earth endeavoureth to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or change theſe Trees into it's turfy nature; and I ſuppoſe it hath already changed, as <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe, the ſmaller boughs into it's nature, and introduced ſome indiſpoſitions into the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er wood: for this earth hath a peculiar and more manifeſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of multiplying, then other earths have: for when it is exhauſted it groweth again, as I have heard of divers worthy of credit, if ſo be the water be kept on it all winter, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to run forth in the Spring, which good Husbandry I have ſeen practiſed in divers places; and further every one obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that it preſently ſtops the Channels and Ditches which are cut through this kind of earth: and therefore from the Vapours, Fumes, or <hi>Effluvia,</hi> call them what you will; for <hi>I</hi> think all multiplicative Acts to proceed from ſuch ſpiritual things, and not from bodies; and of this earth, doth this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration or blackneſſe of the wood proceed, as in putrificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſeen, and not as in putrifaction: for the wood is ſtrong, firm, and oft uſed for boards and building: as to explain my ſelf, Smoak will diſcolour any thing that is long hung up in it, but in this there is a vital, active, multiplicative Energy, which worketh not by putrifaction, which in ſmoak is wanting: that the Pine is not ſo ſoon changed as the Oak, it is becauſe it is of a more reſinous or oyl nature, Pitch, Roſin, and Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, being made out of ſuch Trees, and therefore it is not ſo eaſily penetrated: This is in briefe my Philoſophy concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Moonlog,</hi> if I am in an errour, <hi>I</hi> will thank him that ſhall ſhew me the truth.</p>

               <p>Firſt, After the juice of the fruit is expreſſed, preſently to put it into Barrels, and there to let it work as Beer uſually doth, and that there is not any neceſſity to put it firſt into Caves or great Tubs to work in, and thus I have oft ſeen it made in <hi>Kent,</hi> and very good.</p>
               <p>The ſecond way, which I eſpecially commend, is to boyle the juice ſometime over the fire gently either by it ſelf alone, or with ſome good ſpices, and then to make it work with ſome barm or yeſt, as Beer doth, and afterwards to barrel it, and bottle it up; and this truly I conceive to be the beſt way for many reaſons; and I ſuppoſe the Weſt-Countrey Gentleman, whom the Animadverſor quoteth, conſenteth to this way; for he acknowledgeth that by boyling it may be kept longer, and that is fitter for long Sea-voyages, and conſequently better; for boyling purifieth, diſgeſteth, and taketh away windineſſe, and crudities, as we daily ſee in boyling of Beer, and Ale eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be with ſpices: Now this boyling ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the working or fermenting; for then the watry part fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away firſt, and there is not any conſiderable decay of the Spirits: but if Cyder be boyled after it hath wrought (as we call it) then the Spirit. <hi>Aqua-vitae,</hi> or life of the liquour firſt flyes away, as it is well known even to all <hi>Aquavitae</hi> Diſtillers and nothing remaineth but a dead, flat, unpleaſant liquour,

Neither do I ſee any conſiderable inconvenience by doing thus, onely a greater quantity of groſſe lees will be at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the wine; but if wine ſhall any time work in great tubs with the husks of the Grapes, it will loſe its colour, grow <hi>Garbo,</hi> or rough, flattiſh, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I grant that amongſt our Gardiners are divers ſorts of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,</hi> great and ſmall with blew and yellow flowers; which as I ſuppoſe may differ as our Peaſe and Tares, and therefore require divers ſorts of land; but I ſay that theſe <hi>Lupines</hi> are totally unknown to the Husbandman, and never uſed for that end, the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> uſed them, <hi>viz.</hi> to fertilize their land, as in <hi>Kent</hi> ſome uſe tares. In <hi>New-England</hi> I found the ſmall blew <hi>Lupine</hi> growing naturally on a dry white ſandy Plain, and therefore think that that ſort is more natural for the end above mentioned, then the great <hi>Lupine,</hi> I hope in little time to experiment ſomething in this kind.</p>

               <p>I know that we have a great kind of Oatmeal, which we call Grots, but this Grout which I mean, is a ſmall round thing, it cometh over to us in <hi>Holland</hi> ſhips, and I ſuppoſe it a kind of <hi>Millet</hi> or <hi>Panick,</hi> but wonder how it comes to <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> becauſe thoſe Grains grow not there; but if it be made of Oats or Barly, the way to make it ſo round &amp; ſmal is unknown to us: I read in <hi>Parkinſon</hi> of a kind of Rice ſown in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>

perhaps it may be of that kind; for I have found, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſome of the grains unhusked, which to me ſeemed to be like very ſmall rice, I would willingly know the truth of this, whether I be miſtaken or not.</p>

               <p>I ſuppoſe he meaneth <hi>Angelots</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> Cheeſes, and that <hi>Parmiſans</hi> are made of other milk then Cowes milk. If ſo, that Animadverſor, I dare ſay, is miſtaken; for I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired concerning <hi>Parmiſans,</hi> even to <hi>Lodi</hi> in <hi>Millan,</hi> where the beſt are ſuppoſed to be made, and yet never heard any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that any milk beſides Cows milk was an Ingredient to them: and further all the Lands in thoſe parts are very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for ſheep, the Countrey being a low flat Countrey, which they float three or four times every year, and by that means do mow as often; neither did I ſee any conſiderable flocks of ſheep. As for Mares milk that is improper for cheeſe, though many good Houſe-wives in <hi>England</hi> think, that the ſtrength and ſtrong ſavour of <hi>Holland</hi> Cheeſe proceeds from hence, but as I have formerly touched, falſely: perhaps there are ſome in other places, who to excuſe either their negligence or ignorance, report the ſame of <hi>Parmiſans,</hi> but they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: As concerning <hi>Angelots</hi> and <hi>Parmiſans,</hi> I muſt ſay (though I am unwilling to diſparage our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Houſwifery, further then is right) that to my apprehenſion the <hi>Angelots</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> which are made in great abundance, are better far then our <hi>Cheſter</hi> Cheeſes, and alſo our <hi>Banbury</hi>; as for our <hi>Chedder</hi> Cheeſes which are made onely in two or three pariſhes in their number ſo ſmall that they are ſeldom ſeen, but at ſome Noble-mans table, or rich Vintners Sellars, that they are even nothing conſidering the great quantity of Cheeſe which is made in this Iſle. Neither do I think they tranſcend the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſan</hi> or ſome <hi>Angelots,</hi> but I leave this Controverſie to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones palate; that being very excellent to one, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little worth to another: and I can truly affirm, that it is a great deficiency even through the whole Iſle, if theſe <hi>Cheddar</hi>

Cheeſes be ſo good that there are ſo few made, the Paſtures in that Country not exceeding other Counties in <hi>England</hi>; nor breed of Cattel better. Neither is the price of <hi>Angelots</hi> at two Sous for half a pound, a vile price (as the Animadverſor ſaith) conſidering the Cheeſes are uſually ſold green; further I have ſeen ſome few <hi>Angelots</hi> made in <hi>England</hi> after the <hi>French</hi> manner by ſome curious Ladies of tranſcendent good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, according to mine and divers other palats; and I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that other ordinary Houſewives might make the ſame, if they knew the Art.</p>

In brief, I will declare my rude thoughts, which perhaps will at length be
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55779:94"/>
found truths, for light breaketh forth a pace: In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the wiſe Creator made two great Lights for the uſe of this Sphere of the World, the Sun, and Moon; the Sun to enlighten and to warm, and refreſh all things, and to rule the day; the Moon to rule the night, and to be for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing of times and ſeaſons; the Sun being the Center imparts his light to the Earth and Moon, alſo to <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> (for they are found by the Selneſcope to increaſe and decreaſe as the Moon doth) and alſo it is probable to <hi>Mars,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> and ſcarce further; for the power of all created things are finite, as the Moon being nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reflects its light on us, ſo its probable that the Earth illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates the Moon. <hi>Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,</hi> have their Lunars or ſmall Stars moving about them, which have lately been diſcovered (the Ancient knew not thereof) which its probable are for the diſtinguiſhing of times and ſeaſons for the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of thoſe parts.

               <p>
                  <hi>Cork-tree.</hi> I very little queſtion the growth of this. For firſt theſe trees grow abundantly in <hi>Biſcay,</hi> a Countrey far colder then <hi>England,</hi> where the Summers alſo ſcarcely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the grapes: Likewiſe they grow in the North of <hi>New-England</hi> at <hi>Parcato</hi>-way. Further that Tree is a great hardy bearing Acorns, and leaves like to an Oak, that one may eaſily be deceived by it, and miſtake it for the common Oak.</p>
               <p>Scarlet Oak, I hope, I ſhall make it very probable, that even this alſo may flouriſh in our Iſle: In <hi>Latine</hi> it is called <hi>Ilex,</hi> of which there are divers ſorts.

I loſt my berries, and never ſince could obtain more: For theſe reaſon; therefore I believe, and I hope others will ſo far, as to endeavour by experience to find out whether the Scarlet Oak which is a conſiderable Plant, will thrive amongſt us.</p>

I ſuppoſe the reaſon is plain enough, but that Flatters cannot make good Hats, becauſe the water is not good enough for them: or the Dary-maid make good Butter or Cheeſe, &amp;c.

But that the difference
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55779:99"/>
of water doth cauſe thoſe alterations. I very much queſtion, for I know that in <hi>Kent,</hi> whether the Cows drink puddle or pond-water, or clean ſpring, or freſh or brackiſh, (which in ſome place they oft do) yet the butter and Cheeſe are the ſame, if the Paſtures be alike.

And I ſuppoſe that if the paſtures mentioned in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by the Animadverſor, were wel viewd by a judicious man, the like difference might be found, for as I ſuppoſe the Waters in <hi>Holland</hi> differ little, the Countrey lying for the moſt part in one even flatneſs without Minerals or Metals, the Country in Winter over-flown with rain-water, in the Summer time moſt of their waters brackiſh: But if it be otherwiſe, I ſhould be very glad to have ſome further light, and deſire ingenious men not to build upon vulgar report, for I know they are apt to make <hi>Molchils Mountames, &amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Interim</hi> I ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in my own opinion.</p>

               <p>YOur cordial love to the kingdoms good being ſo clearly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the world, not onely by your pen, but alſo by your conſtant practiſe in promoting of all good deſignes which tend to the general good of the Commonwealth, hath emboldened me to ſend you this encloſed Copy, deſiring that you will be pleaſed to take care that it may be forthwith printed and publiſhed, together with this Letter: Neither need you fear any diſhonour by promoting of this laudable deſign: for I have ſhewed the Copy to the Learned as well as the unlearned, to the rich as well as the poor, and all approve of it, and deſire to have it as ſoon as it ſhall be publiſhed: They think it is a fine experiment to make good bread of an old ſhooe: And though they differ in opinion concerning other affairs, yet they all love to eat bread with one conſent; and if they ſhall agree to practiſe according to their profeſſion, which is to doe their beſt endeavours to further the good of the publick, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cards will turn, and we ſhall win our money again by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, which we have loſt by diſcord, yea and twice as much more. And though many of theſe things which I would have to be put to the beſt uſes, ſeem to be trivial, that is for want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in the Readers; for in <hi>Genoa</hi> as I have been credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly informed, it is an uſual practiſe to buy barren land for little or nothing, and to carry good earth to it, and cover it ſo deep, as a ſpade or a plough may work upon it; but this practiſe would never counter vail the firſt charge, unleſs they did uſually pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe another ſtrange work, which is ſo common there, that if an horſe or a beaſt doe dung in any ſtreet, or high-way, it is a marvel if ſome boy or girle doe not take it up, before it he cold, ſo carefull are they that the fertility of the Kingdom ſhould not be diminiſhed: And though theſe boyes and girles get nothing but ſinnes and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55779:101"/>
points, or ſome other trifles, yet in the general the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is made rich and plentifull: Even as we ſee in a Bee-hive, though every Bee bring but a drop of honey at a time, yet it maketh up a weighty maſs, and many of thoſe maſſes put together do make up the great maſſe, which I have ſeen at <hi>Sturbridge Fayre,</hi> which is able to amaz a man that beholdeth it.</p>
               <p>When this Book is publiſhed, then I deſire you to think of the beſt way you can poſſibly imagine, that all the Inhabitants of the whole kingdom may have knowledge of it generally; for knowledge that concerneth the publick good, ought not to be concealed in the breaſts of a few. As for the large Book to which this little one hath relation, there is no thinking of publiſhing of it, till we have obtained a Committee to examine witneſſes, and to print their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in it; for Projectors have caſt ſo many bitter things into the publick Fountain, whereof all have drunk, and their minds are ſo poyſoned, that that there is no other way to unpoyſon them, but to win their belief and willingneſs to practiſe, but ſuch depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gentlemen of quality, which know, the ſame as well as I my ſelf, and ſome of them have taught me, and I have taught o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſeveral Secrets, and ſome few I know my ſelf still, and no man elſe in the Kingdom, for ought that can be proved; all which reſerved Knowledge in particular breaſts, is againſt the Wealth of the Publick, and therefore ought to be made common to all, or elſe this Deſign cannot proſper, nor the Kingdom flouriſh according to my deſire. As for your particular Encouragement I need ſay no more, but that by furthering of this friendly Advertiſement, and the perfecting of the Books to which it belongeth, you ſhall become a Further of the moſt Charitable Deſign that is now on foot in <hi>England,</hi> beſides the great and manifold Benefit that ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound thereby to the Commonwealth: For I dare undertake that <hi>by the right Improvement of the ſeveral Directions and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments that ſhall be diſcovered, you ſhall undoubtedly cauſe more naked to be cloathed, more hungry to be fed, more poor Virgins to be preferred in marriage, than</hi> Suttons <hi>hoſpital, the</hi> Savoy, <hi>or all the Hoſpitals, or Liberal Gifts in</hi> England <hi>have ever performed.</hi> So I reſt,</p>

Earths leaſure, till ſuch time as he ſhall be graciouſly pleaſed to afford ſo much leaſure to the high and honourable Court of Parliament to hear ſuch Witneſſes as I ſhall produce, to the end that the Depoſitions being printed in the ſame Book, every Subject in the Kingdome, as well in great Cities and Towns Corporate, as in the Country may be ſatisfied concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the truth thereof, and ſo be more apt to yeeld unanimous conſent, which is all that is wanting for the full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this laudable work.</p>
               <p>And I wiſh no man to think that this is a device to exhauſt his purſe; for the truth is, I wrote the ſame for no other cauſe, but becauſe I ſaw that all thoſe Books which were formerly written upon this ſubject, were written by men which had not attained to any conſiderable <hi>Perfection in the Knowledge of Nature,</hi> and ſuch as had but a glimmering light of ſuch great Secrets, as Nature hath heretofore locked up in her Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and ſo were ignorant in the fundamental points and cauſes of Vegetation and Multiplication. Whereupon I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the Teachers and the Teached were nothing elſe but the blind leading of the blind, by which we all fell into the ditch: I mean, we lived in want and miſery, when we might might more eaſily have lived in plenty and proſperity.</p>
               <p>As for the particular way whereby this wonderful Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be brought to paſſe, here is no room in theſe few leaves: therefore I will only ſhew how every one in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well in great Cities as in the Country Towns may be an helper in this happy work, and raiſe ſome conſiderable gain to himſelf, and that great Cities which in former times devoured the fatneſs of the whole Kingdom, may yeeld a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable retribution yearly without any mans prejudice, ſo that tht fertility of the Countrey needs not be ſo much dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as in former times.</p>
               <p>And therefore every one is deſired to take this one thing into conſideration, that as any parcel of good land, being kept in Paſture, and having the dung which it breedeth ſpent upon it, doth continue fertile for ever, without any other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, ſo the excrements and materials which any family pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55779:102"/>
being wel contrived, will produce yearly as much bread and drink as that family ſpendeth for ever.</p>
               <p>But the better to ſtir up all poor maid-ſervants to put their helping hand, let them be pleaſed to underſtand, that I taught a poor woman to get three pounds a year, which ſhe hath continued many years without any conſiderable labour, or neglecting her other occaſions, and thus ſhe practiſed.</p>
               <p>When ſhe waſhed, and ſwept rooms at her neighbours houſes, inſtead of caſting many materials to the common dunghil, ſhe took them home with her at night, and laid them in a corner, and once a year ſhe ſold them for above three pound. Beſides ſhe laid aſide every year as many linnen rags as yeelded her forty ſhillings, and her labour, in receiving her five pounds from the Bargeman, or thereabout every year, was a moſt as much as all her other labour, I mean extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary labour.</p>
               <p>If young poor Maid-ſervants will imitate her induſtry, I will tell them the whole Secret, to the intent that beſides the benefit to the publick, every one may get her ſelf a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable portion; and to the end that many may be induſtrious in this laudable way, and that many thouſands may remember me in their good wiſhes, I will firſt ſpeak a good word for them to all generations to come, to wit, that ſuch an one, which by her wit, induſtry, and providence getteth her ſelf a portion of twenty or forty pounds (which ſhe may eaſily doe in a certain number of years, not very many) deſerveth as good a marriage as one that hath an hundred pounds given her by her parents and friends.</p>
               <p>And to the end that this may not ſeem to be a ridiculous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, I will ſhew the reaſons of it, and alſo the experience, and laſtly declare the ſeveral materials which I taught her to reſerve.</p>
               <p>As for the reaſons, they are thus diſcovered, <hi>viz.</hi> the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſpirit of the world, by which all things do encreaſe and multiply, is ſometimes cloathed with a groſs and earthly foecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, as in dung, and more in ſome dung than in other: ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is more purified from its earthly foeculency, and then
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55779:103"/>
it is far more effectual, as we ſee by experience in <hi>London,</hi> that a load of ſhavings of horn is ſold for ſhillings, or three pound a load, wollen rags is ſold for thirty or forty ſhillings, when as a load of common dung is ſold for a penny, and many times for nothing but carriage away.</p>
               <p>Now I proceed to declare the ſeveral materials which I taught her to reſerve: As for the linnen rags, ſhe reſerved thoſe before I knew her, and ſold them yearly to the Paper-Mils; and I ſeeing her induſtry, thought it a good deed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe her to reſerve all the ſhreads and rags of woollen cloath as well old as new, all the ſhreads and pieces of leather of all kinds as well old as new; all the horns and hoofs of beaſts of beaſts of all kinds, whether ſhaven or not, that came in her way; all the hair either in Barbers ſhops or Tanners yards, or at the houſes of Butchers and Cooks, where they ſcalde many hogs and pigs, and fondly caſt away the hair; and to take up all the old ſhooes and peeces of leather which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in her way, as ſhe went about her ordinary occaſions, and to work as often as ſhe could, at the houſes of Taylors, Shoomakers, Sadlers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For I have found by experience, that a load of the beſt common dung will not produce corn worth above twenty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings at three crops, unleſſe corn be very dear, and if it be far carried, then the labour, rent, and ſeed, will conſume the gains, whereas a load of any of theſe materials formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, will produce Wheat and other corn worth above ten pound, though the price be reaſonable.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being well conſidered, there is a great reaſon why theſe materials ſhould not be fondly caſt away to the common dunghill in great Cities, or other places, whereas the greateſt part thereof is utterly loſt; and though ſome of them goe to the dunghill, yet they ſerve onely to enrich land which lieth near to great Cities, where there is no need of them, whereas being reſerved by themſelves, they will quit the coſt to be carried twenty or thirty miles, and ſo make land fertile, which beareth not halfe the quantitie for want of dung.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:55779:103"/>And whereas I have found by experience, that a load of any manner of ſeeds whatſoever, doth contain as much of the vegetable ſpirit of the world, as ten loads of common dung, I could wiſh, that all ſuch young men-ſervants, as have no Stocks nor Trades, ſhould get them ſervices in great Innes, or to be Bayliffs of Husbandry to great men, and to reſerve all the hay ſeeds that come within their reach, and all the ſoot that is ſwept down out of the chimneys, that they can get, and once in a year to get ſo much blood at any Butchers, or Poulterers houſes as will make them into a paſte, and then to adde ſo much Cow-dung dryed to them, as being temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with urine, will be ſufficient to make the whole maſſe apt to be formed into the form of bricks, loaves, or cheeſes, and then they are to be layd up in a dry place till they be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rotten, and that a ſmall quantity thereof being made into powder will not produce any thing ſuddenly, being ſpread in a garden or other open place where the rain may fall upon it, without the help of new ſeed, and then though their common dung will yeeld no price at all in that place, but rather they are forced to pay money to have it carryed away, yet this will give them a large price, after that the virtue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is known.</p>
               <p>And if any ſuch men-ſervants have meanes to farm certain Acres of barren land, which lieth ſo remote from dung, that the annual rent thereof is little, then by ſetting of Wheat, or other Grain, by my directions in my book formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, they may make one quarter, or one pounds worth of corn, to yeeld forty quarters, or forty pounds worth of corn in leſſe time than one year, and as much over and above as ſhall pay all charges and workmen nobly, and alſo as much rent as any ordinary Farmer can afford to give yearly for it, by which means he may in a few yeares get a conſiderable Stock, and be as likely to thrive as he that hath twice ſo much given him by his parents or friends. And I could wiſh all ſuch men to marry with ſuch women as by their wit, induſtry, and providence have gotten themſelves portions by my directions in this l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55779:104"/>
do the like, and try concluſions whether of them thriveth better.</p>
               <p>If <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ny one ſhould be ſeen to caſt away good bread, when ſo many poor people want it, then all the world would cry ſhame upon him; but why ſhould not the caſting away of any of theſe materials fondly be reputed a more heynous ſin, when as they will produce divers times their weight of as good bread as any Prince eateth.</p>
               <p>I have ſeen by experience that Salt-peter is the moſt rich compoſt in the world to multiply Corn, and I have ſeen fifty pounds worth of Salt-peter extracted out of a vault at <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> not very ſpacious, which was formerly an houſe of office, and not emptied till the matter was throughly rotten, why may not the ſame thing be done by Art which was formerly done by Nature and Accident? I have been credibly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſuch a work is ordinarily done in the Kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> and alſo at the City of <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and I ſee no reaſon why Engliſh men ſhould not have as much wit they.</p>
               <p>If any man hath convenient room to build two houſes of office, and to cloſe up the one whilſt he uſeth the other, then there can be no queſtion, but that inſtead of the charge of emptying, and noyſomneſs of the ſmell, he may have it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied for nothing, and feel the ſweet ſmell of money very gratefull to moſt men, and that in as great quantity, or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he receiveth for his ordinary Edifices: beſides that he will ſhew himſelf to be a good member of the body poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or Common-wealth wherein he liveth; but he muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, that the matter doe lye dry, and that no adventitious moyſture come to it either from beneath or above, which will be ſomewhat more chargeable in moyſt grounds, then where the earth is very dry by its own nature.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is as clear as the Sun, that the fleſh and blood of a beaſt is five times as good as the dung of a beaſt, and that the skin, hair, wooll, horns, and hoofs are ten times as good as the dung; and that theſe things are at the leaſt the third part of the fertility and wealth of the Kingdome, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55779:104"/>
that theſe things are for the moſt part loſt and caſt away for want of general knowledge: I could wiſh that every Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder in the Kingdom would make uſe of this Book, and let it be common for all his family to read, or hear it read, to the end that ſome conſiderable quantity thereof might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, the ſoot in every ones chimney will pay him again; for a Buſhel of ſoot will produce two Buſhels of wheat, if it be well ordered, becauſe it aboundeth much with the vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit of the world, by which all ſublunary things doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and multiply.</p>
               <p>And whereas there is much food of all kind ſpoyled for want of looking as muſty Corn, mouldy Cheeſe, ſtinking Fleſh and Fiſh; alſo if any man have any Horſes or beaſts that dye by accident, let all men be pleaſed to receive inſtructions in the ſaid book formerly mentioned, how to recover ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſhare of their loſſes; and if any one cannot finde out ſome way or other to benefit himſelf more or leſſe by the reading of the ſaid book, beſides the good to the publick, let him lay the blame no where elſe but upon the weakneſs of his own underſtanding; for it will be proved againſt him that ſome have advanced their revenues above a thouſand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> by ſome ſmall part of the skill contained in the ſaid book. And if every poor ſervant cannot get themſelves portions of conſiderable value, by reaſon that their Maſters houſes afford not ſtore of ſuch materials, nor ſpare room to lay them in, then let them get five ſhillings a year, that they may doe in the pooreſt houſe in the kingdom, yea the pooreſt beggars that goe from door to door, may get more than that, ſo ſhall they get themſelves every year a ſuit of cloathes, if they buy them at the ſecond hand, and ſhew their love to the Common-wealth; and perhaps ſome good minded man, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their induſtry, may disburſe money for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one crop, and take it again with intereſt, or without intereſt, out of the firſt part that is ſold, and ſo will the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder afford them a conſiderable portion. And though that waſte paper of all ſorts, either white or brown, written or printed be not very good to make barren land fertile, yet it
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:55779:105"/>
will make good Paſſeboard, the white is worth three farthings a pound, and the other an half penny a pound to make brown Paſſeboard, good to cover Bookes, and all other things where the colour is hidden in the work, and therefore worthy to be reſerved, for in ſome houſes it is of very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable value.</p>
               <p>And let all men be pleaſed to take into ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that as in every century of yeares there doe more people dye than are in the World at any one time, ſo in every cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury of yeares there is more Wealth loſt fondly for want of knowledge in <hi>England,</hi> in the compleat Art of Agriculture, then is in the Kingdome at any one time, yea though an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory were taken and valued at <hi>Michaelmaſs,</hi> when the whole yeares fruits are engroſſed together, which ſumme will double throughout the whole Kingdom (eſpecially in the Country) to the like Inventory taken at <hi>May</hi> day, when the yeares fruit are almoſt waſted, and little remaining but hopes, which are not uſually put into Inventories.</p>
               <p>Whereas it will plainly appear to all rational men, that I wiſh well to all in general, let them be pleaſed to accept of one friendly advertiſement more: Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that is not with me, is againſt me,</hi> admitting of no neutrality, and I ſay, that whoſoever doth not according to his abilitie, and opportunity, further this bleſſed worke, more or leſſe, liveth in a deſtructive way to the Common-wealth, or body politick, whereof he is a member, though an unworthy one.</p>

Certainly that man had as excellent a genius that way as any that ever lived in this Nation before him; and was a moſt faithfull ſeeker of his moſt ingratefull Countries good. I never think of the great judgement, pure zeale, and faithfull inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that man, and withall of his ſtrange ſufferings, and manner of death, but I am ſtruck with amazement that ſuch a man ſhould be ſuffered to fall down dead in the ſtreets for want of food, whoſe ſtudies tended to no leſs than the providing and preſerving food for whole Nations, and that too as with much Skill and Induſtry, ſo without Pride or Arrogancie towards God or man.</p>
               <p>Sir, I can give you no other or better accompt, but conſtant praiſes: Onely this I ſay, that whereas I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Plat</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention for Setting was far better than any thing that preceded; yet ſince it is loſt, and was not ſo very perfect neither, as you:

               </head>
               <p>FOur hundred graines of choſen Wheat, doe weigh three quarters of an ounce, which is three ounces for a perch; and ſo a hundred and ſixty perches muſt have four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighty ounces, which is in weight thirty pound, and in meaſure half a buſhel and two pints.</p>
               <p>If this half buſhel being ſet upon an Acre ſhall enreaſe but an hundred for one, which is the leaſt encreaſe of ſet Corn that ever was known, then there will be about 11 quarters upon that Acre.</p>
               <p>And that ſeveral ſorts of Wheat doe differ at leaſt 11. pound in a buſhel in weight, and alſo in the number of grains, ſo that it is impoſſible to make this accompt abſolutely, and exactly perfect.</p>
               <p>But yet it appeareth clear, that there is above foreſcore pounds in the two hundred pounds ſaved in the ſeed Corn in ſetting, more than by ſowing the common way; and alſo that there is above foreſcore pounds in the hundred pound ſaved in workmens wages, by this new device of ſetting: and alſo it ſhall appear, that there is above foreſcore pounds in the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound ſaved in the Compoſt, by diſperſing it by my new Invention, in ſuch manner that it ſhall all lye within the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive virtue of the ſeed Corn.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:55779:106"/>Alſo it ſhall appear, that the Corn upon every Acre, being ſet by my direction, ſhall yeeld a full third part increaſe more than if it were ſown the common way; which ſaid third part ſhall bear all the charges whatſoever, both rent and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences; ſo that by this new way of Husbandry, there will be as much Corn gained clear upon every Acre of ground in <hi>England,</hi> as formerly the ſaid land did yeeld one year with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>The ſeed wheat for the ſetting of an acre is worth half a crown, at five ſhillings a buſhel; the workmens wages for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ſix ſhillings; the compoſt coſteth little more than the ordinary charges of ſpreading the dung by the ordinary way of ploughing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo it appeareth clear, that the gains of one Acre will do a great deal more than to pay for the ſeveral Engins; which notwithſtanding being well trimmed will endure, and be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable for the ſpace of an hundred years.</p>
               <p>And if any man doubt of it, let him caſt up the charges of my work more punctually; and alſo the charges of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way, and he ſhall finde that there is more cleare gains by my way by ten Acres, then by thirty done the common way, in which accompt I will not be my own carver, but will refer my ſelf to the accompt in a little book which I met withall lately though it was printed <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1601. when ſetting of Wheat was in great practiſe; but afterwards when the price of Wheat grew cheap, and Labourers wages grew dear, the practiſe ceaſed, for want of an expeditious way.</p>

               <p>And thus a friend of mine proceeded, <hi>viz.</hi> he ploughed up at <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> twenty Acres of very fertile and rank green ſword ground, and afterward croſs ploughed it, and harrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it three or four times to kill the graſs, and alſo to mingle the fat earth with the lean, then he ſowed it about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>March</hi> with Barley before the vehement drought came had cover'd the ground ſo full, that it was as if it were even turfed with the Corn, ſo that afterwards the violent heat and drought which ſpoyled the thin and barren Corn in the Common fields did cauſe this Corn to have but a ſhort ſtraw, yet the rich earth put forth a large ear, and very exceeding thick, and alſo the corn was plump and round, which had the weather happened to be moyſt and rainy, then there would have been almoſt nothing but ſtraw, but ſo it came to paſs that he had thirty quarters upon every Acre, which was upon the twenty Acres ſix hundred quarters, and by reaſon of the failing of Corn in the Common fields he ſold it for forty ſhillings a quarter, which came to twelve hundred pounds with the rent and all, ſo that he gained above a thouſand pound clear by his twenty Acres of Barley: Yet I would wiſh no man to take in hand ſo hazardous a work again, but rather to 2aim at a meane in fertilizing of his land, which is the ſureſt way one year with another; for if he make his land too ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream fertile, then it is ten to one he ſhall have nothing but ſtraw, and ſome light corn, which is good for little uſe, but onely for Poultry; and if on the other ſide he take ſo much are able land, that he is not able to enrich it ſo that every Acre

may bear in a reaſonable year five quarters by ſowing the common way, or thereabouts, and a eleven quarters and a half, or thereabouts, by ſetting, then let him caſt up his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts juſtly, and he ſhall find himſelf to be no good friend to himſelf, nor yet to the Common-wealth, for he might have gained more by laying his Compoſt upon half ſo much land, and by ſetting it orderly, than by the whole, ſo that he himſelf and the Common-wealth is deprived of that benefit of the herbage of that land which he did unadviſedly and above his ability to enrich, keep in tillage to his own loſs and great damage.</p>

               <head>Certain Experiments and Improvements for the inriching of Land, by my new Invention or Engine, which diſperſeth the Compoſt in ſuch manner, that it falleth all within the reach of the attractive virtue of the Corn.</head>
               <div type="subsection">
                  <head>The firſt Experiment or Improvement.</head>
                  <p>It is found by experience, that where dung hath been layd upon heaps upon fallowed land, and hath layen unſpread for a moneth or ſix weeks, and withall ſome ſtore of rain hath faln to carry down the <hi>Chilus</hi> or juice of the dung into the earth there, though the dung was all removed in the ſpreading from the place where the heap lay, yet there grew more corn in a yard ſquare of that ground ſo fatned with the <hi>chilus</hi> or juice of the dung than in three yards ſquare, where the dung was diſperſed in the reſt of the land.</p>
                  <p>By this we may obſerve that Dung doth not enrich ground till it be putrified and turned into <hi>chilus,</hi> or <hi>aqua pinguis,</hi> or <hi>aqua viſcoſa,</hi> and alſo that Compoſt of land whatſoever is to be turned into ſuch a nature and property before it can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce great encreaſe in the preſent crop.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the beſt Husbandry is to prepare Earth and Compoſt in ſuch manner, that the nutritive virtue thereof may aſſimilated into the corn and fruits in the firſt year, or elſe the Husbandman layeth out his ſtock and charges long before hand, and is deprived of great part of the benefit thereof, by reaſon that the rain and land-flouds doe carry away a great
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:55779:108"/>
ſhare of the <hi>chilus</hi> or juice of ſuch dung as falleth out of the reach of the attractive virtue of the ſeed or plant; and if any man doubt of it, let him fill all the holes (when he hath ſet an Acre of Corn) with ſuch fat earth, and he ſhall find his encreaſe doubled upon common barren field land; and contrariwiſe, let him fill the holes with common dung, and he ſhall finde no ſuch ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay that this is a pedling buſineſs, and an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs work; to which I anſwer, That ſo it is indeed, to thoſe which know not the uſe of my new Invention, or Engine, but that being known, is the moſt profitableſt work in the world, for a man may fill 400. holes in the twinckling of an eye, and may order a whole Acre in like manner, with a very little charges more than the ſpreading of the dung doth uſually coſt. Therefore now I will proceed to ſhew how divers fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile earths may be prepared wherewith the holes may be filled, and ſo conſequently the encreaſe may be doubled, and this practiſe will be excellent in ſuch places where the charge of carriage coſteth much, by reaſon of the great diſtance of the place from the Compoſt; for I find, that though divers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibitions of the ſeed with apt liquors doe produce a good im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, yet it is not a practiſe comparable to this; for if a Farmer have twenty acres of Arable land, and have dung but for fifteen Acres, and ſhall yet have a good crop, by means of a good imbbiition, yet is not this knowledge ſufficient for a Husbandman, upon whoſe skil the happineſs of himſelf, and the whole Common-wealth dependeth: For by this way he may enrich his Arable land at pleaſure, be it never ſo barren, nor never ſo much remote from his Compoſt; for on the one ſide, if the filling of the holes be not ſufficient, he may heap them, as hops are uſually heaped, with fertile earth and dung; and on the other ſide, if the earth be too rich, ſo that it will make the Corn too rank, then he may half fill the holes, or leſs and then fill them up with a Rake with their own proper earth, or he may make his earth ſo rich, that he may mingle with it twice the quantity of the field earth before he diſperſe it; by which means he may ſave a great deale in the

                  <head>The third Experiment, or Improvement, where is ſhewed how a rich Compoſt may be made in form of earth, near to the Sea, which may be carried many miles.</head>
                  <p>You muſt underſtand that this Compoſt is profitable onely for ſuch ground where bay-ſalt is apt to cauſe fructification, or ſea-ſand, as in divers places in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where they carry it on horſe back divers miles, and find that it maketh a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Improvement: Well, thus may you work, and make as rich a Compoſt as any can be in the world for ground of that nature, Let a place be choſen where there is an Acre of kindly earth, where it may be floated at every ſpring-tide, and afterward the water dryed away by the heat of the Sun, and then ploughed and ſerved ſo many times, till it be as fertile as you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>The like may be done by watering the earth with ſea-wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by ploughing it with ſcoopes all ſummer, or till it be as fertile as you pleaſe; and in ſome parts of <hi>England</hi> the ſea water may be let into the land many miles, for the purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
                  <p>The like may be done by mingling earth with Malt duſt, Pigeons dung, or any other Compoſt, which is found to doe much good with a ſmall quantity, as Malt and other Corn ſpoyled by any accident, may be ground into Meal, and ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with earth, or putrified with the earth, a whole yeare un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, till it be turned into earth. Alſo Lime and dung, or combuſtible earth mixed together, or all three ploughed divers times, for a year, till they be turned into earth, is a rich Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt.</p>
                  <p>If you can find out the true adaptation of this, and of all my other Compoſts, then you may ſave foreſcore pounds in the hundred pounds in the fertilizing of any Arable land in <hi>England,</hi> and alſo you may afford to carry your Compoſt to places and barren grounds far diſtant, which now admit of no improvement within charge, by reaſon of their great diſtance of place.</p>
                  <p>And if the diſtance be very far, then you may try with Bay-ſalt, Saltpeter, Soap diſſolved in hot water, or any other

                  <p>It is found by experience, that where the Salt-peter men do find an old houſe of Office in a dry vault, where no moyſture doth annoy it, there they get their beſt Liquors. Alſo it is found by experience, that Horſe-dung, being putrified, and turned into earth in a dry place, doth likewiſe yeeld much Salt-peter: Alſo it is found by good experience, that Clay walls, made of ſome kind of Clay, doe yeeld great ſtore of Salt-pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which may be ſeen in <hi>Oxford-ſhire</hi> and divers other places, where Pidgeons reſort to the clay walls, and thereby give in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence to the Salt-peter men to ſteep the ſame, who many times finde the liquors ſo rich, that they will ſteepe many pearches in length of ſuch walls, though they make up the walls again at their own charges, according to the Law.</p>
                  <p>By all theſe Experiments joyned together, it ſeemeth that a rich Compoſt either for Land, or for Salt-peter may be made as followeth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt let an little frame of an houſe about four foot high be framed in every mans backſide, as well in Cities as Countrey Towns, and let there be nothing but ſtuds, and thoſe very thin, and let it be length and bigneſs of a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>wpit, or grave, or grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or leſſer at pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Then build a little houſe of Office over it, which be broader than it, to keep it from rain and moyſture. Then make up the walls about a foot thick, with this compoſition of earth
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55779:110"/>
following, and in leſs than a eleven years, all the walls and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure will yeeld either good ſtore of Saltpeter, or a rich earth for Compoſt worth twenty ſhillings a load at the leaſt for the fertilizing of land: If every houſhold have two of theſe houſes, he ſhall never have more trouble but to make uſe of one while the other doth ripen.</p>
                  <p>The walls muſt be made of horſe dung, and ſo much clay as will temper it, and the leſſe the better, ſo that it will hold to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The Clay muſt not be of the nature of Brewers clay, I mean ſuch as will ſtop water, of the Mawmy clay in <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and many other places, which is partly of the nature of Marle, and will break it ſelf, which lying abroad in winter like unto Marle, or Lime, whereby it is diſcovered to contain much ſalt in its compoſition, which if it be well choſen: will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully adde to the richneſſe of the earth, when it is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified fox both uſes, to wit, for Compoſt or Salt-peter at pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>If this work were well put into practiſe, the very ordure of every family might be ſo improved by my new invention, that it would produce as much Corn again as was ſpent in the ſayd houſe in the former yeares; beſides that barren land, and far diſtant from other Compoſt, might this way be made fertile.</p>
                  <p>And for the poorer ſort, whom the charge may be made conſiderable for the building of the houſes, they may lay a load or two of good earth, like a bed in a garden, and cover it from rain, and with a moveable ſtoole or ſeat make this earth as rich as the other.</p>
                  <p>But in all works where Salt-peter is expected, you muſt make a little ditch about the earth which ſhall produce it, or elſe the leaſt moyſture will draw away the Salt-peter, even as the Salt-peter men doe with their Tubs. And if any man would take in hand to build ſuch houſes of Office, in, or near to any Market-place, School Colledge, or other place where there is a great confluence of people, he might gain ſoundly by it, and alſo doe a pleaſure to the Common-wealth. And let no man doubt of this relation, for if the Compoſt be apt
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55779:111"/>
for the land and ſeed, it is marvellous to ſee the increaſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: I had the laſt ſummer 18. for one upon a tryall, which I made with Beere Barly, which doe call Barly, which ſome doe call Barly big; it hath four ſquare eares, and I did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, but ſteeped in blood for one night, and then ſet it at a eleven inches depth, and ſix inches diſtance, and it yeelded more than twice as much as other Corn of the ſame kind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſteeped at all in any thing, and being ſet at the ſame depth and diſtance, and in the ſame ground, on purpoſe to ſee the difference.</p>

                  <p>It is found by experience, that where vegetables dumb, as Ferne, Whinnes, Broom, and the like, have long grown, and dyed upon the ground, and have continued in this courſe of husbandry, or rather ill husbandry for many years, there the earth doth abound with the vegetable ſalt or juice, for the cure whereof it is likewiſe found by experience, that Lime, Bay-ſalt, and Aſhes, and Pidgeons dung, and ſuch like things of hot and binding nature doe poyſon it, and decreaſe the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility. It is likewiſe found by experience, that in ſuch grounds which have been long occupied in good Husbandry, there dung is the beſt Compoſt in the world; the cauſe is, for that by long continuance in ſuch husbandry, the nature of the land is quite changed by the yearly carving of the Corn, Hay, or other crops, whereby the vegetable ſalt or juice is diminiſhed, and contrariwiſe the hot and binding nature doth predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, which require for cure ſalt-peter, dung, blood, and ſuch things wherein the vegetable ſalt or juice predominateth: The middle of theſe natures of ground require Sheeps dung, as of all other moſt temperate, being neither ſo hot and dry as Lime, Bay-ſalt, Aſhes, or Pidgeons dung, nor ſo cold and moyſt as the dung of beaſts, in the room whereof Lime putrified with dung or more earth, as aforeſaid, may ſupply the want thereof very exceedingly.</p>

                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:55779:111"/>The uſe of theſe Obſervations and Experiences may teach us, that all books heretofore written for this purpoſe, are fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous; for they preſcribe ſuch a Compoſt for ſuch an earth, of ſuch a colour, or of ſuch a mixture, as ſand clay, haſel earth, white clay, red clay, white ſand, red ſand, black ſand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas it is found by good experience, that where Lime was the moſt excellent Compoſt in the world about a hundred yeares agoe, there about fifty yeares agoe they were forced to change their Compoſt, and to lay upon the ſame ground half Lime, and half Dung, and now the ſame ground requires the Dung onely, or elſe it will yeeld no Corn, for Lime poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it: yet is not the colour, or quality of the ſame ground in outward viſibility to the eyes corporal, but by the intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual eyes beholden of all men of good underſtanding. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that all men may obtain their deſire in this worke, my counſel is, that the more skilful men, if they take in hand to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove twenty Acres, or more, or leſſe of ſuch land, which they have not formerly tryed fully, that they goe the beſt known way with nineteen Acres the firſt year or two, and make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſeveral tryals in the odde Acres, till they have hit the mark punctually: And as for the more unskilfull, my counſel is, that they doe make divers ſeveral trials in the odde Acre the firſt year, and let the other be uſed as aforetime, till by experience they have learned to improve all the beſt way: By this meanes many notable Improvements may be found out of ineſtimable benefit both to the Farmer, Parſon, and Landlord, and alſo to the whole Common-wealth plenty, without any ſenſible, or conſiderable loſſe to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker.</p>
                  <p>And for the better inſtruction then is contained in any book formerly printed or written of this ſubject, for the Adapta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Compoſt, let this ſuffice for brevitie, <hi>viz.</hi> where the earth is ſubject in the heat of ſummer to chap much, if it be clay, or to burn much if it be ſand, there if you apply Lime, Salt, Aſhes, or Pidgeons dung, or any thing of like hot, and dry nature, there you poyſon it: Alſo where the earth is not apt to chap or burn in the heat of ſummer, there it you apply
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:55779:112"/>
any other thing except Lime, Salt, Aſhes, or Pidgeon dung, or other things of hot and dry nature, there you poyſon that alſo; for as it is a fooliſh thing for a Cook to put more ſalt into the pot, when the pottage were too ſalt before, ſo is it as fond a trick in Husbandry to adde a Compoſt to land wherein that quality predominateth which doth alſo predominate in the land; for Corn and Seeds are as nice in their diet and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment as any Lady in the world, and will not proſper nor draw the nouriſhment if it be never ſo little diſtaſtful, and this is the cauſe, why ſo many times ſo little a quantity of Compoſt doth work ſuch wonderful effects by the exquiſite adaptation to the land or ſeed.</p>
                  <p>Men might eaſily find out an apt Compoſt for ſuch land as hath been <hi>Devonſhired,</hi> and hath ſpent its fertility, which it will do in three years, and then it is reputed nothing worth: I aſſure my ſelf that Lime and combuſtible earth putrified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether will doe the feat, yea and that with a ſmall quantity, if it be diſperſed by my Invention.</p>

                  <p>Although I have ſhewed in the Chapter of the Sheep how this diſeaſe may be infallibly prevented, yet in regard that ſometimes through negligence of Servants, and ſometimes through want of ſound grounds to remove them to, at ſuch times as I have preſcribed, this diſeaſe will happen in your flocks, I will ſhew a certain cure, although ſomewhat coſtly, and when I have done I will ſhew you the charge how it may be regained with great advantage: Well then, a little after <hi>Midſummer,</hi> if the Months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> have proved very moyſt and rainy (for elſe you need not to trouble your ſelves at all) then take a view of your ſheep ſomewhat ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly;

if you find by the colour of their eyes, that they have caught that diſeaſe, then thus you muſt proceed.

This may be done in a Corrt-yard, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, where an houſe cannot be had; but then you cannot ſo well recover your charges again, which muſt be done after this manner, <hi>viz</hi> you muſt lay in the houſe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver good Arable earth for Wheat, and once in three or four daies le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There is a cauſe why Sheep that are folded doe rot more violently than thoſe which are not folded, though they feed upon the ſame grounds, for that they are more hungry many times by being reſtrained of their free liberty to feed at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they doe devour the rawiſh, ſowriſh, and hurtfull graſſe with more greedineſſe, and are leſſe prone to be nice in their diet, and to refuſe that ſort which is moſt pleaſing to their nature, therefore it ſeemeth to be a good way to let them goe at liberty in the Months of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> in ſuch yeares as thoſe Moneths of <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> prove very moyſt and rainy; for it is leſſe trouble and charge to prevent a diſeaſe than to cure it afterwards.</p>

                  <p>It is ſound by experience, that when three or four yeares comes together wherein Corn proſpereth well, then it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſo cheap that the poor Farmer is undone: Again, if the unreaſonableneſs of the weather croſſe it a year or two, then it becometh ſo dear that the poor people are half ſtarved. To remedy this inconvenience I know no better way than to inſtruct Corn-hoarders, who though they uſually be none of the beſt Common-wealths men, yet they doe ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Dearth, that it is not ſo violent as elſe it would be.</p>
                  <p>Well then, thus may we doe, make a boarded floor about a yard or two high, and as broad and as long as ye pleaſe; then ſet ledges about it, ſo that no Mice nor Rats can climb up: then in Harveſt make a Rick of Corn upon it, which may be kept three or four years without loſſe or trouble. If when Winter is paſt Corn be very cheap, then would I have all the richeſt Farmers, who are able to forbear their money, to thraſh up the moſt part of their other Corn, and to take down the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Rick, and to make it up again with a leere of thraſhed Corn, with chaffe and all together, by which meanes he may lay up a wonderfull great quantity in a little room, and have his Straw for his preſent uſe, and withall the poorer ſort of Farmers may have a better ſale for their Corn to pay their rents withall.</p>
                  <p>And as for Cities and Corporate Towns, I would have all Houſholders of good ability to keep a yeares proviſion of Corn before hand, and not to ſpend it till time of dearth, by which means the dearth will not be ſo grievous when it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and alſo the cheapneſſe in time of plenty will not ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A friend of mine propounded to the City of <hi>London</hi> to ſhew them a way how they might keep a thouſand quarters of Corn in ſuch a floor where now they can keep a hundred, by ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Corn with great Beans, exceeding hard dryed on a kiln, which may be ſeparated eaſily with a wire Trie, and are as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable as the Wheat, and that they ſhould be eaſed of the charges of turning Corn in the ſtore-houſes.</p>

                  <head>The tenth Experiment, wherein is ſhewed the natural cauſe why the changing of Seed corn produceth an improvement; alſo certain wayes for the melioration of Seeds and Fruits.</head>
                  <p>It is found by experience, that if Seed-wheat be brought from barren, and ſtony land, and ſown upon rich clay ground, it proſpereth wonderfully, the cauſe is double: Firſt the Corn that groweth upon a barren land, is more plump and full than that which groweth upon very rich land, and therefore hath
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55779:115"/>
more force to encreaſe. Secondly, the Corn that growth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtony land hath attracted plentifully the <hi>Juter,</hi> or petrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaltiſh nature, which falling into another earth, where that ſubſtance is wanting, ſtandeth in ſtead not onely of ſeed, but alſo of compoſt.</p>
                  <p>The like might be ſhewed in many other works of this kind, but I wiſh that this may ſerve to give light to the reſt: As for the meliorating of Seeds and Fruits, the former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſheweth the way; for there is in every compounded ſubſtance in the world a double kind of fatneſs or ſulphur, the one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s apt to putrifie the other, not ſo apt, but endureth longer without putrifaction: this may be ſeen in Cabbages, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Garden fruits, growing near great Cities where dung is plentiful, which if they be boyled in water, and the water kept a little time, it will ſtink ſooner than that wherein the like ſtuffe hath been boyled which growed in grounds more barren.</p>
                  <p>Whereby it appeareth that the extream fatting of ground with dung doth in ſome ſort adulterate the ſeeds and fruits, and <hi>piſorate</hi> their quality, and contrariwiſe the ſowing the ſame in more barren earth, doth meliorate the quality of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the beſt way is to ſow, ſet, or plant ſeeds in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren land, for ſeeds onely; for by that meanes they will get a greater melioration in their quality when they are intended for ſeed than the <hi>poſoration</hi> can be in the ſowing them in earth much enriched with dung; for in all rich dunged earth the attractive virtue of the ſeed draweth much of the fatneſs, which is not much putrified, whereby it declineth from its former virtue and goodneſſe. The one of theſe fatneſſes is gratefull to humane nature, the other is offenſive for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyding of which inconvenience I know none better than to let the dung be fully putrified, and turned into earth without ſtnking, before it be mingled with the Corn or Seeds.</p>
                  <p>And this may be done by my former Inventions, in ſuch ſort that there may be above foreſcore pounds in the hundred ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:55779:116"/>
in the Compoſt of all the Arable land in <hi>England.</hi> There are three cauſes why people in the Country live longer, and have better health than thoſe that live in great Cities: The firſt is, the aire is more pure and wholſome: The ſecond is their food doth not abound ſo much with the fatneſs and ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, which is apt to putrifaction, and to contaminate the blood: The third is their much exerciſe doth evacuate that part of their nutriment which is ungrateful to humane nature.</p>
                  <p>The contrary to all theſe is in great Cities, where the aire, dyet, and exerciſe are ſo much different, the effect doth ſhew the cauſe very clear, ſo that there need no other or further philoſophation concerning the ſame.</p>
                  <p>If any man doubt whether vegetables draw the corruptible or ſtinking ſulphur, or fatneſs which lyeth within the reach of their attractive virtue, let him behold the places, where beaſts have lately dunged in Paſtures, and he ſhall finde that there the graſſe is more ſowre and giſtaſtfull to the Beaſts and Cattle.</p>

                  <p>It is found by experience, that where there is a good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War, there the kingdom is well defended; and where there is good regularity in Divinity, there the ſoul is preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from ſickneſs: Why ſhould it not be ſo for the ſtate temporal, if a council of Husbandry was erected whereupon the happineſs of all kingdoms doth depend?

                  <p>The Plebeans are like thoſe in <hi>Ireland</hi> who will not lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide their old cuſtom, to draw their horſes by the tayls, though an Act be made againſt it, nor lay aſide the burning their Corn in the ſtraw to ſave the labour of thraſhing, though their houſes lye unthatched. I have known ſome Parſons in Pariſhes which have been skilful in Agriculture, and have been
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:55779:117"/>
excellent Improvers of land, and ſome that were good phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, and have done much good in their Country that way. I have alſo known ſome Landlords qualified with the ſame skils, and certainly if all were ſo, it would conduce greatly to the proſperity of a Kingdome, for the greateſt profit would redound to thoſe two ſorts of men, yet may the marter be eaſily ordered ſo that the reſt might live in twice as much proſperity as now they do, and though they were doubled in number: for I have known many men to live better with 30. acres of land than others have done with an hundred of acres; and if need require I can ſhew where one acre of land hath been worth two hundred pound <hi>per an</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by being planted with Mellons, and a whole family have lived well upon it, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered riches. If the courſe of Husbandry were regulated in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> That no man ſhould occupy any land in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture whoſe fertility may perpetually be encreaſed by the means of water, though the hay growing thereupon were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſpent, to produce dung for the fertilizing of high grounds: Alſo that no man ſhould occupy any land in Tillage, whoſe fertility may be perpetually increaſed in Paſture by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame dung ſpent upon them which they yeeld natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally: Alſo that no man ſhould Till any other land but ſuch high and barren land as is not able to fertilize it ſelfe, and ſhould make uſe of my ſeveral Inventions for the enriching of the ſame. Then would there be left but little barren land in <hi>England</hi> in a ſhort ſpace, whereby all the premiſes in this twelfth Experiment might be eaſily performed.</p>
                  <p>A friend of mine did ſearch divers Regiſter books in ſeveral Pariſhes in <hi>England,</hi> he alſo ſearched the Parſons bookes of Tythes, and found that where Arable land as turned into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture there were fewer Chriſtnings, and many more tyth Lambs and tyth Calves, whereby he diſcovered a kinde of Witchcraft, which is to turn men into beaſts. To diſſolve this Witchcraft there is no other way, but to goe the contrary way; and whereas the Landlord found more gain in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of ſheep and beaſts than formerly he found in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of people, to ſhew a way how more gain may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew

to the Landlord by the increaſe of people than formerly he found in the increaſe of beaſts; and ſurely this is no hard task; for if the peoples employments be well regulated, there will come more profit a great deal than by beaſts. And if there be any doubt whether people may be had to improve the land, and to produce greater profit than beaſts can doe, let but things be ſo ordered that the Plebeans may have ſuch good employments whereby they may maintain a married e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate plentifully, and it will be found by a ſhort experience, there will be no want of ſervants. By this means the Parſons may double their tyths, the Landlord may double his rents, and the common people, though doubled in number, may live twice as well as they did before, and Princes and Stateſmen ſhall not have half the trouble which they had before; for want and neceſſity is found to produce grudgings and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments: Theſe have produced Rebellions and Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all which have cauſed Princes for to loſe their kingdoms many times, and turned the ſtate of Countries topſey turvey.

Thirdly, in populous Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where there is difficulty of living, the pure law of nature is not obſerved in Marriages and married eſtates, but other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects doth ſway overmuch, which cauſeth defects in many generations.

                  <p>It is found by experience, that if the kernel of a Pear or Apple be ſet and not grafted, but be let grow to a great tree, then it will not bear fruit till forty or fifty yeares, as a great number of other trees of the ſame kind.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe found by experience, that a Siens taken from a tree that is fruitfull, and alſo from the moſt fruitful bough of that tree, and being grafted into a young ſtock of the ſame kind, as that before mentioned, will bear fruit in a quarter of the time which the other did, the cauſe can be no other but that nature hath ordained a certain time for propagation in all things, but yet the ſaid time was accelerated in the graſſed

                  <p>So that every one may make choice of theſe two wayes at pleaſure; and if he aim at his preſent profit, then graffing is his preſent way and beſt; but if he aim at the profit of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, then it is beſt not to graft at all.</p>
                  <p>And by this means he may change the taſts of fruits at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which by graffing he cannot doe; for it is found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that if three kernels of ſeveral ſorts be put into the cave of a Bean-ſtalk cut half an inch long above a knot, and ſo ſet it will bear a fruit contrary in colour, taſt, and form, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to any one of them: Alſo by this means he may exalt the nature and excellencie thereof at pleaſure, if about the root thereof he make three or four little holes in the earth, and now and then with a little Fennel and a ſpoon he put into the holes a little of the beſt new wort, wherein hath been boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little Cinamon, Cloves, Mace, Sugar, or any other ſubſtance of excellent taſt and odour.</p>
                  <p>For as it is found by experience, that any evil neutriment doth ſpoil, yea &amp; ſometimes poiſon the thing nouriſhed, ſo any excellent nutriment doth wonderfully advance the goodneſſe and excellency thereof. And after that theſe trees are come to age of maturity to be fruitful; then the Siens taken thence will be perpetual, and able to fill the whole Country with fruits of the ſame kind, and by ſuch means as theſe there is no queſtion but all theſe varieties of excellent fruits were obtained in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; for it cannot be thought but that at the firſt, when there was none but wild fruits, there could neither be ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties, nor yet fruits of ſuch excellency.</p>

                  <head>The fifteenth Obſervation and Experiment, ſhewing how it may be ordered that Corn ſhall never be exceeding cheap to the great prejudice of the Farmer, nor exceeding dear to the grievance of the buyer.</head>
                  <p>It is found by experience that when Barley is at two ſhillings
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:55779:119"/>
the buſhel, or under, then an Acre, and ſo twenty Acres of land may be manured with Malt more cheap than with dung, if it he worth ſix pence a load, and to be carried half a mile, and this is true if after the common manner the Malt be ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt the Wheat, as they uſe to doe with Pidgeons dung: Malt duſt, rags, ſhavings of horn, ſalt-peter, bay-ſalt, or any other thing which is potent and effectual for multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Now let every man judge of how great conſequence this Experiment will be, if by my new Invention the Malt be diſperſed into the holes where the Wheat is ſet, ſo that it all lye within the attractive virtue of the Corn, for then none will be loſt, and by this means an acre of land may be manured with ſo much Corn as is uſually caſt away by the accuſtomed manner of ſowing more than by ſetting.</p>
                  <p>And the reaſon why Malt is ſo much better than Corn, is becauſe that by drying upon the kiln the vegetative ſpirit is killed, and by the Malting the nutritive virtue is opened and advanced, and it mattereth not of what Corn the Malt is made, as of Barly, Peaſe, Beans, Oats, Fetches, or Buck-wheat, or whatſoever is cheapeſt; for by this means it is converted into the ſubſtance of the Wheat together with the benefit of the multiplication, neither is it material whether the Maſt be ground or not, eſpecially for Wheat, or any Corn ſown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore winter, for that in due time it will be diſſolved and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, ſo that by little and little it may be aſſimilated.</p>
                  <p>I have found by experience, that when I have taken the great piked Wheat, my increaſe hath been doubled more than with the ſmaller ſort, the reaſon can be no other, but that ſuch Wheat is both Seed and Compoſt. I have alſo put into every hole with the Wheat ſeven or eight Malt-cornes, and then increaſe was four or five, yea ſixe times more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed than before, and this ſeven or eight Malt-corns being ſo diſperſed by my Engine into every hole is quickly done, and amounteth to no more Corn than is uſually caſt away in ſowing more than is needful in ſetting.</p>
                  <p>Now the uſe to be made of this Experience for the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of cheapneſſe, is to make a great uſe thereof in time of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:55779:120"/>
exceeding plenty, and to keep much dung in ſtore for another year; this with the practiſe of ingroſſing and hoarding up of Corn, taught before, will prevent immoderate cheapneſs, and preſerve many an honeſt poor Farmer from poverty.</p>
                  <p>And howſoever I ſhall not be free from the aſperſion of the ignorant Plebeans for this my attempt, yet I regard them not, being devoted to the univerſal benefit of all, and let them be pleaſed to underſtand that every cheap year is but a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of a dear one, unleſs that this courſe be taken, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that much Corn ground is uſually upon ſuch occaſions turned into Paſture, when as the Farmers find more gain in converting the fruits of the earth into Beef, Mutton, Butter, Cheeſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then by turning them into Corn.</p>
                  <p>And let them be pleaſed alſo to take notice of the Statute made in the reign of King <hi>James</hi> of happy memory, which alloweth Engroſſers to hoard up Corn for no other purpoſe but this, which Statute I wiſh all men, that can ſpare their money, to take notice, and to maſte uſe of the ſame for their own advantage, as wel as for the publick benefit, and let them not doubt of their gain, which muſt needs prove certain how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, yea though nature ſhould divers years together prove a loving Nurſe, and not play the Step-mother by adminiſtring too much rain or too much drought, or too little of either, which is ſometimes ſeen three or four years together, though very ſeldom, and if it happen ſo, yet by turning the Arable land into Graſſe, it hath alwaies come to paſſe, as I have diligent<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly obſerved for many years, that the price of Corn hath been doubled at the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>Now that I have done with the preventions of cheapneſſe, I will proceed to the preventions of dearth, which may be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done by the ſtoring of Corn, and partly by my new Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the expeditious ſetting of Corn, which is ſo eaſie and quick for diſpatch, that he that hath an ordinary plowland, <hi>viz.</hi> ſixty acres in Tillage may ſet it all in due time, and pay his charges with the fourth part of the money, which he may ſell his corn for preſently, beſides the increaſe of the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crop, which wil be a third part more at leaſt, and will come in a good time; for it is never ſeen, that corn is very cheap, the next year after a dear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:55779:120"/>And by this meanes a good Farmer may ſow twenty quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in his ſeed corn, which is worth twice as much mony as it is other yeares, and how much corn will be thus ſowed in the whole kingdom, I lean to the eſtimation of all men, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that they will confeſs that if every Farmer keep theſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; ready for ſuch times, howſoever they make not ſo great uſe thereof in time of exceeding cheapneſs, that it may well be called ſtore-corn, and is more effectual, and preſerveth greater abundance of Corn for the prevention of dearth, then all the ſtore-houſes that ever were in the world.</p>
                  <p>I have taken the more pains and diligence in the penning of this diſcourſe, becauſe I beheld the mercileſs dealing of men one with another upon all advantages; for if corn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper well, then the buyers will cauſe the price to fall twice as much as much as the plenty requireth in equity; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of Corn do fail never ſo little extraordinary, then the ſellers will inhaunce the price double at the leaſt to that which a good conſcience requireth.</p>

            <head>A Philoſophical Letter concerning Vegetation or the Cauſes of Fruitfulneſs.</head>
            <p>I Shall a little tell you what my thoughts are about Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and what I have within my ſelf inſtituted.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I have framed a pretty large Induction upon common and familiar Experiments, to demonſtrate that without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie Salt is the ſeat of life and vegetation, and ſo the ſubject of nutrition. And this being aſſented to, it is in the next place to be conſidered whether Salt as Salt be this ſubject, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all Salts equally nouriſh? Here comes in an examination of Salt by their Tribes, as 1. Nitrous Salt, 2 Urinous Salt, in which are comprehended, 3. all Dungs, Horns, Shreads and the like; 4. Common Salt, and Sea ſand; 5. Kaly Salt, as Aſhes, Kelpes, Mineral Salts, as of Stones or Lime, of Marl, Chalk, Fullers-earth, Vitriol.</p>
            <p>And becauſe ſome Salts doe kill, as that of Vitriol, alſo that of Stones and Lime, if applyed in quantity and to the plant it ſelf immediately. Hence comes the examination of Salts further, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether any Salt doth univerſally nouriſh all Plants, and make them thrive, or whether ſome doe beſt agree with one, others with another, and upon the clear determination of this, and this ſolely doth the great ſecret of Imbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ition depend, if we ſpeak of things rationally, and not like Mountebanks. But here two knots offer themſelves, and will do ſo whether we will or no.</p>
            <p>Firſt ſeeing you cannot ſow, ſet, or plant any Vegetable or Seed in ſalt alone, but muſt require two other <hi>Media,</hi> viz. Water to diſſolve and make ſluyd the particles of Salt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the pores of the Plant or Seed may be capable of it, and admit it. 2. Earth as a fit <hi>uterus</hi> or <hi>matrix</hi> to keep the thing planted ſteady. Hence a ſcruple ariſeth, what is earth abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55779:123"/>
conſidered, for either it is and or ſalt, or water, or ſome other body. If Sand, whence comes its clammineſs and aptneſs to ſod together? If Salt, whether is that a peculiar ſalt, and whether can it be ſeparated or not from it? If Water, how comes it to be unable to nouriſh without addition ſtil of moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture. If earth be none of all theſe, what is it, and what is its property, and whether hath it any Energy? And indeed this is a very neceſſary enquiry; for my Imbibitions ſignifie nothing if my earth be beforehand impregnated with another ſalt of perhaps a much different nature than what my plant imbibed doth require: And how ſhall I know this, when all Inquiries about the natures of earth, their ſeveral ſalts, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, their uſes, and neceſſity for Germination, and their ſeveral wayes of compoſition and correction is wholly lame and unſought after.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is to be conſidered, that Water, eſpecially Rain-water, hath life in it ſelf without any addition of Salt or Earth, as is moſt apparent as by many Experiments, ſo by that famous and commonly known one in <hi>Africks,</hi> That Rain-water in four and twenty hours will ba full of Inſects, that it will putrifie. Now if even Rain-water it ſelf be ſufficient for life, and do contain manifeſtly a vital ſalt in it, what is the need of thoſe other Salts which ſeem more remote from a life or vitality of diſpoſition.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As no poſſibility of nouriſhment, nor any approach to Vegetation without moyſture, ſo no poſſibility of life without an excitation and production of it by an actual warmth, and this is as well ſeen in vegetables as in Animals: For the earth is there, the ſalt is there, and the water is there, yet in ſharp and cold weather vegetation is not to be effected. Hence on the other ſide produceth nothing ſimply, unleſſe in a ſoyl firſt ſited, and cold it ſelf, though not a fit ſeaſon for Germina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet permits of nutrition to many plants, who have even their luſtre then, as the Cypreſs, the Firre, the Bay, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other.

            <p>Secondly, he muſt ſeriouſly weigh, whether the ſubject of Fermentation and things that ſerve to excite and entertain heat be not of one kind, ſubject of nutrition of another.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whether Fermentation being no other than a <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of Motion, there may not be divers ſorts of it ariſing from the nature and diverſity of the Salts or other ſubjects which cauſe it: And whether according to this divers motion the ſubject of Nutrition, having in it alſo a vitall principle, may not be diſpoſed more or leſſe, to take this or that figure?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, he muſt reſolve the ſeveral Caſualties, as I may call them, of Vegetation, as why the earth puts forth ſome Plants <hi>ſponte,</hi> not other? why it very ſeldom puts forth ſome, unleſs it be in producing of others, as <hi>Botanists</hi> can tell you, that many Plants are rarely, or never found unleſs in ploughed fields, either under Corn and Tillage, or under Fallow, why water ſhould put forth Plants that will not at all grow in the earth? Why on the other ſide ſome plants deſtroy even the Vegetative virtue, as it were in the ſoyl where they are, as to many Plants, as is manifeſt in Hemp and in Oade. Theſe, Sir, are the Inſtitutes I ſet my ſelf to in the point of Husbandry. In the ignorance of any of which, I think a man knows ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily very little. They are rudely ſet down, but may afford ground of larger diſcourſes. If you ſhall pleaſe either to chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh or excite this humour in me, by laying or propounding of ſomething further for promoting of vegetation upon theſe comprehenſive grounds, I ſhall not refuſe to deal very freely with you, if you will afford me an occaſion by letting me have the thoughts of ſome better wits than mine own upon them.</p>

            <p>J Have read the Book of Husbandry thorow, being very much delighted with the many profitable ingenious and promiſing Inventions ſpecified therein, I wiſhing that I were a Farmer in the Country, to play the practical Philoſopher. I remember in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> being a youth, I was wont to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he was no Natural Philoſopher, that could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his Tillage, order his cattel, fiſhing, fowling affairs with more dexterity, and to greater profit then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man that pretends no skill in Phyſick. This I ſpeak from what I have read ſomewhere in <hi>Ramus,</hi> who referred all Arts to profitable uſe in mans life, abhoring the vain oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the ſophiſticated Univerſities. The mention
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:55779:124"/>
which is made of Experiments of fructification by Salt, confirmes me in an opinion, that the Sea is as the heart of the World, whence the waters run by low and ſecret waies into the earth, as by Arteries carrying the vitality of Salt into the body of the whole earth, wherewith it hath loſt its met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and vigour, and is become freſh, it returnes again by the Rivers as by veins into the Sea, to receive a new fructifying and quickning tincture, by the way ſerving to allay the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions that Animals finde in themſelves by the over-activity of Salt, which we call quenching of thirſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have long thought of this, being moved thereunto at firſt by conſidering the like motion of blood in the Microcoſine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as here the heart reſembles the Sea, the motion of the blood the ebbing and flowing and circular motion of the Sea waters: for the blood being ſalted in the heart, and ſpirited with ſubtle Nitre or Gunpowder, it by the Arteries in a more ſecret paſſage (like that of the Sea waters into the earth) is diſtributed through the body, where having ſpent its vigour and metal, it by the high and viſible way of the veins, lying on the ſurface of our earth, is returned to the heart again to be freſh pickled, I doubted of the truth of this, till I read your book, becauſe I remembred that I had read of ſowing the ground with ſalt in the Iſraelitiſh wars, which I had heard interpreted to make it barren, and becauſe I have heard the old women ſay, it will make hearbs dye to have urine to fall upon them.</p>

At laſt I reſolved, and did lay to this eaſie Poulteſſe <hi>(viz.)</hi> White Bread Chewed in my own mouth to a kinde of pap or ſoft paſte: I chewed ſo much as bound both my feet about of all ſides; I went to bed, and fell faſt aſleep for two or three houres (which I had not done in all the time before.) The next morning when I waked, my pain was gone: And (I thank God) I was never troubled with it ſince.</p>
               <p>Another time being ſtruck with a (new ſhod) ſton'd horſe, juſt on the ſhin-bone, my legge ſwel'd ſo that my boot was fain to be cut off: I layd this to it when I went to bed, and next day the pain was gone, yet to this day there is the mark.</p>
               <p>Divers green wounds I have cured with it.</p>
               <p>My hand was bitten through by a mad dog, I ſayd this only to it, and healed it in three or four daies.</p>
               <p>I have by applying this ſix times ſo mollified a Corn upon my toe, that I after took it out core and root and all, and never any more grew in the place.</p>
               <p>I took once a very great cold, which ſwel'd all my throat on both ſides under the chin, and broke into a foul <hi>ſorance</hi> like the Kings Evill. I applyed this, and took it away in two or three dayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:55779:129"/>For many years together I was troubled with an old pain in my ſhoulder, cauſed by ſome ſtrein the pain was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies but onely when I did ſuddenly and violently lift up my arm as to ſtrike or through a ſtone or the like, by applying this I took it away.</p>
               <p>And laſtly ſince you commanded me to give you this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, as I was with a great hook pruning a tree in my Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, I ſtruck the point of it by miſchance into the nail of my Thumb, above a quarter of an inch almoſt through, and in two or three renuings of this ſalve (God be praiſed) 'tis very well.</p>
               <p>And leaſt it ſhould be ſaid or conceived that this Medicine would cure none but my ſelf, I have alſo experimented it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on divers others; for example, Once I applied it to a mans leg that was ſo ſwelled and putrified, that he had divers great and deep holes therein, and all over nothing but moſt filthy rottenneſſe, it was conceived to be a Gangrean how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever under God this cured it.</p>
               <p>Once I applied it to my ſervant, that was run into the very joynt of the knee with a ruſty Rapier, and for want of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, did feſter exceedingly; inſomuch that the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgians ſpoke of cutting it off, howſoever under God it did cure him, although he did come at his wife in the time of the cure.</p>
               <p>Once a Maid of my Siſters received a very violent blow with the handle of a double draw well, it was black and blew (as they call it) from the Elbow to the Shoulder, for it hit her upon the Brawn of the Arm, yet under God, I cured her in a day or two with this onely.</p>
               <p>My wife had the end of her Thumb ſorely bruiſed or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, between the Wheel and the Nut of my Engine, as it was in ſwift and ſtrong motion, and applying nothing but this, ſhe was well in a ſmall time (God be praiſed.)</p>
               <q>Cum multis alijs.</q>
               <p>The quality of it is (ſlowly but certainly) to ſtench blood, to eaſe pain, to draw out any poiſon or a thorn, and to heal up and make ſound the place grieved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:55779:129"/>But ſome men by intemperance, or evil conſtitution of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, are harder to heal then others.</p>
               <p>If you lay it to any ſound place it works nothing. This I teſtifie for truth upon my own knowledge.</p>

               <p>J See no defect in this Proceſſe, if by thrice fermenting the taſt of the hony will be taken away. It is no matter what quantities of Water and Yeſt you uſe, provided there be Yeſt enough to make it work, which every Brewer knowes, and experience will eaſily ſhew it: And for your Water, you may take as much as will make it either ſtrong or ſmall, as you deſire it; for the quantity of water will no way ſpoyle the buſineſſe. But I am not of their mind who think it may beſt be brewed in ſmall veſſels, for they are not fit for the purpoſe. For my part I would never try it in a leſſe veſſel than a barrel, for experience ſhews that drink will work beſt in great veſſels. <hi>Glanber</hi> knows how to precipitate Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins and Honey ſo as to take away the taſt of them, and to make the liquor taſt like Wine, but I could never get it from him; yet I gueſſe he doth it with Tartar, or Lees of Wine.</p>

               <p>I Have not been inſenſible of the obligation which a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer promiſe laid upon me, which was to give you an account of the proceed and profit which I made of a ſmall quantity of ground by Clover graſſe, which I could not compleat much ſooner, in regard that it is not long ſince I ſold the laſt of my ſeed, ſo that unleſſe I ſhould have ſet a ſuppoſitory value, upon part of it, I could not draw

the account to a perfect head till then; for every thing—<hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum valet quantum vendi potest,</hi>— and prizes of all commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities ebbe and flow. I will not injure this Husbandry ſo much, as to have you think that it can receive a true cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter from my experiment, for I muſt not be aſhamed to own many errors committed therein, which were the effects of my general unskilfulneſſe in Georgick, and was not eaſie to be prevented where there were no practical guides extant, nor any veſtigia's thereof to be found, but what were track<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſcovered by the book thereof, firſt publiſhed by you, and you well know the difficulty of putting Theory wel in practice. I have heard of ſome in <hi>England</hi> that have made almoſt an incredible profit of it, much more then I have been ſenſible of, but yet I find the improvement ſo conſiderable, that I am much incouraged to proceed in it; the particulars are as followeth. The ground I planted contained little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove two acres, I ſowed 15 pound of ſeed upon an acre, the charge I was at all manner of waies was five pound, which was more then repaid by that Summers crop of Barley. The next year the 28. of <hi>May,</hi> I mowed the Clover, there was two loads upon it, for which I refuſed five pounds. The next crop I let ſtand for ſeed, which was ripe in <hi>Auguſt</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing when I cut it, and had three very great loads, which I reckon at nine pound, as that yeer went, I had 300 <hi>l.</hi> of ſeed ſome of which I ſold for 16 <hi>d.</hi> the pound, ſome more, the whole profit of that year I caſt to be 30 <hi>l.</hi> beſides the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſture.

Concerning the Husbandry of clover-ſeed.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>UNtill now I could not be ſo throughly informed (by the party that writes the incloſed) what he hath found (in his ſeveral ways of practiſe) to be the beſt way and time for ſowing this Clover-graſs ſeed, and how, and where I might be furniſht with the beſt and beſt cheap, which hath retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this my thankfull anſwer to your kind Letter, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſhewed me ſome that he ſowed laſt year thin, amongſt other good Engliſh hay duſt, upon bare rubbiſh earth (in <hi>North-hampton,</hi> where he had demoliſhed ſome of the Bulwarks:) Which now is throughly covered and hath a full freſh bite of very rich green ſward thus early; but I find the Clover-graſſe ſeed would have Corn thicker, but that the other Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ordinary hay-duſt (being as he thinks more natural for our climate) doth choke the other, wherein I differ in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him; for it's apparently higher and ranker, and over-ſpreads the other much. This Clover-ſeed was of his own growing, in a little piece of ground in his Orchard very good, which he mowed twice the laſt year, <hi>viz.</hi> about <hi>Midſummer,</hi> and about a fortnight after St. <hi>James</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſowed on the 6<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> laſt before, and yet he did not cut it untill it afforded ſeed both cuttings, and he beleeves the laſt cutting afforded rather more and better then the firſt, and that little (ſowed of it ſelf) is long enough (but that it is not ripe enough) to be mowed now. He beleeves the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:55779:134"/>
ſeed that is of his own, that comes of the Dutch ſeed, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as good if not better then the Dutch ſeed, Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſowed ſome Dutch ſeed laſt yeer there, ſome in his garden, and about an acre or two with barley, upon a red ſandy ground in his cloſe by his garden, that was worn out of heart with bearing too many crops of Corn, and I viewed them both laſt week, and I found that ſowed in his Garden to be throughly ſwarded, and was (as they told me) mowed the laſt year, and is now again in as forward a condition as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſowed in his Garden: But that ſowed with Barley is ſcarce ſo forward, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſowed with ordinary hay ſeed as aforeſaid, and it comes not much thicker, and is in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter danger to be eaten out with Scutch graſs, that ſuch kind of ground (worn out of heart:) is apt to breed, ſo that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſideration of the whole matter, I think the beſt way for me would be to ſow it alone without Barley, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this moneth, which cannot now be done this year, unleſſe I had been provided of ſeed earlier; beſides Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſaith it will be hard to get good ſeed ſo late, eſpecially new ſeed which is beſt to be had at <hi>Candlemas,</hi> and much cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then now, for he ſaith (when he was at <hi>London,</hi> which was a little before I was with you) new ſeed was riſen from 8 <hi>d.</hi> the pound to 1 <hi>s.</hi> and before he came out of Town dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer; but when new was at 1 <hi>s.</hi> they offered him old ſeed for 6 <hi>d.</hi> and he is confident it may be had at half the price of new at any time. I ſend you in Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s. Letter, ſome of the beſt kind of new ſeed, by which ſample (if you be not skild) you may know old from new.</p>

               <head>Sir <hi>Richard Weſtons</hi> more ſpecial directions for the beſt ordering of Clover-graſſe.</head>
               <p>CLover-graſs Seed thrives beſt when you ſow it in the worſt and barrenneſt ground. Such as our worſt heath ground is in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ground is thus to be prepared for the Seed.</p>
               <p>Firſt pare off the heath; then make the paring into little hils; you may put to one hill as much paring as comes off from a Rod or Pole of ground, which is the ſquare of ſixteen feet and a half.</p>
               <p>The hils being ſufficiently made and prepared (as they doe in <hi>Devonſhiring</hi> as we call it) are to be fir'd and burnt into aſhes. And unto the aſhes of every hill you muſt put a peck of unſlaked Lime; the Lime is to be covered over with the aſhes, and ſo to ſtand till rain comes and ſlakes the Lime. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that mingle your aſhes and lime together, and ſo ſpread it over your land.</p>
               <p>This done; either againſt, or ſhortly after rain, plough and ſow; ploughing not above four inches deep and not in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, but as plain as you can, and to make yet plainer, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row afterwards, and with buſhes under your harrows.</p>
               <p>The ground being thus prepar'd you may ſow your ſeeds. An Acre of ground will take about ten pounds of your Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver graſſe-ſeed, which is in meaſure ſomewhat more than half a peck. The chief ſeaſons of ſowing it are <hi>April</hi> or the latter end of <hi>March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the firſt of <hi>June</hi> it will be ready to be cut. It yeelds moſt excellent hay. The time of cutting it will be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly known, by obſerving when it begins to knot: For that is the time: And ere the year be done, it will yeeld you three of thoſe crops, all of them very good hay; and after you have thus cut it the third time, you may then feed the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55779:135"/>
ground with Cattel, all the Winter as you do other ground.</p>
               <p>But if you intend to preſerve Seed, then muſt you expect but two crops that year, and you muſt cut the firſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the foreſaid directions. But the ſecond growth muſt be let ſtand, till the Seed of it be come to a full and dead ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and then muſt you cut it, and threſh the tops, and ſo preſerve the Seed, you ſhall have at the leaſt five buſhels of Seed from every Acre.</p>
               <p>This Seed thus threſhed off, there will be left long ſtalks, theſe your Cattel will eat; but when they grow old and hard you are to boil thoſe ſtalks, and make a maſh of them, and it will be very nouriſhing, either for hogs or any thing that will eat thereof.</p>
               <p>After the ſecond cutting for ſeed, you muſt cut it that year no more; but as it ſprings again, feed it with Cattel. One Acre of it will feed you as many Cows, as ſix ordinary Acres, and you will find your Milk much richer; which induces ſome not to cut it at all, but onely to graze it for their Dayry.</p>
               <p>Being once ſowed, it will laſt five years, and then being ploughed, it will yeeld three or four years together, rich crops of Wheat, and after that a crop of Oats.</p>
               <p>And as the Oats begin to come up, then ſow it with the Clover-ſeed (which is in it ſelf excellent Manure) for that you need not beſtow any new dreſſing upon the ground, and by that time you have cut your Oats, you will find a delicate graſſe grown up underneath, upon which if you pleaſe, you may graze with Cattel or horſe all that year after, and the next year take your crops as before at pleaſure.</p>

               <head>Some Doubts and Queres concerning the aforeſaid directions propounded in a Letter from <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Have diſperſed that Paper (of Sir <hi>Ri. Westons</hi> Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) you did me the favour to ſend me about the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry of Clover, and I am to return you humble thanks for it, though there doth remain a very matterial ſcruple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, which is:</p>
               <p>That if they ſow it with the Barley or Oats, it muſt needs ſpring up and be ripe before the Barley, and conſequently at the mowing of the Barley will either be mixt with it, ſo as not well to be ſeparated, or muſt be trodden down and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by it.</p>
               <p>This I being not able to anſwer muſt intreat you to take a little pains to ſatisfie me, and to communicate what you have experimentally been informed concerning it.</p>
               <p>I am to ſolicite you alſo in the name of ſome young Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen and other Improvers here, to procure them a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of choice, good, new and excellent Clover-ſeed, who are reſolved according as this takes, ſo to follow that Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry. As therefore the good ſucceſſe of this, will much incourage our young Undertakers, ſo if this Seed ſhould prove bad and not thrive, it would as much diſcountenance all our new Projectors.</p>

                  </gap> make concerning the ſowing of Clover with other Corn, I can ſay that onely, which my experience hath taught me, <hi>viz.</hi> That Poliſh Oats are the beſt Corn to be ſown with Clover about the middle of <hi>April,</hi> two buſhels and a half, or three buſhels of Oats will be enough, which yeelding a middle crop of Oats at harveſt will ſhadow the Clover from the heat of the Sun, and leave the Clover (at the time of mowing) 2 or 3 inches high and no more, which will be a notable paſture in <hi>September</hi> or <hi>October</hi> following, and will (according to my experience) Winter 2 or 3 Sheep of an Acre. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the ſecond Summer, and ſo forward. A Kentiſh-man (by name Sir <hi>Thomas Payton</hi>) gave me this relation of his own experience, <hi>viz.</hi> That (by cutting of it and feeding of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel in racks under a tolle of trees) ſix Acres did maintain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the middle of <hi>April,</hi> and the middle of <hi>October,</hi> that is half a year) 13 Cows, 10 Oxen, 3 Horſes, and 26 Hogs, which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> 12 <hi>d.</hi> a week for the Bullock or Horſe, and 2 <hi>d.</hi> for a Hog, comes to above 30 <hi>s.</hi> a week, which is 40 <hi>l.</hi> for the 26 weeks, which is not leſſe then 20 Nobles for the Summer profit of an acre, beſides what it yeelds in the Winter, which is alſo conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Rich. Weſton,</hi> applies this Husbandry to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of barren ground, but my experience and judgement are, that the beſt improvement is upon the beſt ground, nor is 10 <hi>s.</hi> or 15 <hi>s.</hi> an acre conſiderable to the certainty which rich land gives to an improvement that is ſo great in it ſelf. The common practiſe alſo imploies this Husbandry by way of mowing of the Land; but my opinion is, and practiſe ſhall be to paſture it, which (inſtead of impoveriſhing the ground, as mowing by experience doth) will much better the ground
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55779:137"/>
by the abundance of ſtock which is continually kept upon it, upon the ſame reaſon, as foddering of land doth.</p>
               <p>Note alſo that the Clovergraſſe is moſt excellent food for Bees.</p>

               <head>An Anſwer to more Queres concerning the Husbandry of Clover-graſſe.</head>
               <p>Q. <hi>THe quality of the ground Clover-graſſe delights in?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Any light ſandy or hazel-mould-land, is beſt to bear Clover, and though barren land wil bear it, yet freſh and rich ground doth by experience return beſt profit.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>The manner of preparing the ground?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. There cannot be too much coſt in preparing the ground, and making it free from all manner of other graſs.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>The ſeaſon and manner of ſowing the ſeed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Clover is uſually ſown with Barly, Poliſh Oats, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with Flax, or with any ſeeds that are ſown in <hi>April.</hi> The beſt manner of ſowing that I have been able to learn, is to mix it by quarters of pounds or leſſe quantities, with ſuch proportions of ſand, as when all the parcels are put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they may make two buſhels and a half or tbree buſhels, or any ſuch proportion as fits an ordinary ſowers hand, and thus it may be ſown (like any other Corn) with a full hand, ſome (at the firſt) did uſe to ſow 4 or 5 pounds upon an Acre, others have uſed to ſow 10 pounds, and I ſhall (next Spring) ſow more. It is uſually about the ſpring-time, ſold in <hi>London,</hi> for 12 or 14<hi>d.</hi> the pound, but by the help of ſome Belgick Merchant, it may be had, thence for 6 <hi>d.</hi> the pound, or perhaps for leſſe.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>The beſt uſe of it for Cattel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. The beſt way (that I can learn) of feeding Cattel with it, is to cut it and to give it them in the Racks, within ſome little grown or ſhady places, and a proportion of ſwine will grow very fat with what falls from the Racks. In this manner (as I am credibly informed) 6 acres did feed all this ſummer time, more Oxen, Milch-cows, Horſes, and Hogs
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55779:137"/>
then (not being my own experience) I am willing to name.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>The way of ſaving or getting it out?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. To this my experience reaches not, but in this I am fully ſatisfied; that our own ſeed is beſt and freeſt from cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenage. It laſts three or four, or more years in the ground, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the ground is good, and (at firſt) well peopled with it: This is all that my experiences reacheth unto concerning Clover.</p>

               <head>Concerning the Threſhing of Clover-ſeed.</head>
               <p>THe Clover-Seed, is a Seed very difficult to thraſh; They Muſt bee good Thraſhers that can Thraſh ſix Gallons in a day. The way uſed by a great Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Clover</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> is, firſt to Thraſh off the heads which eaſily part, which being ſeperated from the Straw, he uſed to Thraſh over again until it ſeem all as chaſſ or duſt, which after he winnowed with a Fan as long as the duſt fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out. Amongſt the duſt there wil remain ſome ſmall heads unbroken, which he ſeparated or Thraſht over again as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I hope it will be no offence to give this publike notice that one Mr. <hi>Stoughton,</hi> a Gentleman that lives in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> hath for many years ſince uſed the Husbandry of Clover-Graſs, and hath an eaſie way by the help of a kind of Mil, to Shell the Husk from the Seed, whereby his Seed will not ſtand him in 2d. <hi>per</hi> Pound.</p>

               <p>I Was at the charge for ſending for a hundred weight of Clover-graſſe ſeed, on purpoſe to incourage the chief of our friends here, to undertake the Husbandry of it, and when it came I ſowed ſome in my own ground, ſome I ſent to Col. <hi>J.</hi> ſome to Col. <hi>H.</hi> ſome to Capt. <hi>V.</hi> and to other Collonels and Officers of the Army. Lately I furniſhed ſome of it to two Gentlemen in the Country, that were excellent Husbandmen.

But though I vſed that care, I did it to procure good ſeed, and though I am as confident of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> my friends care, who had it where you directed him, and ſtaid for it, while the Merchant told him he had new come over.

               <p>I Am ſorry the Hushandry of Clover, hath received ſuch a blaſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in its firſt eſſay, having obſerved how much more men are (ordinarily) ready, to judge of things, by the ſucceſſe of ſome one trial ill made, then to take the pains to weigh, and conſider in which of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars which belong (more or fewer) to every action, there may have been ſome failing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:55779:138"/>One of the moſt ordinary wayes of failing, which I have obſerved in this Husbandry is in the Seed, which comes to us ſometimes two yeares old, old, and very ſeldome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then what is mixed, and this I know by dear experience of my own heretofore, and of a very neer friends this laſt Spring.</p>
               <p>A ſecond conſideration, is the ground, which (for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule) ought to be light and tending rather to the ſand then clay.</p>
               <p>A third but very conſiderable Obſervation is, that the ſeaſon be very clear and free of all other graſſe, or roots, and as fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e worked, as if it were for a garden, which is a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance not more neceſſary, then it is little obſerved.</p>
               <p>A fourth Conſideration (though not ſo general) if the drought of the Fumer, which hath (as I hear) ſpoiled much Clover this ſpring, and not leſſe (I fear) then 20. acres of mine, if the ground have not helped me by its being proper and good. But if theſe particulars be well obſerved, I can (from my own and others experience) aſſure you, that it will (upon an eaſie account) double and treble the profit or rent of the Land; and that an acre (if managed by the Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) will yeeld as much (to all intents) as 5 <hi>l.</hi> worth of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſture. The greateſt fault which I find in this Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry is, that if the ground be ſtil cut or mowed, it will like Corn, impoveriſh the ground; for no man can eat his cake, and yet ſtill have it; to prevent this great inconvenience, and to turn it to an advantage, my ſelf intends to try how it will thrive, and what return it will make, being paſtured. I have known already the experience of ſome who have this ſpring, (before there was any paſture elſewhere) kept 8 Sheep of an acre, which is double the proportion, which the beſt land in <hi>Rumney Marſh</hi> will bear; if this, upon trial, prove well, I cannot but think, that this way of paſturing of Clover, will be a kind of foddering of the land, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>DR. <hi>H.</hi> told me, that a Merchant who dealeth much in Oranges, Lemmons, and other Provence Wares, had told him, that within a few days he expected 10 or 12. mules loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with thoſe commodities, among which there would be good ſtore of Lucern ſeed, and that of 3 ſeveral ſorts, for ſo many there is, which I never knew before, and Dr. <hi>H.</hi> ſhewed me Paterns of every one of them, having got them of the ſaid Merchant.

               <p>Of the 3 ſorts of Lucern, mentioned in Dr. <hi>B.</hi> Letter of <hi>March</hi> 22. 1653. my deſire is, to have of each ſort, as much as will plentifully ſow an Engliſh Acre, and rather more than leſſe.

               <p>I Am well acquainted with the <hi>Saint-Foyne</hi> Seed, which you received from <hi>Paris</hi>; but as for the <hi>Lucerne</hi> ſeed, I doe upon ſight of it conceive it to be no other than the Clover ſeed, that is commonly procured here from <hi>Flanders,</hi> being meliorated in <hi>France</hi> only by growing nearer the Sun. And therefore I heartily wiſh, that you friend could certifie you of his certain knowledge of the <hi>Flanders</hi> Clover-ſeed, and of the different natures (if any) of thoſe two ſeeds. But howſoever it prove, I ſhould be very glad if by your friends kindneſſe I might by the firſt of <hi>April,</hi> or before, receive twenty pound weight of the <hi>Lucerne</hi> ſeed, ſuch as is good, and of the laſt years growth.</p>
               <p>There is another French ſeed called <hi>Eſparcet,</hi> and mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (by the Author of <hi>Theatre d' Agriculture</hi>) to grow u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually about <hi>Die</hi> in <hi>Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>If by your Friends favour I could have his knowledge of that ſeed, a pattern of it, and (if it be to be had) ten or fifteen pound weight of it by, or before <hi>April,</hi> you would much oblige me.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IN my voyage from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Roan,</hi> I obſerved divers fields, as I thought, of the hearb called <hi>Aphaca vicia,</hi> or Tares and Fetches, and in them horſes feeding, but not at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, being by the means of a rope allotted onely a certain ſpace ſome four yards about; and this ſpace was thought ſufficient for one horſe in one day. But being in the Coach in company with a Gentleman of the Country, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſomething in Husbandry, I made theſe following Enquiries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What it was called?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Was, <hi>La Romagne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>If every year ſown?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. It was, but if it was not, it would not ceaſe to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though not in ſuch abundance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>How often mowen?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Not but once, not that it might not be oftner moven, but becauſe being green, and ſo eaten off the field, the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel fatned on it, they were willing it ſhould be ſo to ſpare their hay. He ſaid likewiſe, that it was of ſo quick growth, that one furrow but of a competent length, was ſufficient, and more for one horſe all graſſe time over, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted from <hi>April</hi> to the latter end of <hi>August,</hi> and then being ſpared for a time, it might be mown and kept dry, and given in the Winter to Horſe, Oxen, and Sheep, either alone
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55779:142"/>
or mixed with other fodder. I asked how that a horſe eating on one furrow alwaies could be ever a freſh ſupplied. He ſaid, that every day he was to be carefully changed, and that beginning at one end of the furrow, and ſo going on to its middle; then he was to be ſhifted to the other end of the furrow, and in like manner to proceed till he come where he had left before, and by that time the firſt end, where he firſt begun, would be ſufficiently grown, and ſo as he had eaten it before <hi>gradatim,</hi> ſo he found it again growing <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datim,</hi> and ſo good paſture again. Moreover I inquired, what difference he made of the profit the Lucerne brought (for he knew it well) and that of <hi>La Romagna?</hi> He anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the Lucerne certainly went beyond this, but that they uſed the one and the other, according to the nature of their ground, beſides that that ground, which was allotted to the Lucerne, ſhould be for many years; for once having got root, it was not ſo eaſily eradicate, and ſo not fit for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other uſe, but that the field of <hi>La Romagna</hi> might be changed, according to pleaſure, beſides the ground which was fit or <hi>La Lucerne,</hi> was not for <hi>La Romayne, &amp; è con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trà</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For Lucern required more humide places, and <hi>La Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne</hi> more dry.</p>
               <p>This is the ſubſtance of what I remember paſſed betwixt that Gentleman and me, which how true it is I dare not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe becauſe having it, but from one hand, and that a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to me; but thus much I remember, that ſome <hi>York-ſhire</hi> men in the Army in <hi>England,</hi> were more glad to find a field of Fetches to feed their horſes on, then if they had found both Hay and Oats, and that they have often to my ſeeing left ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent graſs to ſeek after theſe Fetches.</p>
               <p>Sir, I think it will not be amiſſe in the further inquiry of this, to ſee the affinity between the <hi>Vicia</hi> or <hi>Aphaca,</hi> the <hi>Lens,</hi> and the <hi>Ervum,</hi> for all of them according to <hi>Dioſcor.</hi> have that fatning quality, and truly I cannot well tell, which of theſe certainly is <hi>La Romayn,</hi> though I incline to think that it is the <hi>Vicia</hi> or <hi>Aphaca</hi>; for being in a Coach, I was too negligent to go out and remark it more narrowly, but may be
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55779:142"/>
eaſily known of any whom you may inquire of. Thus I pray God to bleſſe you in all your noble indeavours, and ſo I ſhall continue to pray,</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THe Spurry-ſeed which you have gotten out of the Low-Countries, grew no doubt in light ground. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, if it were mine, it ſhould again be ſowen in the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ground I had. Though for trials ſake I might perhaps beſtow a handfull or two upon every ſort of ground neer me.</p>
               <p>The times of ſowing it are twice in a Summer. The firſt time is not very early. I ſhould not adventure to ſow Dutch ſeed in <hi>England</hi> before the middle of <hi>May</hi>; leaſt, being a ſtranger, it ſhould take it unkindly to meet with cold <hi>May</hi> mornings, and diſcourage me. In <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July</hi> it will be in flower; and in <hi>Auguſt</hi> the ſeed is uſually ripe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond time of ſowing is after Rie-harveſt; when the Brabant-husbandman preſently ploughs up his ground and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:55779:143"/>
ſows it with Spurry-ſeed, that it may grow up and ſerve his Kine, after all late-graſſe, and Rowens be eaten up, even till New-years day. So that this latter ſowing yeelds no ſeed, but is eaten up green; and the proviſion for ſeed is made by the former ſowing.</p>
               <p>It will be good in this firſt triall, to ſow it in ſeveral parts of the ſame ground in different proportions, and to mark which thrives beſt: As alſo in the ſame ground, and with the ſame proportion of ſeed, to try what difference of increaſe there is, between the ſeed newly threſht out and thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to new ploughed ground, and that ſeed which is at the ſame time a year old.</p>
               <p>It is ordinary in <hi>Brabant</hi> to ſell away their <hi>May</hi>-butter, and to make their Winter-proviſion for themſelves, and their more knowing cuſtomers, in the end of the year. For many of them prefer Spurry-ſeed before <hi>May</hi>-butter. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the principal reaſon is, becauſe it is not ſo apt to grow rank with that Summer heat, which <hi>May</hi>-butter muſt indure in <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have known ſome <hi>Brabant</hi> Husbandmen ſow Tolls, that is, ſmall round Turneps among their Spurry, in the latter ſeed-time, as being alſo good to increaſe the milk in their Kine.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Brabant</hi> women give Spurry to their Hens, that will catch it from one another, as they do Chick-weed. They beleeve that it makes them lay the more Eggs.</p>
               <p>Spurry is by ſome eſteemed a ſure remedy for a cut or green wound, if it be bruiſed green and layed to the cut, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In Latine its called <hi>Spergula.</hi>

               <p>I Thought to have imparted unto you the Secret how to preſerve Milk from ſowring, but I muſt refer it to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſingular Honour, Piety, and Experimental learning, who had made ſome trial of it, but hath not yet fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his minde about it. When that is done, I know you will have it before any other, the Gentleman being wholly devoted not onely by this, but many other very Noble and uſeful Experiments, to promote the good of Mankind.</p>
               <p>As for Doctor <hi>Ziegler's</hi> Germane Book, written purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the ſubject of Milk, when I viſited him at <hi>Zurich</hi> he ſhewed it me, not fair written for the Preſs. It will not be great, unleſs he reſolve to an much of his own experience.

               <head>Obſervations concerning Oyles.</head>
               <p>I Gave Dr. <hi>Zeigler</hi> occaſion to ſhew me <hi>Balſamum Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritanum,</hi> as he called it. He ſeemed to ſay, that <hi>Paeracel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> firſt gave it that name, in memory of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> in the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.33. For this Balſam, he ſaid, was made of meer Oyl and Wine boyled together, without any other ingredient. But, ſaid he, whoſoever ſhall goe about to boyl them together ſhall find it troubleſom, if he never ſaw any practice of that kind before. I told him, that ſome Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal heads ſay, that <hi>Luke</hi> might be a good Phyſician, but he was but a bad Chirurgion, if he knew not that Oyl muſt not be put into wounds. The Doctor anſwered, that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors were no great Chirurgions, if they did not know, that Oyl was hurtful onely in thoſe wounds that reached to ſome bone; for then the Oyl would make the bones <hi>carioſa.</hi> But ſaid he, if ſuch a thing happen, <hi>caries oſſium</hi> may be cured by Chymical ſalts.</p>
               <p>From this I gave him occaſion to ſpeak further concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oyl. He told me, that when he was in <hi>Italy,</hi> he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that ſome families there were wont to preſerve Oyl from Generation to Geneaation, and to divide it equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the children, or neereſt kinſmen of the deceaſed. He had ſpoken with one Italian Gentleman, that ſaid hee had about two ounces of Oyl that was three hundred yeares old.</p>
               <p>I asked him, what ſerious uſe there was of ſuch old Oyl, beſides the vanity of boaſting of ſuch Antiquities? He ſaid, that new Oyl hath a ſaltneſſe in it, which makes it unſit for many uſes; but time deſtroyes that ſaltneſſe, and makes it able to perform ſuch offects as ſome of the Antients have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of it. They ſay, that divers who were eſteemed dead, have been annointed with old Oyl in the five principal pulſe-places, and revived. And, ſaid he, I am apt to think that the Extreme Unction, now adaies applyed to men at the laſt gaſp, had its firſt riſe from that Experiment; for I would thank any man that could tell me what kinde of Oyl it was
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:55779:145"/>
that is mentioned <hi>James</hi> 5.14. An Apothechary of <hi>Padua</hi> proffered to ſell me Oyl, which he ſaid was fifty years old: but I bought none of him, partly for the greatneſſe of the price that he demanded, and partly for the uncertainty whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were indeed ſo old as he pretended.</p>

               <p>THat if this Art, Trade, or Profeſſion of Husbandry were indeed ſo beneficial, ſo profitable as many pretend, why then are there not more Rich men of that ſort? And why doe ſo many Farmers or Tenants in this Nation live ſo poorly and beggarly that they ſeem rather the Landlords ſlaves or ſervants then tenants, ſince all they get, ſaving their own very mean ſubſiſtence, goes to the paying of their rent?</p>
               <p>To this it's anſwered: Firſt, that that the poſition is in its ſelf a miſtake, there being more that mannage theſe rural affairs Rich, than of any ſort of people or profeſſion in the Nation beſides by far.</p>
               <p>Secondly: It's affirmed, that the moſt noble Families in the Nation have been either raiſed or upheld by the Plough, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it is obſervable, that nothing more enables a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Nation than Hoſpitality; this, for all that, becomes the bain, the deſtruction of many great Families, when the bountifull hand is alone, but when the one is as induſtrious by theſe very wayes of good Husbandry, to provide or bring in as the other is to give or let out, that man onely is the good Houskeeper, that man onely is the conſtant Friend to the poor and his neighbours, that man only is the wiſe.

               <p>Thirdly: It's affirmed, that there are at this time very many Graſiers, Sheep-maſters, and Corn-maſters in this Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:55779:146"/>
more common and general account it is not, yet the fault is not in the Profeſſion but in the Practice and Perſons? for the more common, mean, and vulgar ſort of Tenants or Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen improperly ſo called, have onely ſome general, rude, imperfect, and (in many caſes) much irrational Rules, or Cuſtomes rather, which their as ignorant Fore-fathers left them, from which they can no more be weaned than a dull ſturdy Aſſe can be gotten to mend his pace. And they are generally ſo averſe to all new practiſes, that it is found meerly impoſſible to infuſe any ſuch thing into their heads or hands by any other means more than one manifeſt example, and that under their noſes too.</p>
               <p>Amongſt their irrational Cuſtomes, I reckon that of ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying with the Lord, though never ſo juſt and ingenuous, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout incloſing their Commons (the Freeholder and Coppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder I mean) chuſing rather to keep three ſtarved Sheep than one good Milch-cow, which the ſame land incloſed would in all probability doe.</p>

For though it be an undoubted truth that one Acre worth twenty pound, all charges defrayed, is better than three or four worth five pound all charges defrayed; yet it is as true, that if my neceſſary expences require threeſcore pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> and I hold threeſcore Acres, worth twenty pound each clear, I have gained no more but my bare ſubſiſtence, and have nothing to lay up for poſterity, no nor to ſtop a gap with (which yet often happens) and being not ſtopt, makes others ſtoop to beggary, whereas had I ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (as they will needs call it) upon an hundred and twenty
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:55779:147"/>
Acres, I had had threeſcore pounds to ſtop gaps, and lay up for poſterity; and farther if this ſhould be rightly caſt up by a rule of Progreſſion, it would eaſily appear, that threeſcore pound driven on again, and each year augmented, would in a mans life riſe to a plentifull fortune for his poſterity, and after a while afford him ſome better way, or rate of ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence alſo. What ſhould a man ſay but conclude with the Proverb, He that is born under a three penny Planet ſhall never be worth a groat.</p>
               <p>If it be anſwered, that much Land is barren, or uncertain; and the more one deals with, if the year proceeds evil, the greater his loſſe, the more certain and deſperate his undoing. 'Tis anſwered, That to a good Husband this ſo rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, and he by the meanes aforeſaid, and other good waies, is ſo prepared, that it perhaps may hinder his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward for that year, but ſhall not pluck him back at all.</p>
               <p>And here alſo is the ſtubbornneſſe of theſe mens natures diſcovered, that when moſt rational approved good Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Wayes to make their barren or uncertain land bear good crops to prevent or cure the Rot amongſt their Sheep, or Murrain amongſt their cattle, they utterly refuſe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deride the Movers and Inventers, and (as much as in them lies) endeavour to retard or poyſon the practiſe, leſt their fordid ignorance and wicked envy ſhould be theteby diſcovered or prevented.</p>
               <p>Certainly he that (having any conſiderable ſtock to begin with) doth firſt carefully inform himſelf, and conſider what, where and how to proceed; and ſhall do ſo cheerfully, and throw himſelf upon Gods abundant power, wiſdom, mercy, and providence for the ſucceſſe, cannot fail to be as rich as a good man will deſire to be; and he that withſtands or refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſo to doe, I can liken him to nothing more properly than to the dog in the manger, that eats not hay himſelf, nor lets the horſe that would.</p>
               <p>I am ſure that the moſt rich men the Scripture tels us of, were of this ſort (that were inſtrumental to their own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:55779:147"/>
and not born ſo) witneſſe the hiſtories of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob, Lot, Job</hi> good men, or of <hi>Nabal,</hi> or the Rich man in the Goſpel, that hath his barns full, and goods laid up for many years.</p>
               <p>And prophane ſtory tell the ſame, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> for his invention and practice in husbandry, was honoured as a God; that <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Tamberlane</hi> were Sheepherds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>A Laſt of Rape-ſeed is ten Quarters or eighty Buſhels, and three ſhillings is the ordinary price of a buſhel.</p>
               <p>One Acre is ſowed with half a peck ſufficiently, and will yeeld replanted, according to the goodneſſe of the ground and ſeaſonableneſſe of the year <note n="*" place="margin">The ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon when to begin this work is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after Midſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</note>, 40 <hi>l.</hi> 30 <hi>l.</hi> 20 <hi>l.</hi> and at the leaſt 10 <hi>l. per</hi> acre.</p>
               <p>The whole charge to ſow an Acre, and all things thereto

belonging firſt and laſt will ſtand in three pound Rent and all (for the Rot amongſt the Sheep, and Murrain amongſt Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, muſt needs make Land cheaper.)</p>
               <p>If therefore there were found a hundred men of indifferent quality, that would disburſe each man tea pound ſterling,<note rend="inter">If <hi>100</hi> men be not found that will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take or engage, fewer wil ſerve, ſo they either engage <hi>20</hi> l. or <hi>30</hi> l. for <hi>2</hi> or <hi>3</hi> children, or at least for the firſt or ſecond year allow the Steward more than is here accompted.</note> and commit all their ſtocks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one hand to be managed by that perſon (as one that is known to be skilful, and ſo able to undertake and paſs through the work) for the raiſing of a portion for their child, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren reſpectively, they would finde this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereby <hi>(viz.)</hi> They ſhould onely ſpare the ſaid ten pound for the two firſt years and no more, at the end whereof it ſhould be returned, and ſo they have given that child no other portion point-blank more than the uſe of ten pound for two yeares, which is but two and thirty ſhillings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ſhould be at no charge to keep or maintain the ſame child ſave onely the firſt two years, for at the end of the third year they ſhould receive competent maintenance for the ſame year, and ſo continue, or increaſe the ſame ſo long as the grand ſtock is ſuffered to lye in the Stewards hands, which is to be underſtood that during the firſt ſeaven yeares the Steward cannot give it up but by conſent of the owner, but after that he may eaſe himſelf of the burthen when it grows too heavy, as he ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He will have a moſt plentifull proviſion for his childe, without any trouble to himſelf, or at all diverting his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by only allowing the Steward one tenth part from time to time, as the reward of his care, skil, paines, and expence of his time, which muſt be chiefly dedicated to this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>And here I preſent it more lively to your view in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Table.</p>

               <p>FOr the more general ſorts of Poor, I humbly conceive that what followeth may be a good way, and open to them a door of ſubſiſtence, without wrong or loſſe either of wealth or freedom to any ſubject of <hi>England,</hi> ſince in it all things are to be done in love and order; the Rich invited by the Profit, and the poor comming in as to a ſafe harbour, where he may reſt ſecure under the Lee of this opportunity from the dangerous working of thoſe many and ſtrong ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations their poverty is accompanied with, and from the danger of the ſevere proſecution of the known Laws againſt Idleneſſe, which will become altogether good, if all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or excuſe be thus taken away, and the perſon once taken notice of, be uncapable of any ſecond for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:55779:154"/>I ſay then that ſowing Hemp is the moſt certain way, how with gaines to all parts many hands may be ſet to work, but if any man think Flax better, he may uſe it; yet I muſt tell you that Flax (as ſometimes it turnes to greater profit than Hemp, ſo it) is not ſo certain; and after Flax the ground is not ſo right for Corn as after Hemp, which indeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares land excellently for Corn; but the chief reaſon is, that the perſons to be employed are more likely to do good (at firſt eſpecially) on Hemp than Flax, the other being the more choice and difficult work, in all points requiring more care and skil, and the vent for Flax alſo is nothing ſo ready as that of Hemp, the uſes being not ſo many, nor ſo great, and we may equal the works of other Nations in Hemp, not preſently in Flax.</p>
               <p>If there will appear a hundred honeſt, able, worthy En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen, that will engage each man ſix thouſand pound to ſet forward this good work (or if not juſt ſo, yet more men and leſſe ſtocks amounting to that proportion (<hi>viz.</hi>) of ſtock engaged in all ſix hundred thouſand pound; I ſhall onely hold forth the private and publique Advantages, and may boldly promiſe them, beſides Gods bleſſing, and their Countries love, together with the conveniency of taking the moſt ſafe courſe (one of them at leaſt) that can be imagined in theſe times.</p>
               <p>The ſix hundred thouſand pound, will ſow about threeſcore thouſand Acres, and defray all charges firſt and laſt till the Hemp he converted into Cordage, Cloth, <hi>&amp;</hi>c. and fit for ſale. That is, ten pound for an Acre, and each Acre will ſet above two hundred perſons to work for one day; the whole will ſet above forty thouſand to work all the year. Every Acre well managed will yeeld at leaſt twenty buſhels of ſeed, which at two ſhillings the buſhel, is forty ſhillings the Acre, or a hundred and twenty thouſand pound for the whole, and each Acre ſo managed may yeeld at leaſt five hundred and ſixty pound of Cloth or Cordage, worth one with another five pence the pound, in all for one Acre ſixteen pound ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and in all for the grand ſtock nine hundred and ſixty
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:55779:155"/>
thouſand pound ſterling; by which, three hundred and ſixty thouſand pound is gained, that is, about fourteen ſhillings in the pound gained yearly. And for two years after, the ſame ground will bear moſt excellent Wheat, Rye, or Barley, all charges payed to the value of four Quarters of Barley on an Acre, worth one time with another twenty ſhillings a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, al a hundred and twenty thouſand Quarters, and ſo alſo a hundred and twenty thouſand pound yearly.</p>
               <p>Thus ſhall forty thouſand Poor be kept conſtantly at work all the year, and the Commonwealth eaſed of that burthen, and advantaged beſides a hundred and fifty thouſand Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Hemp-ſeed, a hundred and fity thouſand tun of Cloth and Cordage, and above a hundred and twenty thouſand Quarters of good Corn; and the Undertakers amongſt them ſhall gain clearly three hundred and ſixty thouſand pound ſterling yearly. This is ſet down purpoſely, the Charge with the moſt, and the Return with the leaſt. And if the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſo many Rich men cannot be found to engage for any of theſe ſums, more perſons, and leſſe engagements may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the work.</p>

well know, that the Land may not onely be ſpared, but will otherwiſe very much enrich us, and advance our plenty of Corn, and this is declared in the Propoſition, and the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion therefore not ſo pertinent: Yet for a farther Anſwer, I affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m, that there is demonſtratively in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> above 4000000 of Acres for Tillage, and you finde but forty thouſand Acres to be uſed yearly for the ſowing of Hemp, which is but the hundereth part, and it is there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that in the two or three ſucceeding years wherein the ſame land ſhall be ſowed with Corn, amends ſhall be fully made for the miſſing of that yeares crop, and more by the goodneſſe of thoſe that follow.</p>
               <p>The laſt part of this Quere is ſoon anſwered; for it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known, that an Acre of Corn (taking one time, place, grain with another throughout) is hardly worth forty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, whereas a reaſonable Acre of Hemp is worth (ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing four pound, ſome five pound, ſome ſix pound, and very many more. And then the Acre of Corn is worth no more than it ſhews for, whereas the Hemp (to the Commonwealth as well as the particular owner) is of far greater value, if we conſider that one Acre of Hemp well wrought up may be worth above a hundred pound, but then the charge may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to the better half indeed.</p>

But how far other Nations may under-ſell us, or we them, I leave to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that are more Merchant-like, to which I lay no claim, but (at moſt) to be one that would fain be a good Inland Husband, a Lover of my Country, and a faithful ſeeker of her Peace &amp; Proſperity by all juſt and lawful means. Yet thus much I can ſay to the point, that to my knowledge many hundreds (I think I may ſay thouſands) of Acres are
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:55779:156"/>
with great advantage to the poſſeſſors imployed in this way, namely in the Iſle of <hi>Axholm,</hi> and other the parts of <hi>Lincoluſh. &amp;c.</hi> which place is more populous than any part of <hi>England</hi> that I know, and yet few or no Beggars. And I have a little lookt into the prizes, yet I find not Engliſh hemp differ much in price from that which is imported; it ſeems to me that neceſſity rather (as not having enough at home) cauſes ſuch importing. I have ſeen a <hi>Hull</hi> Merchant ſtand upon three pence a pound for raw Hemp, when the ſame day Engliſh Hemp, that was adjudged every whit as good, was ſold for two pence half penny. I have alſo known Hemp fetched by Waggon from <hi>Bourn</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> to <hi>Gloceſter</hi> upon the River of <hi>Severn.</hi> And our Experience, certainly we may bluſh to ſay we have not ſufficient skill to make Cordage, or ſuch kinds of coarſe cloath as the Propoſition intends; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuch as is commonly uſed to make Sheets, Table-cloathes, Towels, Napkins, and the coarſer ſorts of Shirting, or the like: As for the finer ſorts, we may work our ſelves into the kill and practice of making ſuch by degrees, and at more leaſure.</p>
               <p>Qu. 4. <hi>Whether when we make ſo much Linnen Cordage as here, we ſhall have ſo good vent for our Native commodities for which Cordage, Hemp, &amp;c. is returned?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> As I ſaid, I pretend not to judge of Merchants affairs, yet I have not heard of any of our native commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which are vented for Hemp, or Cordage or the like, which will not be acceptable to the ſame or other Countries for the return of as good commodities. Once I am ſure that thoſe commodities are onely (or at leaſt moſt) fit to import which we cannot ſo well make native to us, as Spices, Wines, Drugs Medicinal, Silkes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I ſuppoſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be unhappy, or unfit for us to make as many our own as by good meanes we can, eſpecially, Hemp, Cordare, &amp;c. ſince we cannot be without them, and are not ſure alwaies to hold fair correſpondence with thoſe Nations from whom we have them, the chief ſtrength of <hi>England</hi> principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in Shipping, 'tis but a coarſe policy to have our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to keep.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:55779:156"/>Qu. 5. <hi>Who will advance ſo great a ſumme in unſetled times upon a New Trade, having in it the afore-mentioned (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more) difficulties?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If you pleaſe to obſerve my Propoſition, you will find, I ſay onely if ſuch men may be found, I promiſe not to find them, but if they will finde themſelves I hold forth to them the ſweet invitation of a greater advantage than, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve they can otherwiſe obtain by direct and good means: And then adde to that the double and treble ſervice or good they ſhall (all under one) do tax for their Chriſtian Brethren and native Country. And if this will not this will not invite, cannot perſwade them, yet me-thinks we ſhould rather take occaſion to bewaile our own, theirs, and the Commonwealths miſery and averſneſſe from all goodneſſe. As for the troubleſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the times, I can but put you in mind of that part of the Propoſition that aſſures this to be one of the moſt ſafe and likely waies to ſave a mans eſtate, where if it be not fully enough explained, I refer you to your own better judgement to find and propound what you think beſt.</p>
               <p>And now whoſoever raiſed theſe Objections, did well, if he did it for the right end (<hi>viz.</hi>) to illuſtrate the Propoſition, that ſo it might be made more clear and acceptable.

               <head>A Paſſage taken out of a tract againſt the high rate of Uſury; preſented to the high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Anno Domini 1623.</hi> In which the Uſe for Money was brought down from ten to eight in the Hundred. And now humbly recommended to a further Publique Conſideration, as a ſpecial Means for Advancement of the National Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of this Commonwealth.</head>
               <p>IT hath been the wiſdom and care of former Parliament to provide for the preſervation of Wood and Timber; for which there is nothing more available than the calling down
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:55779:157"/>
of the high rate of Uſury; for as the rate of Money now goeth, no man can let his Timber ſtand, nor his Wood grow to ſuch years growth as is beſt for the Commonwealth, but it will be very loſſe-full to him. The ſtock of the Woods after they are worth forty or fifty the ſhillings the Acre, growing faſter at ten in the hundred than the Woods themſelves doe. And for Shipping which is the ſtrength and ſafety of this land, I have heard divers Merchants of good credit ſay, that if they would build a Ship, and let it to any other to employ, they cannot make of their Mony that way, counting all charges, tear and wear, above ten or twelve in the hundred, which can be no gainful Trade without hazard, Money it ſelf going <hi>at ten</hi> in the hundred. But in the Low-Countries where Mony goeth at <hi>ſix,</hi> the building of Ships, and hiring them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is a gainfull Trade, and ſo the ſtock of Rich men, and the induſtry of beginners are well joyned for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
               <p>And yet that which is above all the reſt, the greateſt ſin againſt the Land is, that it makes the Land it ſelf of ſmall value, nearer the rate of new found Lands than of any other Countrey, where Laws, Government, and Peace have ſo long flouriſhed: For the high rate of Uſury makes Land ſell ſo cheap, and the cheap ſale of Land is the cauſe why men ſeek no more by induſtry and coſt to improve them; and this is plain both by example and demonſtration; for we ſee in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, where the uſe of Money is of a low rate, Lands are generally ſold for 30, 40, in ſome for 50 years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. And we know by the rule of bargaining, that if the rate of uſe were not greater here than in other Countries, Lands were then as good a pennyworth, at twenty years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe as they are now at ſixteen: For Lands being the beſt aſſurance, and ſecureſt inheritance, will bear a rate above Money. Now if Lands were at thirty yeares purchaſe, or near it, there were no ſo cheap purchaſe, as the amendment of ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> own Lands; for it would be much cheaper to make one Acre of Land, now worth five ſhillings by the year, to be worth ten ſhillings, or being worth ten, to be worth
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:55779:158"/>
twenty ſhillings; and ſo in proportion, then to purchaſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acre worth five or ten ſhillings. And in every acre thus purchaſed to the owner by the amendment of his own, there were another purchaſed to the Commonwealth. And it is the bleſſing of God to this Land, that there are few places of it to which he hath not given means by reaſonable coſt and induſtry, greatly to amend it, in many to double the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, ſo as in time, if for their own good, mens induſtry were compelled that way, the riches and commodities of this Land would neer be doubled: Then would all the wet-lands in this Kingdome ſoon be drained, the barren lands mended by Matle, Sleech, Lime, Chalk, Sea-ſand, and other means, which for their profit mens induſtry would find out. We ſee with how great induſtry and charge our neighbours the <hi>Dutch</hi> do drain and maintain their Lands againſt the Sea which floweth higher above them than it doth above the loweſt parts of our drowned lands. I will admit a great deal to their induſtry, but I ſhould very unwillingly grant that they are ſo much more ingenious and induſtrious than we, as that all the odds were therein. Certainly the main cauſe of it is, that with us money is dear and land cheap; with them lands dear and money cheap; and conſequently the improvement of their lands at ſo great a charge with them, is gainfull to the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which with us would be loſſe-full; for Uſuring going at <hi>ten in the hundred,</hi> if a man borrow five pounds, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it on an Acre of ground, the amendment ſtands him in ten ſhillings a year, and being amended the Land is not worth above fifteen years purchaſe: But if the uſe of money went at no more than at other places, then five pound beſtowed upon an Acre of ground, would ſtand a man in but five or ſix ſhillings a year, and the acre of land ſo amended would be worth, as hath been ſhewed, ſix and twenty or thirty yeares purchaſe. Whereby it appeareth, that as the rate of Uſe now goeth no man (but where the land lyeth extraordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy for it) can amend his Land but to his own loſſe; whereas if money were let as it is in other Countries, he might beſtow more than double as much as now he may, and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:55779:158"/>
yet be a great gainer thereby; and conſequently, as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remembred, ſhould to his own benefit purchaſe land to the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Neither would ſuch purchaſe of Land to the Common-wealth be the benefit to the landed men onely, the benefit would be as much to the poor Labourers of the Land: For now when Corn and other fruits of the land which grow by labour are cheap, the Plough and Mattock are caſt into the hedge, there is little work for poor men, and that at a low rate, whereas if the mendment of their own lands were the cheapeſt purchaſe to the owner; if there were many more people than there are, they ſhould be readily ſet a work at better rates than now they are, and none that had their health and limbs could be poor, but by their extreameſt lazineſſe.</p>

                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:55779:159"/>2. Divers Husbandmen want wherewith to ſtock their ground, whereby (perhaps) the Nation ſuffers more than many times by much unſeaſonable weather.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A great part of <hi>Ireland</hi> lyes at preſent waſte, which (without great ſtock to plant) is like ſo to continue.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There are great quantities of oazie grounds about the Sea-coaſt and other Fens and waſte grounds; beſides Forreſts and Commons, which drained and improved might equalize in value ſome two or three Counties in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. There are many Mines in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which being wrought would much increaſe our Expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and imployment for poor men.</p>
               <p>To ſet all theſe Wheels a going, two things are neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> that the people may know where to be furniſhed with ſtock at low intereſt, and that a ſufficient quantity of currant money be diſperced amongſt them.</p>
               <p>And indeed the great <hi>Remora</hi> is, that the people are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally voyd of ſtock, whereby it is impoſſible they ſhould deal either in the Forraign Trade, Fiſhing, Plantations, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their own poſſeſſions, by reaſon whereof both poor and rich are deprived of imployment, and forced to live chiefly upon the Principal, to the greater increaſe of their poverty and ruin.</p>
               <p>Whereas if they knew where to obtain ſuch ſtock at low Intereſt, it would both enable them to proſecute the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ends, and alſo make way for the more ſpeedy vent of commodities in other Nations; for greatneſſe of ſtock at low Intereſt, would enable the Engliſh Merchants to deal for much, and thereby to buy cheap, work cheap, and ſel for leſſe profit in the pound (and alſo to procure their commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities at the beſt hand, <hi>viz.</hi> at the places of their growth in their proper ſeaſon) whereby out-trading and underſelling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, they obtain the pre-emption of ſale, and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of vent abroad.</p>
               <p>Alſo great ſtock at low Intereſt would enable Merchants to raiſe the price of our own native commodities in Forraign parts, by keeping them for a good Market, which helps
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:55779:160"/>
much towards the enriching of a Nation.</p>
               <p>Again if there were great quantity of money diſperced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people of this land, there would not wantvent of commodities amongſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>For in this caſe every man to improve his ſtock would be laying out that mony in commodities, &amp; thoſe that receive it would be laying it out again upon others, and thoſe upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſo on, which would beget a conſtant return, or quick vent for commodities proportionable to the quantity of money ſo perpetually revolving amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Now if (through plenty of mony amongſt the people) there were as much vent for commodity as the earth could by induſtry be made to afford, men would not ſpare either the Sea or the Land, but the one by the Fiſhing Trade, the other by Husbandry and all ingenious wayes of Improvement here in <hi>England</hi>; by planting in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and other new Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions throughout the whole Globe, would beſtow all their skill and diligence to multiply commodity and livelyhood to the imployment of innumerable poor, and all other men whatſoever, and the abundant increaſe of our Shipping and Dominion on the Sea, and thereby the ſtrength, renown, and flouriſhing eſtate of the Nation.</p>
               <p>And not onely ſo, but if there were ſuch vent here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> even Forraign Nations would diſpatch their commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties hither as to the quickeſt Market, and by meeting here (as in a center) might furniſh each other with returns, ſo as <hi>England</hi> would become as it were a general Market or Faire to other Nations, to the great enriching thereof; whereby the Frontier Towns upon the Sea-coaſt, by reaſon of Trade would grow populous and ſtrong for the defence of the Nation.</p>
               <p>Alſo quickneſſe of returns here in <hi>England</hi> would expedite returns abroad; for quick returns makes a ſmall ſtock equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to a great ſtock with ſlow returns, and therefore if the Merchants of <hi>England</hi> could vent all ſorts of commodities here as faſt as they could poſſibly procure them, it would inable them to deal for much, and conſequently to buy much
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:55779:160"/>
cheap, work cheap, and ſell for leſſe profit in the pound as before. So as in this caſe there would not want vent for commodities, either at home, by reaſon of the plenty of mony here, or abroad by reaſon of our own out-trading other Nations, through the greatneſſe of our ſtock, and quickneſſe of returns.</p>
               <p>Alſo if men (through plenty of Coyn revolving amongſt them) could meet with ready money for all commodities as faſt as they could be made fit for ſale, no man for the future would deal for time, the rather for that the forbearance of Debts in a time of quick trade would be great loſſe.</p>
               <p>This would remove all thoſe Inconveniencies which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to the ordinary way of Trading upon credit, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The impriſonment of mens perſons for debt.</item>
                     <item>2. Innumerable ſuits of Law about ſuch debts.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>This neceſſity of plenty of Coyn amongſt a people, is the reaſon why States makes Laws againſt the Exportation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and many times pitch upon ſome Staple commodities which they will not exchange with other Nations but for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in Bullion.</p>
               <p>So much money in <hi>ſpecie</hi> as were neceſſary to furniſh the people with the aforeſaid ſtock at low Intereſt, and ſuch plenty of Coyn as is already mentioned, is impoſſible to be had, and if it could be obtained by returnes from other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet we muſt part with our own commodities for it, which we cannot ſpare in ſuch great quantities. Whereas up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſerious conſideration it will be found, that Credit ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:55779:161"/>
upon the beſt ſecurity is the ſame thing with Money, and may be had in very great abundance, without parting with any commodity for it.</p>
               <p>That ſuch Credit is as good as Money will appear if it be obſerved that Money it ſelf is nothing elſe but a kind of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie which men receive upon parting with their commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, as a ground of hope or aſſurance that they ſhall be repayed in ſome other commoditie: ſince no man would ſell any commoditie for the beſt money, but in hopes thereby to procure ſome other commodity or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>True it is that Coyn which hath no intrinſical value, as they call it (<hi>viz.</hi> Money of Braſſe, Copper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) though whilſt it runs currant the owner may obtain commodity for it, yet when the uſe of it is prohibited (no man being enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make it good) he ſuffers loſſe. Which if he had ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Lands of ſufficient value would be prevented, whereby it appeares, that ſecurity anſwers to the intrinſick value of Coyn.</p>
               <p>That ſuch Credit is as good as Money, is alſo evident upon this ground, That Money if it were a better ſecurity than it is, yet it ſerveth onely to ſupply the interval of time between the ſelling of one commodity, and the buying of another: Now the beſt aſſurances in Land are a ſecurity ſufficient for the ſupplying of that intervall: Eſpecially conſidering that mens eſtates are generally either in land or commodities. And in land (though more certain than commodity) yet if abſolutely purchaſed there may be loſſe by its decreaſe in value, but if accepted onely as in Morgage, that hazard is prevented, and ſo becomes the moſt certain ſecurity on earth, and therefore muſt needs be ſufficient to ſupply the ſhort in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval betwixt the ſelling of land or commodity and the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.</p>
               <p>Upon this ground that Security is in effect the ſame thing with Money, it is, that in divers places of the world it runs currant in ſtead of Money.</p>
               <p>Thus Bills in <hi>Flanders</hi> obliging the Debtor to pay money
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:55779:161"/>
at a certain time, are acccepted by thoſe who eſteem of the man as able and ſufficient, whereby ſuch Bills doe uſually paſſe from one hand to another, untill they become payable.</p>
               <p>Thus in <hi>Venice, Leighorn,</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> the ſecurity (commonly called Credit, grounded upon the depoſitions of money in bank, runs currant, and though the owners may have mony if they pleaſe, yet they chuſe rather to deale by credit; whereby it appeares that it is neither unpoſſible, ſtrange, nor unpracticeable, for ſecurity to be made to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of mony.</p>
               <p>This is beſt effected by the way of Banks.</p>
               <p>Banks, as they are now practiced, are nothing elſe in effect but places where men pawn or depoſite their moneys for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining currant credit, as that which they may keep with leſſe danger, and aſſign to another with leſſe trouble.</p>
               <p>If any man who hath credit in Bank demands the money, it is payd him; but as ſome men demand money out of the Bank, ſo others when they are to receive money, doe cauſe it to be payd into the Bank, whereby to eaſe themſelves of the trouble of receiving, keeping, and paying it.</p>
               <p>Hence it is that the Bankers are alwaies receiving mony of ſome, as well as paying it to others; ſo as thoſe who from time to time demand any money, are uſually payd by thoſe who bring it in, and the reſt of the money lyes dead in bank, or elſe that Bank hath no credit; for look how much credit runs currant, ſo much mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now ſeeing ſuch money lyes dead in bank, and ſerveth for no other purpoſe, but as a pawn or ground of ſecurity; for making good the credit that runs currant in ſtead thereof, there is no doubt to be made but that lands being morgaged to a Bank, would ſerve as well and better for ſuch a pawn, which cannot be removed or made away by force or fraud, as great ſummes of money lying long in one place may; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any temptation to an enemy, as Banks of money are; witneſſe the late attempt of the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:55779:162"/>If any ſhould here expect a more full opening of the nature of ſuch Banks of ſecurity, and other circumſtances relating to the practice thereof, it is not my ſcope to inſiſt thereon at preſent, leaſt the diſcourſe might become too large for men of buſineſſe: It may ſuffice in the mean time that the thing it ſelf plainly appeares to be practiceable, there being nothing in it but what is dayly acted amongſt men: For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The raiſing of Credit upon the ſecurity of Lands, is no new thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The making uſe of Credit in Bank, inſtead of mony, and transferring of ſuch credit from one man to another in books kept for that purpoſe, is alſo practiſed in the aforeſaid Banks. Now put thoſe two together, and you have the whole of what is here propounded.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore in the generall put a caſe.</p>

               <p n="2">2. It may be they would reſolve alſo to raiſe Banks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, whereby the credit grounded upon ſuch mony, might run currant amongſt the people, rather than the mony it ſelf, which is not ſo fit for daily uſe, in great ſummes, in reſpect of the trouble of telling and re-telling, the loſſe in clipped and counterfeit mony, the hazard which men ſuſtain in keeping much mony by them, the trouble of carrying great ſums from houſe to houſe, and the danger from conveighing it in <hi>ſpecie</hi> from one Town to another, whereas dealing in ſuch credit (as to all great ſummes) would prevent Highway-theeves, who if they have nothing but goods to ſeize upon in the road, cannot goe long undiſcovered, nor can advance any thing thereupon worth their attendance, which would totally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them from following that lewd kinde of life, and thereby free the Highwayes of ſuch Vermine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:55779:162"/>Credit alſo is better amongſt the people than money, in theſe two reſpects: Firſt it cannot be tranſported to other Nations. Secondly, it will not be hoarded up, as mony many times is to the great hinderance of Trade: for that money which is of leaſt eſteem amongſt the people, if it be of real value in it ſelf, is moſt for their good, becauſe every man ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to poſt it off from himſelf, doth thereby quicken returns of Trade.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſe that (upon theſe manifold conſiderations) ſuch Banks ſhould be erected, and it ſhould thereupon come to paſſe, that this mony thus lent to the Commonwealth, ſhould lye dead in Bank, and the people ſhould make uſe of their Credit in ſtead thereof (as they do I ſay in other places) I demand then to what purpoſe this mony ſerveth?</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid it lyes for a pawn to ſecure the Credit that runs currant in ſtead thereof:</p>
               <p>I anſwer, the Land which was taken for ſecurity, when the money was lent to the people, is a ſufficient pawn to make good ſuch credit: If not, then the money which was lent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſecurity, which fails, is loſt; but if the ſecurity hold good it is the ſame with money: And therefore if the State might venture to lend the money it ſelf upon the beſt ſecurity, the people may even as well venture to take ſuch ſecurity it ſelf for money.</p>
               <p>Hereupon there is no doubt but the State (in order to their own ſecurity) would reſtore this money to the owners, and proceed without it, as being, firſt, altogether ſuperfluous; ſecondly, a great temptation to an Enemy; thirdly, ſubject in proceſſe of time to the fraud of Officers, and ſudden com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions of ſeveral parties and factio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The premiſes conſidered, to diſpute againſt the aforeſaid Banks grounded upon ſecurity, is the ſame thing, as to oppoſe the accepting of the aforeſaid mony in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> if it were to be lent this Nation <hi>gratis.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe by the lending thereof to the people upon Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, a Revenue may be raiſed to free them from publique taxes and burdens.</p>

            <head>The Concluſion of the Legacie of Husbandry, taken out of Sir <hi>R. Weſton</hi> late of <hi>Sutton</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Surrey,</hi> his Legacie to his Sons, with a little alteration of his words.</head>
            <p>BY the means of good Husbandry you may nobly aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your eſtates, and will receive ſo much the more profit and praiſe, by how much more induſtry and diligence you govern your affairs; and will not only be imitated, but alſo honoured by our Neighbours, when they ſhall ſee your labours proſper ſo far, as to convert barren ground left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>husbanded for many Ages into commodious Arable land, with Paſtures and Meadows. And certainly that man is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of praiſe and honour, who being poſſeſſed of a large and barren Demeaſne, conſtrains it by his labour and induſtry to produce extraordinary fruits; which redounds not onely to his own particular profit, but alſo to the publique benefit. <hi>Cato</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is a great ſhame to a man not to leave his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance greater to his Succeſſors than he received it from his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, and that he deſpiſeth the liberality of God who by his ſlothfulneſs loſeth that which his land may bring forth, as not ſeeming willing to reap the fruits which God hath offered him.</hi> Nay he threatens the crime of high Treaſon to thoſe that do not augment their Patrimony ſo much as the Increaſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts the Principal. It is a thing much celebrated by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and thought the nobleſt way to gather Wealth for to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:55779:164"/>
employ ones Wit and Money upon his Land, and by that means to augment his eſtate. If you obſerve the common courſe of things, you will finde that Husbandry is the End which men of all eſtates in the world do point at. For to what purpoſe doe Souldiers, Scholars, Lawyers, Merchants, and men of all occupations and trades toyl and labour with great affection, but to get money? and with that money, when they have gotten it but to purchaſe Land? and to what end do they buy that land but to receive the fruits of it to live? and how ſhall one receive the fruits of it but by his own Husbandry or a Farmers? So that it appears by degrees; that what courſe ſoever a man taketh in this world, at laſt he commeth to Husbandry which is the moſt common occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt men, the moſt natural and holy being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the mouth of God to our Firſt Fathers. There is care and dillgence requiſite in Husbandry, as there is in all the Actions of the world; and therefore as a Captain hath a Lieutenant to command his Souldiers in his abſence, or for his eaſe: So muſt you provide ſome able honeſt man to whom you will commit the execution of ſuch things, as you your ſelves cannot do without too much labour; whereof you muſt often take an account, and confer with him (as occaſion ſhall require) about your buſineſs, that nothing may be left undone for want of providence. To ſuch a man you muſt give good wages, with intent to advance your own gain, and take the more eaſe by reaſon of his honeſty and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>You will find the Improvement by Husbandry (after you have once had experience of it to be very pleaſing to you, and ſo exceeding profitable, that it will make you dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diligent; for no man of any Art or Science (except an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſt) ever pretended ſo much gain any other way, as you ſhal ſee diſcovered and demonſtrated in this Treatiſe. The Uſurer doubles but his principal, with Intereſt upon Intereſt in ſeven years, but by this Legacy of Husbandry you ſhall learn now to do more than treble your principal in one years compaſſe. I will ſay no more of this ſubject, only it remains to tell you, that you muſt not expect either Eloquence or
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:55779:165"/>
Method in theſe miſcellanies; but true relations and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, plainly ſet forth, which muſt be carefully followed and obſerved: but before all things to be ſure you lay the foundation of your Husbandry, upon the bleſſing of Almighty God, continually imploring his divine aid and aſſiſtance in all your labours: for it is God that gives the Increaſe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving this as the Quinteſſence, and ſoul of Husbandry. <hi>But ſeek ye firſt the Kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you.</hi>

               <head>An Animadvertiſement to the City and Country.</head>
               <p>THeſe are to give publick notice to City and Country, that there is lately invented a new and very uſeful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, both for quencing of fire, and improving of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, it may be managed with one man to quench fire, and may be uſed 24 hours without danger of choaking, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, up not above five or ſix foot (the whole Engine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and all) whereas the ordinary Engine cannot be played in leſſe than twenty foot. It is of ſo ſmall a bulk, that it may be carried through any narrow entry with two men, and is to be applied to any fire that is broken out backwardly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas in the ordinary Engines, they are fain to pull down the fore-part of the houſe before they can come at the fire,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:55779:165"/>
by which means the fire increaſeth much, which is prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this invention. It is alſo very commodious for Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring of whole Fields or Gardens, as likewiſe beating of Caterpillars off Trees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beſides ſeveral other profitable Uſes. If any ſhall deſire to have further informations or directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, concerning the foreſaid Engine, he may pleaſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort to the Inventor himſelf, Mr. <hi>Thomas Owefield,</hi> dwelling in the Strand, near the <hi>Savoy,</hi> next door to the Sign of the Sun; who ſtands ingaged to the Author of the Legacy of Husbandry to make good all his Undertakings.</p>
