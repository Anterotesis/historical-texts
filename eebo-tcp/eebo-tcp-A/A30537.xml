            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Through this Gift we believe, That Christ Jesus (the Son of God) was manifest in the Flesh in the Fulness of time: And this we know, by the same Spirit by which our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers believed he should come, and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> saw his Day, by the same we do believe he is come, and do see his Day; as also by the Prophet and Apostles Writing, which <hi>two-fold Cord is not easily broken.</hi>

               <p>We believe also according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth, That this <hi>same Jesus hath God highly exalted, and given him a Name above every Name, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish, but have Everlasting Life; and that there is not another Name, whereby any can be saved, than this Name of Jesus Christ:</hi> nor is Remission of Sins to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any other Name: But as we do not believe, that the outward Letters and Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are that Name that is to be bowed to by the outward Knee, no more then the Letters or Syllables in the words <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Spirit,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture faith, <hi>Unto God,</hi> who is a Spirit, <hi>every Knee shall bow,</hi> Isa. 45. 93.

Iniquity: This is that Name which was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and which is preached through Faith, in which Name Remission of Sin is obtained: Therefore was the outward word <hi>Jesus</hi> given him, as his outward Name; <hi>Thou shalt call his Name</hi> JESUS; <hi>for he shall save his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from their Sins</hi> [mark] <hi>for he shall save, &amp;c.</hi> So that which saves, is the <hi>Name,</hi> which is to be believed in, which is that Arm of God that brings Salvation, <hi>when no Eye pities, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any Help:</hi> the Power of God that then saves, is that Grace that comes from the Fulness of Christ, the Saviour: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Virtue, <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Jesus</hi> are but emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Names, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>No man can say, that Jesus is the</hi> LORD, <hi>but by the Holy Ghost.</hi>

               <p>We believe also, That this Jesus dyed for or because of Sin, and rose again for the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of those that believe in him, as well as to manifest to all the World, that he was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and that he thereby <hi>spoiled Principalities and Power,</hi> and <hi>triumphed over them openly,</hi> and <hi>led Captivity captive</hi> in his own Person; yet we believe and know, by his Grace in our Hearts, that as his Name <hi>Jesus,</hi> without Virtue and Power, is but an empty Word; so his Dying, without man's Conformity to his Death, or being planted into the Likeness thereof, or being crucified

We further believe, That God is only to be Worshipped, and not any Likeness that man makes unto himself of God, from any View, Sight and Knowledge that he hath had of him; but in every Act and Service man is to know what substantially, as well as whom speculatively or notionally he wopships; as it is written; John 4. 22. <hi>Ye worship ye know not what; we know what we worship; for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is of the</hi> Jews.

               <p>We believe also, That this Worship is spiritual (and not carnal) in all its Parts and Ordinances, and not to be imposed by any outward Force, but performed by the inward Leading of God's Holy Spirit, according as the Holy Men of God were led and guided in the days past, who gave forth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; all Impsitions of Worship outward being only enjoyn'd under the <hi>first, Covenant,</hi> that made nothing perfect, <hi>until the Time of Reformation,</hi> spoken of, <hi>Hebr</hi> 9 10.

For we find by daily experiences, that most men and women live like <hi>Pharaoh's lean Kine,</hi> only to <hi>eat up the fat,</hi> and to envy those that are not so lean-soul'd as themselves.</p>
               <p>We believe also, That as there is one true saving Baptism, so there is one Bread, or Body of Christ, which all the Saints do feed upon; and though they be many, as to persons, yet their Bread is but one and they all in it but one Bread: And this we believe is <hi>the flesh that came down from Heaven,</hi> John 6. 33. Though the outward <hi>Jews</hi> now as then, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur at him, because he said, <hi>I am the Bread which came down from Heaven,</hi> ver. 41, 42.

But Christ, (ver. 45.) to stop their murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tells them, that the knowledge of this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery was only revealed unto them whom God (and not man) teacheth, and no more then are <hi>taught of God,</hi> can set seal and subscribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this <hi>Truth in Jesus;</hi> though we believe also, that Jesus took outward bread, and break it, and gave it to the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And we believe, he did arise again and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto his Disciples; <hi>and all that believed were together, and had [All things Common] &amp;c. And they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleness of heart, praising God, and having fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with all the People,</hi> Acts 2. 44, 45, 46, 47. And we believe that the Apostle, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 20. said true, where he said, <hi>When ye come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether therefore in one place, this is not to eat the Lords Supper.</hi> And all that he speaks in that chap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And the more man's mind is gathered within from all visibles, the more he comes to be sensible of the Movings and Stirring, of this Spirit, in its secret cryes unto God, answerable to the wants of that man or woman, in whom it moves and cryes.

               <p>We believe by the same gift of Grace, that there are <hi>several Minstrations, and several O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations,</hi> according to 1 C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And we further believe by the same Spirit,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:29997:15"/>
that the sum of all Religion, according to the Truth and signification of the word [Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on] is, <hi>Man not at liberty in his will, but bound again unto God, by his having given to him, by the Light of Christ within, the true sight and knowledge of himself, as in himself, as lost and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done forever, and from this Sight a true sense to arise upon and remain with him;</hi> from whence spring unutterable groans and cryes unto God, under the weight of the burthen and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, by reason of the body of Sin and Death, and then when there was none to help or pitty in this state, then is Mercy shewed in Christ the Arm of God, which is revealed as an help, neither seen nor known, where, how, or when to come at it, or meet with it; And this begets in the heart of that man or woman, in and unto whom it is thus revealed, thanks and praises unto God, for this <hi>Gift</hi> and <hi>Revelation</hi> of his Son, in this needful time, whom the Soul sees to be the Gist of <hi>Eternal Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we believe and know, upon this <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness</hi> of God, is founded, built and established the <hi>Everlasting Covenant,</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not only all men may be saved for its <hi>abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but some shall be saved because for its <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency) which is not like to the Covenant h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>in sufficiency</hi> in this Covenant, or because of the <hi>weakness of the Grace</hi> that appears in, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men; but because of <hi>mans will loving death, and chusing his own delusions,</hi> whereby <hi>his destruction is of himself,</hi> and God <hi>clear</hi> of his <hi>Blood</hi> in the free tender of his Grace, Gift and <hi>striving of the Spirit within him.</hi> For we know assuredly, according to the Scriptures of Truth, and experience of all souls that ever were tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly converted to God, that though <hi>by Grace man is saved, not of himself,</hi> but <hi>by the free Gift,</hi> yet as the old world did, and those rebellious <hi>Jews,</hi> spoken of, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. who as did their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, so did they, <hi>always resist the Holy Ghost;</hi> so do men now. And yet in the tender of this Grace, and striving of his spirit, the Lord is a God so hiding himself in the mannagement of this striving and Ministration of his Spirit, as if it wholly depended upon mans choice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting, that mans will, as to him is (as it were) free in rejecting or accepting, <hi>Life and Death being set before him;</hi> whereby in the wisdom of God, the propensity of his Name, as it came out of the hands of his Maker, hath an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by this dealing of God, to put forth it self; so that man is as free in the choice, as he is in the refusal of the tender of Mercy and Help, and that with an <hi>equal indifferency,</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to him in this state; notwithstanding af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29997:16"/>
in the further growth in this Grace and knowledge of Christ, he sees clearly and convincingly, that the Grace (that wrought hiddenly from his sight and knowledge, in the first working, tender and ministration of God towards him) gained his consent through its own prevalency in the Love of God, by which sight and sence <hi>self</hi> comes to be <hi>abhorred,</hi> and the <hi>free Love</hi> so <hi>admired,</hi> that he knows from first to last, all was of <hi>Grace,</hi> and that <hi>free;</hi> that <hi>self</hi> is not able to challenge any thing as due from what it had done, but <hi>all of gift:</hi> and yet as before, with such an equal indifferency on mans account: so that God may and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be just, both in condemning and saving; and <hi>the Justifier freely of all that believe in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, the Light of the world.</hi>

               <p>THere is the Natural man, and the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al man, and there are the Perswasions of each in and about matter of Religion. There is the perswasion of <hi>Reason</hi> and the perswasion of <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The perswasion of <hi>Reason</hi> is that Belief which man receives into his mind or heart from the exercise of the Reasoning Faculty: &amp; this perswasion in maters of Religion is but mans Opinion or Judgment, which how cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or infallible soever it appears to him, yet may be shaken by a demonstration or evidence of a higher kind of nature</p>
               <p>The perswasion of <hi>Faith,</hi> is that Belief which the new Creature receives into the renewing Mind, from the Evidence and Demonstration of the Spirit, which openeth and manifesteth the things of the Spirit, unto that mind which is begotten and renewed by it. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion is certain and infallible, however it may be struck at, and battered by the reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the wise Earthly part, even in that very man, whose heart is thus perswaded, by the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29997:18"/>
Light of the Spirit of God, concerning the things of Gods Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Now the lowest perswasion of <hi>Faith</hi> is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and of a more noble nature then the highest perswasion of <hi>Reason,</hi> because <hi>Faith</hi> is of an higher Principle, and of a deeper nature and ground, then mans Reason is: But this (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it appears not in mans sphear, but rather out of it, and is contrary to the line and reach of his wisdom) is accounted by him <hi>foolishness and madness.</hi> This is the Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And how can it be otherwise? How can the wisdom of men but judge that as foolishness, whose beauty and excellency is hid from its eye? But this is, because the wisdom of man is out of its place, not subjected to the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, but exalted above it: therefore (as a Curse unto it) is it suffered to lift up it self in its conceitfulness against, and so to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the pure Wisdom of God and the birth thereof, that it might fall, and be broken, and snared, and taken, and its day deservedly come to an end, and be shut up in the shadows and chambers of eternal darkness.</p>
               <p>But what Ear of Man can hear this? Surely none that is whole in the line of Man's wisdom, reason and understanding, but that alone which is bruised, broken, and in some measure dashed to pieces, by the inroads of a divine Life and

               <p>Happy is he who knows and hearkens to the Perswasions of God's Spirit, who is born of God, and taught to wait upon him and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him in Spirit, who receives his Religion from the Lig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>For though such may suffer very deeply in this World, from the men of this world, (as the Subjects and Servants to the Principle of Life have done in all Ages and Generations) yet their Principle will bear them out, in which God will appear to strengthen and refresh their spirits, and carry them up above all their Sufferings in the Patience, Meekness, and Faith of the Lamb; And keeping to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, they cannot be overcome, but must either live or die Conquerors, according to the will and good pleasure of Him who ordereth and disposeth of all things well, and bringeth

the face of the whole Earth, is a time and day of Visitation given, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and be saved by Jesus Christ, who is given of the Father to call the worst of men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and the most ungodly of sinners are convinced by him of their ungodly deeds, <hi>that they may believe, and be converted and saved.</hi>

               <p>And we believe, That there is a Crown of eternal Glory, and an Inheritance of eternal Life to be enjoy'd for evermore, by all that believe &amp; are chosen of God; and that there is an everlasting Misery and Destruction to be possessed by all that believe not, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the state of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> and are not changed from the ways of sin and death, but walk after the ways of their own hearts lusts, fulfilling the will of the flesh, in the evil of this world, and follow not Christ the Light of the world, that they may be saved; and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,

               <p>Concerning Religion, we believe, That it is the Spirit the of Lord, that makes men tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religious, and no man ought to be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to or from any exercise or practise in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by any outward Law or Power, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ought to be left free, as the Lord shall perswade his own mind, in doing or leaving undone this or the other practice in Religion; and every man, of what Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in Religion soever, ought to be protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Peace, provided himself be a man of Peace, not seeking the wrong of any mans Person or Estate.</p>

               <p>Again, We believe concerning <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> That there is a State of <hi>Election,</hi> and a State of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> a state chosen of God, and a state rejected of God; and that all Mankind are in one of these states: All that are elected are elected in Christ, and all that are out of him, are in the state <hi>Reprobate,</hi> bringing forth fruits of death and darkness, <hi>being Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Wrath and Disoebdience,</hi> in the <hi>Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Separation from God,</hi> in the Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion unreconciled to God, the Enmity ruling in the heart, being in the fall, and not restored to God again, but ignorant of his Power and Wisdom, <hi>having the Understanding darkened, that they cannot see nor perceive the things that are Eternal:</hi> And in this condition his best Works are Sin, and whatsoever he doth, he cannot be accepted of God; for he is dead to God, and alive to all Evil, bringing forth all his Works out of that ground which is cursed.

                  <p>And much more might be mentioned, how Christ foretold what was to come and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and revealed in that day, <hi>John</hi> 16. 23.

When the Spirit should be poured forth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prophets; all which plainly declareth, and most evidently sets forth, how Christ in his Ministry, when he was upon Earth, did most chiefly direct unto the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Spirit of Truth, which was then yet to come; and that they might not run to teach others (as many do now) before they had received the Spirit of Truth <hi>in themselves,</hi> by, and with that to be led into all Truth, but might receive the Power of truth in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, from the Life thereof, to convert others <hi>unto the same:</hi> therefore said he further, after he was risen again; <hi>But tarry ye in the City of</hi> Jerusa em <hi>until you be endued with power from on high,</hi> Mark 24. 4. so that though they had seen his body before, and had now seen him after his Resurrection, yet that and all the rest was not enough without the Power and the Spirit which was to come, which they were to wait for. And so now men should tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wait and stand still, to see the Salvation of God, and until they receive the Spirit; for it is the Spirit (not the body) which searcheth all things, and sheweth plainly of the Father.</p>

                  <p>Then whether or no people were to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue following <hi>Moses's Priests,</hi> with their Tythes and long Prayers, and still be seeking the Law at their mouthes, or <hi>to come to Christ,</hi> to seek the Gospel? for <hi>Moses</hi> himself did not fay, that they should seek the Gospel at the Priests mouth: And then when did the Priests ever preach the Gospel?</p>
                  <p>And then, whether those obey not <hi>Moses,</hi> who leave the Priests and come to Christ, the <hi>Light?</hi> and whether such, when they are come to Christ, should alwayes be looking and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing after his Body, Miracles, Baptism, or Supper <hi>without them,</hi> or tarry and wait to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit <hi>within them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then, which of these now should all people that profess Christ, be led by in these dayes, either <hi>Moses,</hi> or <hi>the Person of Christ,</hi> or <hi>the Spirit of Truth?</hi> And whether such as have received, and are truly indeed led by this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, and know that to be their Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and follow it, and are ruled, governed and guided by it, according to the Command of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> do not hereby obey the command of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> and fulfil their Doctrine? And whether any other People or Professors whatever do obey the Command

of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> but only such? And whether this be not a thing of great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be known and learned by all who Profess Christianity?</p>
                  <p>But why then do People follow these Priests of <hi>England</hi> any longer, which are contrary to <hi>Moses,</hi> and also to <hi>Christ,</hi> who have no Store-houses, but suffer the poor to want with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without, and the Widdow and the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ready to perish, and moreover devour, and can never have enough of the Spoil of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens goods?</p>
                  <p>And why do others dispute about, and talk of the Body so much, which they never saw nor knew? And is it not better to be silent, and know God who dwells in his People, and the Spirit of Truth, which he requires in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, and to feel after God, even the Life in themselves, because the Apostle said, they <hi>were saved by his Life being before recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by his Death, Rom.</hi> 5. 10? And until the Life came, there were many things which they were not saved from by the Body, for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was before the Death, and the Death which reconciles was passed through, before the Life was received again to save and Justifie.</p>
                  <p>And why then are people so much busied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that which was before the Reconciliation (and so therein much short of the Life) and

for outward <hi>Bread, Wine,</hi> and <hi>Water;</hi> Are not these things which are seen? And are not the things that are seen Temporal?</p>
                  <p>But Christ the true Prophet, being come, of whom <hi>Moses</hi> did write, who is the end of the Law, and so the end of that Ministry, whereby that is done away for the weakness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableness thereof; and Christ coming af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>John,</hi> of whom <hi>John</hi> bore witness, that he was before, and greater, and came after him; and Christ also having finished that which he himself came to do: and likewise so largely and often Exhorted to wait for <hi>another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, even the Spirit of Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then what Ministration is it that now stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and remaineth, which is according both to <hi>Moses, Christ</hi> and the holy <hi>Scriptures?</hi> and what Ministration is to be expected or waited for, but the Ministration of the Spirit? And whether all they be not compassed about with a cloud of error, who are upholding that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Law (or a worse) which Christ is the end of, and the Apostles said <hi>was done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> and likewise such as are upholding and keeping up that which Christ said, <hi>he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished?</hi> And whether the upholding of such things now, be not quite opposite, both to <hi>Moses, Christ</hi> and <hi>Scriptures?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And being that <hi>Moses,</hi> nor indeed his true Ministers of the Law, <hi>are not upon Earth,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that Body of Christ (which by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors was murthered at <hi>Jerusalem)</hi> visibly to be seen <hi>upon Earth;</hi> then what is it those have to follow, who have not received the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be led by?</hi> and if they will say, <hi>they have the Writings of Moses</hi> and <hi>the Words of Christ;</hi> I say, if that be all, then they that forsook and denyed Christ had more then them; for they had the words from his own mouth, which were <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and yet they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not; (and then what do those under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand who have not so much as they had?) therefore after he had suffered, and rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he opened their understandings.</p>
                  <p>And so, what is all their Religion worth, who are not come to the Spirit? And whether <hi>Moses</hi>'s Ministration being ended by Christ, and Christ also having finished his work, are not all People in the first place, now to wait for the Spirit, and to receive the Spirit by it, then to be led into all Truth; and so being first led into the Truth, then in the same Truth to worship God in Spirit, who is a Spirit? And whether there be now any true Worship standing, which God accepteth, but only this? And whether this alone be not agreeable to <hi>Moses, Christ</hi> and <hi>Scriptures?</hi> And whether all other Worships now upheld, be not contrary to this true Worship of God, and contrary to

                     <hi>Moses</hi> and his Ministry were visible, and Christ in the form of a Servant (and so like unto <hi>Moses)</hi> was visible, and so were his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; and that which is visible to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral eye, the carnal mind can come to profess and contend about; but the blessed eye, which God openeth with the Light, cometh to see the one done away, and the other finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ, the Light and Life.</p>
                  <p>And the Spirit is that which first moved, and yet moveth, and moved unto, and led through the visible Ministration; and this Spirit is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, as it is wirtten, <hi>the invisible only wise God,</hi> whom no eye of flesh hath seen, or can see; and this moving invisible Spirit of God which is without limit or end, is that which all people should be led unto, by all its outward visible appearances, ministration and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:29997:37"/>
and this Spirit was that which gave forth and ordained the Ministration of the Law, which was glorious in its time, though to be done away: but how much more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is the Ministration of that Spirit of Life it self, from which the Ministration of the Law came, which Spirit abideth for ever. And the <hi>second Adam is made a quickning Spirit;</hi> and the Spirit which is the Word, <hi>was with God,</hi> and <hi>was God,</hi> before the body of flesh was made; and that Spirit abideth forever, as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And this forever blessed invisible Spirit was before time, and is to be when time shall be no more; and is without limit, an eternal lively Substance, giving Life from it self, and secretly covering it self from the carnal part of man, not seen nor understood, but by such as by its secret motions come to be led to see through that which shadows it forth, and by the Image, form, shadow or figure, to discern the Substance, which is the Life, where Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality dwelleth: for in the most innermost and secret of all is the Life of all, being cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with that in which it lies; through which it breaking forth in any discovery of it self, is that whereby the beholders might be drawn through the discovry unto it self, which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:29997:38"/>
in the discovery broke forth; for the discovery was still too short of that from whence it came, &amp; that which was discovered forth in any Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, Form or Image, was not to be idolized nor set up, for the very things or Substance of Life, from whence it proceeded; and herein hath been much mistaken, by such who came not by that, which opened in the Visibles, to that from whence it came, in that to have their understandings opened, and thereby to be made sensible of that which is Eternal by it to be brought in, where its Indwellings abide forever, whose breaking forth in the Visible (which was to draw to that invisible) refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Soul invisibly, in an unexpected man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and time; but being (after) sought for in the visibles (and not in the Eternal) withdraws it self out of the visibles, and out of the sight and reach of that which seeks it there, that thereby that which is to live forever with it, may come through all that which it appeared in unto the very thing and invisible Substance it self, which is the Life of all, and the true Center of the living motion which moveth of itself, and gave forth all things good, as they proceed from it, by vertue of its gradual, and various motions; and this being come opens it self, in them that find it, and live therein; and this maketh Darkness Light before the People

whose dwellings is with God, and the crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed comes to be made streight by the things it self, and dark sayings of old come to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and secret things revealed.</p>
                  <p>But to write more plain for the sake of the weak, of this glorious indwelling Spirit, which in the fulness of time cometh forth in flefh, laying hold of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the most glorious Appearance that ever was; being thus appeared, was the express Image of God, who dwelleth in his People, whose bodies are flesh and earthly Tabernacles; but by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the <hi>Sanctifying, cleansing Siprit,</hi> which the Father sendeth, are made fit habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, and Co-heirs with Christ, and Members of his Body, Flesh and Bones; which Spirit quickneth to God, and being thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and obeyed, is felt to live forever, though the shadowings forth of it be done away, and this is Eternal, and never endeth, but a bideth with such forever; and the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And as the Lord took of that Spirit which was upon <hi>Moses,</hi> and put it upon his Brethren the Elders of <hi>Israel,</hi> whereby they might rule and judge with him; so saith Christ, <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall take of mine, and give it unto you,</hi>

even of that Spirit of Love, Life, Power, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Virtue, which was upon and in him, (that was like unto <hi>Moses)</hi> is ministred into, and put upon such as are truly his Brethren and Friends, whereby, with him, they (thus gifted, sanctified and qualified) judge the World: <hi>for all Judgment is committed to the Son,</hi> and of that which the Son hath (and is committed to him) doth the Father give unto his Members, and so from Christ the Head they come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Power over the World, and its Way, Worship, and Fashions, and over unclean spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And that is an unclean spirit which will lead into any sin, and it is an unclean spirit in which sin standeth, and which pleadeth for the continuance, and upholding of that which is unclean; and that is of the World, which the Saints Judge.</p>
                  <p>And as those Elders of <hi>Israel</hi> (who were of the Church in the Wilderness) were not made fit <hi>to Judge or Rule in outward matters</hi> by all the writings and words of the Law (though received by disposition of Angels) until the Lord himself took of that Spirit which was upon <hi>Moses</hi> and put upon them.</p>
                  <p>So those that profess to be Elders in the Church now, or any other person whatsoever, are much less made fit to <hi>Rule or Judge in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual matters,</hi> by all the reading and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Moses</hi> Writings, and Christs Words, and

the rest of the Holy Scriptures (though they were given by the Inspiration of God) until the Lord take of that Spirit which was upon, and in Christ (who is like unto <hi>Moses)</hi> and give unto, and pour it upon, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster it in un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And though Christ (after his Resurrection) said, <hi>All Power in Heaven and in Earth is given unto me, Go ye therefore and teach;</hi> yet they were to tarry until they had the power in themselves; and when that was come, which they were to tarry and wait for, then with that they went, and so taught the Nations, from the sensible feeling of that which taught them how to teach, and all things else, when the same Spirit and Power was upon them, which was before committed unto him; and so the coming forth of it from him into them and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them therewith, was to them in that work of the Ministry most effectual: like as the Vertue going forth of Christ healed the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; so the Power and Vertue of the Holy Spirit, coming forth from Christ, being sent of the Father, and received by the Disciples (who with much desire waited for that) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:29997:40"/>
them to do that which before they were commanded to do, after they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Power (or had the Power in them) and so what they were commanded to do, they were to wait to receive Power in themselves from God to perform; and Christ did intend to give them Power to do that which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: And as he commanded them to go and teach, he also required them to tarry (and so not to go) until they had received so to do; and so it was the Power of the holy Ghost in them, which made them Ministers, and these were, and such are, truly Ordained Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters: And after they had received Power from on High, even the Spirit (or Life) of Truth, and were filled therewith, and so had it in them, then they went to do that which was commanded them; then they went to teach Nations, and converted thousands, and turned sinners, and brought Souls to God, and then they were called <hi>Christians,</hi> and then were People brought to be of the True Church which Christ buildeth upon that which Flesh and Blood revealeth not.</p>
                  <p>And this is the Enterance into the Church in God, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>The receiving of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and in this God is Worshipped, and not else, for this hath excluded all other Worship;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:29997:40"/>
and these only are the true Worshippers, who come in thus by the door, which is Christ, the Light and Spirit of Truth, sent into the heart from God.</p>
                  <p>And if all the prudent learned Divines (so called) in <hi>Europe,</hi> or all, or any of the wisest Orthodox men (so called) in any other quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the whole World, can prove by the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament any other true Worship of God (who is a Spirit) now extant among men, and to be performed (especially among them called Christians) with acceptance to God, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which the Spirit of Truth leadeth such unto as receive it; then let them bring it forth that we may see it, and prove it by plain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable truth of Scripture; or otherwise I shall look upon their proofs, words, ways, actions, practices, performances, duties, and several Worships, as things of no value.</p>
                  <p>Or if there be any other enterance into the true Worship of God, then this Spirit that God sendeth for the Light, which leadeth to it, or if there be any other Worship which God doth, or will accept to be after this, spoken or prophesied of in the Scriptures of Truth, whereby this shall ever be done away, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, from being the true, only, and alone Worship of God, whilst men have a being

                  <p>For this I am satisfied in, that Christ Jesus (who is the End of the Law, and who finished his work, when he was upon the Earth) is made a Quickning Spirit, and is the Way and Truth of life, which bringeth into the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, and he is the Beginning and the End, and he leadeth to the beginning of Gods Worship, and he is the end and the Rest of all the Faithful, in whom all the promises are <hi>Yea and Amen;</hi> and without him all is as nothing, and all that comes before him are Theives and Robbers: and he it is that abideth a Priest for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and his Spirit of Truth is it, which all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And then thus I <hi>query;</hi> If Christ's own dear Disciples, who had forsook all and followed him (not <hi>Priests</hi> or <hi>Papists)</hi> did not come to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:29997:41"/>
receive this Spirit, by hearing all the words which he spoke unto them, but by waiting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the words were ended; Then, whether those that have not forsaken all (nor so much as the Worlds fashions) do now come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Spirit by reading, hearing or profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the same words of Christ, now written, or any other part of the Scriptures?</p>
                  <p>Or, whether a Proud man hath received this Spirit, or a Lyar or Profane Person, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Wise or Prudent Man whatsoever, by any means or way of his? And whether any such ever did, have or can or may by any industry, or other way or means attain to this Spirit which leadeth in the true Worship of God, but as it is freely given forth from God? and then whether all people are not to be led by that Spirit (which God freely giveth) into the Worship of God; because Christ said, <hi>the Spirit shall lead,</hi> which indeed doth lead into all Truth, and nothing else doth so? And they that have not received this from God to lead them, are not yet come to be led by that which the Sons and Children of God were, and are led by.</p>
                  <p>And the Ministration of the Spirit, which all are now to be taught by, is inwardly to be known, in the nearest, secret invisible maner, and is more out of the sight, comprehension,

and reach of mans Wisdom then any other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration; and it is given forth from the clear Foundation it self, unto the soul satisfaction of man, when he is come to the end of words; or having heard much, or all the words that can he spoken of it, remaineth unsatisfied, in a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less longing desire, to find, receive, feel and enjoy the thing it self, which the words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare of; and that which sat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>And the secret invisible Hand of God whose Power was and is felt in my heart, having out of the sight of Flesh and Blood, in the hidden counsel of his secret Will, led me by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the opreations and drawings thereof, through those things, which thereby I come to leave behind, and to receive and feel that which now goeth before, and is my Leader, in whose Covenant of Life Eternal, my Soul is now satisfied; and so by good experience of
