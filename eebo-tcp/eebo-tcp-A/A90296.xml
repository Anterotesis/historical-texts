            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the <hi>Papall</hi> world for the <hi>ſeducing</hi> of this poor Nation:
that I ſay nothing, how this <hi>viall</hi> was poured out upon the

in our ſelves, that we ſhould ſo <hi>undervalue</hi> and ſleight the
<hi>free mercy</hi> of God, in breaking ſuch a ſnare, and ſetting the
Goſpel at liberty in <hi>England.</hi> My intent was, having before
aſſerted this reſtauration of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the <hi>good pleaſure</hi>
of God, to have ſtirred you up to <hi>thankefullneſſe</hi> unto him, and
<hi>ſelf-humiliation</hi> in conſideration of our great undeſerving
of ſuch mercy; but alas; as far as I can ſee, it will ſcarce <hi>paſſe</hi>
for a mercy: and unleſſe every mans <hi>perſwaſion</hi> may be a
<hi>Joſephs ſheaf,</hi> the goodneſſe of God ſhall ſcarce be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged;
but yet let all the <hi>world</hi> know, and let the houſe of
<hi>England</hi> know this day, that we lie <hi>unthankefully</hi> under as
full a diſpenſation of mercy and grace, as ever Nation in the
world enjoyed, and that without a lively <hi>acknowledgement</hi>
thereof, with our own <hi>unworthineſſe</hi> of it, we ſhall one
day know what it is (being taught with briars and thorns)
to <hi>undervalue</hi> the glorious Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus. Good
Lord! what would <hi>helpleſſe Macedonians</hi> give for one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiment?
O that <hi>Wales,</hi> O that <hi>Ireland,</hi> O that <hi>France,</hi>
Where ſhall I ſtop? I would <hi>offend</hi> none, but give me leave
to ſay, O that <hi>every,</hi> I had almoſt ſaid, O that <hi>any</hi> part of the
world, had ſuch <hi>helpes</hi> and means of grace, as theſe parts of
<hi>England</hi> have, which will ſcarce <hi>acknowledge</hi> any mercy in
it: the Lord break the <hi>pride</hi> of our ſpirits, before it break the

but if he come the <hi>third</hi> time and finde no fruit, the ſentence

to prevent this I ſhall not follow all thoſe Goſpel-ſupplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſins we finde in holy writ, onely I deſire to <hi>cautionate</hi>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Take heed of pretending or <hi>holding</hi> out the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
for a covert or <hi>ſhadow</hi> for other things. God will not
have this Goſpel made a <hi>ſtalking horſe</hi> for carnall deſignes:
put not in that <hi>glorious name,</hi> where the thing it ſelf is not
<hi>clearly</hi> intended; if in any thing it be, let it have no <hi>compeer;</hi>
if not, let it not be <hi>named;</hi> if that you aim at be juſt, it needs
no <hi>varniſh;</hi> if it be not, it is the worſe for it. Gilded pills
loſe not their <hi>bitternes,</hi> and <hi>painted</hi> faces are thought to
have no native beauty; all things in the world ſhould <hi>ſerve</hi>
the Goſpel; and if that be made to <hi>ſerve</hi> other things, God
will quickly vindicate it into liberty.</p>
            <p>From the beginning of theſe troubles, <hi>right honourable,</hi>
you have held forth <hi>Religion</hi> and the Goſpel, as whoſe <hi>preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>
and reſtauration was principally in the aims, and I
preſume <hi>malice</hi> it ſelf is not able to <hi>diſcover</hi> any <hi>inſincerity</hi>
in this, the <hi>fruits</hi> we behold proclaim to all the <hi>conformity</hi>
of your words and hearts. Now the God of Heaven grant
that the <hi>ſame minde</hi> be in you ſtill, in every particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:159666:20"/>
of this Honourable Aſſembly, in the <hi>whole</hi> Nation, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> and <hi>Miniſtery</hi> of it, that we be
not like the <hi>boatmen,</hi> look <hi>one way,</hi> and rowe <hi>another;</hi> cry
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> and mean the <hi>other thing;</hi> Lord Lord, and advance
our own ends, that the Lord may not ſtir up the <hi>ſtaffe</hi> of his

people.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take heed of <hi>resting</hi> upon, and truſting to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
priviledge, how ever excellent and glorious, of the <hi>outward</hi>

If now <hi>England</hi> have received more <hi>culture</hi> from God then

if it be as <hi>earth,</hi> which when <hi>the rain falls upon it, brings

to ſay, (and the Lord avert the evil deſerved by it) That
<hi>England,</hi> (I mean theſe Cities, and thoſe other places,
which ſince the beginning of our troubles, have enjoied the
Goſpel, in a more free and plentifull manner then hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
hath <hi>ſhewed</hi> it ſelf not much to <hi>value</hi> it.</p>
            <p>1. In the time of <hi>Straits,</hi> though the ſound of the

if it run croſſe to the preſcriptions of <hi>authority,</hi> it ſhall
cheerfully ſubmit to the <hi>cenſure</hi> thereof; In the mean time,
all <hi>Petitioning</hi> of any party about this buſineſſe, ſeems to
thwart ſome <hi>Declarations</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
I doubt not, but they intend for the <hi>main,</hi> inviolably
and unalterably to adhere. Adde hereunto, that <hi>petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
in this kinde, was not long ſince <hi>voted breach in privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
in them, who might <hi>juſtly</hi> expect, as much <hi>favour</hi>
and <hi>liberty</hi> in petitioning, as any of their <hi>brethren</hi> in the
Kingdom, and I have more then one reaſon to <hi>ſuppoſe,</hi>
that the <hi>purpoſe</hi> and deſigne of <hi>theirs</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> was one,
and the ſame.</p>
            <p>3. There are <hi>no ſmall grounds</hi> of ſuppoſall, that ſome
<hi>petitions</hi> have not their <hi>riſe</hi> from amongſt them by whom
they are <hi>ſubſcribed,</hi> but that the <hi>ſpring</hi> and maſter wheels
giving the <hi>firſt motion</hi> to them, are <hi>diſtant</hi> and unſeen;
My ſelf having been <hi>lately urged</hi> to ſubſcription, upon this
<hi>ground,</hi> that <hi>directions were had for it from above,</hi> (as we
uſe to ſpeak in the Countrey) yea in <hi>this,</hi> I could ſay <hi>more</hi>
then I <hi>intend,</hi> aiming at nothing but the quieting of mens
<hi>spirits,</hi> needleſly exaſperated, only I cannot but <hi>ſay,</hi> that
<hi>honeſt</hi> men ought to be very <hi>cautious,</hi> how they put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
upon any <hi>engagement,</hi> that might make any <hi>party</hi> or
faction in the <hi>Kingdom;</hi> ſuppoſe that their <hi>intereſt</hi> in the
leaſt meaſure, <hi>doth run croſſe to that of the great Councell
thereof,</hi> thereby to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> the hands or deſignes of any,
by occaſioning an <hi>opinion</hi> that upon <hi>freſh or new diviſions,</hi>
(which God of his mercy prevent) we would not adhere
conſtantly to our old <hi>principles,</hi> walking according to <hi>which,</hi>
we have hitherto found <hi>protection</hi> and ſafety. And I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:159666:29"/>
not but be <hi>jealous</hi> for the honour of our noble <hi>Parliament,</hi>
whoſe <hi>authority</hi> is every day <hi>undermined,</hi> and their <hi>regard</hi>
in the affections of the people <hi>ſhaken,</hi> by ſuch dangerous <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations,</hi>
as though they could in an <hi>houre</hi> put an end to
all our <hi>diſturbances,</hi> but refuſe it. This ſeaſon alſo for ſuch
<hi>petitions,</hi> ſeems to me very <hi>unſeaſonable,</hi> the greateſt <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing</hi>
danger impendent to this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> being from
the conteſt about <hi>Church-Government,</hi> which by ſuch
means as this, is exceedingly <hi>heightned,</hi> and animoſity
added to the <hi>parties</hi> at variance.</p>
            <p>4. A particular <hi>form</hi> of Church-Diſcipline is uſually in
ſuch <hi>petitions,</hi> either directly <hi>expreſſed,</hi> or evidently <hi>pointed</hi>
at, and directed unto, as that alone which our <hi>Covenant</hi>
engageth us to <hi>embrace;</hi> Yea, as though it had long ſince
<hi>deſigned</hi> that <hi>particular</hi> way, and diſtinguiſhed it from all
<hi>others;</hi> the <hi>embracing</hi> of it, is preſſed under the <hi>pain</hi> of
breach of <hi>Covenant,</hi> a crime abhorred of God and man.
Now truly to ſuppoſe that our <hi>Covenant</hi> did ty us up <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely</hi>

characteriſe men (otherwiſe godly and peaceable) as <hi>Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>

thing it ſelf, rightly apprehended, whereunto <hi>lighter dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences</hi>
do not amount; Such <hi>names</hi> as this, I know are
<hi>arbitrary,</hi> and generally ſerve the <hi>wills</hi> of the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
They are commonly <hi>Sectaries,</hi> who (<hi>jure aut injuria</hi>)
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:159666:29"/>
are oppreſſed. Nothing was ever <hi>perſecuted</hi> under an eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

amongſt <hi>theſe</hi> again, to <hi>ſome</hi> I have been a <hi>Puritanicall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary,</hi>
an Aerian Haeretick, becauſe <hi>Anti-prelaticall:</hi> yea
and amongſt <hi>theſe last,</hi> not a <hi>few</hi> account me a <hi>Sectary,</hi>
becauſe I plead for <hi>Presbyteriall</hi> Government in Churches:
and to all theſe am I thus <hi>eſteemed,</hi> as I am fully convinced,
<hi>cauſeleſly</hi> and <hi>erroneouſly,</hi> what they call <hi>ſectariſme,</hi> I am
perſwaded is <hi>ipſiſſima veritas,</hi> the very truth it ſelf, to which
they alſo ought to ſubmit, that others alſo though upon <hi>falſe
grounds,</hi> are <hi>convinced</hi> of the truth of their own <hi>perſwaſion,</hi>
I cannot but believe; and therefore as I finde by <hi>experience,</hi>
that the horrid names of <hi>Haeretick, Schiſmatick, ſectary,</hi>
and the like, have never had any <hi>influence</hi> or force upon my
<hi>judgement,</hi> nor otherwiſe moved me, unleſſe it were unto
<hi>retaliation;</hi> ſo I am perſwaded it is alſo with <hi>others,</hi> for
<hi>homines ſumus;</hi> forcing them abroad in ſuch <hi>liveries,</hi> doth
not at all <hi>convince</hi> them, that they are <hi>ſervants</hi> to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of <hi>ſects</hi> indeed, but only, makes them <hi>wait</hi> an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
to caſt the like <hi>mantle</hi> on their traducers. And this
uſually is the beginning of <hi>arming</hi> the more againſt the few,
with <hi>violence:</hi> impatient of <hi>bearing the burdens,</hi> which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:159666:30"/>
they impoſe on others ſhoulders: by means whereof, <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom</hi>
hath been made a <hi>theatre of blood:</hi> and <hi>one</hi> amongſt
all, after that by <hi>cruelty and villany,</hi> he had prevailed above
the reſt, took upon him to be the only <hi>dictator</hi> in Chriſtian
Religion: but of this afterwards.</p>
            <p>Now by the <hi>conceſſion</hi> of theſe, as I hope not <hi>unequita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
demands, thus much at <hi>leaſt</hi> I conceive will be attained,
<hi>viz.</hi> that a peaceable <hi>diſſent</hi> in ſome ſmaller things, <hi>dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi>
queſtions, <hi>not-abſolutely-neceſſary</hi> aſſertions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
not any <hi>rigid</hi> cenſure, diſtance off <hi>affections,</hi> or breach
of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Communion and amity: in ſuch things as theſe,
<hi>veniam petimuſ<expan>
                     <am>

I can hardly bring my <hi>minde</hi> to comply and cloſe in with
<hi>them,</hi> amongſt whom almoſt any thing is <hi>lawfull</hi> but to
diſſent.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being <hi>premiſed,</hi> I ſhall now ſet down and
make <hi>publike,</hi> that propoſall, which heretofore I have <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi>
as a means to give ſome <hi>light</hi> into a way for the profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and comfortable <hi>practice</hi> of <hi>Church-Government;</hi>
drawing out of generall <hi>notions</hi> what is practically appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
ſo <hi>circumstantiated,</hi> as of neceſſity it muſt be: and
herein I ſhall not <hi>alter</hi> any thing, or in the leaſt <hi>expreſſion</hi>
go off from that which <hi>long ſince</hi> I drew up at the <hi>requeſt</hi>
of a worthy friend, after a diſcourſe about it: and <hi>this,</hi> not
only becauſe it hath <hi>already</hi> been in the hands of <hi>many,</hi> but
<hi>alſo</hi> becauſe my <hi>intent</hi> is not, either to <hi>aſſert,</hi> diſpute, or
make out any thing further of my <hi>judgement</hi> in theſe things,
then I have <hi>already</hi> done, (hoping for more leaſure ſo to do,
then the few houres aſſigned to the product of this ſhort ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix
will permit) but only by way of a <hi>defenſative,</hi> to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
that the <hi>rumours</hi> which have been <hi>ſpread</hi> by ſome,
and entertained by <hi>others,</hi> too greedily about this matter,
have been exceeding <hi>cauſeleſſe</hi> and groundleſſe; So that
though my ſecond <hi>thoughts</hi> have, if I miſtake not, much <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi>
ſome particulars in this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> yet I cannot be <hi>indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi>
becauſe of the reaſon before recounted (the only cauſe of
the publication thereof) to make any <hi>alteration</hi> in it, only I
ſhall preſent the <hi>reader</hi> with ſome few things, which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:159666:30"/>
gave <hi>occaſion</hi> and riſe to this propoſall. As</p>
            <p>1. A fervent <hi>deſire</hi> to prevent all further <hi>diviſion</hi> and
ſeparation, <hi>diſunion</hi> of mindes amongſt godly men, <hi>ſuspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi>
and jealouſies in the <hi>people</hi> towards their <hi>miniſters,</hi> as
aiming at <hi>power</hi> and unjuſt domination over them, <hi>fruitles</hi>
diſputes, languiſhings about <hi>unprofitable</hi> queſtions, breach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of charity for <hi>trifles,</hi> exaſperating the <hi>mindes</hi> of men one
againſt another: all which <hi>growing</hi> evils, tending to the
ſubverſion of <hi>Chriſtian love,</hi> and the power of godlineſſe,
with the <hi>diſturbance</hi> of the <hi>state,</hi> are too much fomented
by that ſad breach and diviſion, which is here <hi>attempted</hi>
to be made up.</p>
            <p>2. A <hi>deſire</hi> to work and <hi>draw</hi> the mindes of all my <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi>
(the moſt I hope need it not) to ſet in, for a thorow
<hi>Reformation,</hi> and for the obtaining of <hi>holy Communion,</hi> to
keep off indifferently the unworthy from Church privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and prophaning of holy things. Whereunto, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
the <hi>diſcovery</hi> of a way whereby this might be <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,</hi>
without their <hi>diſturbance</hi> in their <hi>former station,</hi> would
be a conſiderable motive.</p>
            <p>3. A <hi>conſideration</hi> of the <hi>paucity</hi> of poſitive <hi>rules</hi> in the
Scripture for <hi>Church-Government</hi> with the great <hi>difficulty</hi>
of reducing them to <hi>practiſe</hi> in theſe preſent times, (both
ſufficiently evidenced by the endleſſe diſputes, and irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable
differences of godly, precious and learned men about
them, made me <hi>conceive,</hi> that the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
Churches, (doubtleſſe for a time obſerved in thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
ſucceeding) would be the beſt <hi>externall help</hi> for
the right <hi>interpretation</hi> of thoſe rules we have, and <hi>patern</hi>
to draw out a <hi>Church way by.</hi> Now truly after my beſt
<hi>ſearch,</hi> and inquiry, into the <hi>first Churches</hi> and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
framing an <hi>Idea</hi> and exemplar of them, this poor
<hi>heap</hi> following, ſeems to me, as like <hi>one of them,</hi> as any
thing that yet I have ſeen: nothing at all <hi>doubting,</hi> but
that if a more <hi>skilfull</hi> hand had the <hi>limning</hi> of it,<note place="margin">

tell me, whether any rationall man can ſuppoſe, that either
there were in thoſe places, ſundry <hi>particular Churches, with
their diſtinct peculiar officers, acting in moſt paſtorall duties
ſeverally in them, as distinguiſhed and divided into entire ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,
but ruling them in reſpect of ſome particulars loyally
in combination, conſidered as diſtinct bodies;</hi> or elſe, that
they were <hi>ſuch ſingle Congregations, as that all that power
and authority which was in them, may ſeem fitly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
to be entruſted, with a ſmall handfull of men,
combined under one ſingle Paſtour, with one, two, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
no aſſociated Elders.</hi> More then this, I ſhall only
ask, whether all <hi>ordinary power,</hi> may not without danger,
be aſſerted to <hi>reſide</hi> in ſuch a <hi>Church</hi> as is here deſcribed,
reſerving all <hi>due right</hi> and authority, to <hi>Councels</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates.</hi>

<hi>people,</hi> this is no place to <hi>diſpute;</hi> theſe following <hi>lines</hi>
