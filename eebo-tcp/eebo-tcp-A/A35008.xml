            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>An Eſſay towards the Allaying of</hi> George Fox <hi>his Spirit.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>CHriſtian Friend, I deſire that my Imperfections, nor theſe Quakers revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings may not prejudice thee, againſt the impartial and ſerious reading of this <hi>Diſcovery,</hi> for they cannot repreſent me a greater ſinner than (I thank God) I think my ſelf to be, but they by their villifying of me ſhew the weakneſs of their cauſe and the wickedneſs of their ſpirits; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy between us is not what <hi>T. C.</hi> is, but whether or no <hi>G. Fox, &amp;c.</hi> have printed ſo as I charge them, and whether or no thoſe Expreſſions objected againſt by me be not unchriſtian and contemptable; if they be not, then I have wronged them, but if they be the product of Ignorance or worſe, then the Authors thereof were falſe Prophets, Diviners and Conjurers by <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s own judgment in print. I deſire you only to judge of the Tree by its fruit, and remember that altho' the poor Aſs was beat by the mad, angry and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Prophet, yet the poor Aſs ſaw the Angel when he did not. Theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers charge me for ſhort quoting of <hi>G. F</hi>'s words, of which fault <hi>G. F.</hi> is herein proved groſly guilty: My charge was not on the Quakers in general, but particular Perſons, which I diſtinguiſhed from chriſtian Quakers by the Term of <hi>Foxonian Quakers,</hi> but others by covering and juſtifying the wicked have made themſelves guilty, and this <hi>Diſcovery</hi> is not uncovering of Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but warranted by their own practice and in print. This is not in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the High Prieſt's Servant <hi>Ed. Pennington.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS is ſaid in <hi>Acts.</hi> 8. ſo it hath been in theſe days, there was a Man cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>G. Fox,</hi> into whom a Spirit entred, giving out that himſelf was ſome great One, to whom moſt of the Quakers gave heed, ſaying, This is the great power of God, and having in his life, and alſo ſince his death, extolled this <hi>G. Fox</hi> above what they ought, <hi>W. P.</hi> eſpecially, ſaying, <hi>Many have done well, but thou</hi> Dear George <hi>excellest them all,</hi> but it was in ſelf-exalting and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing others, and having contemned Water-baptiſme, Lord's Supper and the Scriptures, he invents an Image of Female-prelates in their Church, and theſe his chief Prieſts make an Idol thereof, and deck it with high Titles, as <hi>the great and good Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, which he hath ſet up in his Church,</hi> and he <hi>G. F.</hi> ſays to theſe Women when ſo met by his Order about the <hi>10th.</hi> hour of the day, G. F. ſaith, <hi>whoſe mouth the Lord opens in the Womens meeting to praiſe him, they are to be obedient,</hi> as if the Lords opening their mouths were not ſufficient without his licenſe, and of this Image they have in print alſo ſince his death, with other of his Appointments ſaid, <hi>You know Friends that all the meetings mens and Womens,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>were ſet up by the Power, Spirit and wiſdom of God,</hi> ſo indeſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Duties as they ſay, in the room of them two, <hi>Water-baptiſme</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi>'s<hi>-ſupper.</hi> I conſidering the evil conſequences of theſe things, and knowing by the rule given in Scripture, <hi>(viz.</hi> That the Tree may be known by its fruit) that this Spirit of theirs is not of Chriſt but that Man of Sin, who exalteth himſelf above all that is called God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay, theſe conſiderations

               </gap>o others the fruits of the Spirit of <hi>G. F.</hi> in hopes that many amongſt them who be honeſt would condemn thoſe Wickedneſſeſs, and ſo clear themſelves thereof; for indeed although they charge me with Envy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God knows its falſe, for they are to me many of them, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith the <hi>Jews</hi> were to him, and I never had any prejudice againſt any of them, but know they exalted themſelves too much and deſpiſed others, as the proud <hi>Phariſees,</hi> excuſing their Contempts of our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> his ſufferings and blood, and the Scriptures, Magiſtrates, and almoſt all Chriſtians ever ſince the Apoſtles to the worlds end, except themſelves, and this I have in print proved, and in this and other their wickedneſs they are uncharitable and unchriſtian, and ſcandalous to the proteſtant Religion, eſpecially <hi>England,</hi> and if they do own the true Faith and Scriptures, and our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> truly, they muſt condemn and diſown them printed Expreſſions tending to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for the Matter in controverſy is not what thy now ſay they believe, but about what is in print from <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and others their chief Rulers and Teachers, whom they give theſe high Titles to, and write ſuch Epiſtles and high Commendations of them and their Writings, as will more fully be made appear <hi>W. P.</hi> and many more of them have done of and to <hi>G. Fox</hi> and others, conſidering <hi>W. P</hi>'s great power in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and great intereſt in all the Quakers in <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere, and influence over them, I think they may be 100000 and 1000 of them preachers, and may have 1000 Meetings in <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> and I fear <hi>W. P</hi>'s influences 80000 of them; ſo that what Intereſt, Doctrine or Men he eſpouſes is moſt likely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, Experience have proved the truth of this, but they are but ſowing their Seed now, but the full Crop and effect of theſe their evil Labours may not be known in this Age, and indeed many of their printed Expreſſions are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptious of our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Mahometans</hi> may from them take great advantages to deny the New Teſtament in part, ſaying, Your new Teſtament ſays, That him whom our Rulers killed was the Saviour, and that they by wicked hands ſlew him; but the Quakers ſays, what was done to him was done by Law, and in a great part by due execution of a Law; alſo they ſay the <hi>Jews</hi> never ſee the World's Saviour, your New Teſtament ſays, that Jeſus with his own blood ſhed without the gate ſanctifies the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but theſe Quakers ſay his Blood was no more than the Blood of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saint. Excuſed by <hi>G. W.</hi> as in <hi>G. K</hi>'s paper.</p>
            <p>Their Scripture accuſe our Rulers for cruelty to <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when as you are more cruel to them, as they ſay, and theſe Quakers ſay, <hi>His Diſciples loved his perſon for the ſake of the frame, and quality of the Spirit that dwelt in him, or elſe what is his perſon more than another perſon:</hi> But our Rulers did not condemn him for ſaying the Son of God was in his prepared Body, but becauſe he ſaid of himſelf he was the Son of God, for they meddled with nothing in that body, only a Soldier with his ſphere let out ſome of his blood, which theſe Quakers ſay was no more than the blood of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saint, therefore your New Teſtament ſeems by theſe their printed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to charge our Rulers too hardly in ſaying of him <hi>whom they took down from the Tree and laid in the Sepulchre—That through this Man his preaching Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40706:2"/>
               <hi>of Sins, and that by him all that believe are juſtified,</hi> but by their Doctrine it ſeems to us that Man our Rulers crucified was but a <hi>Garment</hi> or <hi>Veſſel</hi> that Chriſt dwelt in ſaying, <hi>The ſame Chriſt therein crucified aſcended into Heaven,</hi> but they meddled with nothing within that body, nor laid no hands on Chriſt, as your New Teſtament charges them.</p>
            <p>Indeed I have not capacity to expreſs how deſtructive to the new Teſtament Doctrine many printed Expreſſions of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s, <hi>W. P. G. W.</hi> &amp;c. are or may be, beſides what formerly publiſhed, ſee more now publiſhed by <hi>G. K.</hi> in a book entituled <hi>A true Copy of a Paper,</hi> &amp;c. from page 17 to the end, I ſay if the Enemies of the Chriſtian Religion ſhould but take the advantage of their printed Contempts they may be of ill conſequence, and hinder the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the chriſtian Faith, as in the new Teſtament, if not to the ſubverſion thereof.</p>
            <p>But if any object, why ſhould theſe Quakers now living be blamed, for the Errours (of the dead) ſeeing they ſay they believe rightly in Jeſus Chriſt. I do believe many of them are not ſo guilty as them who wrote thoſe Errours, but it may be doubted that few of them are ſound in the Faith, if we may judge by their dubious and too-faced expreſſions thereabouts; alſo their great enmity againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> and others for preaching and defending it, and if they do truely believe than they ſhould diſown them printed Errours of <hi>G. Fox, &amp;c.</hi> or elſe they are likely to remain and poiſon more people hereafter, and much more dangerous than verbal Preaching, for that uſually reaches no other than the preſent hearers, but printed books are for poſterity alſo; eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what Monuments of high praiſes they have printed of <hi>G. Fox;</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the broachers of them; But the reaſon why they ſo ſtrive to excuſe and cover, and will not diſown <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s errours is not commonly underſtood; for he having arrogated to himſelf to be moved and guided by the infallible Spirit, and no leſs than equallity with God and Chriſt, and they having owned his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions or dictates, as from God immediately, and his Writings allowing to be Titled <hi>The Word of the Lord,</hi> and yet called <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> to term the Scripture ſo; nay, <hi>D. S.</hi> a chriſtian Quaker did but propoſe to have ſome Amendments or Corrections of his and others Errours they exceedingly reviled him in print, and give a caution to <hi>whom preſume</hi> (mind that) <hi>to amend what they apprehend offienſive, leaſt they be found touching the Lord</hi>'s <hi>Anointed, as to hurt his Prophets,</hi> Thus you may ſee the high value they put on <hi>G. F. &amp;c:</hi> and indeed I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion not but it will appear to the the impartial that <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s ſpirit is the Foundation or chief Corner-ſtone of their Buildining, and if that prove fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible and erroneous, (as is proved) than their building of Church-power muſt fall; therefore it is as I fear that ſo many wiſe Men having been decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by this falſe Spirit, they cannot deny themſelves and take up their croſs to acknowledge it, but whether their Reputation or the Authority of the New Teſtament be of moſt advantage or concernment to the Proteſtant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, let the true Chriſtians judge. And let but theſe Quakers conſider their Dealings to and with <hi>G. K.</hi> and the Reaſon they give therefore, <hi>i. e.</hi> they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join in him to clear them of thoſe Errours charged on the Brethren-preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> but theſe Errours of theirs in print are of greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40706:3"/>
therefore by the ſame rule they ought (to clear the proteſtant Religion) to condemn and diſown theſe printed contempts of our Lord Jeſus, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Magiſtrates, and all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> almoſt ever ſince the Apoſtles to the end of time, more eſpecially conſidering how the endeavour by high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations in print to exalt this <hi>G. Fox,</hi> as the only or chief Luminary of this Age, whereby they are ſo far from diſowning his Errours that they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by do more effectually ſpread them, than if twenty of the ableſt of them went all over <hi>England</hi> preaching the ſame, and ſo far as this contemptious and ſelf-exalted ſpirit prevails, ſo much muſt the true Faith decline, and is undiſcernable <hi>under</hi> mined by their ſo extolling <hi>G. F.</hi> as they have done in print, in a Journal and Preface thereto in Folio, the folly and wickedneſs thereof will in time appear, and I have warrant from themſelves for my diſcovering them, for they ſay in print <hi>The only way to recover the Deceived is to diſcover the Deceivers,</hi> and for their ſhuffling in among their Errours ſome ſound Expreſſions its for their Advantage, if you conſider they muſt be very ſilly Cheats that intend to deceive with falſe Coin if they ſhould not put ſome <hi>Good</hi> among the <hi>Bad,</hi> but although the <hi>Good</hi> be good yet that doth not make the <hi>Bad</hi> good.</p>
            <p>And pray take notice that the matter now in controverſy is not ſo much what theſe Modern Quakers ſay they now believe but about thoſe printed Errours, for if theſe believe otherways than they muſt condemn and diſown them, but they contrarywiſe excuſe and cover them, and thereby make themſelves guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and chargeable with them, but I having printed a Diſcovery of ſome of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s errours, and for brevity ſake I took his Sentences ſhort, but not willingly to wrong his Senſe, but they to excuſe him pretend I have abuſed him, by my ſhort citation, but I ſhall have an Opportunity to cite them at large, wherein I doubt not but it will appear that they falſly accuſe me; but ſeeing they ſo revile me for ſhort Quotations, by the ſame rule if they be guilty of the ſame Fault they deſerve the ſame puniſhment and more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in as much as I acknowledge my ſelf a fallible ſinner, for which they have banterr'd me, as <hi>G. Fox,</hi> have done other Chriſtians; therefore the chief end of theſe following Citations is to ſhew how groſsly wicked <hi>G. Fox</hi> was in ſhort and falſe quoting and perverting Men's words and meaning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>G. Fox</hi> his falſe Quotations and pervertions of <hi>J. Timſon's</hi> words in his Book, <hi>The great Myſtery,</hi> &amp;c. In page 17. <hi>G. F.</hi> brings <hi>J. T.</hi> ſaying, It is an Expreſſion of a dark deluded mind to ſay God is not diſtinct from his Saints, but <hi>J. T.</hi>'s words be theſe, would they counfound God and Man into one, denying God to be diſtinct from his Saints, would they renounce all former Teachings and Practiſes received from the Lord by the means of his Word and Ordinances, and wholly follow the Imaginations of a deluded heart; conſider are not ſuch things as theſe <hi>expreſſes of a dark deluded mind, &amp;c.</hi> Now obſerve <hi>J. T.</hi> ſentence is above 50 words, and <hi>G. F.</hi> takes but 10 of them, and tranſpoſes them to, and, its confounding the being of God into one with Man that <hi>J. T.</hi> oppoſes, as in <hi>8th</hi> pag. he ſays, Is every gift and work of God in Man, God that made all things, its this confuſion <hi>J. T.</hi> oppoſes, and not God being by his divine power in the Soul.</p>
            <p>Again page 16. <hi>G. F.</hi> brings <hi>J. T.</hi> ſaying, we <hi>(Quakers)</hi> have broken the everlaſting Covenant of God, becauſe <hi>(ſays G. F.)</hi> we own the Teachings of God by his ſpirit and light, <hi/> but <hi>J. T</hi>'s Reaſons why he ſays they

have broken the everlaſting Covenant be theſe, while you (ſays he) deny the Ordinances—you are none of God's Saints but Apoſtates—and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the everlaſting Covenant, whereby its evident <hi>J. T.</hi> doth not ſay you have broken the everlaſting Covenant becauſe you own God's teaching by his ſpirit and light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>G. F.</hi> falſly ſays, but becauſe you deny thoſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, for <hi>J. T.</hi> doth in pag. 11. own the ſpirit is the Rule, and in page 47. <hi>J. T.</hi> ſays, <hi>I have owned that to the means muſt be added a divine hand in working effectually upon the Souls of Men,</hi> and <hi>G. F.</hi> doth not only falſly quote the Man's Words, but falſly Accuſe him too. Again, <hi>G. F.</hi> brings in <hi>J. T.</hi> ſaying, its a contradiction and confuſed ſenſleſs thing to preach the Word of Faith in the Mouth and in the Heart; but <hi>J. T</hi>'s words be theſe, <hi>In your Anſwer you ſay none know the Scriptures by the outward Declaration but by the Word of Faith in the mouth and in the heart which we preach,</hi> and then ſaith he, <hi>I told you that was a ſenſleſs thing—confuſed and contradiction,</hi> and then <hi>J. T.</hi> ſays, <hi>I quered you whether any of you know what is written in Scripture without the outward Declaration,</hi> ſo that <hi>J. T.</hi> term'd it ſenſleſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to affirm none knew the Scriptures or what was wrote in them but by the word of Faith in the Mouth and Heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he did not ſay it was ſenſleſs <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to preach the word of Faith within, as <hi>G. F.</hi> falſly ſays. Again in page 17. ſays <hi>G. F. I. T.</hi> ſays, Its Blaſphemy to ſay that Chriſt is in them as God and Man, but <hi>J. T.</hi> words be theſe, <hi>Its Blaſphemy to ſay Chriſt in them by his Perſon as God and Man, and to deny the glorified Body of Chriſt which God had raiſed from the dead, as the Quakers do,</hi> ſays J. T. but <hi>G. F.</hi> leaves out the material Words of <hi>J. T</hi>'s (by his perſon) and cut off from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence theſe following words of <hi>J. T</hi>'s <hi>and deny his glorified Perſon which God has raiſed from the dead,</hi> as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do: Alſo in the ſame <hi>23d.</hi> page, <hi>J. T.</hi> ſays they make Chriſt's ſufferings in them make ſatisfaction for their ſins, and call him a Chriſt without, a Type, a Figure, alſo in page 4. of his Preface <hi>J. T.</hi> charges them with ſaying <hi>They are as perfect as Chriſt that died at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and that they which truſt in him for Salvation ſhall be deceived,</hi> but <hi>G. F.</hi> takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all this, but wrongs the Man's words and ſenſe, by leaving out the middle words and cutting off the latter part of his ſentence, and by oppoſing <hi>J. T.</hi> he <hi>G. F.</hi> ſeems to own no other perſonal Chriſt but what is in them, and thereby denies our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> to be Chriſt, for he as God and Man in one perſon cannot be in them, and it is ſuch a Man Chriſt, ſuch Blood and ſuch Sufferings of Chriſt as is in them that <hi>G. F.</hi> means when he mention'd Chriſt or his Blood and Sufferings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as further appears by his Anſwer to thoſe afore-cited words of <hi>J. T.</hi> ſays <hi>G. F. How are they of his Fleſh and Bone, and doth not the Scripture ſay that Chriſt in you, God will dwell in you, and walk in you, and are they not partakers of divine Nature,</hi> therefore it ſeems by <hi>G. F</hi>'s Doctrine that Chriſt had no other Perſon, Fleſh, bone, nor Blood, that was Chriſt's but what was in them, and that him whom ſhewed himſelf to his Diſciples, and bid them feel and handle him ſaying, a Spirit hath not Fleſh and Bone as I have is not <hi>G. F</hi>'s Chriſt, but a Perſon God and Man in him, and our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> but a Veſſel or Garment in which Chriſt appeared in, but I can think theſe Doctrines of <hi>G. F.</hi> no leſs than denying the Lord that bought them, and trampling under foot the blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:40706:4"/>
Again page 17. <hi>G. F.</hi> ſays that <hi>J. T.</hi> ſaith, its abhorred Dotage they are bewitched with to ſay they witneſs Forgiveneſs within, but <hi>J. T</hi>'s words be thus, <hi>Doth Christ</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>undergo the stripes of a juſt God, and ſhed his Blood for our Redemption and Forgiveneſs within you, what abhorred Dotage are you bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with.</hi> Here <hi>J. T</hi>'s ſentence is twenty ſix words, and <hi>G. F.</hi> culls out ſix of them and tranſpoſes them to make a ſentence contrary to <hi>J. T</hi>'s meaning, for its the Sufferings of Chriſt being acted <hi>within them</hi> for our Redemption that he oppoſes, but <hi>G. F.</hi> contrarywiſe repreſents him as denying having the Witneſs of Forgiveneſs within, as <hi>G. F</hi>'s anſwer alſo ſhews, for ſaith he to <hi>J. T. thou never knew a Saints life and that which cleanſeth, and the Teſtimony within of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of Sin, for where its forgiven its forgiven within,</hi> in this <hi>G. F.</hi> perverts the Man's words and falſly accuſes him.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>G. F.</hi> brings <hi>J. T.</hi> ſaying, None ever had ſuch Attainments of Chriſt a Redeemer without the help of Scripture. Now <hi>J. T</hi>'s words be theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges 65, 66. ſaith he, <hi>Themſelves are no strangers to thoſe Scriptures that give ſuch Diſcoveries of the Perſon, Natures and Offices of a redeeming Chriſt that never any have attained unto and diſcovered, either by Words or Writings, which never had nor heard of the help of the Goſpel as contained in the Scripture;</hi> here <hi>J. T</hi>'s ſentence is 48 Words, and <hi>G. F.</hi> takes but 8 of them dodging from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perverting them. Again page 18. <hi>G. F.</hi> brings <hi>J. T.</hi> ſaying, Where did ever any ſay they went through the Law to Chriſt, they be ſtrangers to the Life of God that ſay ſo, but <hi>J. T.</hi> ſays thus, <q>Muſt a ſinner go through the Law in perfect Obedience, until nothing remains to oblige him further, and is this the way to Chriſt in whom is Juſtification only witneſſed—whether I or you be aleniated from the Life of God as you cenſure me let the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber judge.</q> Here <hi>J. T</hi>'s ſentence is above 40 words and <hi>G. F.</hi> takes but 10 of them and tranſpoſes them alſo, and its the attaining ſalvation through or by our Obedience, or fulfilling the Law in our ſelves that <hi>J. T.</hi> is againſt, and <hi>G. F.</hi> oppoſes him perverting his Words.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>G. F.</hi> brings <hi>J. T.</hi> ſaying, Chriſt Jeſus was not in all Ages and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the World; but <hi>G. F.</hi> diſhoneſtly cuts off from his ſentence theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Words, <hi>In his Perſon, Miniſtry and powerful Workings viſibly,</hi> herein <hi>G. F.</hi> is guilty of mangling and cutting in two the Man's ſentence as well as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting his ſence. Again page 19. <hi>G. F.</hi> brings <hi>J. T.</hi> ſaying, he knows not what, the true Light, eternal Word, the everlaſting Goſpel, the Light which gave forth the Scriptures, the Judge of the World, the Kingdom of Heaven within, the Law of the New Covenant and Chriſt within, theſe ſays <hi>G. F.</hi> he knows not, but in p. 84. <hi>J. T.</hi> having reckoned up all theſe afore-named Titles that they give to the Light within them, then <hi>J. T.</hi> adds theſe words, <hi>And I know not what,</hi> that is, he knew not what more Titles they dignifie the Light within with, and not as <hi>G. F.</hi> falſly ſays he does not know what thoſe aforementioned things were.</p>
            <p>Again p. 246. <hi>G. F.</hi> brings <hi>C. Wade</hi> ſaying, O horrible! to ſay the infallible Spirit muſt open the Scripture, but <hi>C. W.</hi> ſpeaking of the Pope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> taking on them to open ſcriptures, and ſays <hi>C. W.</hi> 
               <q>The Quakers differ not much, for they ſay it muſt be ſome Spirit of or in them which they ſuppoſe to be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40706:4"/>
infallible, O horrible inſolency! doth <hi>T. M.</hi> hereby (ſays <hi>C. W.)</hi> deny the Spirit of God to give the ſenſe of the Scriptures, doth he not deny, the falſle ſpirit in them to give the ſenſe of Scriptures,</q> here <hi>C. W</hi>'s ſentence is 78 words and <hi>G. F.</hi> takes but ſix of them, tranſpoſing them and perverting the ſenſe. Again p. 246. ſays <hi>G. F.</hi> its <hi>C. W</hi>'s principle, fleſh and bone cannot be a meaſure in one and a meaſure in another. But <hi>C. W.</hi> in his <hi>7th.</hi> ſays thus, <q>Chriſt ſpiritualized and glorified Perſon, of real Fleſh and Bone, cannot be part thereof in one Man, and the other part of his real fleſh and bone in other Men, as you falſly imply, although by his ſpiritual influences he is in all his Saints.</q> Now <hi>C. W.</hi>'s ſentence is 42 words, and <hi>G. F.</hi> takes but 8 of of them and tranſpoſes them, and by oppoſing <hi>C. W.</hi> do deny Chriſt to have or had any fleſh or bone as his, but what they have in them.</p>
            <p>Again <hi>G. F.</hi> ſays <hi>C. W.</hi> cries, <q>O <hi>Luceferian</hi> pride to ſave Souls.</q> But <hi>C. W</hi>'s words be to one <hi>J. Milner</hi> to whom he ſays, <q>Thou by thy <hi>Luceferian</hi> pride to ſave Souls as Chriſt did thou muſt come under the Laſh.</q> Now here's <hi>C. W</hi>'s own Anſwer to <hi>G. F.</hi> in print, ſays he, <q>I do no where ſay ſo as thou ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly affirms, but do in my 8th. page accuſe <hi>J. Milner</hi> Quaker with <hi>Luceferian</hi> pride, becauſe he pretended to be Chriſt, and audaciouſly took on him to ſave Souls, as Chriſt did, and his Blood was ſhed, and that he gave up the Ghoſt, as Chriſt did, and ſays <hi>C. W.</hi> I no where accuſe any Quakers of ſaving Souls, but as they pretend to be Chriſt, and apply to themſelves his Titles to ſave Souls;</q> and ſays <hi>C. W.</hi> to <hi>G. F. This muſt ſtand up as a Lie againſt you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again p. 246. <hi>G. F.</hi> brings <hi>C. W.</hi> ſaying, God the Father never took on him Human Nature; but <hi>C. W</hi>'s Words be thus, <q>God the Father who is and ever was totally ſpiritual never took on him any perſon of Human Nature, as God the Son hath done.</q> Now <hi>C. W</hi>'s ſentence is 26 Words, and <hi>G. F.</hi> takes but 10 of them, and by oppoſing of <hi>C. W.</hi> do imply no difference between the Perſon of Jeſus Chriſt and God the Father, and ſo Chriſt no more or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe a Man, but as God the Father was, and ſo conſequently if our Lord Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was not God the Father he was not Chriſt. Again p. 246. <hi>G. F.</hi> ſays to <hi>C. W.</hi> the Scriptures are not the Word of God, as thou blaſphemouſly affirmed, but in <hi>C. W</hi>'s ſenſe the Scriptures may be termed the Word of God, for ſays he, they are the Word or Words of Chriſt who is God, but ſaith <hi>C. W.</hi> p. 13, 14. we do not expect to be taught by the Letter of the Scripture written with Ink and Paper, but by the ſpirit of Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and this might have ſatisfied a Chriſtian that <hi>C. W.</hi> did not intend the Scriptures the Word of God, as Chriſt is, but one would think by <hi>G. F</hi>'s nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs herein that he were a conſciencious humble Man, but his Fruits proves him otherwiſe, for in three ſeveral places in this Book ſays he, <hi>This is the Word of the Lord,</hi> pages 123. 211. 225. and on a ſilly, idle, pamphlet-ſheet of his own he clapt on the Title-page <hi>This is the Word of the Lord God unto you all, Luceferian-like</hi> exalting  himſelf. Again page 247. <hi>G. F.</hi> brings <hi>C. W.</hi> ſaying, <q>God limiteth the ſupreme holy One, by his inſpired Writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;</q> but <hi>C. W</hi>'s Words and Senſe are quite contrary to <hi>G. F.</hi> for in page 13. ſays he, <q>As the <hi>Devil</hi> of old he over-powers you Quakers—to deny the Scriptures to be any help—and as he thereby limits the ſupreme holy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40706:5"/>
One, ſo he over-rules you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>—In this <hi>G. F.</hi> is guilty of no leſs Errour then applying <hi>GOD</hi>'s Name to the <hi>Devil,</hi> and it may be he has been ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in his pretences to the Infallible Spirit. Again p. 247. <hi>G. F.</hi> brings <hi>C. W.</hi> ſaying, the Scripture contains the immediate inſpired Teaching, Written Word of God, that was and is God. <hi>C. W</hi>'s words being in page 16. <q>The very Letter of the New Teſtament or Goſpel contains in it the immediate inſpired teaching and written Word of Chriſt, who was and is God.</q> Now of his 26 Words <hi>G. F.</hi> takes but 12, and change his words <hi>New Teſtament</hi> for <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> ſo repreſenting <hi>C. W.</hi> as terming the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> God, whereas <hi>C. W.</hi> ſays, <hi>Christ who was and is God,</hi> but of ſuch Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods this Book of <hi>G. F</hi>'s is full of. Again 247. G. F. brings <hi>C. W.</hi> ſaying, Its a Lye to ſay the Saints ſhall judge the World, but in page 21. <hi>C. W.</hi> ſays, <q>Thy ſaying not that thou ſhalt be, but that thou art the Judge of the world is a Lye, for no Saint can be a Judge of the World,—during this their Life of Mortality:</q> Hereby <hi>G. F.</hi> does not only falſly accuſe <hi>C. W.</hi> but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys that they (Quakers) are the Judges of the World.</p>
            <p>Again p. 248. G. F. ſays, that C. W. denies the Son to be revealed in Man only by Adoption; but <hi>C. W.</hi> ſays in p. 24, <q>The Saints are not God's Sons, any otherway but by Adoption, only by Chriſt, not as being Chriſt, as you fooliſhly fancy; ſo that its evident <hi>C. W.</hi> did not deny the Revelation of Chriſt in Man, as <hi>G. F.</hi> falſly ſays, but their being Sons as Chriſt.</q> Again <hi>G. F.</hi> ſays that <hi>C. W.</hi> cries againſt Equality with the Father; but pray hear what Equality it is that <hi>C. W.</hi> does oppoſe; in page 24 ſays <hi>C. W.</hi> 
               <q>Creature adopted Sons cannot be equal with the heavenly uncreated Father—nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any creature adopted Sons be equal with God's only begotten Son, and by thy making no reſerve or diſtinction ſays <hi>C. W.</hi> in thy pretended Equality with God ſhews—that thou art a Lyer;</q> and G. F. by oppoſing C. W. doth claim Equality with the Father. Again page 248. G. F. brings <hi>C. W.</hi> ſaying, it is a falſe thing to ſay Chriſt's perſon is in Man, but <hi>C. W</hi>'s words be page 25. <hi>Chriſt's Perſon in them God and Man,</hi> but them words <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> G. F. leaves out. Again page 248. G. F. ſays C. W. calls it <hi>Satanical</hi> to ſay, as he is ſo are we in this World. In page 26. <hi>C. W.</hi> ſays, <q>They (Quakers) do declare themſelves to be totally without Sin as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is<hi>—Satanically</hi> perverting that Scripture—and affirm, That they are without Sin in them,as ſome of them have ſaid in my hearing of themſelves.</q> Again page 249 G. F. brings <hi>C. W.</hi> ſaying, no People on Earth go about to ſave Souls but the Quakers, <hi>C. W</hi>'s words in page 32, <q>Where is to be found any People—as the Quakers in a falſe way do declare themſelves to be Chriſt, and do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to themſelves Chriſt's Titles and take on them to ſave Souls.</q> Again G. F. brings <hi>C. W.</hi> ſaying, There is not whole Chriſt God and Man in Man; G. F. mangles this Sentence by cutting off the latter part of <hi>C. W</hi>'s words, <hi>By his Spirit, by faith.</hi> All theſe falſe and ſhort Quotations, pervertions and Untruths aforementioned of G. F's conſidered, it may be ſaid of him more truly than as <hi>W. P. Many have done</hi> wickedly, <hi>but thou dear</hi> George <hi>excelleth them all.</hi>
