         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>May it pleaſe your Excellency.</opener>

which make up <hi>your Excellency</hi>'s diſtinction,
it is not the leaſt, that the <hi>true Religion, and
Loyalty,</hi> are known to have been choſen with a

could not carry me to a fitter Patron for Truths, which

againſt Arguments ſupported by the <hi>French In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,

            <p>Yet, they who oppoſe the Right of the <hi>preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
having pretended to ſeeming Authorities;
<pb facs="tcp:54119:3"/>
I have uſed that method, which I hope may be proper
for their conviction: giving a ſhort view of what, upon
the various Exigencies of the Publick, in all Ages of
this Monarchy, has been the uniform Judgment, and
regular Practice, of <hi>Conventions of the States,</hi> and

            <head>REFLECTIONS
UPON A
Treaſonable Opinion, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Enemies of the Peace of theſe Realms ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
handed about a Paper, as the Opinion of
a certain <hi>florid Gentleman</hi> of the long Robe, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for making <hi>New Treaſons;</hi> and whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is ſaid to have prevailed with ſeveral to refuſe Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Aſſociatlon</hi> for the defence of His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s Sacred
Perſon, and <hi>Rightful Authority;</hi> I ſhall offer what I conceive
a ſufficient Antidote to the Poyſon he would ſpread, with
all his <hi>affected ſoftneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words of the Opinion, as they have occurr'd to me,
are theſe:</p>
            <p>By the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. the Subjects are Indemnified in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Oath,<note place="margin">The Opinion.</note> or Fighting for a King <hi>de Facto:</hi> But the <hi>Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is not within the Statute, but an <hi>Overt Act of Treaſon</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the King <hi>de Jure,</hi> and Puniſhable as ſuch when he ſhall be
reſtored.</p>
            <p>In refuteing the pernicious Errors contained in this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
I ſhall evince,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That according to the beſt Authorities of them,
who ſuppoſe that there may be a King <hi>de Jure,</hi> as diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
from a King in <hi>Fact;</hi> the Right of the ſuppoſed King
<hi>de Jure</hi> is not ſuch, as makes any Act againſt him to be
Treaſon; nor is he King, or has any Right againſt the King in
Poſſeſſion, or his Iſſue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54119:4"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That an <hi>Aſſociation</hi> for the Defence of the <hi>King's
Perſon</hi> and <hi>Right,</hi> is within the purview of the Stat. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7.
and that as plainly as an Oath of Allegianee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That it is not ſuppoſed or implyed in that Act,
that there was or might be a King <hi>de Jure,</hi> while an other
was King in <hi>Fact;</hi> but that according to that Act, the King
for the time being, is the onely <hi>Rightful King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. is not introductory of
any new Law in this matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That his Preſent Majeſty is the only King <hi>de Jure;</hi>
and that the late King neither is, nor of Right ought to be,
King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That according to this Gentleman's own Law, he
is Guilty of High-Treaſon againſt our Sovereign Lord the
King.</p>
            <p>1.<note place="margin">No Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any King but the Regnant, nor has any other Perſon Right againſt him or his Iſſue.</note> The Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> upon the Statute of Treaſon 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3.
referring in the Margin to the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. ſays,</p>
            <p>
               <q>This is to be underſtood of a <hi>King in Poſſeſſion</hi> of the
Crown, and Kingdom: For if there be a <hi>King Regnant</hi> in
Poſſeſſion, altho' he be <hi>Rex de Facto,</hi> and not <hi>de Jure,</hi> yet
he is <hi>Seignior le Roy</hi> within the purview of this Statute;
and the other,<note place="margin">3 Inſt. F. 7.</note> who hath the Right, and is <hi>out of Poſſeſſion,</hi>
is not within this Act.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Mathew Hale</hi> ſays what in ſubſtance agrees with the
Lord <hi>Coke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hales</hi>'s Pleas of the Crown, <hi>p.</hi> 11.</note> King, ſays he, ſpeaking of the Statute 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3.
<hi>de Facto,</hi> and not <hi>de Jure,</hi> is a King withing that Act; and
Treaſon againſt him is puniſhable, tho' the right Heir get
the Crown.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, both thoſe Great Men ſeem to ſuppoſe, or admit,
that there might be one who had, or at ſome time or other
might have, <hi>a ſort of Right,</hi> notwithſtanding another's being
ſo <hi>fully King,</hi> that a Conſpiracy to Kill, or Depoſe him, would
be Treaſon.</p>
            <p>But it is to be conſider'd,</p>
            <p>1. That the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> does not ſuppoſe that there may
be a King <hi>de Jure,</hi> while another is King in <hi>Fact;</hi> unleſs
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54119:4"/>
this ſuppoſition is warranted by the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. which,
as I ſhall prove, it is not.</p>
            <p>2. The Statute, which in both their Judgments regards only
the <hi>King Regnant,</hi> makes it Treaſon to Conſpire the Death
of the King's<note n="b" place="margin">
                  <hi>Nota,</hi> In the Act 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. reſtoring <hi>H.</hi> 6. of the younger Houſe, His Eldeſt Son <hi>Edward,</hi> who died in his life time, is called Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> Rot. Parl. 1 H. 7. N. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Eldeſt Son,</hi> or to violate his <hi>Eldeſt Daughter;</hi>
for the laſt of which, the Lord <hi>Coke</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">3 Inſt.</note> aſſigns this Reaſon,
That <hi>for default of Iſſue Male, ſhe only is Inheritable to the Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that the ſuppoſed King <hi>de Jure</hi> appears to be barred,
not only by the <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> of the King in <hi>Fact,</hi> but even by
that Right which is Veſted in his <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Daughter,</hi> before
either of them have <hi>Poſſeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, indeed, That Right which ordinarily would deſcend
to the Eldeſt Son of the <hi>King Regnant,</hi> is truly explanatory
of all that will be found to have belonged to one, who
ſince <hi>E.</hi> 4. of the elder branch of the Royal Stock, got
Poſſeſſion, has often been call'd King <hi>de Jure;</hi> tho', as will
appear, in a ſence very different from the Modern vulgar
Notion: Nor does the Judgment even of <hi>E.</hi> the 4th's own
Parliament, in the leaſt favour the <hi>late King:</hi> however if it
did, later Parliaments in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 7. have taken away
all colour from ſuch pretences.</p>
            <p>That the Eldeſt Son even of the moſt Rightful <hi>Regnant
King,</hi> was not King upon the Death of his Father, without
a Parliamentary Settlement of the Crown upon him before
his Fathers Death; nor with it, till the <hi>States</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
had actually received and recognized ſuch Son, will
appear beyond contradiction: And that the Eldeſt Son's
Right was only a Right to be <hi>declared King,</hi> unleſs he was
unfit to Reign, or the exigencies of the Publick required
the advancing ſome other Perſon of the <hi>Royal Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If a deſerving Perſon was kept back, or one ſo judged by
his own Party, or the Nation, when he prevailed, the leaſt
Complement they could make him was, that <hi>of Right,</hi> he
ought to <hi>have been King,</hi> before <hi>he was King;</hi> but farther
they never extended their Tranſports of Loyalty, nor ever
Authoritatively declared, That he had ſuch a Right as
made him <hi>King,</hi> while another <hi>poſſeſſed the Throne:</hi> And till he
got Poſſeſſion, it was never declared that he had Right.
Nor does the ſetting one aſide, before his coming to Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
or after, make any difference in the Nature of the
Right in queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54119:5"/>
And I ſhall put it beyond Controverſie, that whenever a
worthy Perſon of the Saxon <hi>Royal Family,</hi> eſpecially of that

            <p>3. Fully to ſhew this Gentleman his miſtakes, upon the
<note place="margin">Proof of the 2d and 3d General Heads, <hi>Stat.</hi> 11. <hi>H.</hi> 7. c. 1.</note>Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. it will be requiſite to tranſcribe the whole;
which is as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The King our Sovereign Lord, calling to remembrance
the Duty of Allegiance of his Subjects of this his Realm, and
that by reaſon of the ſame, they are bound to ſerve their
Prince and <hi>Sovereign Lord for the time being,</hi> in his Wars,
for the Defence of <hi>him, and the Land, againſt every Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
Power and Might, reared againſt him,</hi> and with him, to
enter and abide in Service in Battle, if caſe ſo require:
That for the ſame Service, what Fortune ever fall by
chance in the ſame Battle, <hi>againſt the Mind and Will of the
Prince,</hi> as in this Land, ſome time paſſed, hath been ſeen,
that it is not reaſonable, but againſt all Laws, Reaſon, and
good Conſcience, that the ſaid Subjects going with their
Sovereign Lord in Wars, attending upon him in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or being in other places by his Commandment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this Land, or without, any thing ſhould leeſe or forfeit
for doing <hi>their true Duty and Service of Allegiance.</hi> It be
therefore Ordained, Enacted and Eſtabliſhed, by the King
our Sovereign Lord, by the Advice and Aſſent of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this preſent
Parliament Aſſembled, and by the Authority of the ſame,
That from henceforth, no manner of Perſon or Perſons,
whatſoever he or they be, that attend <hi>upon the King and
Sovereign Lord of this Land for the time being,</hi> in his Perſon,
and do him <hi>true and faithful Service of Allegiance</hi> in the
ſame, or be in other places, by his Commandment, in the
Wars within this Land, or without; that for the ſaid deed
and true Duty of Allegiance, he or they be in no wiſe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54119:5"/>
Convict or Attaint of High-Treaſon, or of other Offences
for that Cauſe, by Act of Parliament, or otherwiſe by any
Proces of Law, whereby he or any of them ſhall <hi>now</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
Life, Lands, Tenements, Rents, Poſſeſſions, Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Goods, Chatals, or any other things; but to be for
that Deed and Service utterly diſcharged of any Vexation,
Trouble, or Loſs. And if any Act or Acts, or other Proces
of the Law hereafter thereupon for the ſame happen to be
made contrary to this Ordinance, that then that Act or Acts,
or other Proces of Law whatſoever they ſhall be, ſtand and
be utterly void. Provided always that no Perſon or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhall take any Benefit or Advantage by this Act, which
ſhall hereafter decline from his, or their <hi>ſaid Allegiance.</hi>
               </q>
Here 'tis obſervable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1ſt.</hi> That whereas <hi>this Gentleman</hi> abſurdly ſuppoſes, that
it is Treaſon to engage to fight againſt one whom one may
lawfully kill; and that one may enter into a contrary Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,
but may not do any <hi>voluntary act of Allegiance;</hi>
it is evident by the Words, that if Swearing Allegiance is
ſafe, ſo are all voluntary Acts of Allegiance: for the Swearing
is not expreſly provided for by that Act, or any otherwiſe
than as it is a part of the Duty and Service of Allegiance to
the <hi>Sovereign Lord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>:</hi> but if Aſſociating for the Defence of the
King's Perſon and Right, be part of the Allegiance due;
then that is as much provided for as the Oath is: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
this Gentleman muſt grant, that the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7.
indemnifies the preſent <hi>Aſſociators.</hi> That this is part of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
due, appears by the Common-Law Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
affirmed in the Laws of <hi>W.</hi> 1. and continued down
to this day in Subſtance and Obligation:<note place="margin">Vid. Leges W. 1. c. 52. de fide &amp; obſequio er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga Regem.</note> according to which,
all the Freemen of the whole Kingdom are to affirm
with <q>
                  <hi>a League</hi> [or Aſſociation] and <hi>Oath,</hi> that within and
without the whole Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> they will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to <hi>their Lord the King;</hi> preſerve his Lands and Honors
with all fidelity, together with his Perſon; and defend them
againſt Enemies and Strangers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in an other Chapter of that Law, after Proviſion,
that all Freemen ſhall enjoy their Eſtates,<note place="margin">Cap. 58.</note> as <hi>had been before
enacted and granted in a Common-Council of the whole Kingdom,</hi>
it adds,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54119:6"/>
We alſo enact and firmly enjoyn, that all Freemen of
<q>the whole Kingdom be <hi>ſworn Brethren</hi> [or Aſſociators] to
defend our Monarchy, and <hi>our Kingdom,</hi> according to their
Strength and Faculties, and manfully keep the Peace, and
preſerve the <hi>Dignity of our Crown entire:</hi> and conſtantly to
maintain Right, and juſt Judgment <hi>by all means,</hi> according
to their power, without fraud, and without delay.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What is this but an <hi>Aſſociation</hi> to defend <hi>the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
againſt any Perſon whatever; and by conſequence,
to declare that the King for the time being, is the only <hi>Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
King?</hi> Since his Perſon, Crown, and Dignity is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by all means in their Power.</p>
            <p>This part of the Common-Law is affirmed by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. declaring it <hi>the Duty of Allegiance to defend</hi> the
King, and Land, <hi>againſt every Power and Might:</hi> and therefore
as well againſt Pretenders to Title as others.</p>
            <p>2. This Act, expreſly indemnifies for voluntary Acts of
Allegiance, <hi>againſt the mind and will of the Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3.<note place="margin">Proof of the 3d. General Head.</note> It can by no means have been intended or implied by
that Statute, that there was, or could be, any other King
beſides the King <hi>for the time being:</hi> For,</p>
            <p>1. To take it in that ſenſe, would be to make the Statute
fight againſt it ſelf; and not only to admit that he were but
<hi>[a]</hi> King not [the] King; but to require the Subjects to
fight, for, and againſt one and the ſame Perſon.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. And his Parliament could not be thought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
that he was an <hi>Uſurper,</hi> or a King contrary to Law, or
<hi>Right.</hi> But <hi>H.</hi> 7. certainly intended to provide for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity
of thoſe that ſhould pay Allegiance to him, as well
as of thoſe that ſhould pay Allegiance to future Kings for
the time being. And indeed upon ſome of the Words it may
ſeem doubtful whether the enacting part was intended to
reach beyond his time; and whether any other Sovereign
Lord for the time being was intended, but he who was at
that time. But if in relation to the King, whoſe Parliament
paſſed this Act, the King <hi>for the time being</hi> was ſuppoſed
to be the only Lawful and <hi>Rightful King;</hi> it muſt be ſo taken
in relation to all other Kings <hi>for the time being:</hi> if either the
enacting Part or the Preamble extend to 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54119:6"/>
5. If this Act ſhould carry a plain implication, that ſome
other beſides <hi>the King for the time being,</hi> was <hi>the King of Right;</hi>
this would be ſo far from being for the Security of <hi>the King
for the time being,</hi> (as muſt have been then intended as well as
the indemnity of his Subjects,) that it muſt needs have the
like effect with their Diſcourſes, who will have it, that
the preſent Government is not <hi>Rightful,</hi> but yet that <hi>a ſort
of Allegiance</hi> is due to it, becauſe <hi>of God's Authority,</hi> tho'
<hi>contrary to Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whenever theſe Men ſpeak out, it appears, that they
allow no Authority to <hi>the King for the time being,</hi> but what
is derived from the Tacit, or implied Conſent, of their
<hi>King of Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this <hi>Jeſuitiſm</hi> was not thought of at the making of
that Statute.</p>
            <p>6. I deſire to know what Perſon beſides <hi>H.</hi> 7. was ſo
much as imagined to be <hi>Rightful King,</hi> or <hi>Queen,</hi> of <hi>England,</hi>
when that Act was made? However, whether it can be
thought, that in the Judgment of that Parliament, any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
beſides <hi>H.</hi> 7. had Right to the Crown; after a former
Parliament had <q>
                  <hi>Ordained,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vid. Printed Stat. 1 H. 7.</note>

ſtand, and remain, <hi>in King</hi> H. 7. <hi>and the Heirs of his Body,
and in no other Perſon?</hi>
               </q> That they held this Settlement to
have been duely <hi>and righfully</hi> made, and that without any
relation to his marrying the ſuppoſed Heireſs to the Crown,
appears by three other Acts of the ſame Parliament. One
of which attaints<note n="*" place="margin">Ret. Parl. 1 H. 7. n. 3.</note>

               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:54119:7"/>
7. When the Parliament 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. ſpeaks only of the
<hi>King,</hi> or <hi>Prince,</hi> or <hi>Sovereign Lord for the time being,</hi> without
giving any diſcription whereby it ſhould be known who is
[the Prince] unleſs what relates particularly to <hi>H.</hi> 7. It
muſt be preſumed that no King is intended, but he that was
the <hi>Sovereign,</hi> or <hi>Leige Lord,</hi> in the Eye and Reputation of
Law: which as appears by the Caſe of <hi>R.</hi> 3. an Uſurper,
continuing ſo, was not then taken to be. But who
ever was in the Poſſeſſion of the Throne without Uſurpation,
was always lawful and <hi>rightful King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. It cannot be thought the Parliament 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. would
have made an Act directly contrary to three others of the
ſame Reign; but they would have expreſly repealed the
former Acts, or have offered ſome reaſon to palliate or
colour their Proceedings to the contrary.</p>
            <p>But take the Statute of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. in this Lawyers Senſe,
(only with an Exception that as to the Matter in Queſtion
it was a Declaratory Law, as the words plainly ſhew, and
it will farther appear) and it is evident that the Statutes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>R.</hi> 3. and indemnifying them that acted for <hi>H.</hi> 7.
before the diſplaying his Banner, as well as after, while
<hi>R.</hi> 3. was in Poſſeſſion of the Throne, were contrary to this
Lawyer's Senſe of the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. according to which,
they who aſſiſted <hi>H.</hi> 7. muſt have acted contrary to their
Duty of Allegiance to <hi>the King for the time being.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it plainly follows, that <hi>R.</hi> 3. was not King for the time
being, according to the true meaning of the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7.
and yet <hi>H.</hi> 6. who was of the younger Houſe, was in his
time the only King <hi>for the time being,</hi> in the Judgment of
that very Parliament which ſuppoſes <hi>R.</hi> 3. not to have been
ſo;<note place="margin">Ret. Parl. 1 H. 7. n. 16. Reſtitutio H. 6.</note> as appears by their reverſing the Attainder of <hi>H.</hi> 6. and
declaring the Act of Attainder, to have been <hi>contrary to
the Allegiance</hi> of the Subject, <hi>againſt all right wiſeneſs,

were in a <hi>Parliament</hi> of a King by many ſuppoſed to be the

               <hi>Obj.</hi> But it may be objected, if the Act 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. was made
only to indemnifie them that paid Allegiance to <hi>Rightful
Kings,</hi> there was no manner of need of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Many needleſs Statutes have been made in
affirmance of the Common-Law, out of abundant cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>2. It could not be needleſs to obviate mens fears, upon
pretences which might be ſet up againſt the King <hi>for the time
being;</hi> by removing the ſuppoſal that Allegiance could be
due to any body elſe.</p>
            <p>3. The enacting part extends to indemnifie Men, for what
they out of Loyalty ſhould do in time of War, <hi>againſt the
mind and will of the Prince:</hi> for which the caution was but
reaſonable.</p>
            <p>Effectually to prove,<note place="margin">3<hi>d.</hi> Proof of the 4<hi>th.</hi> and 5<hi>th.</hi> General Heads.</note> that the Judgment of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7<hi>ths</hi>
Parliament, That there could be but one <hi>Rightful King</hi> at a
time, except where they were Partners in Power; is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the fix'd and known Conſtitution of this Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;
and that this manifeſts <hi>His preſent Majeſty</hi> to be our
only <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>rightful Sovereign Lord;</hi> and that the <hi>late
King</hi> neither, is, nor <hi>of Right,</hi> ought to be King; I ſhall as

Records, Hiſtories, Law-Books, Charters, and Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Manuſcripts, from before the fixation of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy

            <p>The moſt antient unconteſted Authority of this kind
which is allowed us even by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Writers, who think
themſelves concerned to blemiſh our Antiquities,<note place="margin">Bede Lib. 1. cap. 1. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bires veniret in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium magis de foemineâ, regum proſapiâ, quam de maſculinâ fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi eligerent.</note> is the

            <p>Whereby it appears what was his Judgment of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions,
where they have ſeemed moſt fond of an <hi>Inherent

while<note n="c" place="margin">Ib. c. 12.</note> the <hi>Weſt-Saxon</hi> Kingdom was govern'd
by ſeveral <hi>petty Kings,</hi> in diſtinct Diviſions. Theſe Kings
probably at that time were Tributary or Feudatory Kings,
under the <hi>Mercian</hi> Kingdom: for in the year<note n="d" place="margin">An. 730.</note> 730 I find
King <hi>Aetilbalt,</hi> ſtiles himſelf not only King of the <hi>Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>

in the ſame year I find an <hi>Offa,</hi> who ſtiles himſelf King of

about. By reaſon of the Inheritance of Crowns belonging
to ſeveral Sons of Kings, the Kings were ſo numerous that
<hi>Bede</hi> mentions two Brothers <hi>Crown'd</hi> Kings even of the

            </p>
            <p>But generally, I take it, regard was had to that part or

which ſome would ſet up for a will, diſpoſing of

               <hi>appoint no Heir of the Crown of England,</hi> but
to the Univerſal Creator, whoſe I am, and in whoſe hands

            <p>This <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> not being General throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

a <hi>Treacherous Miniſtry</hi> induced a weak Prince to lay
upon the Subjects: This made the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>Kent</hi> invite
over, from abroad, the <hi>Duke</hi> and his Party, who had fled

think, were enough to give any Man a face of Title: and
yet his pretended <hi>Divine Right,</hi> countenanc'd by Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,

theſe Objections were agreed upon againſt <hi>Richard</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Title.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>Oaths</hi> they had taken <hi>to the King their Sovereign

            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> made in <hi>divers Parliaments</hi> of the
King's Progenitors, <hi>of Authority ſufficient</hi> to defeat any
manner of Title to be made to any Perſon.</p>
            <p>3. Several <hi>Entails</hi> made to <hi>Heirs Male.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. That <hi>Richard</hi> did not bear <hi>Lionel</hi>'s Arms.</p>
            <p>5. That <hi>H.</hi> 4. took upon him the Crown, not as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror,</hi>
but <hi>right Inheritor</hi> to <hi>H</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>All that is urged materially againſt this for <hi>Richard,</hi> is,</p>
            <p>1. That Oaths do not bind againſt <hi>God's Law;</hi> and that
requires <hi>Truth and Juſtice</hi> to be maintain'd: but this being
a <hi>Spiritual matter,</hi> he refers to any <hi>Judge</hi> Spiritual.</p>
            <p>2. That there was but <hi>one Entail</hi> of the Crown, 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4.
but that this was void againſt <hi>the right Inheritor</hi> of the Crown
according to <hi>God's law,</hi> and all <hi>Natural laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It could be juſtify'd by Record, that <hi>H.</hi> 4ths ſaying
was not true.</p>
            <p>Upon which 'tis obſervable,</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Duke Richard</hi>'s anſwer goes upon a manifeſt
begging the Queſtion, and ſuppoſing, that he had a Right
which could not be barred by <hi>Act of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That the Lords having mentioned <hi>ſeveral Entails</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Heirs Male;</hi> we are to believe that there was then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Record, the Entail upon Heirs Male in the time of <hi>E.</hi> 3.

there was but one Entail upon <hi>Heirs male</hi> in <hi>H.</hi> 4ths reign:
nor is <hi>Richard</hi>'s denial any argument againſt this, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
that he thought it ſufficient for him to affirm any
thing; and this was to paſs for Truth and Law. Thus he
denies, that there had been any Entail but 7<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>H.</hi> 4. forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that which had been made 5<hi rend="sup">o</hi> and was amended 8 <hi>H.</hi> 4.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54119:23"/>
and ſo very much did he miſtake, that he ſuppoſed the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail

               <hi>Heirs of the Body,</hi> when it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>3. What the Lords ſay of <hi>Richard</hi>'s not bearing <hi>Lionel</hi>'s
Arms, confirms another objection againſt him made by
Judge <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> from the <hi>Barſtardy</hi> of <hi>Philippa,</hi> born while
<hi>Lionel</hi> was beyond the four Seas; and never own'd by him;
nor did ſhe, or her deſcendants, till the time of this claim,
bear the Arms of that Family.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Richard</hi>'s Right of Deſcent, admitting there had been
no Illegitimacy, is laid as a Right in <hi>Nature:</hi> but either
this muſt be as the Laws of the Land guide the courſe of
Nature, or, otherwiſe, we muſt go back in ſearch of this
Right, if not as far as <hi>Adam,</hi> yet to ſome deſcendant from

ſhould admit of Debate, ſuch of our Kings as deſcended

in that his Children were begotten on<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. Weſt. <hi>f.</hi> 1200.</note> an other Man's
Wife, who does not ſeem ever to have been divorced: and
beſides, according to the Law of Nature it would ſeem,
that <hi>John</hi> had a former Wife in being. For he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced
from her only for their being third Couſins, as
<hi>H.</hi> 2<hi>ds.</hi> Wife was from her firſt Husband, as they were
Couſins in the 4<hi>th</hi> Degree. If the firſt Marriages in both
caſes were void, or voidable, it could have been only by
the Laws of the Romiſh Church; but if thoſe Laws ſhall
make a natural right, by governing the courſe of deſcents,
much more ſhall the Laws of particular Countries. If,
by the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> Duke <hi>Richard</hi> meant that which

               <hi>Cujacius,</hi> this Law of Nature
is for the right of <hi>Proximity,</hi> which <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> from
whom <hi>H.</hi> 6. deſcended, had to his Father before <hi>R.</hi> 2. and
<hi>H.</hi> 4 <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi>'s Son, had before the Son of <hi>Lionel</hi>'s
Daughter, ſuppoſing her legitimate. And by that Law it
ſhould ſeem, that <hi>Males</hi> are ordinarily to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Females; tho' their Vertues have often rais'd 'em to
Empire.</p>
            <p>Farther yet, if by this he meant the Law of <hi>reaſonable
nature;</hi> what ſhadow of reaſon can be aſſigned, why<note n="b" place="margin">Vid. Grot. de jure belli &amp; pacis l. 2.</note>

They go no farther then <hi>E.</hi> 4. and his Party did, even after

And ſhould ſuch Men add, that neither has the <hi>late

has no right making him King; they therein would ſtill
keep to that Preſident. But then if they would exactly
follow that, they muſt believe that the late King cannot
be duely reſtored to the Regal Dignity, till he ſhould be
received by the <hi>election,</hi> or <hi>conſent,</hi> of the <hi>States,</hi> or <hi>Body of

            </p>
            <p>Thus far I am ſure they cannot come without a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
departure from their avowed Principles: and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54119:26"/>
to keep to them, they muſt give up the only co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable
Authority for their notion of King <hi>de jure,</hi> and

            </p>
            <p>And they muſt yield, that there is not the leaſt ſhadow

there was a <hi>King of right,</hi> at the very time that an other

to <hi>E.</hi> 4. having been attainted in a Parliament of <hi>E.</hi> 4. they
having <hi>ſingular confidence in</hi> Richard's <hi>particular merit, have

him their King and Sovereign Lord, to whom they know of

            </p>
            <p>And obſerving that tho' the Learned in the Laws and

quieting of mens minds, and removing the occaſion of doubts
and ſeditious language.</hi> Therefore <hi>by the Authority of that

            <p>Any Man who compares that Act at large with the

great Wiſdom, and regard to the Conſtitution of the

            <p>And tho' out of an uſual complement to the prevailing

her ſuppos'd Right gave him no diſturbance, and his Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion

(who was the great Inſtrument in ſetting him up) by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
his Claim to be <hi>High-Conſtable of</hi> England: which
was an Authority dangerous to be truſted in the hands
of ſo popular a Man: nor could the <hi>Duke</hi> and his Faction
expect to ſucceed in their conſpiracy, without the ſupport
of <hi>French Forces:</hi> and, accordingly, applied themſelves to
<hi>Henry Earl of Richmond,</hi> afterwards <hi>H.</hi> 7. with whom the

               <hi>Henry</hi> was glad of the opportunity: and, to ſtrengthen
his Intereſt, agrees with ſome of his Party to marry the
Daughter of <hi>E.</hi> 4. but was far from making any claim
in her right. It is very probable that one of <hi>E.</hi> 4<hi>ths</hi> Sons
was then alive: be that as it will, as appears by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. cited above, his Parliament held that he landed
with Title: and <hi>R.</hi> 3. being deſerted, and ſlain in the Field

and that Succeſs which gave him the preference
before others of the ſame Blood; eſpecially, ſince that
enemy, whom he ſubdued, was held to be an <hi>Uſurper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This 'tis evident, that he was accounted before <hi>H.</hi> 7.
Landed. But if it be truly conſidered, his Uſurpation, if
any, muſt have conſiſted in the Tyrannical Exercice of his
Power, which the Duke of <hi>Bucks</hi> had urged to juſtify his
Arms, and not from the aſſuming it; and that <hi>H.</hi> 7<hi>th</hi>'s So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
was founded in that <hi>election</hi> of the Body of the
People, without a <hi>formal Convention,</hi> which pitch'd upon
him as a fit Perſon to deliver them from their real or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd
Yoke. This will appear beyond contradiction, from
the proceedings of the Parliament upon his Claim, and
the moral impoſſibility of giving it any other colour.
However, the Parliament took to it ſelf full Authority in
the matter; and<note n="a" place="margin">Stat. 1 H. 7. Rot. Parl. II eſt ordeign eſtablie &amp; enact par auctorite du die Parliament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

According to this, tho' his Reign was held to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
before he had been declared King, it was, as I ſhall
have occaſion to obſerve in other caſes, only by way of
relation to that ſolemn Inveſtiture; without which he had
never been King. That his Right muſt have been derived
from a plain <hi>Election,</hi> is very evident; for,</p>

            <p>But whatever right was aſcribed to him after he got

            <p>Then with a new ſtrain of Loyalty, <hi>Judges, Lawyers,</hi> and
<hi>Juries,</hi> concurred in making attempts to prevent his
coming to the Crown, Treaſon: the like of which, withal
its Circumſtances had not been known in any Age of
this Monarchy. Tho' there had been Treaſon againſt <hi>W.</hi> 1.
before his actual admittance to the Crown, it was, as has
appeared above, after a National Settlement upon him
by name: and this was the caſe of the unfortunate <hi>Lady

However, that <hi>Parliament</hi> made no Law in the Matter,
and, by good luck, left the conſtitution as they found it:
for they made no Settlement of the Crown, only offered
that recognition as <hi>the firſt Fruits of their Faith to him, and
his Royal Progeny, and Poſterity for ever;</hi> which, if it had
been a Settlement, would amount to no more, than what
had been uſual in former times; for Parliaments to make
a branch of the Royal Family, a new head of future Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions:
but by this any one of the Iſſue, or Poſterity,
ſtood fair for an <hi>election.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, poſſibly, the Parliament had not been ſo forward
with theſe Fruits of their Loyalty, but for his Speech to
'em, wherein he ſays,</p>

Care and Affection to the Subjects of</hi> England, <hi>to alter, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novate,
the</hi> Fundamental, <hi>and ancient Laws, Priviledges, and

fall, upon the whole ſtate and frame <hi>of this Kingdom.</hi>
Where, in as modeſt terms as they could, they bid the
King, at his peril, to violate the Fundamental Laws, on
which his <hi>regal Authority</hi> depended, as well as their Rights
and Priviledges.</p>
            <p>But that King ſoon forgot upon what terms he had been

of his <hi>Divine Right,</hi> it paſs'd at that time as the Doctrine of

While this fit of Loyalty laſted, <hi>C.</hi> 1. ſucceeded as by

But whatever was the conſequence of that War, there has
been no reaſon for the Pulpits to ſound to loud, and long
as they have done, with, denunciations of God's wrath,
but, indeed, the Clergies, againſt this Kingdom, for what
hapned in a War, for which the Parliament and People,
who would not have carried the Point ſo far, as it unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
went, are not to anſwer. <hi>C.</hi> 1. dying a deplorable
death, the Nation was left without the exercice of any
Legal Government, till the Reſtoration of <hi>C.</hi> 2. who was
accounted King from the death of his Father.</p>
            <p>But by what Law, or in what reſpect is worth enquiry,
and will it appear.</p>
            <p>1. That the ſuppoſed Maxim that the King never dies,<note n="d" place="margin">Finehes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Common Law ed. An. 1613.</note> is
of very <hi>late</hi> and doubtful Authority, in compariſon with
thoſe which ſhew that no Man was, or ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
King, till he had been formally recognized.</p>
            <p>2. Yet tho' this ſhould be true, when any Prince ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
in vertue of a Settlement, made in the Anceſtor's
life time; it will not be ſo where there has been none, as
was the caſe of <hi>C.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>3. If one ſhould in the eye of Law be King immediately
upon the death of an other, it would not follow that this
would be by a ſtrict right of deſcent; but that after the
being admitted King, there ſhould be a relation backwards,
to prevent the loſs of any rights belonging to the Crown:
and thus it was plainly taken by the Chief Juſtices <hi>Dyer</hi>
               <note n="e" place="margin">Dyer f. 165. Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon f. 44.</note> and <hi>Anderſon,</hi> who ſay, that the King who is <hi>Heir, or
Succeſſor,</hi> may write and begin his Reign, the ſame day that
his <hi>Progenitor,</hi> or Predeceſſor, died.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:54119:32"/>
And agreeably to this, it was the reſolution of all the
Judges of the <hi>King's Bench</hi> in <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi>'s time, that
a ſaving to <hi>a King and his Heirs,</hi> ſhall go to a <hi>Succeſſor</hi> of the
Crown, tho' not Heir to that King.</p>
            <p>That <hi>J.</hi> 2. made too great haſte to ſucceed his Brother
<hi>C.</hi> 2. now at leaſt Men will be apt to believe: of whom I
ſhall obſerve only in ſhort,</p>
            <p>1. That he was within no <hi>Parliamentary Settlement</hi> of the
Crown then in force.</p>
            <p>2. The beſt pretence <hi>J.</hi> 2. had of coming to the Crown

               <hi>A</hi> Parliament <hi>called ſoon after,</hi>
               <note n="d" place="margin">Stat. 2. <hi>W. M.</hi> Seſ. 1. cap. 1.</note> 
               <hi>declares, and enacts,</hi>
that they do recognize and acknowledge, that Their Majeſties
are, and of Right ought to be, by the Laws of this Realm,
their Sovereign Liege Lord and Lady, King and Queen of
<hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. in, and to whoſe Princely Perſons, the Royal
State, Crown and Dignity of the ſaid Realms, with all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
Prerogatives, &amp;c. are fully, rightfully, and entirely, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted,
Incorporated, United, and Annexed.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding which, many who have ſworn to <hi>bear
Faith and true Allegiance</hi> to <hi>King William,</hi> will be wiſer than
the Law, not only declared by this Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> but
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54119:34"/>
by ſeveral in former Reigns; and with a groſs Jeſuitical
evaſion, without any colour of foundation in Law or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
pretend that they have ſworn to <hi>K. William</hi> only as <hi>King
in Fact;</hi> but that another was <hi>rightful King</hi> at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>This groundleſs and wicked diſtinction, appears to have
engaged ſome Men in an horrid and barbarous Plot againſt
his <hi>Majeſty's Perſon</hi> and Government, tho' they had ſworn
to be <hi>true and faithful to him:</hi> and it ſeems, by the caſe of
Sir <hi>John Perkins,</hi> that neither he, nor his <hi>Caſuiſts,</hi> thought
the Oath to <hi>King William</hi> any departure from the <hi>Allegiance</hi>
to <hi>King James:</hi> nor the deſign of <hi>Aſſaſſinating King William,</hi>
any breach of the Oath to him.</p>
            <p>Since therefore the deceit has taken riſe from the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
that the late King continues King of Right, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the general terms of the Oath, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to leave a latitude for this illegal and nonſenſical
ſuppoſition; and an Oath more explicit has been artfully
kept off; a <hi>voluntary</hi> Declaration <hi>that his preſent Majeſty,
King</hi> William, is <hi>Rightful and Lawful King of theſe Realms,</hi> as
it is fully warranted by the fundamental conſtitution of
this Government, is, at this time, become a neceſſary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
when it is evident to the World, what they who are of
a contrary Opinion, will act, as they have opportunity.
But to engage to ſtand by and aſſiſt each other in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of His Majeſty's Perſon and Government, is not
more a conſequence of the declaring him rightful and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
King; than it is implied in the Oath of Allegiance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by the Act of Parliament which ſettles the Crown;
and, however, the Common-Law Oath, and the legal
ſenſe of Allegiance, manifeſtly require it.</p>
            <p>If any who have taken the Oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Majeſty, ſcruple to <hi>aſſociate,</hi> becauſe of the declaring
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> to be <hi>rightful and lawful King;</hi> it is evident, that
they prevaricated when they ſwore. If they queſtioned
the legality of entring into this before there was a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Law for it; 'tis certain, they have been little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Common-Law Oath of Allegiance, and
the warrantable Preſidents of former times; according to
which, the<note n="a" place="margin">Stat. 7 &amp; 8 W. 3. For the better Security of his Majeſty's Royal Perſon and Government.</note> 
               <hi>late Act, late Act,</hi> which enjoyns ſome to Sign the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54119:34"/>
Aſſociation, not only gives it Sanction for the future; but,
with expreſs relation to its being voluntarily enter'd into,
by great numbers of His Majeſty's Subjects, declares that
<hi>it is good and lawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And any Man who impartially weighs what I have laid
together from Records, and other Authentick Memorials
of paſs'd times, muſt own, that it is, with full and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable
Authority, enacted, That <q>if any perſon or perſons
ſhall maliciouſly, by <hi>Writing, Printing, Preaching, Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or adviſed ſpeaking, utter, publiſh; or declare,
that His <hi>preſent Majeſty</hi> is not <hi>the lawful and rightful
King of theſe Realms;</hi> or that the <hi>late King James,</hi> or <hi>the
pretended Prince of</hi> Wales, hath <hi>any Right or Title to the</hi>
Crown of theſe Realms; or that any other perſon or
perſons hath, or <hi>have any right</hi> or title to the ſame,
otherwiſe than according to an Act of Parliament made
in the firſt year of the Reign of His <hi>preſent Majeſty,</hi> and
<hi>the late Queen,</hi> Intituled, <hi>An Act declaring the Rights and
Liberties of the Subject, and ſettling the Succeſſion of the

Convicted, ſhall incur the danger and penalty of <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To imagine that after all this, the late King either is,
or ought to be King, is to flight all Authorities, Ancient as
well as Modern.</p>
            <p>Which leads me to the Nature of our Lawyer's offence,<note place="margin">Proof of the 6th general head.</note>
who, before the Act for the Security of His Majeſty's Perſon
and Government, held the Signing the Aſſociation to be an
Overt-Act of Treaſon againſt the King <hi>de Jure:</hi> which, as
has appeared above, tends manifeſtly to depoſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
His <hi>preſent Majeſty,</hi> as in the Eye of the Law there is
but <hi>one King,</hi> and he is the only King <hi>de Jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, this <hi>Gentleman</hi> admits, That by the Statute
11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. Allegiance is due to a King <hi>in Fact,</hi> and that the
Oath of Allegiance was to be taken to him: nor can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that there ever, till of late, was any other Oath but
what expreſly obliged to the Defence of the <hi>King and
Kingdom</hi> againſt all Men: therefore in conſequence of his
own Notion he muſt grant, that to contend that there
may be Treaſon againſt any other but the King for the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:54119:35"/>
               <hi>time being,</hi> is to ſuppoſe two contrary Allegiances; and
therein to depart from that Allegiance which was due, even
by his own interpretation of the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. But it
being evident, that by that Statute, and the whole courſe
of the Common Law, there is but <hi>one King,</hi> I need not tell
him the Crime of publiſhing a written Opinion, manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
importing an endeavour to Depoſe him.</p>
            <p>If this had been delivered only in Words, it is well
known who uſed his Oratory to make words alone Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
within the Statute 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. for which I may refer
him to the Trial of the now Earl of <hi>Macclesfield,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the late King's Reign: and to the Author of
<hi>the Magiſtracy and Government Vindicated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as the Opinion was written; he may well know from what late
Authority, <hi>Soribere eſt agere,</hi> is become a Maxim, or Proverbial.</p>
            <p>Nor can he deny the Words to be within the reaſon of what the
Court held<note n="a" place="margin">Yelverton, f. 1 07. 5 J. 1.</note> in <hi>Blanch Flower</hi>'s Caſe, of a Man's affirming the King
to be a <hi>Baſtard;</hi> or that <hi>another had better Tittle to the Crown: becauſe
it may draw the Subjects from their Allegiance, and beget Mutiny in the
Realm:</hi> or <hi>Owen</hi>'s Caſe, of declaring it Lawful to kill the King being
<note n="b" place="margin">1 Rolls, f. 185.</note> Excommunicated by the Pope: both which, not to mention more of
the like kind, were adjudged <hi>High-Treaſon.</hi> According to the Print
of the later Caſe, it would ſeem that Words alone made the Treaſon';
but it appears, by a<note n="c" place="margin">Banks MS. p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
