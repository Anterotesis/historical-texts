            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Brethren of the <hi>Presbyterian Way,</hi>
which were preſented to your HOUSE
ſome foure or five yeares ſince; wherein
they doe in much ſtrength and piety, as it ſeems to
me, open the way and ſecrets of <hi>Spirituall Tyranny,</hi>
and <hi>Conſcience-yoaks;</hi> there is ſome occaſion now of
reminding the Brethren of theſe, becauſe the ſtraine
of their preaching and printing ſeems to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
theſe <hi>principles:</hi> Spirituall Yoaks and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
<pb facs="tcp:113476:3"/>
being taken off from us (through the hand of
God upon ye) the <hi>memory</hi> of them ſeems to be gone
off too from ſome; ſome have forgotten that they
<hi>were ſtrangers in the Land of Egypt;</hi> the Lord hath
ſeemed <hi>to forgive the formerly Nonconforming Brethren
all their debt, becauſe they deſired him:</hi> And now the
Queſtion is, <hi>Whether they ſhould have compaſsion on
their fellow ſervants as he had pity on them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Controverſy now before ye, is of all your
Faithfull ones, and therefore it cals for the tenderſt
judgement: fathers may better beat ſervants then
children out of doores; the one ſort (if I miſtake
not) contend that they may rule with ye, the other,
that they may be ruled by ye in the things of your
own Kingdom; and in that of the Kingdom of God,
that Ieſus Chriſt may rule both ye and them: how
juſt, how ſpirituall, this latter plea is, will appeare
from the choyceſt Reaſonings of ſome in reputation
with ye, which I have awakened.</p>
            <p>The things I preſent ye, I would not preſume to
make too poſitive, becauſe I would not conclude a
wiſdome of your latitude under any notion of mine,
(though I ſee private men take too much liberty in
that way towards ye) though it is your indulgence
not to know it.</p>
            <p>I here preſent ye things only to be <hi>conſidered,</hi> to
be <hi>quared,</hi> in the behalfe of <hi>truth</hi> and the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of your State, to which I am covenanted; and
I am the bolder and freer, having ſold <hi>ſomething
that I had for that pearle,</hi> for which we are bidden
<hi>to ſell all:</hi> I ſhall adde ſome Conſiderations here
to the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:113476:3"/>
1 Conſider whether under Popery the myſtery of

all the <hi>Pretences</hi> and <hi>Conſequences</hi> to draw in
States and Kingdomes for the <hi>Churches intereſt</hi> (if

myſtery, then of zeale to Religion or the
power of Magiſtracy?</p>
            <p>2 Conſider whether in the Kingdom of Jeſus
Chriſt any other Scepter ſhould be lifted up then
that golden one of his owne, and whether if there
be a Kingdome of God, if Ieſus Chriſt be the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi>

of whoſe Kingdome is an everlaſting ſcepter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3 Conſider whether there be not an Heatheniſh
or Gentiliſh world, and an Antichriſtian world or a
world of many called <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and Believers in
Chriſt, and yet a Church of Chriſt which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theſe; and if ſo, whether is all this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

rather much of it that part of the Antichriſtian

who ſee not by your <hi>Light,</hi> and write not by your <hi>Candles</hi>
your binding up the <hi>Tares</hi> with the <hi>Wheat</hi> together, and the
<hi>pretious</hi> with the <hi>vile;</hi> your trampling upon your Brethren as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113476:20"/>
the mire in the ſtreets, have forced my <hi>Spirit</hi> into theſe few
Queries: <hi>for Sions ſake I cannot hold my peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Deſignes of your Book ſeem to be theſe;</p>
            <p>1 A Deſigne of <hi>Provocation</hi> to the Magiſtrate againſt your
Brethren.</p>
            <p>2 Of <hi>Accuſation,</hi> under the old Project of Hereticks and
Schiſmaticks.</p>
            <p>3 Of <hi>Hiſtoricall Recreation</hi> to the people, that they may
make themſelves ſport with the <hi>Beleevers</hi> that differ from ye,
as the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> with <hi>Sampſon</hi> upon the Stage.</p>
            <p>Can your wounded Brethren make yee good muſick? Can
their faylings make ye more innocent? Or their ſinnes make
ye more ſpirituall?</p>
            <p>You would have <hi>all the Beleevers that are not of your minde,
baniſhed</hi> &amp;c. will you who pretend your ſelfe to be a friend, be
ſuch an enemy to the State, as to cut off (like <hi>Nero</hi> the Tyrants
wiſh) ſo many thouſand of their faithfull ſervants at a blow,
in ſuch a <hi>juncture</hi> of time when they need ſo many? Ought ye
to work off ſo many <hi>choyce ones</hi> from this Cauſe, till you have
as many more of your way for their places, and till as many
Battels, yeares, experiments, prove them as gloriouſly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
as theſe are; is this faire dealing with the State?</p>
            <p>You have brought forth before Iſrael and the Sunne, many
pretended ſinnes and crimes of your Brethren: Suppoſe they
ſhould write by your copy, and bring forth the Aſſembly ſins,
the crimes of all thoſe of your way, of all the Divines and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that you take in, and rake back into the aſhes of their
unregenerate condition, keep Almanacks for the yeares and
dayes of their faylings, watch their haltings in all things they
ſay or do, tell all the Stories of them they heare, what would
the next generation think of their Book and yours? At this
rate of writing they would not read one honeſt man of all their
forefathers, yet this is your courſe and method.</p>
            <p>I have done for this time, and I hope all that are not enchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the <hi>Gorgons head</hi> of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> and
<hi>Church of England,</hi> (as your own Smectymnians ſay) will
read and judge. I had ſaid more to ye, had you printed us more
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113476:21"/>
               <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and leſſe <hi>Reviling,</hi> and ſomething more then <hi>Stories</hi>
and <hi>Winter Tales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for our <hi>Licenſer,</hi> whom you ſo rayl at, he is ſo much a
friend to all the world of Beleevers, as to give them the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
liberty of proving and <hi>trying all things;</hi> and not to ſilence
the <hi>Preſſe,</hi> as ſome would, and as the Prelates did ſilence the
<hi>Pulpit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now let any age, weighing all the differences (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Blaſphemies, &amp;c.) and the nature of them, nakedly
without <hi>aggravations,</hi> and <hi>fallacy</hi> of words, bring forth a Book
printed in ſuch <hi>Letters of Blood,</hi> as this <hi>Gangrena?</hi> binde up all
the <hi>Oxford Aulicuſſes,</hi> the <hi>Mountagues,</hi> the <hi>Pocklingtons,</hi> and
ſee if this <hi>Gangrena</hi> do not exceed them all; this is <hi>Perſecution</hi>
and <hi>Prelacy</hi> ſublimate.</p>
            <p>And yet for all this, I would not have the <hi>Civill power</hi> drawn
againſt you, (if we had all the Magiſtrates on our ſide) but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that you may in the flowings of a more <hi>hevenly ſpirit,</hi> with
your head of waters, and your eyes a fountain of teares, write
againſt your own Book, and let the world ſee that <hi>Men</hi> in
theſe times are not <hi>Infallible,</hi> as you all conclude, but may
miſtake their Brethren for Enemies, ſome Truths for Errours,
and Zeal for Perſecution, as the very Iewes did when they
crucified Chriſt, as they thought, for Blaſphemy; <hi>And ſome
ſhall kill ye,</hi> ſayth Chriſt, <hi>and think they do God good ſervice.</hi>

in a curſory way diverted off his Road of Medicine of which

his Friends. 2. In things doubtfull conſcience hath refuge to
the ſureſt ſide: Now its granted by all, and not controverted
by any, that in the Apoſtolique Church, the government of
the Church of the New Teſtament was in the hands of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
Paſtors, Teachers; and therefore Conſcience would ſway
to that in which there can be no Error, except on ſuppoſall of
abuſe; and Chriſtian Rulers would not do well to venture
upon Eternity, wrath, the judgement to come; confiding on
the poor plea of an <hi>Eraſtian</hi> diſtinction, to incroach upon the
Prerogative royall of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
