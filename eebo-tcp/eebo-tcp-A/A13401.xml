            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

nature abhorreth from such kynde of copulation.

               <p>Wherfore not long after, wyth a greuouse vengeaunce, God plaged him.

and so great thynges, he maye easyly be to proude and hawtye, and sone growe out of kynde and degendre vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to tyrannye, euen as nowe of late it was seen of Cambyses.</p>
               <p>After hym stode vp Megabysus, whyche disalowynge thys counsayle of Otanes, affyrmed, that suche ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie was moche more hurtfull and pestiferous to the comon weale, then tyrannye shuld be. For noble men and cities yf they lacke a lorde and hedde they can not but abuse thys libertye vnto priuate offection and lust. But to thentent no suche thynge shulde ensue, his counsayle and aduise was, not to chose some one Kynge, but to appointe certayne noble men, wyth whom mighte alwayes remayne the tytle, prerogatyue, and ryght of the Imperiall power.</p>
               <p>The sentences of these bothe, the

thyrd lord named Darius disalowed &amp; cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sayled to chouse one kynge. For albeit in thys kynde of gouernaunce lyke as in al other humane thynges, many and greate inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities maye chaunce, yet no rule, no gouernaunce is so stable, so sure, as is a monarchie that is to saye, where one ruleth in whose handes is put the charge of the hole kyngdom.

Besydes all thys, there shulde not want also amonges these selfe princes an inordinat studie and desyre of dignitie &amp; dominion aboue the reste, ouer whom some one wold labour to haue power as ouer hys subiectes or iferiours. And these were in effecte the causes, whyche Darius brought forthe for the proue of hys purpose, vnto whych the other foure prynces subscribed, and so at laste it was determyned after the olde vsage to chouse a kynge. But least any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might aryse betwen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, they thought it best, to committe
<pb facs="tcp:11699:24"/>
the lotte of the election vnto God. It was a greed vpon, that vpon a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge very erly the prynces on hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe shulde mete togyther at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place, &amp; that he whose horse first neyghed, shuld be forthwith proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med king. The princes retourned eue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry one to hys home. Darius shewed the counsayle and determination of the princes vnto the Stuard of hys howse, who forthwith toke the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon hym, to brynge hys lordes purpose to good passe. Wherfore the euenynge before the daye appoynted, he bryngeth hys lordes horse and a mare vnto the place appoynted, and there commytted the horse and mare togyther, to thentent, that the nexte mornynge, the place knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the horse myghte for desyre of the mare, which then shulde be absent, neyghe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to hys propertie.</p>

They were not soner there, but loo forthwith Darius horse begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to neyghe, and that they shulde not doubt, but it was the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God to haue Darius to theyr kynge, incontinent in an open and clere wether without any maner tempest, it both lyghtened and thon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered whyle the horse neyghed. By and by the other princes leapynge of from theyr horses exhibited vnto Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rius kyngly honours, and saluted hym kynge. Thus by thys accasyon was Darius auaunced to the kyng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and empyre of the Perssans, whyche he afterwarde wyth hyghe prayse administred.</p>
               <p>Kyng Darius was wont in prayse
<pb facs="tcp:11699:25"/>
of hym selfe to saye, that by warres &amp; aduersities, he was made the wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser and more prudent. Certeynlye, though this be como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly true, for expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is mother of prudence, yet suche prudence &amp; wysedom cost the comon weale moch.

A counsailour ye shall haue of me (o ye men of Athens) whether ye woll or not, but a sklaunderour ye shall not make me, though ye wolde.
