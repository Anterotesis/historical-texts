         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>From a fair Palace to a floating Hell,</l>
               <l>That from ſev'n bloody ſtorms thy life was giv'n,</l>
               <l>To the two greateſt pow'rs under heav'n;</l>
               <l>One moſt ambitious of thy worth and Fame,</l>
               <l>In this Extream ſtrove to preſerve thy Name,</l>
               <l>Yet could not waſt thy Life unto the ſhore,</l>
               <l>Alas! her Burthen was too great before,</l>
               <l>But clos'd thee in her Womb, ſince Death would have</l>
               <l>Thy Period ſet, there to receive a Grave;</l>
               <l>So kind ſhe was when ſhe had lodg'd thee there,</l>
               <l>And found no fit Companion for thy Peer,</l>
               <l>Knowing thou wert too worthy for her Womb,</l>
               <l>Sent thee a ſad but honour'd Trophy home;</l>
               <l>Where thy bright Name ſhall raiſe unto thy Glory,</l>

               <head>An ELEGY
On the Death of the Valiant Sir
Edw. Spragg.</head>
               <l>COuld each brave <hi>Hero</hi> with his conqu'ring Fame</l>
               <l>Immortalize his Life as well as Name,</l>
               <l>And make thoſe Acts (which Glories ſill create)</l>
               <l>Prove Armour 'gainſt the nimble ſtroke of Fate;</l>
               <l>What great attempts would meaner Mortals quit,</l>
               <l>If Death were to be ſhun'd by daring it?</l>
               <l>But here the Virtue's greater in the brave,</l>
               <l>Where Courage ſtrikes for Honour or the Grave;</l>
               <l>Yet ſtill goes on, aſſured of its aim,</l>
               <l>A ſenceleſs Honour or a breathing Fame,</l>
               <l>Though cropt i'th' bud, this comfort Fame doth tell</l>
               <l>The Soul departing that it has done well;</l>
               <l>Fortunes beſt promiſe, but depends on chance,</l>
               <l>And oft encourages without advance;</l>
               <l>Some mount apace as darlings of her will,</l>
               <l>Some hope for flood, but yet are ſtranded ſtill;</l>
               <l>Others on billows of ambition toſs'd,</l>
               <l>Sink in a wrack before their native Coaſt;</l>
               <l>Some ſhe gives Crowns, but ere they come to reign</l>
               <l>Diſgrace or envy takes 'em back again.</l>

Some who with Fate have had a free Careſs,</l>
               <l>And each endeavour bleſt with kind ſucceſs,</l>
               <l>Secure of Honour and foregotten Fame,</l>
               <l>T' increaſe the Actions and inlarge the Name,</l>
               <l>Boldly go on, till to their bounds they come.</l>
               <l>Where Death meets Fame to give 'm welcom home;</l>
               <l>There the Plot ſhews what was ſo long deſign'd,</l>
               <l>Death robs the Life, but leaves the Name behind:</l>
               <l>Who can his Pow'r immortally intrall</l>
               <l>When Fate has cous'nd ſuch an Admiral?</l>
               <l>The Valiant <hi>Spragg,</hi> whoſe Courage did affright</l>
               <l>The <hi>Belgick,</hi> and <hi>Barharian</hi> put to flight,</l>
               <l>Diſarm'd their Forts, and taught the <hi>Engliſh</hi> way,</l>
               <l>To make Bonfires in a briny Bay,</l>
               <l>Beat down their Walls and made their Turrets nod,</l>
               <l>And their men bow as to an angry God;</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Spragg</hi> was an <hi>European-Aſian</hi> word,</l>
               <l>So famous was he for his Fire and Sword,</l>
               <l>That ſhould you ſtrive t'epitomize the ſame</l>
               <l>His bulk was but a Pigmy to his Name,</l>
               <l>And had till now increaſt had <hi>Mars</hi> been kind,</l>
               <l>And not to <hi>Neptune</hi> his juſt right reſign'd,</l>
               <l>Whilſt <hi>Neptune</hi> weary of ſo great a freight,</l>
               <l>To eaſe his burden turns him off to fate;</l>
               <l>Falſe fate! (for whilſt we thought thee Bullet-free)</l>
               <l>Did diſappoint at once our hopes and thee.</l>
               <l>But as the Eagle with the <hi>Tortis</hi> playes,</l>
               <l>Who with his Wings her earthly Lump doth raiſe,</l>

Mounting with ſpeed above the maſſie Eall</l>
               <l>To the heav'ns pitch, unkindly lets her fall,</l>
               <l>Or as the Merchant whoſe ſucceſsful aim</l>
               <l>Of being rich has ſo divulg'd his Name,</l>
               <l>Each ſubject mention'd that implies a force,</l>
               <l>As money nam'd, he's ev'ry mans diſcourſe.</l>
               <l>Whilſt he whom all the world thought rich and great,</l>
               <l>Breaks unexpectedly and proves a cheat.</l>
               <l>Thus Fortune makes her deareſt Sons a ſcoff,</l>
               <l>Firſt treats 'em high, and then ſhe turns 'em off.</l>
               <l>Thus a baſe doom on mighty <hi>Spragg</hi> befel,</l>
               <l>To drown'd an Adm'ral in a Musſle-ſhell;</l>
               <l>Strange unexpected Fate, and unkind ſtay</l>
               <l>Death might have found out ſome more noble way,</l>
               <l>Surpriz'd him ſingly, rather than have dy'd</l>
               <l>Under the Bulwark of his Champions ſide,</l>
               <l>Yet mark the compoſition of thy freight,</l>
               <l>The ſurly billow might have born thy weight;</l>
               <l>But greedy <hi>Neptune</hi> being honour'd twice</l>
               <l>With no leſs than an Adm'ral for a prize,</l>
               <l>Thought good to hold what Fortune did afford,</l>
               <l>Since the laſt <hi>Hero</hi> gave ſo brave reward,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Triton's</hi> there being buſie in the fray,</l>
               <l>Made bold to ſhew thy Predeceſſors way;</l>
               <l>But ſee how Fate may by exchange deſign,</l>
               <l>What was thy doom ought his new birth have been.</l>
               <l>Unhappy Flag! thou unſuccſsful Blue!</l>
               <l>O! change thy colour to a mourning hew,</l>

That couldſt not keep ſuch <hi>Hero</hi>'s from the harms</l>
               <l>Of ſubtil <hi>Belgick</hi> force and <hi>Neptunes</hi> arms,</l>
               <l>Twice to have born ſo great and dear a loſs</l>
               <l>Under the Conduct of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Croſs;</l>
               <l>Yet let not loſſes urge our grief too far,</l>
               <l>Since 'twas the Fate of an ambiguous War;</l>
               <l>The greateſt <hi>Hero's</hi> by Hiſtorians pen'd,</l>
               <l>Have for their mighty Labours found an end;</l>
               <l>The greateſt Victor underneath the Sun,</l>
               <l>Dy'd ere his aim'd-at Conqueſt he'd begun;</l>
               <l>Yet their great Names ſtill to the world do ſtay,</l>
               <l>And mayſt thou have as great a Name as they;</l>
               <l>But this poor age is with the old at odds,</l>
               <l>As men ſtrove then to make 'em demy-Gods</l>
               <l>We ſilence Fame, which is to honour ſin,</l>
               <l>And think on men as if they ne're had been;</l>
               <l>Deeds now, though ne're ſo ardorous and high,</l>
               <l>Scarce reach the life of one mans Memory.</l>
               <l>That mighty ſoul whom all the world admir'd,</l>
               <l>Seems like a dream when once the breath's expir'd;</l>
               <l>And ev'ry act though ne're ſo good or brave,</l>
               <l>Sinks with the corps in the forgotten grave.</l>
