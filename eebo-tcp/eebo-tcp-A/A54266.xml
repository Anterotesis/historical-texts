            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some Grounds and Reaſons drawn from the Law of God and this Nation, to manifeſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfulneſs of the Practice of thoſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and Others; who Commit men to Priſon, or Fine them; for not putting off the Hat, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>GReat and many have been the <hi>Sufferings</hi> of the <hi>Innocent</hi> in all Ages, who could not Conform to the Luſts and Wills of Men, but ſtood Witneſſes againſt them (<hi>on the Lords behalf</hi>) for Righteouſneſs Sake, that what is Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten might be fulfilled (in this Age alſo) viz. <hi>That God never left Himſelf without Witneſſe:</hi> And therefore have they Suffered moſt through the abuſe of the Law, (<hi>for whom the Law was not made</hi>) and that ſaying hath been fulfilled in our dayes; <hi>The Ignorance</hi> (or Malice) <hi>of the Judge, hath Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Calamity of the Innocent, and the Zeal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Knowledge or Mercy, hath let in Iniquity and Oppreſſion like a Flood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For where there is no <hi>Law,</hi> there is no <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion:</hi> Now, if there were any Law for the putting off the Hat, it ought to appear by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> or <hi>Statute Law,</hi> of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the keeping on the <hi>Hat,</hi> be an offence againſt the <hi>Common Law,</hi> then it muſt appear ſo, either amongſt the Records of this Nation, or the Judicial Determinations and Concluſions of the Chief Courts of Juſtice, Conſiſtant with the True Foundation of the Law.</p>
            <p>If againſt the <hi>Statute Law,</hi> then it muſt appear ſo,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63131:3"/>
either amongſt the Parliament Rolls, or the Printed Books proceeding from thence.</p>
            <p>But that it is an Offence, either againſt the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law,</hi> or <hi>Statute Law,</hi> there is not ſo much as the leaſt tittle of Law (as ever we could here of) to prove it.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid to be done againſt <hi>Good Manners:</hi> But <hi>Evil Communication,</hi> is that which <hi>Corrupts Good Manners; &amp; whatſoever is more than Yea, Yea,</hi> and <hi>Nay, Nay, cometh of evil,</hi> ſaith Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God; and as to <hi>Good Manners</hi> which you ſay it is againſt, produce your Law for ſuch <hi>Good Manners,</hi> and let us See what it Is, and what it Requires.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid to be done againſt the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage</hi> and <hi>Cuſtome</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> Which Reaſon is not of Force with Wiſe Men, until it be proved that <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> becauſe <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> is a binding Law; which ſaith <hi>Cook,</hi> is not; for <hi>Evill Cuſtomes</hi> ought to be aboliſhed; and that <hi>Cuſtome</hi> which is to be Reckoned a <hi>Law,</hi> ought to be as ſaith <hi>Cook,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It is the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtome</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> for Men and Women <hi>to Salute one another,</hi> and <hi>to ſpeak one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and to come into Courts, with <hi>Cloakes</hi> and <hi>Coates,</hi> and <hi>Gloves</hi> and <hi>Boots,</hi> and yet not an offence to leave them undone, or to come without any of theſe coverings; for things which are in a mans power <hi>to give,</hi> or <hi>not to give,</hi> and what he is content not to receive of others (as ſuch things as theſe are, take them in the beſt ſenſe, as they are peculiar to every man, and at his Choice whether he will give them or not) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be made Criminal, if he do not give them.</p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>as The not putting off the Hat,</hi> (no more <hi>then any other Garment</hi>) is any offence againſt

               <hi>the Law of this Nation,</hi> ſo neither is it an <hi>Offence</hi> againſt <hi>the Law of God,</hi> or <hi>Right Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not againſt <hi>the Law of God;</hi> for there is neither <hi>Precept,</hi> or <hi>Preſident</hi> in the Scriptures that makes it ſo, but the contrary; For <hi>David</hi> who was a King, not only <hi>covered his own Head,</hi> but alſo all the People that were with him <hi>covered their Heads,</hi> 2 Sam. 15. 30. And <hi>Moſes</hi> the Judge of all <hi>Iſrael</hi> (was ſo far from Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>the head to be uncovered</hi>) that he ſaid, <hi>uncover not your heads leaſt ye die,</hi> (Lev. 10. 6.) which we Inſtance, to ſhew that they were not offended at the people <hi>for ſtanding covered before them.</hi> So it is manifeſt, that the Rulers, and Judges, in theſe dayes, that command the contrary, and take Offence if people be Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, are led by another Spirit, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>an thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants (of God) were led by, who had learned to be meek, and lowly in heart, as Chriſt taught (and ſtill teacheth) his Diſciples, <hi>being the ſame Yeſterday, to Day, and for Ever:</hi> Who alſo ſaid, (and ſtill ſaith) <hi>How can ye Believe, that ſeek Honour one of another,</hi> (Mark that) <hi>and not the Honour that comes from God only;</hi> and the Apoſtle that abode in his Doctrine ſaid, <hi>He that Reſpects perſons commits ſin,</hi> 2 Jam. 9. And <hi>Mordecai</hi> (the Servant of God, an Iſraelite indeed) durſt not (notwithſtanding the Kings Command) Bow, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <hi>Haman,</hi> though he was a Chief Prince, <hi>Heſter</hi> 3. 12.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Not againſt <hi>Right Reaſon;</hi> for man is either Free, or a Servant by Nature, according to the Spirit that Rules, and hath Command in him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:63131:4"/>And though a Man refuſe to be <hi>uncovered,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Judg or Juſtice of Peace, &amp;c. Commands it, yet this doth not make it <hi>an offence;</hi> for the Judges, and Juſtices, are only to put the Laws <hi>in being</hi> in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that it is no Contempt to deny to obey their Commands, in a thing, which neither <hi>the Law of God,</hi> or <hi>Right Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>this Nation</hi> Requires to be done.</p>
            <p>This Act <hi>of putting off the</hi> Hat, hath been in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alwaies taken to be an Act of <hi>Civill Courteſie,</hi> which a man might <hi>do</hi> or <hi>not do,</hi> to whom <hi>he would,</hi> and when <hi>he would,</hi> and not <hi>of Duty;</hi> and ſo the practice of it amongſt People of all Sorts, High and Low, Rich and Poor, and in all Places, as well in the High Wayes as elſewhere doth manifeſt: And it is no other <hi>than a meer Voluntary Complement;</hi> the Refuſall whereof, was never held <hi>An Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> till of late Years, &amp; that by ſome particular Perſons.</p>
            <p>It's true, that people for the moſt part <hi>ſtand bare</hi> in all <hi>Courts of Juſtice</hi> in this Nation; but this is more than is Required <hi>by any Law,</hi> either <hi>of God</hi> or <hi>Man;</hi> for that which is required to be done to Magiſtrates, <hi>is Honour &amp; Obedience;</hi> which is ſufficiently demonſtrated by a Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>to all lawful Commands,</hi> &amp; not by <hi>any Complement,</hi> or <hi>Act of Courteſie;</hi> neither by putting off the Hat, is true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, love or hatred known; but rather generally known to give nouriſhment to diſſimulation and hypocricy.</p>
            <p>Beſides, to Command any Perſon <hi>to put off his Hat</hi> (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for a Magiſtrate to do it himſelfe) is abſurd; for that is to uſe it contrary to the end, for which it was made; which is <hi>to cover the Head,</hi> &amp; to keep it <hi>from Cold</hi> and <hi>Rain,</hi> whereby ſickneſs may be prevented; and not to keep it in the hand; &amp; <hi>a Wiſe Man beginneth from the End of a Thing, and weighes every Thing as it is there;</hi> as ſaith Cook, <hi>to bring Errours to their Firſt, is to ſee their Laſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:63131:4"/>Again, whether the Condition or health of a Mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will give him leave <hi>to ſtand bare or not,</hi> the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is not <hi>a Competent Judge;</hi> but the party himſelf: And therefore <hi>its against Reaſon</hi> that it ſhould be in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Power, <hi>to Command the Hat</hi> to be put off by Him, whoſe Nature cannot bear it; and alſo it is the ſame, as to Command Him to put off any of his other Garments; and it alſo deſtroyes propriety, which a great Part of the Law is made to preſerve, with <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Right;</hi> which is Deſtroyed and vacated, if any Judge or Juſtice may at his pleaſure Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our Hats from us, or take them off our Heads without our Conſent, either immediately, or by our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives.</p>
            <p>From all which it is clear, that thoſe Magiſtrates that Fine and Impriſon Innocent Men (who for Conſcience ſake cannot bow to their Wills <hi>by putting off the Hat</hi>) they are neither Warranted <hi>by the Law of God, Right Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>of this Nation;</hi> but on the contrary ſuch Actings are meerly <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> againſt <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and very Abſurd; <hi>and is an Invaſion upon the Liberties of the Free-Men of</hi> England, which the Laws aforeſaid were made to preſerve.</p>
            <p>And <hi>it is all one</hi> to Command <hi>our Money-out of our Purſes,</hi> as <hi>our Hats off our Heads,</hi>
