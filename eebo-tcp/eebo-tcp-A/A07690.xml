            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:13170:6"/>
few as they be, wolde god yet they were yet farre fewer than they be. For all be yt there are of heretyques farre fewer than those that are wold haue it seme there were: yet are there vndoutely by suche dyssymysyng suf feraunce, many mo than elles there sholde haue ben.</p>
            <p>¶ And this is also the cause, that of these heretyques bookes there be so many now brought in as there be. For whyle men may so boldely speke out theyre heresyes, euen amonge theym whome they knowe none heretykes: this maketh many folke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> elles durst not medle wyth suche bokes, to bye theym and loke on theym, and longe to se what they saye.</p>

            <p>¶ And thus of suche bokes, as fore as they be forboden: yet are there ma ny bought. Nor the parel refrayneth not myche people from the byenge, syth there is none house lyghtly that hathe so lytle rome, that lacketh the rome to hyde a boke therin.</p>
            <p>¶ But when they hadde the bokes, yf men wolde abhorre theyr talkyng gone were all the pleasure that they take therin. But now while men con trolle theym not, but laugh and lette theym bable, pryde maketh theym procede, and they procure mo, and sprede the bokes more abrode, and drawe mo bretherne to theym.</p>
            <p>¶ There ys no small nomber of suche erronyouse englyshe bookes prented of whyche yf fewe were boughte, there wolde not of lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhed so many be putte in prente /

            <p>¶ And in this wise is there sent oute to be prented, the boke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Fryth made laste agaynste the blessed sacrament, answerynge to my letter, wherwyth I confuted the pestyle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t treatyce that he hadde made agaynste yt byfore.

            <p>¶ But in the meane whyle, there is come ouer a nother boke aguynst the blessed sacrament / a boke of that sort,
<pb facs="tcp:13170:7"/>
that Frythes boke the bretherne may nowe forbere. For more blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouse, and more bedelem rype than this boke is, were that boke harde to be / which is yet madde inough as me say that haue sene yt.</p>
            <p>¶ This boke is intytled, The sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our lord. But I beshre w suche a she wer, as so serueth in the souper, that he conuayth awaye the best dyshe, and bryngeth yt not to the borde / as this man wold yf he could, conuey fro the blessed sacrament Cri stes owne blessed fleshe and bloode, and leue vs nothynge therin, but for a memoryall onely bare brede and wyne.</p>
            <p>¶ But his handes are to lumpyshe and this messe also to great for hym to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uey clene / specyally syth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dishe is so dere and so dayntye, that euery chryste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man hath his hart bent therto

and therfore his yie set theron to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> where yt bycometh.</p>
            <p>¶ The man hath not set his name vnto his boke / nor whose yt is I can not surely say. But some reken yt to be made by Wyllyam Tyndale / for that in a pystle of his vnto Fryth, he wryteth that in any thynge that he cando,' he wolde not fayle to helpe hym forthe.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe be yt some of the brethern reporte that the booke was made by George Jay. And of trouth Tyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale wrote vnto Frith, that George Jay hadde made a boke agaynste the sacrament, whych was as yet partly by his meanes partely for lacke of money, reteyned and kepte fro the prent. Nowe be yt what George Joy wolde do therin afterward wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hys money were come / that coulde he not (he sayth assure hym.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13170:8"/>¶ Nowe of trouthe George Joye hath longe hadde in hande and redy lyenge by hym, his boke agaynst the sacrament. And nowe yf this be yt / he hathe somwhat enlengthed yt of late, by a pyece that he hath patched in agaynst me, wherin he wolde seme to soyle myne argumentes, whyche in my letter I made in that mater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste the deuely she treatyce of Fryth.</p>
            <p>¶ And in very dede, dyuerse that are lerned and haue redde the booke, reken yt veryly to be the booke of George Jaye, whereof Tyndale wrote vnto Fryth / specyally by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayn wordes that were in that letter, For therin wryteth Tyndale, that yf George Jay dyd put forth his boke, there shold be founden in it many rea sons &amp; very few to the purpose.</p>
            <p>¶ Nowe be yt me thynketh by that
<pb facs="tcp:13170:9"/>
marke, that this boke sholde not be that. For in this boke be there very fewe reasons, and of them all neuer one to the purpose.</p>
            <p>¶ The maker of the boke in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende of his boke, for one cause why he put teth not his name therto, wryteth in thys wyse, <hi>Mayster mocke whom the veryte moost offendeth, and doth but mocke it out whan he can not soyle it, he koweth me well inough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>¶ Thys sadde and sage ernest, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that mockyng at myne name calleth me mayster Mocke, dothe in these wyse wordes nothynge but mocke the readers of his boke / saue that his reason is so rude and folysh, that the mocke returneth to hym selfe.</p>
            <p>¶ For syth he wryteth not his booke to me, nor sendeth me none of theym, but the bretherne kepe theym fro me as closely as they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: what if I wyst neuer so wel who he were that wrote
<pb facs="tcp:13170:9"/>
yt, what were this to the bretherne that reade yt? know they therby who yt is to?</p>
            <p>¶ Now for my selfe also, though I knowe Tyndale by name, &amp; George Jay or George Joy by name also, and twenty such other fond felowes of the same secte mo: yet yf tenne of those wolde make tenne suche folysh treatyses and sette theyre names to none, coulde I know therby whych of those madde foles, made whyche folyshe boke?</p>
            <p>¶ Dyuerse there are in dede, of those that are lerned and haue redde the boke, that thynke for the lacke of lernynge and of wytte also, that they fynde euery where therin, the booke sholde neyther be made by Tyndale nor by George Jay neyther / but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by some yonge vnlerned fole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13170:10"/>¶ Nowe be it as for me, I thynke the boke myghte be for all that made by Tyndale or by George Jaye ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For the mater beynge dyuysed agaynst the blessed sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the wy sest or the moste fole, the moste ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or the leste, is all in maner one, and in that mater maketh lytle dyffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. For I neuer founde yet any man so wel lerned, and so naturally well wytted wythall, but after that he fell ones to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> defense of heresies, &amp; specyally of this abomynable here sye agaynst the blessed sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: ney ther lernyng, nor wyt, neuer wel ser ued hymafter.</p>
            <p>For as for Tyndale the captayne of our Englyshe heretyques (who by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he felto these fransyes, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had went had had some wyt, and was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for full pretyly lerned to) ye se
<pb facs="tcp:13170:10"/>
good chrysten readers playnly tryed by his bokes, that an vnlettered man myghte be ashamed to write so vnler nedly / and a madde man wolde all most wax rede for shame, to wryte in some thynges so frantykely.</p>
            <p>¶ As touchynge frere Barons and George Jay, the bretherne &amp; systern them selfe se theyr wyttes so wasted and theyr lernyng waxen so slender, that the bretherhed hath lytle lyste to reade them. ¶ And some of the bre therne that say this new worke was made by George Jay, thynke that the cause why he sette not his name therto, was bycause he wyst well the brethern dyd not regarde hym. And Tyndale had in his letter also decla red him for a fole, by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof he thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if yt came vnder his name, the stimacyon therof were but loste.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13170:11"/>¶ Fryth was lo a proper yonge man and a towarde, tyll he fell vnto these folyes. After whyche to what dekay both his wyt and his lernynge came, euery wyse man myche meruayled, that in his open examenacyon herd and consydered his answeres.</p>
            <p>¶ For all be yt that in the booke that the bretherne that are here haue sent ouer to prent, Tyndale and hys fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes to bydylde the worlde wyth all, purpose to make many chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and amende and aduaunce hys parte, vnderpropyng yt wyth theyre own proper lyes: yet shal y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meanes be metely well founden to controll theyre falshed I truste, and to take awaye theyr clokes, and lyue hys fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bare. And than shall men playne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly se, that of one whome the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne boste for so wyse, there neuer
<pb facs="tcp:13170:11"/>
dyed in Englange byfore, any false heretyque so folyshe.</p>
            <p>¶ But now as touchynge this new come ouer boke, whyche the maker hath entitled The super of the lord: though the man haue named yt the souper of our sauyour Chryste, yet hathe the man made yt the souper of the deuyll.</p>
            <p>¶ The specyall effecte of all hys whole purpose is to fede vs wyth the moste poysoned heresye that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boreth to kyll the catholyque christen fayth, concernynge the blessed sacra ment of the autare / all be yt by the waye he putteth forthe dyuerse other heresye besyde.</p>
            <p>¶ Thys vsauerye souper of his, withoute any corne of salte, and spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all wyth poyson, he dyuydeth as yt were into two courses / that ys to

wytte into the treatynge and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of two specyall thynges spe cyfyed in the gospell of Chryste, wherby chrysten people playnely perceyue, that in the blessed sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thaulter, is the very blessed bodye of Chryste, his very fieshe and hys bloude.</p>
            <p>¶ In the fyrste parte whych I call here his fyrst course, occupyenge the tone halfe of his boke, he treateth the wordes of Chryste spoken in the syxte chapyter of saynte Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / why che wordes our sauyour speketh, of the eatyng of his flesh and drynkyng of hys bloude.</p>
            <p>¶ In his secunde parte, whyche I call hys secund course, he treateth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maundye of Chryste wyth hys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles vpon shere thursday, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our sauyour actually dyd instytute y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> blessed sacrament, &amp; therin veryly

gaue his awne very fleshe and blood to his twelne apostles hym selfe.</p>
            <p>¶ I shal therfore diuyde this worke of myne into two partes in lyke wise, of whyche twayne this shall be the fyrste, wherin I shall detect &amp; make euery man perceyue thys mannys euyll coquery in hys fyrste course, concernynge the treatynge of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes wordes in the syxt chapyter of saynte Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>¶ And all be yt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I shall afterward send you forth my secunde parte also agaynst his secunde course: yet shall I so handle thys mannes mysche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouse heresye in this fyrst part, that though I neuer wrote worde more herafter of the mater, yet to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuynge of the trouth, and deteccy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his falsed, this fyrst part might suffyse for all the whole mater.</p>
            <p>¶ In hys fyrste parte, he forste ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powneth
<pb facs="tcp:13170:13"/>
the later parte of his syxte chapyter of saynte Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / and by hys declaracyon laboreth to drawe men from the perceyuynge of the trouth, and setteth forth also both his pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypall heresye, and ouer that dyuerse other.</p>
            <p>¶ Also in the same parte he argueth agaynste all men in generall that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powne any of those wordes of Crist there spoken, to be ment by Chryste of the very eatynge of hys fleshe (as the catholyque chyrch byleueth) in the blessed sacrament.</p>
            <p>¶ In that fyrste parte also he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth agaynste me by name in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyall / and pretendeth to soyle such ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gumentes as I made in my letter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste the poysoned treatyse, that John Fryth had before made in that mater agaynst the blessed sacrament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13170:13"/>¶ In that parte also the man bryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth in two placys all in great, which he hath pyked out by longe leysoure amonge all my bokes / in eyther of whyche two places, he sheweth that I haue notably contraryed myn own wrytynge, that I haue wryten my self in other places before &amp; sheweth also the places where.</p>
            <p>¶ I shall therfore good readers in thys fyrste parte of myne gyue you fyue bokes / and some of them very shorte.</p>
            <p>¶ In the fyrst wyll I geue you the exposycion of the selfe same wordes of Chryste, mencyoned in the syxte chapyter of saynt John / by whyche who so conferre them and consyder them togyther, shall I trust perceiue well the fashed of his exposycyon, &amp; not be deceiued therby. And for myne
<pb facs="tcp:13170:14"/>
exposycyon ye shall not geue me the thanke. For I haue but pyked it out here and there out of the wrytynges of dyuers olde holy menne.</p>
            <p>¶ The seconde shall shew you for a sample, some of the fawtes both in folies and errours, that the man hath made vs in his exposycyon.</p>
            <p>¶ The thyrde shal answere &amp; soyle hys wyse reasons, wyth whyche he wolde make all men folys, that haue expowned that place before, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to hys here sye now / that is to wytte, all the olde holy doctours and saynte frome thapostses dayes vnto oure owne tyme.</p>
            <p>¶ In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fourth shall ye se what wyt and what sernyng he sheweth, in soy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge of myne argumentes made be fore in that mater agaynst his felow Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Fryth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13170:14"/>¶ The fyfth shall declare you the dylygence that the man hath done, in sekyng out my neglygence, leuynge some places in my wrytynge, repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; contrary the tone place to the tother. And of such place ye shall (as I sayd) se hym with dylygent serche of thre yere, at laste brynge you forth twayne. And there shall you se good chrysten reders, that in those twayn, my neglygence shall for all his dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence proue hym twyse a fole.</p>
            <p>¶ But in the treatyng of this mater with hym, I shall lacke somwhat of the commodyte that the man hath in dysputynge wyth me. For he hath a greate pleasure of tetymes, nowe in one maner, now in another, now to talke of me, and nowe to speke to me by name, wyth, <hi>thus sayth More,</hi> and, <hi>

            <p>¶ And therfore what foly and what falsed be founden in his boke, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth very lytell. For shame he thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth he can none take therby, whyle folke knowe not hys name.</p>

<pb n="lvii" facs="tcp:13170:73"/>
that it shalbe the fame flesshe.</p>
               <p>¶ This exposycyon good readers ye se is euydent open and playne. But now se good readers for godde sake the falsehed of mayster Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in hys exposycyon vppon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same wordes. Where as our sauyour as you se speketh in these few wordes of these two geuynges, the geuynge to eate and the geuynge to dye, the ge uynge in the sacrament &amp; the geuyng on the crosse / cometh me now maister Masker, and expowneth Chrystes wordes all to gether of the tone ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge, that is to wytte the geuynge by deth on the crosse / and letteth the tother geuynge go by, as though he saw it not, albe it that Chryst speketh of that gyuynge both fyrst and most.</p>
               <p>¶ Now yf mayster Masker wyll say that I do but fayne these two ge uynges, and saye as he sayth often
<pb facs="tcp:13170:74"/>
that Chryste ment there but one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge, that is to wytte by hys deth, and wyll saye that Cryste speketh there no worde of the sacrament / I shall tell hym agayne that so myghte mayster Masker marre all his owne exposycyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vtterly. For Cryst whan he sayth, whiche I shall gyue for the lyfe of the worlde, speketh no word in the world neyther of his crosse nor of his deth. If he say that they be vn derstanden, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must he geue me leue to say the lyke for my parte, that as deth &amp; the crosse are vnderstonde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tone geuing, so eatyng &amp; the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is vnderstonden in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tother geuynge. Now be it for my part yet touchyng the fyrst geuyng, I may say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cryst speketh of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; signyfyeth his menyng in this word, brede, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he sayth the brede that I shall geue you is my fleshe. And of the eatynge
<pb n="lviii" facs="tcp:13170:74"/>
therof he speketh expressely after. And therfore shall mayster Masker neuer wade out therof, but that I ha ue the wordes of the scrypture mych more clere for the fyrst geuyng, than he for the secund. And ye may se that of the two geuynges mayster Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker to mocke vs with, hath in hys ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posycion of a folysh wylynesse wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and dyssembled the tone.</p>
               <p>¶ But yet if maister Masker striue with me styll vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this point, whither our sauyour speke of two geuynges of hys fleshe, or but of one / albe it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I haue proued my part therin mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly playne my selfe, yet am I content that a better than we both shall breke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> stryfe bytwen vs. I shall therfore name you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> holy cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nyng doctour sait Bede, whose worde I trust euery wyse man wyll byleue a lytell better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eyther maister Maskers or myn.

So thus sayth saint Bede vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these<note place="margin">S.

               <p>¶ Here you se good readers that saynte Bede telleth you playne the same tale that I tell you, that is to wytte that our sauyour in those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des speketh of two geuynges of him selfe, the tone to his dyscyples in the sacrament, the tother to deth for hys dyscyples on the crosse.

she wold know the meanis, for as mych as she had determyned her selfe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perpetuall virginite / and therof a promyse had passed &amp; a vow was made, and Ioseph well agreed therwith; as it maye welbe gathered vppon the gospell.</p>
               <p>¶ For thangell sayd not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hast co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cey<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued, but thou shalt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceyue.

And therfore we may wel gather of his wordꝭ &amp; hers togyther as I haue shewed in my dialoge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whan she sayd how shall this be for I knowe no man, she ment therin
<pb facs="tcp:13170:77"/>
not onely that she knew none alredy, but also that she hadde promysed and vowed that she neuer wolde knowe man afterwarde / vsynge therin such a maner of spekynge, as a mayed myghte saye by one whom she wold neuer haue, we may well talke togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but we wedde not togyther.</p>
               <p>¶ Now that her determinacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was not with her selfe onely, but confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med also with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent of her spouse, it maye well appere. For without his agrement she coulde not reken her selfe to be sure to kepe it.</p>
               <p>¶ And that her determynacyon of perpetuall vyrginite, was a promyse and a vow to god, it may well appere by this, that els whan she had worde from god by the angell that she shold conceyue and beare a chylde, she had had no cause to aske y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> questyon how. For if she were at lyberty to lye with

               <p>¶ But here may some man happely
<pb facs="tcp:13170:78"/>
say, that this reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by which I proue ber vow, wyll serue well inough to soyle it selfe, and proue that it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not that she had made any vow at all, but had onely some mynde and desyre of perpetuall virginyre, but yet styll at her lybertye / without any promyse or bonde. For syth she hadde now by reuelacyon from god, that his pleasure was she sholde haue a chylde / a bare purpose of virgynyte &amp; a vow of virginyte were all of one weyght. For god was able as well to dispence with her vow, as to byd her leue of her vnuowed purpose.</p>

               <p>¶ And those vowesses lo that hapen to haue any suche mynde / let them at the fyrste thought make a crosse on the yrb rest and blesse it a waye. For though it be no breking of theyr vow yet is it a waye well to warde it, and draueth (yf it be not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

uyour thus in saynt Cyrilles exposi cyon. <q>wene you wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I sayd that who so eate my flesh shal haue euerlasting lyfe, that I ment therin, that this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely body of myne doth gyue lyfe of his own proper nature? Nay veryly. But I dyd speke to you of the spyryt and of eternall lyfe. But it is not the nature of the flesshe that maketh the spyryt geue lyfe / but the power of the spyryte maketh the fleshe geue lyfe. The wordes therfore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to you be spirit &amp; lyfe / that is to wytte they be spyrituall &amp; spoken of the spirit and lyfe / that is to wytte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spirit y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is the natural life, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> geueth lyfe. But yet the thyng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue all redy said, it shal do no harme though we repete it agayn. The thing that I haue sayd is this.

And therfore whan Cryst calleth hys fleshe a geuer of lyfe / that power of geuynge lyfe he doth not attrybute vnto his fleshe and vnto hys holy spi rite bothe of one fashyon. For the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte geueth lyfe by it selfe and of hys owne nature. But the fleshe asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth vnto that power of geuynge lyfe, by reason of the coniunccyon and vnyte that it hath wyth that holy spyryte. How be it how and by what meane that thynge is done, we neyther are able with to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge to tell, nor with mynd to imagyne / but wyth sylence &amp; ferme fayth we receyue it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>¶ Thus haue you herde good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that the thynge that I saye, do not onely I say, but saynt Austayne also and saynt Cyrill both.

               <p>
                  <q>Wherfore he concludeth that thys meate so often mencyoned is fayth. Of the whyche meat sayth the prophete, the iufte lyueth.

               </p>
               <p>¶ I wyll not laye these wordes to hys charge as heresye / but I wylbe bolde by hys lycence to note in them a lytle lacke of wytte, and some good store of foly. For though a man may well and wyth good reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, call fayth a meate of mannys soule: yet is it great foly to saye, that the meate that Chryst speketh of here ys (as may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Masker sayth it is) none other meate but fayth.</p>
               <p>¶ For mayster Masker maye play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely se, and is not I suppose so poore blynde, but that he seeth well in dede
<pb facs="tcp:13170:131"/>
that the meate whych Cryst speketh of here, is our sauyour Cryste hym selfe. Whyche thynge he so playnely speketh, that no man can mysse to per ceyue it / whan he saith, <q>I am my self the brede of lyfe.

And now sayth mayster Masker very solemynely, &amp; with authoryte byddeth euery man marke it well and consyder it, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meate that Cryste speketh of here is nothynge ellys but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>¶ Fyrste in thys construccyon may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Masker lyeth very large. For though Cryst sayd, that to byleue in hym was the wurke of god / he sayde not (as mayster Masker maketh it)

               <p>¶ But now suppose that Cryst had sayd as mayster Masker wold make it seme, that is to wyt that the wurke of god were nothynge ellys but the bylyefe: yet ye se well good readers that Cryst in sayeng that the bylyefe in hym is the wurke by whyche they shall wurke to gete the meate, sayth that the bylyefe is the meane to gete the meate, and not that the bylyefe is the meate.</p>
               <p>¶ But mayster Masker bycause y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bylyefe is the waye to this meate, therfore he calleth the bylyefe the meate / as wysely as though he wold call the kynges strete Westmynster chyrche, bycause it is the way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

               <p>¶ But now wyll mayster Masker wax angry with my wordes, and call me M. mokke as he dothe onys or twyse in hys boke.</p>
               <p>¶ But now good readers I wyll not adiure you by godde holy names to iudge iustely / but euyn onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre you that in waye of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that you wyll say but euyn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyfferently.

               <p>¶ And yet you maye se that I dele wyth hym very gentylly. For in thys poynt wherin by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>traryeng of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes

               <p>¶ And yet I wene the man hath so lytle honesty, that he wyll neuer can me thanke for my curtesye / specyally bycause that (as farre as I can se) the man had leuer confesse hym selfe an heretyke, than be proued a fole.</p>
               <p>And that appereth well in this. For this lytell scabbe of hys foly he labo reth somwhat to hyde and couer, so that a man muste pull of the clowte ere he can spye the boche.

                  <q>I am the brede of lyfe, and who so come to me that is to saye, who so is gryffed and ioyned to me by fayth, shall neuer honger, that is who so byleue in me is satissyed. It is fayth therfore that stann<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth this honger and thyrste of the soule. Fayth it is therfore in Cryst that fylleth our hungry hartes, so that we can desyre no nother yf we ones thus eate and drynk hym by fayth / that is to say yf we byleue his fleshe and body to haue ben broken, and hys bloude shedde for out synnes, for tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are our sowles satysfyed and we be iustyfyed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>¶ The worde of Chryst good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with which he begynneth, is well and fully fulfylled, yf it be vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> den as I haue before declared, that is to wytte, that who so come onys by well workynge fayth, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraunce

therin, vnto the meate that is Chryste, and attayne the possessy o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and fruicion of hym in blysse, he shall neuer hunger nor thyrste after.</p>
               <p>And bysydes this, dyuers good holy doctours expoune these wordes of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> eatynge of our sauyour in the blessed sacrament also.</p>
               <p>¶ But surely I byleue that it wyll be very harde for mayster Masker to veryfye the wordes of his holy ex posycyon / ye scant of some such piece therof as semeth at the fyrste syghte well layed as where he sayth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fayth so fylleth our hungry hartes, and so stauncheth the hunger and thurst of our soule, that we be satysfyed.</p>
               <p>¶ For I suppose that men are not sa tisfied here, neyther with faith alone, nor with fayth and hope and cheryte to / but yet they hunger and thurste<note place="margin">Eccle. 24.</note> styll. For as oure sauyour sayth,

               <p>¶ Lo here youse good readers that he sayth that who so byleueth thys, here is all that nedeth. For he that
<pb n="cxviii" facs="tcp:13170:136"/>
thus byleueth is iustyfied, and eateth and drynketh Cryst, and so his soule satysfyed / bycause he that so eateth hym ones, can neuer after hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger nor thyrst. And why? For he can desyre none other thynge</p>
               <p>¶ Fyrste I wene that all menne are not agreed, that he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> longeth for none other thing, is not a thurst / if he long styll for more of the same. For if a man drynke apynt of ale / though he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de hym selfe so well conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that he do not desyre neyther bere, wyne nor water / yet if his appe tyte be not so fully satisfied, but that he wold fayne of the same ale, drynk a quarte more, some man wolde saye he were a drye soule &amp; were a thyrste agayne.</p>
               <p>¶ But now yf this man ment any good in this mater, and wolde saye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> who so so eateth god as he hath hym
<pb facs="tcp:13170:137"/>
well incorporated in hym, shall so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue his hunger and his thurste slaked, that he shall not hunger and thurste after the pleasure of hys body, nor after the goodes &amp; ryches; nor after the pompe and pryde of this wreched worlde: I wolde haue suffred hym go forth with his exposicyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not haue interrupted it. And yet it coulde not (ye wote well) haue well &amp; fully serued for the texte, syth the texte is, he shall neuer hunger nor thurste, which signyfyeth a takynge awaye of desyre and longynge. And by this exposicyon though there be taken a waye the desyre &amp; longyng for other thinges / yet remaineth there a desyre and longynge for more and more of the same.</p>
               <p>¶ But yet I wolde as I say haue lette it passe by and wynke therat, yf he ment none harme therin. But
<pb n="cxix" facs="tcp:13170:137"/>
now comech he after and declareth by ensample, what he meneth by this his sayenge, that he that eateth and drynketh god by byleuynge that he dyed for our synnes, shall thurst and hunger for none other. For he sayth, <q>He shall desyre none other, he shal not seke by nyght to lone another byfore whome he wolde laye hys gryefe, he shall not runne wanderyng here and there to seke dede stockes and stones.</q>

               <p>¶ And as mayster Masker mysse vnderstandeth those wordes of saint Poule: so I perceyue that longe be fore mayster Masker was borne, there were some suche other folys that mysse toke those wordes after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same fonde fasshyon than / and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore affermed y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> aduowtry was no dedely synne / as these folyshe folke afferme now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is no dedely synne for a frere to wedde a nonne.

wolde haue preched that poynt vnto the Corynthyes. But he preched as hym self sayth in his pystle nothyng vnto them but Chryst and hym cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyfyed / and theruppon they conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> auowtry was no dedely synne.</p>
               <p>¶ But saynt Austayne answereth those folys and thys fole to, that he preched not onely Chrystes crucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyxion.

And therfore as saynt Austayne sayth to preche Chryste, is to preche bothe euery thynge that we must be bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to byleue, and also euery thynge that we muste be bounden to do to come to Chryste. And not as those folys &amp; this fole techeth, that we be iustifyed yf we byleue no more but onely that
<pb facs="tcp:13170:148"/>
Chryste was crucifyed and dyed for our synnys.</p>
               <p>¶ And whan mayster Masker saith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by affermyng any necessary pointe to be lefte vnwryten in the scrypture I make goddes holy testament insuf fycyent and vnperfyte, for all that it was fyrst reueled vnto our fathers, and efte wryten by Moyses, &amp; than by his prophetes, and at laste wryten bothe by his holy euangelystes and apostles to: to this I saye that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des testament is not insufficyent nor imperfyte, though some necessary thynges be lefte out of the wrytyng. For I say that his testament is not the wrytyng onely, but all the whole thynge reueled by god vnto his chyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, and restynge and remaynynge therin, parte in wrytynge and parte without wrytynge styll, as it was all together fyrst without writing geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb n="cxxx" facs="tcp:13170:148"/>
And se now good readers the wytte of mayster Masker in this worde of his.

               <p>¶ And whan so euer that mayster Masker is able to proue that al these thynges whiche we be bounden to by leue more than that Chryst dyed for our synnys, are so fully wryten by Chrystes apostles, that they lefte none of them all vnwryten: whan he

sholde we not nede in dede to byleue that we sholde do penaunce for our synnys our selfe, nor to byleue the presence of Chryst in the blessed sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament neyther. Whych poynt they wolde haue now taken for indyffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and many necessary pointes mo. wherof mayster masker wolde take awaye the necessyte, bycause saynte Poule sayth he preched nothynge to the Corynthies but Chryst and hym to be crucyfyed.

pleasure) that he sholde dye for the synne of the world, and in what wyse also. If mayster Masker answere me no: I am sure euery wyse man wyll tell hym yes. For he spake there not halfe so playnely of the geuynge of his body to be slayne, as he dyd of geuynge it to be eaten. For as for his deth, not so myche as onys named it, but onely sayeth, <q>And the brede that I shall geue you is myne owne flesshe, whyche I shall geue for the lyfe of the worde.</q> In whyche wordes he not onys na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth deth.

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13170:178"/>¶ And some greate holy doctours also, construe those whole wordes, <hi>And the brede that I shall gyue is my flesshe which I shall gyue for the lyfe of the worlde,</hi> to be spo ken onely of the gyuynge of hys bles sed body in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and neyther the fyrste parte nor the seconde to be spoken of his deth. But that in the fyrste parte Chryste sheweth what he wolde gyue them to eate, that is to wytte his owne flesshe, and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde parte he shewed them why he wolde geue the worlde hys flesshe to eate, and what commodyle they shold haue by the eatynge of it / sayenge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wolde geue it men to eate for the lyfe that men sholde haue by the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge of it.

eate it.

               </p>
               <p>¶ There were good readers two causes, for whiche those Iewes and those dyscyples were offended at the herynge of Cryste, whan he sayde they shold eate his fleshe. One was, the straungenesse and the impossyby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte that they thought was therin / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> tother was the lothsomnes that they had therto. Now yf mayster Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker mene here for the impossybylyte
<pb n="clxvii" facs="tcp:13170:186"/>
by reason of the dyfference of his pre sence and his absence: I can not se why they sholde be more offended after his ascencyon than before. For yf it be possyble for hym to make his body to be in many dyuerse places at onys in erth: than it is as possyble for hym to make it at onys in those two dyuerse places erth and heuyn. For the meruayle standeth not in the farre dystaunce of the two places a sunder, but in the dyuersyte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two places hauyng in them both one body be they neuer so nere togyther. And as for the dyfference of his presence here in erth, and his absence hense, by his ascensyon into heuyn: mayster Masker is more than madde, to put that for a dyfference, as a cause after thascensyon to make theym more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended to here of the eatynge of hys body. For yf he make (as he can and
<pb facs="tcp:13170:187"/>
doth) his body to be as well here in erthe as in heuyn: than is hys body no more absent from hense tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from thense, as for the veryte of hys pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in the place, though it be more absent in consyderacyon to vs that se not his body here, but in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forme of brede. But the blessed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>¶ Nowe yf mayster Masker here mene, that after Chrystes ascensyon into hyuyn, it sholde be a thynge that sholde of reason more offende the Iewes to eate hys flesshe, than at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme whyle he was here, as a thyng that wolde be than a mych more loth some mete: what deuyll reason hath

               <p>¶ And yet either he meneth thus / or els he lacketh the waye to fynde the wordes, with which he wold expresse his mynde. For these are the wordes, that he maketh Chryste to saye, <hi>If it offende you to ente my flessh whyle I am here: it shall mych more offende you to eate it whan my body shalbe gone out of your syghte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You se now that he sayth it shal more offende you to eate it whan it is gone out of your syght into heuyn. Now yf he hadde ment in the tother maner for thimpossibylyte, he wolde haue sayd (except he can not speke) that it sholde more offende theym to here it tolde them that they sholde than eate his flessh, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his flessh were so far absent from them, than to here it told
<pb facs="tcp:13170:188"/>
them that they sholde eate it whyle it were present wyth them / and not say it sholde than more offende theym to eate it. For they shall not be offended with the eatynge yf they eate it not. And therfore (yf he can tell how to speke and expresse his owne mynde) he meneth here whyle he sayth it shal more offend you to eate it, he meneth I saye that they sholde of reason thynke his flesshe than more lothely to eate after his gloriouse ascencyon, than it was ere he dyed. Thus it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth that mayster Masker ment. And veryly yf he so mene, he hath a madde menynge. And yf he mene not so: than hath he a madde maner of spekynge. And yet hysyde that hys menynge is as madde that waye as the tother.</p>
               <p>¶ For as I haue shewed you, the thyng is no more impossible to Crist,
<pb n="clxix" facs="tcp:13170:188"/>
to geue them his body to eate after his ascensyon than byfore / and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is maister Masker a fole to say, that it sholde more offende them to here that they sholde eate it after his ascencyon than before.

               <p>Here is lo the conclusyon of all hys sermon.</p>
               <p>¶ Many a fonde processe haue I redde good chrysten readers, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer redde I neyther a more folysshe nor a more false than this is. For the effecte and the purpose of al this pro cesse is, that Chryst in all his wordes spoken in thys syxte chapiter of saint Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ment nothynge of the eatyng of his blessed body in the blessed sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but onely of an alle gorycal eatynge of his body / by whyche he ment onely that they sholde byleue that he sholde be crucyfyed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> shedde his bloude and dye for redempcyon of the worlde.</p>
               <p>¶ Now that our saniour bysyde al such allegories &amp; other spirituall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dings, playnely ment of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very
<pb facs="tcp:13170:192"/>
eatyng of his blessed body in the bles sed sacrament, you haue good reders all redy sene by so many holy doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and sayntes / whose playn wor des I haue rehersed you, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can dowte but that in the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusyon of his argument and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posycyon, mayster <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>¶ But now thys false conclusyon of hys, how febly and how folyshely he defendeth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is euyn a very great pleasure to se.</p>
               <p>¶ In this processe hath he. ii. poynts The fyrste is that Chryste coulde &amp; wolde haue made it open and playne in thys place by clere and euydent worde, yf he had ment of the eatynge of his flesshe in the sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="clxxiii" facs="tcp:13170:192"/>The second is, that by these wordꝭ <q>It is the spyryte that geueth lyfe, my fleshe profyteth nothynge at all, The wordes that I haue spoken to you be spyryte and lyfe:</q> Chryste doth playn and clerely declare, both that he ment not the eatynge of his flesshe in the sa crament, and also that he ment onely the bylyefe that he sholde dye for the synne of the worlde.</p>
               <p>¶ Now touchynge his fyrste folysh poynt, I haue confuted it all redy, &amp; shewed you some samples, where Chryste coulde at some tyme haue declared the mater mych more open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than he dyd, and that in great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our fayth.</p>
               <p>For I thynke the sacrament of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tysme, is a pryncypall poynt of our fayth. And yet Chryste taught not Nichodemus all that he coulde haue tolde hym therin as I sayd before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13170:193"/>¶ And longeth it nothyng to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fayth to byleue the remyssyon of mortall sinnes? I suppose yes. And yet could Chryste yf he had wolde, haue decla red more clerely those worde of his,<note place="margin">Matth. 12</note> who so blaspheme the sone of man it shalbe forgeuen hym. But he that blasphemeth the holy gooste, it shall neyther be forgeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him in this world nor in the world to come.</p>
               <p>¶ No good chrysten man thynketh other, but that it is a pryncypall arty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the chrysten fayth, to byleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chryst is one equale god with his father. And yet Chryste (albe it that by all places sette togyther, he hath declared it clere inough in conclusion, to them that wyll not be wylfull &amp; contencyouse) yet dyd he not in euery place where he spake therof, declare the mater so clerely as he could haue done yf he than hadde wolde. whiche
<pb n="clxxiiii" facs="tcp:13170:193"/>
appereth by that that in some other places, he declared it more clerely af ter. And yet in all the places of the scrypture set togyther, he hath not, nor wolde not, declare it in so playne wordes / as he coulde haue done. For than sholde there neuer haue neded any of those comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, that all the holy doctours haue made vppon it synnys. And surely so sayth Luther and these other heretykes, that there neded none. For all the scrypture (they saye) is open &amp; playne inough. And therfore they put euery manne and woman vnlerned in boldenesse and corage, to be in the scrypture suf ficyently theyr owne maysters them selfe. But whyle they thus teache them, they forgete that by theyr own techyng they shold holde theyr peace the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selfe. And indede so were it good they dyd, but yf they taught better.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13170:194"/>¶ And thus for his fyrst poynt; you se good readers that mayster Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker maketh men perceyue hym for a dowble fole whan it was not inough for hym to come forth with this foly onys, but he muste a goddes name brynge in this his one foly twyse.</p>

my fleshe profyteth nothynge at all, hath not one playne word for his pur pose at all. For all the vttermost that he coulde take of these wordes, were no more but that Chryste sholde tell them that the spyryte is the thynge that geueth his flesshe the lyfe, with out whiche of it selfe it coulde not profyte them at all / and therfore the wordes that he spake were spyryte &amp; lyfe, and to be vnderstanden spyry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, that they sholde eate his flesh wyth hys spyryte, and not carnally that they sholde eate hys flessh alone without his spyryte, cut out in dede peces of flesshe, as they had concey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a fonde opinion therof, out of whyche he sayed all this to brynge them, but yet not so mych as he could haue sayd and he had wold, nor wold not bycause of theyr vnworthynesse to here it / and yet that they shold eate

And by may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Maskers owne argument yf he had ment y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> way, as he well could, so he wold also haue told them playnly thus: Sirs I mene not that you shal eate my flessh, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you shall byleue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I shall dye for your synnys. And syth he sayd not thus, mayster Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers own argument hath cutte of his cable rope, &amp; lost his anchore, &amp; runne his shyppe hym self agaynst a rocke.

For neyther whan our lorde sayde he was a very vyne, nor whan he sayde he was the dore / there was none that herde hym that any thynge meruay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therof.

But whan he sayd that his flesh was very mete, and his blood was very drynke, and that they shold not haue lyfe in them but yf they dyd eate his flesshe and drynke his blood / than were they all moste all in suche a wonder therof, that they could not abyde.

of the behauour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> herers, it might well appere that there was greate dyfference in the spekynge / and that the tother two were well perceyued to be spoken onely by waye of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorye, and the thyrde to be spoken of his very flesshe in dede / where as Fryth helde opinion y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thys was none otherwyse spoken, but onely by way of an allegorye as the tother twayne were.</p>
            <p>¶ Now good readers, yf you reade my wordes agayne, &amp; in euery place of them where I write they meruey led, it wolde lyke you to put out that worde they merueysed, and set in this worde, they murmured, in the stede therof: ye shall frnde no chaunge made in the mater, by that chaunge made in the wordes. But you shal se myne argument shal stand as strong with that worde, They murmured /

For though they vnder stode hym ryght, in that they percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that he spake of the very eatyng of his very fleshe: yet they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stode hym wronge, in that they toke hym that they shold eate it in the self flesshely forme &amp; in dede pyeces with out lyfe or spyryte / and therfore they went theyr waye from hym and lefte hym, and walked no more after with hym.

               <p>¶ The fyrst is that I muste proue it hym, that the body of Chryste is

For is mayster Maskar nor father Frith byfore hym, bounden to byleue no more, than mayster More were able to proue them?

               <p>¶ Nowe as for the thyrde poynte, mayster maskar toucheth, in whiche he wyl allowe for no suffycient ꝓfe myne owne vnwryten dremys, he ge ueth my dremys I thanke hym of his courtesye, myche more authoryte than euer I loked for. For whyle he reiecteth none of theym, but suche as are vnwryten, he she weth hym selfe redy to byleue them, yf I wold
<pb n="vccxx" facs="tcp:13170:244"/>
vouchesaufe to wryte them.</p>
               <p>¶ In the fonrth point he promiseth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yf I do by expresse wordes of scry<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pture proue that it is so: tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (though yt be aboue the reche of his reason) yet wyl he by belyefe, both reche yt, and receyue yt, &amp; hold it fast to. Wold god mayster Maskar wolde abyd by this worde. For now I aske hym a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayn, whyther he wyl be content, yf I proue it him by expresse wordes of some one of the foure euangelystes. And if he be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with expresse wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of any one, than will I do more for hym, proue yt by all foure.</p>
               <p>¶ For saynte Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reherseth, that our sauyour sayd hym selfe he wold geue theym his fleshe to eate. And that he ment of the sacramente, you se all redy proued here byfore.</p>
               <p>And the tother thre reherse, that Chryste sayde hym selfe whan he
<pb facs="tcp:13170:245"/>
gaue theym the sacrament, thys is my body that shal be broken for you. What wordes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there be more playn and expresse than these?</p>
               <p>¶ But here sayth mayster Maskar that these be not expresse wordes. For he sayth that these wordes be spoken but by way of allegory. And he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it as Frith doth, by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our sauiour sayd of hym self, I am the dore, and I am the vyne.</p>
               <p>¶ Nowe remember good readers, that master Maskar bylyed me right nowe, and sayd that all my second ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was, a posse ad esse, it may be so, ergo yt is so. But now consyder good christen reders your selfe, why ther this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his be not a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se ad esse in dede. For by those placꝭ, I am the dore, and I am the vyne, and suche other: he concludeth that these other places of eatynge hys
<pb n="ccxxvi" facs="tcp:13170:245"/>
fleshe and geuynge of hys bodye, was spoken by an allegorye to.</p>
               <p>And howe concludeth he that yt ys so? but bycause yt maye be so.</p>
               <p>And thus ye se good readers, that the selfe same kynde of arguynge which mayster Maskar fayneth hym selfe to fynd with me, &amp; falsely belyeth me therin (for I neded there none other thynge to do, but answere the thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that Fryth layed forthe agaynst the catholyque fayth) the selfe same kynde of arguynge I saye mayster Maskar vseth hym selfe / and so dothe yonge father Fryth hys felow in folye to.</p>
               <p>¶ But than agayne whan they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus, These places maye be so vnderstanden by an allegorye onely, as those other places be, ergo they be to be so vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>den in dede: I haue proued alredy that his ente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is false, and that they maye not be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standen

in an allegory onely as the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be / but the playne and open diffe rence betwene the places appere vp pon the cyrcumstaunces of the texte.

               <p>¶ And all the countreys chrystened can also testyfye, that god hathe hym self by manyfold ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miracles, playn &amp; expressely declared for the blessid sa crament, that this is the trewe fayth which mayster Maskar here oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth / and that god hath by those myra cles expowned his own wordes hym self, to be playne &amp; expressely spoken for our part. ¶ And therfore nowe good christen reders, yf mayster mas kar wil make any more stickyng with vs, &amp; not grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Christes wordes for playn &amp; expresse / &amp; accordynge to hys promyse, reche &amp; receyue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trew faith &amp; hold it faste to: ye may playne &amp; ex pressely tel him, there shal neuer trew man, trust his false promyse after.</p>
               <p>

               <p>¶ Now haue you so good chrysten readers herde a very specyall piece, wherin mayster masker (as you se)

symplest man or woman in a towne, to mayntayne that god maye do this thyng or that (namely the thyng that god hath sayed hym selfe he doth) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste hym that is so folyshe as to presume, agaynst the playne worde of god, to determine by his own blind reason the contrary / &amp; specyally syth the thynge is suche in dede, as though god had not spoken therof, yet had he none holde to say that god coulde not do it, for as myche as it implyeth no suche repugnau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as shold make the thynge impossyble vnto god.</p>
               <p>¶ But now se ferther good reders the wysedome and the mekenesse of mayster Masker here. which as sone as he hath scant fynysshed his hygh solempne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of me; for suche disputyng of godde almighty power, that I sayd he was in dede so mighty that he coulde do the thynge that we
<pb n="ccxxxvi" facs="tcp:13170:256"/>
dysputed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agaynst hym that sayd nay, falleth hym selfe forth with in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same fawte that he fyndeth / and yet not in the same fawte (for the fawte that he founde was none) but in the fawte that he wolde seme to fynde. For he dysputeth and taketh the part agaynst goddes almyghty power in dede / and argueth as you se that god in dede can not do it.</p>
               <p>¶ And this poynt he argueth in such maner fashyon, that in my syfe I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sawe so folyshe an argument, so solempnely set vp an hygh. Fyrste he maketh his reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus. It is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glory of the godhed and appopryed onely therunto, to be present and to fyll all places at onys, essencially, presently, with his almyghty power / and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed to any creature. But Chrystes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> is a creature. Ergo it can not haue this glory that is appropryed to the godhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13170:257"/>¶Here is a wise argument. God hath many gloryes. And his chyefe glory standeth not in beyng presente at onys essencyally in euery place.</p>
               <p>And though he wyl not geue his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from hym, yet of his glory he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth many creaturs in many greate partes of it, to be partiners with him It is one parte of his glory to lyue &amp; endure in eternall blysse / &amp; though no creature be without begynnynge, yet maketh he many a thowsande posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of ioy without endynge.</p>
               <p>¶ How proueth mayster masker y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to be present at onys in all places, is such a kynde of glory so appropred vnto god, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god can not geue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> gyfte to any creature. The scrypture se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to appropre vnto god alone, the knowledge of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes secrete thought. And yet can I not se but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god might geue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> knowlege to some creature to

and yet abyde god styll hym selfe.</p>

               <head>The. xiiii. chapyter.</head>
               <p>THan maketh mayster Maskar an other argument, wherwyth he wolde as it semeth somwhat stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth the fyrst, as yt hath of trouth no lytle nede, beynge as yt is so feble of yt selfe.</p>
               <p>¶ His other argument therfore is (as you haue herd) this. what thyng so euer is euery where after the sayd maner, that muste nedes be infynyte withoute be gynnynge and ende. It muste be one, and alone, and almygh tye. Whyche propertees are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryed vnto the gloryouse maieste of the godhed. But Chrystes manhed ys not suche (as hym selfe wytnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth in holy scrypture) ergo his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed can not be in all or in many places at ones.</p>
               <p>¶Fyrste (that we labour not about
<pb facs="tcp:13170:258"/>
noughte) we muste consyder what mayster Maskar meaneth by these wordes, <hi>after the sayde maner.</hi> He sayde you wote well in the tother ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument before, that the glory of god, is to be present, and to fyll all places at ones, essentyally, presently, with hys almyghtye power. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whan he saythe nowe, what so euer thynge is euery where at ones after the sayde maner, he meaneth (you se well) present, and fyllynge all places at ones, essencyally, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, wyth his almyghtye power.</p>
               <p>¶I let passe here his word present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whose presence nedeth not in that place for ought that I can se. For whan he sayd byfore, present and fyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge all places at ones essentyally: his other worde presently may take his leue and be absent wel ynough. For howe can he be present &amp; essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyally
<pb n="ccxxxviii" facs="tcp:13170:258"/>
fyll the place, and not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? But nowe whan he sayeth <hi>by hys almyghtye power:</hi> what ys thys to the mater? For yt is ynough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste hym, yf any creature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be present in euery place at ones, and essencyally fyl the place / not by hys owne almyghtye power, but by the almyghty power of god / and yet not so fyll the place neyther, but that yt maye haue a nother wysh yt in the same place. For I trowe he wyl not denye, but that there be many crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in those places, whyche god wyth his owne presence essencyally fylleth full.</p>
               <p>¶ Therefore as for these wordes <hi>ofter the sayde maner</hi> whyche he putteth in to make vs amased: mayster Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kar must put out again. Now y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being put out, reherse &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>syder wel master maskars argument, what thynge so
<pb facs="tcp:13170:259"/>
euer is in euery place at ones, that thynge muste nedes be infynyte with out begynnynge and ende / it must be one, and alone, and almyghty / which propretyes are appropryed to the gloryouse maiestie of the godhed.</p>
               <p>But the manhed of Chryste is a cre ature and not god: ergo Chrystes manhed can not be in all places or in many places at ones.</p>
               <p>And yet consyder here that though he leue oute that odyouse worde: yet muste his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusyon be indede, that god ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not make yt so, as you se plain by his begynnyng, where he she weth that yt implyeth repugnaunce, &amp; that therfore god can not do yt.</p>
               <p>¶ Now good readers consyder wel his fyrste proposycyon, whyche we call the maior, that is to wyt that god can not make any thynge created to be euery where at ones. Let vs
<pb n="ccxxxix" facs="tcp:13170:259"/>
pray hym to proue yt, and geue hym one yeres leysour to yt. But here he taketh vppon hym to proue yt, and layeth for the reason, that god ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not make any creature to be in all pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces at ones, bycause yt shold than be infynyte, and therby god almyghties mate and hygh felow. Lette hym as I say proue vs this in two yere, that yt sholde than be infynyte, wythoute begynnynge, and wythout ende, and almyghty. In good fayth eyther am I very dull, or elles doth mayster Maskar tel vs here in a very madde tale.</p>
               <p>¶ I thynke he wyll not denye, but that god whyche coulde make all this worlde, heuen, and erthe, and all the creatures y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he created therin, coulde yf yt so had pleased hym, haue crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely one man, and let all the re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manaunt alone vncreated, and haue
<pb facs="tcp:13170:260"/>
kept hym styll, and neuer haue made heuen nor erth nor none other thyng, but onely that one man alone. The soule nowe that than hadde ben crea ted in that man, hadde yt not than ben in all places at ones? I suppose yes. For there hadde bene no mo places than that mannys bodye / and therein hadde there ben many placesin many diuerse partes of the man / in all why che that soule sholde haue bene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at ones, and the whole soule in euery parte of all those places at ones. For so is euery soule in euery mannes bodye nowe. And yet hadde that soule not ben infynyte, no more than euery soule is now.</p>
               <p>¶ If god wolde nowe (as yf he wolde he coulde) create a newe spy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte that sholde fulfyll all the whole worlde heuyn and erthe and all, as myche as euer ys created, that in
<pb n="ccxl" facs="tcp:13170:260"/>
suche wyse sholde be whole present at ones in euery parte of the worlde, as the soule is in euery parte of a man, and yet sholde not be the soule of the worlde: I wyll here aske may ster Maskar, were that newe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted spyryte infynyte? If he answere me naye: than hathe he soyled hys owne wyse reason hym selfe. For thanne no more were the manhed of Chryste, though yt were present in all those places of the whole world at ones. If he answere me ye: than syth that spyryte were no more infynyte than the worlde ys, wyth in the lymytes and boundes wherof yt were conteyned, yt wolde folowe therof, that the worlde were infy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyte all redye, whyche is false.</p>
               <p>And also yf yt were trewe, thanne wold yt folow by mayster Maskers reason, that god almyghtye hadde
<pb facs="tcp:13170:261"/>
a mache all redy, that is to wyt a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thyng infynyte besyde hym self, whyche is the inconuenience that ma keth mayster Maskar afferme yt for impossyble, that god coulde make Chrystes manhed to be in all places at ones.</p>
               <p>¶ Thus you se good readers vpon what wyse grounde mayster Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kar hath here concluded, that god can not make Chrystes bodye to be in all places at ones.</p>
               <p>¶ But yet is yt a worlde to consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how madly the man concludeth. His conclusion is this ye wote wel, <hi>Wherfore Chrystes body can not be in all places, or in many places at ones.</hi> All his reason ye wote well goth vppon beynge in all places at ones, bycause that therup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon wolde yt by his wyse reason fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that yt shold be infynyte. And nowe is that poynte of trouthe no
<pb n="ccxli" facs="tcp:13170:261"/>
parte of our mater. For we saye not that Chrystes bodye is in all places at ones, but in heuyn, and in suche places as the blessed sacramente ys. And therfore where as his reason goeth nothynge agaynste beynge in many places at ones, but onely agaynste beynge at ones in all places: he concludeth sodaynely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste beynge in many places, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde whyche conclusyon no pyece of his premisses hadde any maner of mocyon. And so in all this his hygh solemne argument, and his farre fet reason, neyther is his maior trew, nor his argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t toucheth not the mater, nor his premysses any thynge proue his conclusyon. And yet after thys goodly reasonyng of his, he reioyceth in his harte hyghly to se how iolyly he hathe handeled yt, and sayeth,</p>
               <p>Here yt is playne that all thynges that More yma

               <p>God promysed and swore that all nacyons shuld be blessed in the deth of that promysed sede whych was Chryste: god had determyned and decreed yt before the world was made: ergo Cryste must nedys haue dyed / and to expowne this worde oportet as More mynseth it.

               <p>¶ Now good chrysten readers here youse, that in his shyft that he vseth, where he sayeth that he wyl byleue any one text trewly taken: we bryng hym for the trew takyng vppon our parte, all these thynges that I haue here shortely rehersed you / of whych thynges hym selfe denyeth very

And the holy counsayles of Chrystes chyrche he casseth the Anti chrysten synagoge. And goddes my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles both fryth and he be fayne to cal the workes of the deuyl.</p>
               <p>And therfore good chrysten readers, whyle you se all thys: ye se well ynough that the textes of the gospell whyche we saye for the blessed bodye of Chryste in the blessed sacrament,
<pb n="cclv" facs="tcp:13170:275"/>
be clere and playne for the purpose / and mayster Maskar wyll not agre yt so, but sayth that we take theym not trewly, onely bycause he will not perceyue and confesse the trouth.</p>
               <p>¶ Nowe where as mayster Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kar sayth of me ferther thus.</p>
               <p>As for his vnwryten verytees, and thou foryfe of hys Antichrysten synagoge, vnto whyche the scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture forsaken he is now at laste wyth shame ynough compelled to fle: they be proued starke lyes and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deuylrye.</p>
               <p>¶ Consyder good chrysten readers that in these wordes mayster maskar telleth you two thynges. Fyrste that I am wyth shame ynough com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to fle fro the scrypture to myn vnwryten veryties, and to thautho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte of thantichrysten synagoge, by whyche he meaneth the tradycyons and the determynacyons of the catho lyque chyrche.</p>
               <p>The tother that the tradycyons and
<pb facs="tcp:13170:276"/>
determinacyons of the chyrch, be all redy proued starke lyes and very de uylrye. For the fyrste poynte you sethat in this mater of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sacrament, whyche ys one of the thynges that he meaneth, he hath not yet compelled me to fle fro the scrypture. For I haue wel all redye proued you this poynt, &amp; very playn and clerely, by the selfe same place of scrypture, whyche mayster Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kar hathe expowned &amp; falsely wolde wreste it a nother way, that is to wyt the wordes of Chryst wryten in the syxt chapyter of saynt Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>Nowe yf I do for the profe of thys poynte, say the tradycyon of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole catholyque chyrche besyde, whyche thynge ys also suffycyent to proue the mater alone: ys that a fleynge fro the scrypture?</p>
               <p>If that be a fleynge fro the scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="cclvi" facs="tcp:13170:276"/>
than myghte the olde herety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques very wel haue sayde the same vnto al the olde holy doctours, that this new heretyque sayeth nowe to me. For this woteth wel euery man (that any lernynge hathe) that those old holy doctours and sayntes, layed agaynste those old heretykes not the scrypture onely, but also the tradycy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnwryten, byleued and taughte by the chyrche. And yf mayster Mas kar whan he shal defende hys boke, dare denye me that they so dyd: I shall brynge you so many playn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues therof, that be he neuer so shame lesse he shal be ashamed thereof.</p>
               <p>And he can not say naye but that they so dyd, as I wote wel he can not: than you se wel good reders y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by ma ster maskers wise reason, those old he retikes might haue sayd agaynst eche of those old holy doctours &amp; saits as
<pb facs="tcp:13170:277"/>
mayster Maskar sayth agaynste me now, that they hadde made him with shame ynough, fle fro the scrypture, bycause he besyde the scrypture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the trew faith and reproued their false heresyes, by thauthoryte of the catholyque chyrche. Suche strength haue alwaye so, mayster mayhers ar gumentes.</p>
               <p>¶ Nowe touchyng the secund point, where he calleth the catholyke chyrch the antichrysten synagoge, and the vn wryten veryties starke lyes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uylrye: he hathe al redy shewed and declared partely which thynges they be that hym self meaneth by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> name. For he hath before specyfyed purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye, pylgrimages, and prayenge to sayntes, honourynge of ymages, and crepynge to the crosse, and halo wyng of belles agaynst euyl spirites in tem pestes, and boughes on palme sone
<pb n="cclvii" facs="tcp:13170:277"/>
daye, and byleuynge in the blessed sa crament. And Tyndale that ys ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hym selfe or his felow, mocketh vnder the same name the sacrament of anelyng / and calleth the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of consyrmacyon the butterynge of the boyes forhed, &amp; had as lyefe haue at his chrystenynge sande put in hys mouth as salt / and mocketh mych at fastyng. And as for lent, father frith vnder name of Bright well in the re uesacyon of Antichrist calleth it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishe fast / which ieste was vndouted ly reueled father fryth by the spyryt of the deuyll hym selfe, the spirituall father of Antichryste.</p>
               <p>¶ So that you maye se good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that to saye the latenye, or our ladye matens, and crepe to the crosse at Ester, or praye for all christen sou les: these thynges &amp; such other as I haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

that yf men wolde denye the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syon of the brede and wyne into the blessed bodye and blood of Chryste, bycause that vnto his owne reason the thynge semeth to implye repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, he shal fynde many other thynges bothe in scrypture, and in na ture, and in hande craftes to, of the trouthe wherof he nothynge dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, whyche yet for any solucion that hys owne reason coulde fynde, other than the omnipotent power of god, wolde seme repugnant to / of whych maner thynges, other good holy do, ctours haue in the mater of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed sacrament vsed some ensamples byfore.</p>
               <p>¶ Nowe for as myche as in these wordes I speke of the apperynge of the face in the glasse, and one face in euery pyece of the glasse bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in to twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty: mayster Maskar hath

               <p>Then sayth he, that ye wote wel that many good folke haue vsed in thys mater many good frutefull ex samples of goddes other workes: not onely myra cles, wryten in scrypture / vnde versus? (where one I praye ye?) But also done by the comen course of na ture here in erth. (If they be done by the come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> course of nature: so be they no myracles) And some thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges made also by mans hande. As one face beholden in dyuerse glasses: and in euery pyece of one glasse broke into twenty &amp;c. Lorde howe thys pontyfy call poete playeth hys parte.

But I aske More / when he seeth his owne face in so many glasses / whyther all those faces that appere in the glasses be hys own very face hauynge boldely substaunce skynne, fleshe, and bone, as hathe that face / whyche hathe hys very mouth, nose, yien &amp;c. wherwyth he faceth vs oute the trouthe thus falsely wyth lyes? and yf they be al hys very faces / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in very dede there ys one body in many places / &amp; he hym selfe beareth as many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in one hoode.

euen as they be no very faces / nor those so many voy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, sownes, and symylytudes multyplyed in the ayer betwene the glasse or other obiecte and the body (as the phylosopher proueth by naturall reason) be no very bodyes: no more is yt Chrystes very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye, as they wolde make the byleue in the brede in so many places at ones:</p>

               <p>I wote well that many good folke haue vsed in this mater many good frutefull examples of goddes other workes, not onely myracles wryten in scrypture, but also done by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men course of nature here in erth and some thynges made also by mannys hand as one face byholden in dyuers glasses &amp; in euery pyece of one glasse
<pb facs="tcp:13170:280"/>
broken into. xx. and the merueyle of the makynge of the glasse it selfe such mater as it is made of. And of one worde comyng whole to an hundred earys at onys and the syghte of one lytell eye present and beholdynge an whole great cuntrey at onys wyth a thousande such other merueyles mo, such as those that se them dayly done and therfore merueyle not at theym, shall yet neuer be able no not thys yonge man hym selfe, to geue suche reason by what meane they maye be done / but that he maye haue such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnaunce layed agaynste it that he shall be fayne in conclusyon for the chyefe and the moste euydent reason to say that the cause of all those thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges is bycause god that hath caused theym so to be done, is almyghty of hym selfe and canne do what hym lyste.</p>
               <p>¶ Lo good Chrysten readers here you se your selse, that I made none
<pb n="cclx" facs="tcp:13170:280"/>
suche argument as mayster Maskar bereth me in hand. Nor no man vseth vppon a symilytude, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarye consequence, in the mater of the blessed sacrament / vnto whyche we can brynge nothynge so lyke, but that in dede it muste be farre vnlyke, sauynge that it is as semeth me some what lyke in this, that god is as able by his almyghty power, to make one body be in twenty places at ones, as he is by come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> course of nature which hym self hath made, able to make one face kepynge styll hys owne fygure in hys owne place, caste yet and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>typly the same fygure of yt self, into xx. pyeces of one broken glasse / of whyche pyeces eche hathe a seuerall place. And as he is able by the nature that hym selfe made, to make one self worde that the speker hath brethed oute in the spekynge to be forth with
<pb facs="tcp:13170:281"/>
in the eares of an whole hundred per sones, eche of theym occupyeng a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall place, and that a good dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce a sundre. Of whyche two thynges (as natural and as comen as they both be) yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I neuer cease to wonder, for all the reasons that euer I redde of the phylopher. And lyke wyse as I veryly truste, that the tyme shall come, whan we shall in the clere syght of Christe godhed, se this great myracle soyled, and wel perceyue howe yt ys, and howe yt maye be, that his blessed bodye ys bothe in beuyn and in erth, and in so many places at ones: so thynke I veryly that in the syght of hys god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed than, we shall also perceyue a better cause of those two other thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges than euer any phylolopher hath hytherto shewed vs yet / or ellys I wene for my parte I shall neuer
<pb n="cclxi" facs="tcp:13170:281"/>
perceyue theym well.</p>
               <p>¶ But nowe where as mayster Maskar mocketh myne argument, not whych I made, but whyche hym selfe maketh in my name / and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth yt feble for the nonce, that he maye whan he hathe made yt at hys owne pleasure soyle yt, as chyldren make castelles of tyle shardes, and than make theym theyr passe tyme in the throwynge downe agayne: yet is yt not euyn so, so feble as his own, where he argueth in the negatyue, as I saye the sample for thaffyrma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyue. For as for the tone that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for me: though thargument be nought for sacke of forme, yet hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it somwhat so so, by the mater in that the consequent that is to wytte, that god may make one body to be at ones in many places, is what so euer mayster masker bable, a trouth with
<pb facs="tcp:13170:282"/>
out questyon necessary.</p>
               <p>¶ But where he argueth for hym selfe in the negatyue, by that that the bodyly substaunce of the face is not in the glasse, that therfore the bodyly substaunce of our sauyoure Chryste is not in the blessed sacrament: that argument hath no maner holde at all. For thantecedent is very trewe / and (excepte goddys worde be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trewe) ellys as I haue all redy by the old holy expositours of the same, well and planely proued you, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent is very false.</p>
               <p>¶ Now yf he wyll saye that he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not that argument, but vseth onely the face in the glasse for a sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple &amp; a symylytude: than he she weth hym selfe to playe the false shrewe, whan of my bryngynge in the selfe same sample, he maketh that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for me. And therfore now wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="cclxii" facs="tcp:13170:282"/>
vppon those facys in the glasse, he maketh and faceth hym selfe that lye vppon me, and than scoffeth that I face out the trouth with lyes, and tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proueth neuer one: he doth but shew what prety wordes he coulde speke, and how properly he coulde scoffe, yf the mater wolde serue hym.</p>
               <p>¶ And yet I pray you good readers consyder well the wordes of that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that he maketh in myne name. <hi>we se many faces in many glasses: therfore may one body be in many places.</hi> Now spake not I you wote well of many faces sene in many glassys (as he bothe falsely &amp; folysshely reherseth me) but of one face sene at onys in many glassys.</p>
               <p>For that is lyke to the mater. For like as all those glasses, whyle onely one man loketh in them / he seeth but hys owne one face in all those places / so be (as saynt Chrysostom declareth)
<pb facs="tcp:13170:283"/>
all the hostes of the blessed sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t beynge in so farre dystaunt seuerall places a sondre, all one very body of our blessed sauyour hym selfe, and all one hoste, one sacryfyce, and one oblacyon.</p>
               <p>¶ And as properly as mayster mas ker scoffeth at that sample and symy sytude of the glasse: I wolde not haue mysse lyked myne owne wytte therin, yf thinuencyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof had ben myne owne. For I fynde not many samples so mete for the mater, to the capacite of good and vnlerned folke, as it is. For as for the poynt of which mayster Masker maketh all the dyf ficultye, that one substaunce beynge but a creature myghte be in many places at onys: euery man that is lerned seeth a sample that satisfyeth hym shortely. For he seeth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth by good reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the soule
<pb n="cclxiii" facs="tcp:13170:283"/>
is vndiuisyble and is in euery parte of the body, and in euery parte it is whole. And yet is euery member a seuerall place. And so is the blessed substaunce of the spyrytuall body of Chrystes flesshe &amp; his bonys, whole in euery parte of the sacrament.</p>
               <p>¶ But thys sample of the soule can not euery man vnserned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue and imagyne ryghte / but of the glasse bath for his capacite a more me tely symisitude, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in one poynt also doth more resemble the mater. For the soule forsaketh euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is clene deuided from the body. But the blessed body of our sauyour abydeth styll whole in euery parte of the blessed sacrament, though it be broken into neuer so many places / as the image and forme of the face avy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth whole styll to hym that byhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, in euery parte of the broken
<pb facs="tcp:13170:284"/>
glasse. And thus good readers as for thys sample and symylytude of the face in the glasse, mayster Masker maye for his folyshe facynge yt out, be myche ashamed yf he haue any shame, whan so euer he loketh on his owne face in the glasse.</p>
               <p>¶ And for conclusyon, thys beynge of the body of Chryste in dyuers pla ces at ones, syth the olde holy doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and sayntes sawe and percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the soule of euery man why che is a very substaunce, and perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture yet of lesse spirituall power, than the flesshe and bones of our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyour Chryste be now, and yet very flesshe for all that and very bonys also styll: they rekened not that the beynge therof in dyuers places at ones, wolde after theyr dayes begyn to be taken for so straunge and harde a thynge as these heretykes make yt
<pb n="cclxiiii" facs="tcp:13170:284"/>
nowe. And therfore they made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng so great a mater of that poynt / but the thynge that they thought men wolde moste meruayse of, was the conuersyon and turnyng of the brede and the wyne into Chrystes very flesshe and bloud. And therfore to make that poynte well open, and to make it synke into mennys brestes: those olde holy doctours and sayntes (as I sayde in these wordes whyche maister maskar mocketh) vsed many mo good samples of thynges done by nature.</p>
               <p>¶ But than were they no myracles sayth mayster Masker. And what than good master Masker? Myghte they not'serue to proue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god myght do as mych by myracle, as nature by her comen course? Those wordes so were by maister masker (you se wel) very well and wysely put in.</p>

And that I ment not in those wordes, to saye myne owne selfe that saynte Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spake nothynge therof: I declare playnely there forthwyth, by that I shew the cause why Tyndale can not say that saynt Iohu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spake any thynge of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at all, that is to wyt bycause that al his sect expressely denyeth, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thynge was ment of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the wordes of Chryste wryten in the. vi. chapyter of saynt Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>¶ By this ye may se playnely good readers, that mayster Maskar playn ly belyeth me.

in that poynt, coulde not saye y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saynt Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spake any thyng therof.

of them that dyd as he doth now after wicliffe, Ecolampadius, Tyndale, &amp; Sutnglius, denye the lyterall sence / and say that Chryste ment not that it was his very body &amp; hys very bloud in dede / but the olde holy doctours &amp; exposytours bysyde all suche allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes, do playnely declare &amp; expoune, that in those wordes our sauyour as he expressely spake, so dyd also well and playnely mene, that the thynge whych he there gaue to his discyples in the sacrament, was in very dede hys very flesh and bloud. And so dyd neuer any of the olde exposytours of scrypture expowne any of those other places in whyche Chryste is called a vyne or a dore.

               <p>But it is suche as he lysted lytle to loke vppon. For where as he maketh mych a do to haue it seme that bothe these wordes of our sauyour at hys laste souper, thys is my body, and his wordes of eatynge of his fleshe, and drynkynge of his bloude, wryten in the syxte chapyter of saynte Iohu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sholde be spoken in a lyke phrase and maner of spekyng, as were his other wordes, I am the dore and I am the very vyne: I shewed there vnto Fryth (whome mayster masker ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth as though he wolde defende) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by thexposycyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of all the olde holy doctours &amp; saynte y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue expowned all those. iiii. place before, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce well appereth, syth none of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare hym to be a very material dore,

But that in the sacrament is his very naturall body, his very flesshe and his bloude, this declare clerely all the olde holy exposytours of the scrypture, whiche were good men and gracyouse, wysw and well lerned bothe. And therfore as I sayd the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may sone be perceyued, but yf mayster masker lyste better to byleue hym self than all them. which yf he do (as in dede he doth) than is he myche <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
