         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="2">2. In our walk we muſt propound to our ſelves this likewiſe, to help forward the ſalvation of our brethren, by exhortation, example, or what way providence offereth; after the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> preſident. It's a vain imagination of thoſe who conceive <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 22.</note> that we muſt walk only to our own ends and intereſts, to our own honour, vain pleaſure, obſervance of carnall friends, with neglect of the Saints, and their common cauſe: Woe be to ſuch a man, when his Maſter cometh, and ſhall finde him ſo walking. It's one of the ſaddeſt ſpectacles our times preſents us with, and which doth threaten and may draw down a greater judgement then we are aware of, that men will not walk nor ſtirre one foot (be the affair of never ſo great importance to the publike,) unleſſe the golden ball run before them. I have read of a bloud-ſtone, which having an excellent quality to ſtanch bloud, the Jewellers ſay, it ſeldome or never exerts <note place="margin">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114087:13"/>
be poorly helped, perhaps rather miſchieved by them.</p>
            <p>Another object in our walk, we are to look on; is Gods likeneſſe, that we may come as fully up to it, as poſſible. We are children of a <hi>holy</hi> and heavenly father, and endeavour to bear his image; that as when the queſtion was, <hi>whoſe is this</hi>

But alas that evil which a father complain'd of in his time, is too rife among us, <hi>Omnes ad Deum, pauci poſt Deum ir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is another mark on which we muſt ſet our eies, in this walk, <hi>viz,</hi> to aſcertain our ſelves that we are in Chriſt, and ſo ſhall with him partake of future glory; which is that very leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſo plainly teacheth the Saints. Although <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 11.</note> (as the learned <hi>Zanchius</hi> obſerves) holineſſe and good works are not requiſite <hi>ad promerendam,</hi> that we can by them merit everlaſting happineſſe, yet <hi>ad poſſidendem vitam aeternam,</hi> they are neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The increaſe of grace received (in this walk we now treat of) is alſo carefully to be looked unto; and is one end that in our heavenly courſe we muſt aim at. You know diverſe after ſickneſſe by moderate walking do get ſtrength: uſe hands (we ſay) and have hands; its a very uſefull leſſon that of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying graces, philoſophicall habits are augmented by putting them forth into exerciſe, and the ſpirituall endowments God vouchſafeth us, if we ſuffer not, what we have received, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair <note place="margin">Gen 5. 24. vvith Heb. 11. 5.</note> by diſuſe, will receive much advantage; if we would learn with <hi>Henock, to walk with God,</hi> I doubt not but we ſhould gain much ſtrength by that divine exerciſe of ſpirituall walking.</p>

Well then, I ſay unto thee my Lord, parſon, and vicar, thou doeſt wrong, to have perſonages and vicarages, to have the tenth pig, the tenth lamb, gooſe, fleece, and ſo of all other things, ſeeing that thou art no Miniſter nor no prieſt of Chriſts Church; teach, nor do any office of a parſon or of a vicar, but polle and pille. What canſt thou ſay of thy ſelf my Lord parſon and vicar? thou wilt ſay peradventure, the King gave me the abbey and all that belongeth thereto, which had then given him by the Parliament, Therefore if thou ſpeak againſt my being perſon and vicar though I neither preach nor teach, nor yet procure none to do it for me, thou art a traitour, for this the thirteenth article of our creed added of late, that whatſoever the Parliament doth, muſt needs be well done, and the Parliament, or any proclamation out of the Parliament time, cannot erre. But to you my Lord parſons, how can ye defend your ſelves if a man ſhould bring this argument againſt you, and prove you all the theeves, that have perſonages and vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages in your hands, and cannot preach. Chriſt ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. <hi>he that entreth not into the ſheepfold by the door, but climbeth in an other way is a thief and a murtherer,</hi> but ye entred in an other way, wherefore ye are theeves and murtherers. That you come not in by the door, I will prove it thus, Chriſt is the door, but by Chriſt ye came not into the ſheepfold, that is, to be parſons and vicars, for ye grant that ye came in by the act of Parliament, and the act of Parliament is not Chriſt, for it is not confirmed by Chriſts word, therefore ye came not by Chriſt, and ſo be ye theeves and murtherers, as your works proved of late, in ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the bloud of ſo many true preachers and ſhepheards, which ſpent their lives for their ſheep. If this argument be not ſtrong enough, what ſay you by this? <hi>All they that come before me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>are theeves and robbers,</hi> ye come into the ſheepfold, before Chriſt, <hi>ergo</hi> ye be theeves and robbers. To come in before Chriſt, is to be a parſon or a vicar before Chriſt ſend him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ye came in before Chriſt ſent you, for he ſendeth none to be ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, but ſuch as he knoweth to be able to feed his flook, <hi>ergo</hi> he never ſent you, for he knoweth you unable to do that office. And thus to conclude, ye be theeves and robbers, for a theef cometh not but to ſteal and to kill. Wherefore give over your parſonages to learned men, and enter not into other mens vocations, to rob the Miniſters both of their office and of their living, that ye be not puniſhed of God. But if ye will needs be parſons and vicars ſtill, and have all the profits of the parſonages, and will have all, even to the tithe egge of a poor woman that hath but two hens, ye muſt have the pains that belong to ſuch perſons as you be.

               <note place="margin">Nehem 13. 14.</note> (who had the overſight of what belonged to the maintenance of the Prieſts, being joyned in affinity with <hi>Tobiah</hi> the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monite,</hi> an enemy of the Jews, the portions of the Levites were not given them, but every man was fled to ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amongſt his friends) moſt zealouſly reformed it as you may ſee; threw out <hi>Tobias</hi> veſſels, thruſt out <hi>Eliaſhib,</hi> and placed them that were accounted faithfull, and brought the tithes of corn and wine and oyl into the houſe of the Lord: again mark the ſtate of our times, and ſee if ſuch <hi>Tobias</hi> be not yet amongſt us, and ſuch <hi>Eliaſhibs,</hi> who dealing in all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe, convey the portions of the Levites by little and little from the Church that all may come to ruine and utter confuſion in time. They muſt have the tithe corn and gleab land, peradventure the houſe alſo for a dairy, and then coſen <hi>Eliaſhib</hi> the Miniſter ſhall have the tithe geeſe, and the egges at Eaſter: But ſhall not God viſit this great impiety? O Lord, O Lord, in mercy forgive the ſinnes of the land, and the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of thy people deſerving juſtly the loſſe of thy word and ſweet liberty of their conſciences, and yet, yet ſhew favour, for thy mercy raiſe up men that are able to feed thy people as they ought, and either convert or confound Church-robbers that ſavour nothing but their own gain, that take thus daily away the reward of knowledge, endeavour the death of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thouſands of ſouls, which thou haſt created. Stirre up <hi>Nehemiah</hi> thy faithfull ſervant to redreſſe this ſin, and to ſettle things carnall as ſhall be fit for them that ſow ſpirituall, that God be not mocked: So we that be thy people and the ſheep of thy paſture, ſhall give thee praiſe for ever, for ſo great a mercy.</p>
