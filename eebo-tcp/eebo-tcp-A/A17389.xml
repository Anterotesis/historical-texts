            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Epistle to the Colossians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines an excellent Epitome of the doctrine expressed in the rest of the books of the old and new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament: as will appeare by a briefe delineation or adumbration of the proportion and parts of that sacred bodie of truth, paralelled with the seuerall parts of this Epistle, vsing the benefit of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie vpon it.</p>
            <p>The whole word of God may be diuided into two parts:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of all Theologie exprest briefly in this Epistle: as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi>
               </note> the first concernes <hi>faith,</hi> or what we must beleeue; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>loue,</hi> or what we must doe. So the Apostle deuided it, as may appeare by the <hi>patterne</hi> vsed in their times, which stood of two parts, <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>loue,</hi> 2. Tim. 1.13. And so is this Epistle deuided; for in the two first Chapters he tell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them what they must beleeue, and in the two last, what they must doe.</p>
            <p>Now faith looks either vpon <hi>God,</hi> or vpon the <hi>world.</hi> In
<pb facs="tcp:21380:3"/>
               <hi>God</hi> two things are to be beleeued: 1. the <hi>attributes</hi> of the essence. 2. the <hi>trinitie</hi> of the persons. The attributes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the nature and proprieties of God; such as are, his power, glory, knowledge, and the like; of the power of God, yee may read, Chap. 1.11. &amp; 2.12. of the glorie of God, Chap. 1.11. &amp; 3.17. of the knowledge of God, Chap. 3.10.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Persons</hi> are three, the <hi>Father, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; of the <hi>Father,</hi> chap. 1.2.12. &amp; 3.17. of the <hi>Sonne,</hi> chap. 1.2.13.15. &amp;c. of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> chap. 2.19. Thus of God.</p>
            <p>In the consideration of the <hi>world,</hi> faith is taken vp espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about the <hi>creation</hi> of it, and the <hi>gouernment</hi> of it. In the <hi>creation</hi> it viewes the mightie workmanship of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all things of nothing, euen the very Angells, as well as men and other creatures. of the creation, chap. 1.16. of Angells also chap. 1.16. both good, chap. 2.9. and euill, chap. 2.15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The gouernment of the world,</hi> is two waies to be considered: First, in the generall disposing and preseruation of all things. Secondly, and principally, faith is taken vp about the consideration of the gouernment of <hi>Men</hi> in the world: of the <hi>generall prouidence,</hi> chap. 1.16.17.</p>
            <p>The prouidence of God ouer man, may be considered according to his fourefold estate: 1. of <hi>Innocencie.</hi> 2. of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> 3. of <hi>Grace.</hi> 4. of <hi>Glorie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the estate of <hi>Innocencie,</hi> faith chiefly beholds and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at the glorious <hi>Image of God,</hi> in which man was created; of this Image you may read, chap. 3.10. by analogie.</p>
            <p>In the state of <hi>Corruption,</hi> two things do offer themselues to our dolefull contemplation: 1. <hi>sinne.</hi> 2. the <hi>punishment of sin. Sinne</hi> is both <hi>originall</hi> and <hi>actuall</hi>: of originall sinne, chap. 2.13. of actuall sinnes, chap. 2.11.13.3.5.6. of the punishment of sinne, chap. 3.25. &amp; 2.13. &amp; 3.6.</p>
            <p>In the state of <hi>Grace,</hi> faith viewes three things: 1. the <hi>meanes of grace.</hi> 2. the <hi>subiect.</hi> 3. the <hi>degrees.</hi> The meanes is either <hi>before time,</hi> or <hi>in time</hi>: before time, tis the <hi>election of God</hi>; of which, chap. 3.12. in time, the meanes chiefly is
<pb facs="tcp:21380:3"/>
               <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>couenant</hi> in him. <hi>In Christ,</hi> two things are to be considered, his <hi>person,</hi> and his <hi>office.</hi> The <hi>theorie</hi> concerning Christs <hi>person,</hi> is twofold: 1. concerning his <hi>two natures.</hi> 2. concerning his <hi>twofold estate</hi> in those natures. The <hi>natures</hi> of Christ are two, <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>diuine,</hi> ioyned in the bond of <hi>personall vnion</hi>; of the humane nature, chap. 1.22. of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, chap. 1.15.16, &amp;c. of the <hi>vnion</hi> of both, chap. 2.9 The <hi>state</hi> of the person of Christ is twofold: 1. of <hi>humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> 2. of <hi>exaltation.</hi> His <hi>humiliation</hi> comprehends, 1. his <hi>incarnation,</hi> as the antecedent. 2. his <hi>obedience</hi> to the law of Moses. 3. his <hi>passion</hi>: of his incarnation and obedience impliedly in diuers places; of his passion, chap. 1.14.20 22.14.15. His <hi>exaltation</hi> comprehends his <hi>resurrection, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension,</hi> and <hi>session at the right hand of God</hi>: of his resurrection, chap. 2.12: of his sitting at Gods right hand, chap. 3.1.</p>
            <p>Thus of the <hi>person</hi> of Christ.</p>
            <p>The <hi>office</hi> of Christ is to mediate between God and man. The parts are 1. his <hi>propheticall office.</hi> 2. his <hi>priestly office.</hi> 3. his <hi>regall office.</hi> His <hi>propheticall office</hi> stands in propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of doctrine, and in making it effectuall by his spirit. His <hi>priestly office</hi> stands in two things: 1. <hi>Expiation of sinne.</hi> 2. <hi>Intercession for vs to God.</hi> His <hi>regall office</hi> is partly in the gouernment of the Church, as <hi>the head thereof</hi>: and partly in the subduing of the enemies of God and the Church; of the treasures of wisdome in Christ as a Prophet, chap. 2.3. of the sacrifice of Christ as a Priest, chap. 2.14. of the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Christ ouer the Church, chap. 1.18. &amp; 2.19.</p>
            <p>Thus of Christ.</p>
            <p>The <hi>couenant</hi> followeth, which is considered both in it selfe, and in the <hi>seales</hi> of it; though the <hi>couenant of works</hi> be accidentally a meanes to driue vs to Christ, yet the proper effectuall meanes is the <hi>couenant of grace,</hi> which God hath made with the elect in Christ: this being recorded in the word of the Gospell both in the old and new Testament, is the ordinarie meanes, by the power of Christ, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert soules to God, by the preaching of it in the ministerie of his seruants; of this chap. 1.6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:21380:4"/>The <hi>seales</hi> of this <hi>couenant</hi> are the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> both of the old and new Testament: of the old testament, was <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi> and the rest; of which chap. 2.11. of the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are <hi>baptisme</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi>; of baptisme, ch. 2.12.</p>
            <p>Thus of the <hi>meanes</hi> of grace. The <hi>subiect</hi> of true grace is the <hi>Church,</hi> the bodie of Christ vnited to him by mysticall vnion. The Church consists of two sorts of men, <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>people</hi>; of the Church in generall with her vnion with Christ, chap. 1.18, 19, 20. &amp; 2.19. of Ministers and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>people with their duties, chap. 1.25, 28. &amp; 2 1. and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other places.</p>
            <p>Thus of the <hi>subiect</hi> also. The degrees of grace in the third estate, are 1. <hi>vocation.</hi> 2. <hi>faith.</hi> 3. <hi>remission of sinnes</hi> 4. <hi>sanctification.</hi> of vocation, chap. 3.15. of faith, chap. 1.4.23. &amp; 2.12. of remission of sinnes, chap. 1.14. &amp; 2.13. of sanctification, in both parts, both mortification, chap. 3 5.8. and viuification, chap. 2.13. &amp; 3.10.</p>
            <p>Thus of the estate of grace.</p>
            <p>The fourth and last estate of man, is the <hi>estate of glorie</hi>; which stands of three degrees. 1. <hi>resurrection.</hi> 2. <hi>the last iudgement.</hi> and 3. <hi>life eternall.</hi> of resurrection, chap. 1.18. of the last iudgement and eternall glorie, chap. 3.4. And thus of the first part of the <hi>patterne of wholesome words,</hi> and that is <hi>faith</hi>: now followeth the second, and that is <hi>loue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Loue</hi> comprehends all the dutie we owe to God or men, as being <hi>the bond of perfection,</hi> which ties together all holy seruices. Loue must be considered both in the <hi>adiuncts,</hi> and in the <hi>sorts</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>adiuncts</hi> are <hi>constancie, wisdome, zeale, care to auoide offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of loue in generall, chap. 1.4. &amp; 2.2. &amp; 3.14. of constancie, ch. 2.6. of zeale, chap. 4.13. of wisdom and care to auoide offences, ch. 4.5. thus of the adiuncts.</p>
            <p>The sorts of works comprehended vnder loue, are two chiefly: 1. <hi>works of worship.</hi> 2. <hi>works of virtue.</hi> The workes of worship are either <hi>internall</hi> onely, or <hi>externall and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> also. The <hi>internall</hi> are, the <hi>acknowledging of God, the loue of God, the feare of God, the trust or hope in God,</hi> and which
<pb facs="tcp:21380:4"/>
floweth from thence, <hi>patience</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the acknowledgment of God, chap. 1.9, 10. of the loue of God, chap. 1.8. of the feare of God, chap. 3.22. of the hope in God, chap. 1.5. of patience, chap. 1.11. The workes of worship that are both <hi>externall</hi> and <hi>internall,</hi> are <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>thanksgiuing</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of prayer, chap. 4.2, 3. of thanksgiuing, chap. 3.17.</p>
            <p>Thus of works of worship. <hi>Workes of virtue</hi> either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne our selues or others: the works that concerne our selues, are chiefly two: the <hi>studie of heauenly things,</hi> and <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.</hi> Temperance concernes <hi>chastitie</hi> and <hi>sobrietie</hi> in the vse of all sorts of earthly things. of the studie of heauenly things, chap. 3.1, 2. of chastitie, ch. 3, 5. of sobrietie, ch. 3.2.</p>
            <p>Thus of vertue that concernes our selues.</p>
            <p>Works of virtue towards others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are chiefly nine. <hi>Mercie, curtesie, humilitie, meeknesse, long-suffering, clemencie, peaceablenes, thankfulnes and iustice</hi>: of the first eight of these, chap. 3.12. to 16. Now <hi>Iustice</hi> is either publike or priuate: <hi>publike Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> is in Magistrates, of which, chap. 2.5. <hi>priuate Iustice,</hi> is either <hi>commutatiue,</hi> in bargaining, or <hi>distributiue,</hi> in giuing that which is right to euery one according to his degree: and so distributiue Iustice is either ciuill or oeconomicall. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate Iustice in ciuill conuersation with men abroad, is either to Magistrates, of which, chap. 2.5. or to all men, and so consists of truth and faithfulnes with sinceritie and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance. oeconomicall Iustice is that which concernes the houshold; and so containes the dutie of husbands and wiues, children and parents, seruants and masters; of which chap. 3.18. to the end, with the first verse of chap. 4.</p>
            <p>And thus also of <hi>Loue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I haue shewed the excellent compleatnes of this worthy scripture: it remaines that I declare some of the reasons that haue emboldned me to make choise of your Honors names for the dedication of my exposition vpon this scripture. Three things swaying godly men in like case, haue compelled me, <hi>protection, obseruance,</hi> and <hi>thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>

God it wrought abundant consolation and comfortable reformation in many hearers, so did it seldom rest from the assaults and calumnies, which one while <hi>prophanenesse,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while <hi>enuie</hi> powred out vpon it: great cause there is therefore that it comming out now to a more publike view, should seeke shelter: and of whom should I seeke it or hope for it sooner then of your Honors, who are pleased by your daily countenance to assure me a iust patronage? For the second, to omit the high reputation which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious eminencie of both your ancestors hath set your Honors in, and the praises of many singular endowments and gifts, in which you doe worthily excell, there are two things wherein your Honors daily winne a great increase of obseruance; the one is <hi>pietie</hi> towards God, the other <hi>mercie</hi> towards the poore: the loynes of the poore daily blesse your Honors, and their mouthes daily pray for you, your pietie is many wayes exprest: to omit my vndoubted proofes of it, your Lordship hath much confirmed the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of your religious disposition by your daily and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate respect of the word of God and prayer in priuate, since the Lord hath made you lesse able to resort more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the publike assemblies. And Madam, what thanks can we euer sufficiently giue vnto God for that rare and worthy example, with which your Ladyship doth comfort and incourage the hearts of many, in your care of Gods sabaoths, and in your neuer-failing attendance vpon the ordinances of God, with the congregation, morning and euening, not only in your owne person, but with your whole familie. For the third, I doe ingenuouslie professe before God and men, that I hold my obligation vnto your Honors in the iust debt of seruice and gratitude to be so great, as the labour here imployed is no way answerable to a meete discharge, no though it had been taken onely for your Honors vse; for to omit the debt which I am in for a great part of my maintenance, and that singular incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I reape daily in your Honors respect of my mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie; what thanks can euer be sufficient, or what seruice
<pb facs="tcp:21380:5"/>
can euer be enough for that incomparable benefit (which I haue and shall euer esteeme the greatest outward blessing did euer befall me; and which (Madam) by your Honors singular care and furtherance, after an admirable manner I obteined) I meane the clearing of my reputation from the vniust aspersions of my aduersaries, and that by the mouth and pen of the Lords Annointed, my most dread Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, whom the God of heauen with all abundance of royall and diuine blessings recompence in all earthly feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and eternall glory. And the same God of Peace and Father of mercies, sanctifie your Honors wholy, that your whole spirits and soules and bodies may be preserued blamelesse vnto the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ: faithfull is he that hath called you, who also will doe it. And I doubt not but God that hath inriched your Honors with the true grace that is in Iesus Christ, will daily winne vnto you increase of honor from your perseuerance in well-doing: so as thanksgiuing for your sakes shall bee abundantly giuen vnto God by many. Thus in most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner crauing your Honors acceptance and patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of this worke, I end, and shall reioyce to remaine</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are foure principall Parts of this <hi>Epistle: 1.</hi> the <hi>Proaeme: 2. Doctrine of Faith: 3.

And the <hi>Epilogue</hi> is in the rest of the verses of the fourth Chapter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proaeme</hi> containes two things: First, the <hi>Salutation, vers. 1, 2.</hi> and secondly, a <hi>Preface,</hi> affectionately framed to winne attention and respect: wherein he assures them of his singular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie in remembring them to God, both in Thanks-giuing for their worthy Graces and the meanes thereof, <hi>v. 3.4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</hi> and in earnest Prayer for their increase and comfortable perseuerance in knowledge and the eminencie of sinceritie in holy life, <hi>vers: 9.10, 11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine of Faith</hi> he expresseth two wayes: first, by Proposition: secondly, by Exhortation. In the Proposition of Doctrine, hee doth with singular force of words, and weight of matter set out both the worke of our Redemption, <hi>v. 12.13.14.</hi> and the person of our Redeemer: and that first in his relation to God, <hi>verse 15.</hi> then in relation of the World, <hi>verse 15.16.17.</hi> and thirdly, in relation to the Church, both the whole in generall, <hi>verse 18.19.20.</hi> and the Church of the <hi>Colossians</hi> in particular,
<pb facs="tcp:21380:6"/>
               <hi>vers. 21.22.</hi> And thus of the Proposition. Now his Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion followes, from the <hi>23.</hi> of <hi>Chap. 1.</hi> to the end of <hi>Chap. 2.</hi> and therein hee both perswades and disswades: hee perswades by many strong and mouing Reasons, to an holy endeauour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and perseuere with all Christian firmnesse of resolution, both in the Faith and Hope, was already begotten in them by the Gospell: and this is contained in the seauen last Verses of the first Chapter, and the seauen first Verses of the second Chapter. Hee disswades them from receiuing the corrupt Doctrine of the false Apostles, whether it were drawne from Philosophicall Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or from the Traditions of men, or from the Ceremoniall Law of <hi>Moses</hi>; and hee proceedes in this order: first, hee layes downe the matter of his Dehortation, <hi>Chap. 2. vers. 8.</hi> then secondly, hee confirmes it by diuers Reasons, from <hi>vers. 9.</hi> to <hi>16.</hi> and lastly, he concludes, and that seuerally, as against <hi>Mosaicall</hi> Rites, <hi>vers. 16.17.</hi> against Philosophy, <hi>vers. 18.19.</hi> and against Traditions, <hi>vers. 20.</hi> and so to the end of that Chapter.</p>
            <p>Thus of the second part.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note n="3" place="margin">
                  <hi>The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of life.</hi>
               </note> in giuing <hi>Precepts of life</hi> the Apostle holds this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: first, hee giues generall Rules, that concerne all as they are Christians: then, hee giues speciall Rules, as they are men of this or that estate of life. The generall Rules are contayned in the first seauenteene Verses of the third Chapter: and the speciall Rules from the eighteenth Verse of the third Chapter to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Verse of the fourth. The generall Rules hee reduceth into three heads: <hi>viz.</hi> first, the Meditation of heauenly things, <hi>vers. 1.2.3.4.</hi> secondly, the mortification of vices and iniuries, <hi>vers. 5.</hi> to the <hi>12.</hi> thirdly, the exercise of holy Graces, a number of which hee reckoneth, both in the kindes, meanes, and ends of them, from <hi>vers. 12.</hi> to <hi>18.</hi> The particular Rules concerne principally houshould gouernment: for hee sets downe the dutie of Wiues, <hi>vers. 18.</hi> of Husbands, <hi>ver. 19.</hi> of Children, <hi>vers. 20.</hi> of Parents, <hi>v. 21.</hi> of Seruants, <hi>vers. 22.23.24.25.</hi> and of Maisters, <hi>Chap. 4. vers. 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Epilogue,</hi>
               <note n="4" place="margin">
                  <hi>The Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue.</hi>
               </note> or Conclusion, contaynes in it both matter of generall Exhortation, as also matters of Salutation. The generall Exhortation concernes Prayer, <hi>vers. 2.3.4.</hi> wise Conuersation,
<pb facs="tcp:21380:7"/>
               <hi>vers. 5.</hi> and godly Communication, <hi>vers. 6.</hi> Now after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle hath disburdened himselfe of those generall cares, then hee taketh liberty to refresh himselfe and them, by remembring cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that were deare both to him and them. And first, he makes enterance by a narration of his care to know their estate, and to informe them of his. To which purpose he sendeth and prayseth <hi>Tichicus</hi> and <hi>Onesimus, vers. 7.8.9.</hi> The Salutations then follow; and they are of two sorts: for some are signified to them, some are required in them. Of the first sort, he signifies the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutations of sixe men, three of them Iewes, and three Gentiles, <hi>vers. 10.11.12.13.14.</hi> The Salutations required, concerne ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Laodiceans, vers. 15.16.</hi> or one of the <hi>Colossaean</hi> Preachers, who is not onely saluted, but exhorted, <hi>vers. 17.</hi> And then followes the Apostles generall Salutations to all, in the last Verse.</p>

The worke of our Redemption, <hi>vers.</hi> 12.13.14. the person of our Redeemer, <hi>vers.</hi> 15. and those that follow to the 23. and all this hee expresseth in forme of Thankesgiuing.</p>
                  <p>The worke of our Redemption hee describes two wayes, after he hath touched the first efficient cause of it, <hi>viz.</hi> God the Father: for in the twelfth Verse hee seemes to shew, that in respect of Inchoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is a <hi>making of vs fit</hi>; and in respect of Consummation, it is a causing of vs to enioy an immortall happines in heauen, better then that <hi>Adam</hi> had in Paradise, or the Iewes in Canaan. And therein hee expresseth, first the manner of tenure or title, in the word <hi>Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi> secondly, the adiunct praise of the company, <hi>viz. the Saints:</hi> and thirdly, the perfection of it, it is <hi>in light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, in the end of the thirteenth Verse hee seemes to shew that our Redemption stands of two parts: first, <hi>deliuerance from the power of darknesse:</hi> secondly, <hi>translating into the Kingdome of the Sonne of his loue,</hi> one of the many excellent priuiledges of which estate, is noted in the foureteenth Verse, to be <hi>remission of sinnes, through the bloud of Christ.</hi> And thus of the worke of our Redemption.</p>
                  <p>The person of our Redeemer is described three wayes:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 15 16.17</note> first, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to GOD; secondly, in relation to the whole World; thirdly, in relation to the Church.</p>
                  <p>First, in relation to God, hee is described in the beginning of the fifteenth Verse; and so hee is said to be <hi>the Image of the inuisible God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in relation to the whole World, fiue things are to be said of CHRIST<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> first, <hi>hee is the first begotten of euery Creature,</hi> in the end of the fifteenth Verse: secondly, he is the Creator of all things, <hi>vers.</hi> 16. Where note the distinctions of Creatures: 1. they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished by their place; some, <hi>in Heauen</hi>; some, <hi>in Earth:</hi> 2. they
<pb facs="tcp:21380:9"/>
are distinguished by their qualitie; some are <hi>visible,</hi> some <hi>inuisible:</hi> 3. the inuisible are againe distinguished, by eyther Titles or Offices, some are <hi>Thrones,</hi> some are <hi>Principalities, &amp;c.</hi> thirdly, <hi>all things are for him,</hi> this is in the end of the sixteenth Verse: fourthly, <hi>hee is before all things,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>vers.</hi> 17. lastly, <hi>all things in him consist<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vers.</hi> 17. the end of it. Thus the Redeemer is described in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the whole World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 18.19.20</note>Thirdly, hee is described as hee stands in relation to the Church: and so eyther to the whole Church, <hi>vers.</hi> 18.19.20. or to the Church of the <hi>Colossians, vers.</hi> 21.22.</p>
                  <p>As hee stands in relation to the whole Church, hee is said to be <hi>the head of the Church,</hi> in the beginning of the eighteenth Verse, and this hee proues, by shewing that hee is a head in three respects.</p>
                  <p>First, in respect of the dignitie of order towards his Members, and so in the state of Grace he is their beginning, and in the state of glory <hi>hee is the first begotten of the dead</hi>; that both among the liuing and the dead <hi>hee might haue the preheminence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, in respect of perfection in himselfe, in that <hi>all fulnesse dwels in him</hi>; which is amplified by the cause, <hi>viz. the good pleasure of the Father,</hi> who made him head of the Church, <hi>vers.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in respect of efficacie or influence through the whole body: for from him flowes <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation, vers.</hi> 20. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which Reconciliation there are eight things to be noted: 1. the mouing cause, which is to be supplyed out of the former Verse, as the Coniunction [<hi>and</hi>] importeth, <hi>viz. it pleased the Father:</hi> 2. the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>by him, viz.</hi> CHRIST the head: 3. the Benefit it selfe, <hi>viz. to reconcile:</hi> 4. the subiect Persons in generall, <hi>all things:</hi> 5. the End, <hi>to himselfe:</hi> 6. the Effect, <hi>making peace:</hi> 7. the Meanes, <hi>through the bloud of his Crosse:</hi> 8. the Distribution of the Persons who, in those words, <hi>things in earth and things in heauen.</hi> Thus of his relation to the whole Church.</p>

                        <hi>Verse</hi> 21.22.</note>In the description of his relation to the Church of the <hi>Colossians,</hi> he vrgeth them with two things: first, their misery without CHRIST: 2. the remedy of their misery by CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Their Misery stands in two things: first, they are <hi>Strangers</hi>: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are <hi>Ene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In setting downe their Remedie hee notes: 1. the Meanes: 2. the End of the meanes is the <hi>death of the body of Christs flesh:</hi> The end is, that <hi>hee might present them holy and vnblameable, and without fault in Gods sight, vers.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>Thus of his relation to the Church of the <hi>Colossians:</hi> and thus also of the second part of this Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Proposition</hi> of Doctrine.</p>

                        <hi>Verse</hi> 23.</note>The <hi>Exhortation</hi> followes: where is to be considered; first, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation it selfe; and then the Reasons. The Exhortation is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance, both in Faith and Hope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21380:9"/>In the Exhortation to perseuerance in faith, there is worthy to be noted: first, the manner of propounding it, which is with an <hi>If</hi>: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the duty required, <hi>Continue:</hi> thirdly, the manner of the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <hi>grounded and stablished:</hi> fourthly the obiect, Grace, <hi>in Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Exhortation to perseuerance in Hope, two things are to be obserued: first, he sets downe the euill to be auoyded, <hi>viz.</hi> vnsetled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or reuolting, in the words, <hi>Be not moued away</hi>: secondly, hee quickens them by remembring the cause and fountaine of their hope: <hi>viz. The hearing of the Gospell preached.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus of the Exhortation, the Reasons follow.</p>
                  <p>There are seauen Reasons to inforce this Exhortation to perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The first is taken from the Consent of Gods Elect, <hi>Which are through the world,</hi> who haue in the preaching of the Gospell receiued Faith and Hope, as their common portion.</p>
                  <p>The second Reason is taken from the testimony of PAVL him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: and that is two-fold; the first is the testimonie of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie; This is it hee preacheth, and therefore it should be it they should keepe fast: the second is the testimony of his <hi>Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi>; hee hath endured much for the Doctrine of Faith and Hope; and therefore they should continue in it: and to stirre them the more concerning his sufferings, hee sheweth that hee suffered with <hi>great Ioy</hi>: which hee confirmeth by expressing the reasons of his ioy; first, because they were <hi>the afflictions of Christ</hi>; secondly, because hee had his part allotted him by the decree of God: and it was his ioy that hee had almost finished what was <hi>left</hi> for him to suffer; there was but a little remaining: thirdly, because they were but <hi>in his flesh</hi>: fourthly, because they were <hi>for them,</hi> and the good of <hi>the Church, Verse</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p>The third Reason is taken from the <hi>testimony of God,</hi> who inioyned vnto PAVL and other Ministers this <hi>dispensation</hi> of the Doctrine of Faith and Hope, with a charge that they should see his <hi>Word fulfilled</hi> herein, <hi>Verse</hi> 25.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Reason is taken from the excellencie of the Gospell: which is set out; first, by the nature of it, it <hi>is a mysterie:</hi> secondly, by the antiquitie of it, it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>was hid since the world beganne, from Ages and Generations:</hi> thirdly, by the time of the reuelation of it, <hi>now,</hi> in the new world: fourthly, by the persons to whom it is reuealed, <hi>viz.</hi> onely <hi>the Saints,</hi> all which should moue to care and constancy in keeping of it. <hi>Verse</hi> 26.</p>
                  <p>The fift Reason is taken from the excellency of the Subiect of the Gospell, which is no lesse nor worse then Christ reuealed by the preaching of the Gospell. In this reuelation of Christ in the Gospell, consider, first, who reueales him, God: secondly, the cause of his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>the will of God, hee would:</hi> thirdly, the manner, <hi>viz. in a rich and glorious mystery:</hi> fourthly, the persons to whom, <hi>viz.</hi> the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Gentiles:</hi> fiftly, the effects or fruits of it, which are, first, the <hi>inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of Christ:</hi> secondly, the <hi>hope of glory, Verse</hi> 27.</p>

                     </note> not onely as hee workes Gods Image in man, or because hee appeared for God the Father, to the Fathers in the old Law; or because as man hee had in him the likenesse of God in perfect holinesse and righteousnesse; or because hee did by his Miracles, as it were, make God visible in his flesh; but as he was from euerlasting the very essentiall naturall Image of God, most absolutely in his diuine person resembling infinitely the whole nature of his Father: and therefore is to be acknowledged as the begotten of God by an eternall generation: so the first begotten of euery Creature, as he was before them; so is he therefore the principall heyre of all things, by whom, and in whose right, all the Saints doe inherite what they haue or looke for.<note place="margin">Verse <hi>16.

perseuere, you cannot haue sound comfort in your right to the benefits before named. Besides, there are many reasons may induce you to the resolutenesse of perseuerance in the Doctrine you haue already belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and hoped in. First, it is the Doctrine which all God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Elect, with one consent, haue receiued, throughout the world; and vpon it haue founded their Faith and Hope. Secondly, the consideration of what yee see in mee may somewhat moue you, and that, if you eyther consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my Ministery or Sufferings: for my Ministery, I haue so through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed my selfe concerning the Doctrine which <hi>Epaphras</hi> hath taught you, that I see it in all things, for the substance of it, to be the same which I my selfe haue taught in euery place.</p>
                  <p>Now for my Sufferings,<note place="margin">Verse <hi>24.

                     </note> it is apparant to all sorts of men, that I haue endured my part of all kindes of Troubles for the Gospell, which I would not haue done, if I had not had full assurance of the truth of it, neyther doe I repent mee of my afflictions, but reioyce in them rather, and that for diuers Reasons. First, because they are the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> that is, such as he accounts to be his. Secondly, because I know that in Gods Decree I haue my part of troubles assigned mee; and it is my ioy, to thinke that in so good a cause I haue almost fulfilled them. Thirdly, because these Afflictions extend but to my flesh and outward man. And lastly, because it is for your good I suffer, euen for the confirmation of your Faith, and for the good of the whole body of Christ, which is the Church.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Verse <hi>25. Whereof I am a Minister, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of God, which is giuen mee vnto you ward, to fulfill the word of God.</hi>
                     </note> I haue receiued this Commission concerning the Gospell im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from <hi>GOD</hi> himselfe, with strict charge, that for your good I should pursue the execution of it, till not onely Faith and Hope were wrought, but till we saw the worke and word of God, euen accomplished and fulfilled.</p>

                     </note> what can there be more excellent and worthy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued and trusted in, then this Gospell of <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> and our reconciliation in him, seeing it is that dreadfull Mysterie, which worlds of men haue wanted, as being hid from whole Ages and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations hitherto, and now by the vnspeakeable mercy of <hi>GOD</hi> is reuealed by preaching vnto the Saints, as a peculiar treasure entrusted to them.</p>
                  <p>And fiftly,<note place="margin">Verse <hi>27. To whom God would make knowne what is the riches of this glorious mystery among the Gentiles, which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is Christ in you, the hope of glory.</hi>
                     </note> the rather should you hereupon settle, considering the admirable subiect of the Gospell: for it is the good pleasure of <hi>GOD</hi> in this rich and glorious Mystery of the Gospell, to make knowne to the poore Gentiles, Christ Iesus himselfe, and that by giuing him therein to dwell in your hearts by Faith, and as your assured and onely hope of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall glory.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly,<note place="margin">Verse <hi>28. Whom we preach, admonishing euery man, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching euery man in all wisedome, that we may present euery man perfect in Christ Iesus.</hi>

                     <pb facs="tcp:21380:13"/>
in some acceptable measure of Sinceritie and Knowledge in him.</p>

The Apostle then holds his calling from God, and therefore beleeues Gods protection and blessing because God had called him to his function. And as the Apostle, so euery member of the Church holds his particular standing and function from God; hee is ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked into his order by the speciall prouidence and calling of God.</p>

Secondly, it may teach men not to passe the bounds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of their calling; for seeing they are in their places by Gods will, they must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> take heede of going beyond their limits, eyther by vsing of vnlawfull wayes and courses, or by intruding into other mens functions.

sanctification to glorifie God, and seeke his owne saluation in the things of the Kingdome of Christ, and this is a calling generall to him, with all belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.

                           <note n="3" place="margin">The Church may be true &amp; yet faultie.</note>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:21380:18"/>
remaine in it vnreformed, as here these titles are giuen to a Church much poysoned with humane traditions and vile corruptions in worship. Lastly it is to be obserued,<note n="4" place="margin">One grace or priuiledge can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without another.</note> that the Apostle ioynes all these together, to note that one cannot be without the other, one cannot be a <hi>Saint</hi> vnlesse hee be <hi>faithfull,</hi> and <hi>in Christ,</hi> and so of the rest. The last clause cuts off the Iewes apparantly from being Saints or true beleeuers, seeing they receiue not Christ:<note place="margin">Carnall Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</note> and the first clause cuts off the carnall Protestant, so as hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a beleeuer or in Christ, seeing hee cares no more for sanctitie: and the two middle-most cut off the Papists and all Heretikes and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes, seeing they haue with insolent pride made a rent and Apostasie from the true Apostolicall Churches,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.4 &amp;c.</note> by aduancing themselues with their <hi>Man of sinne</hi> aboue their brethren, nay, aboue all that is called God.</p>
                        <p>Thus farre in generall, the first thing particularly giuen them, is, that they are Saints.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Saints.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the word <hi>Saints.</hi>
                           </note>] This Word is diuersely accepted in Scripture. Sometimes it is giuen to the Angels, and so they are called <hi>Saints, Deut.</hi> 33.2 <hi>Iob</hi> 15.15. Secondly, men are said to be holy by a certaine Legall or Ceremoniall san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 11.44. And in this sence the superstitious are holy: This is the holinesse and sanctitie of Papists and Popish persons, which place all their holinesse in the obseruation of Rites and Traditions, and superstitious Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes. Thirdly, all that stand members of the Church, by the rule of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, or in respect of outward visibilitie and profession, are called Saints, and so all that couenant with God by offering Sacrifice,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.5.</note> are called Saints. Lastly, and properly it is a tearme giuen to men effectually called: the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God truely conuerted are called Saints; not because they are perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy without all sinne,<note place="margin">Gods children are called Saints in foure respects.</note> but in foure respects.

Secondly, in respect of vocation; and therefore the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. When he had said they were sanctified, he said by way of explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were Saints by calling. Thirdly, in respect of regeneration, because they are now new creatures.

                           </note> with many other places. The vse of this serues first, to confute the grosse folly of the Papists that acknowledge no Saints till three things come to them:<note place="margin">Three things needfull for popish Saints.</note> first, they must be Canonized by the Pope: secondly, they must be dead first: thirdly, it must be an hundred yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their death.

Secondly, this serues for the seuere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe of numbers in our owne Church, that liue as if there were no sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be looked after, till they come to heauen. Thirdly, the Scripture is not without singular comfort to the poore despised Saints:<note place="margin">Comforts for the despised Saints and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 16.3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 30.4.5.</note> I will take them in order as they lye. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6.7.

The Lord by crosses intends to bring them out of sinne, not to driue them in; and if men finde not these priuiledges true, it is because eyther they doe not hearken, that is, obserue and marke the Word, Spirit, and Workes of God, or else because they are not his Saints.

Fourthly, his last signe is, that <hi>hee did set the Lord alwayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> before him:</hi> hee could be content to walke euer in Gods presence, and to haue him the witnesse of his actions, hee was not carefull onely to approue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to men (as wicked men may doe) but his chiefe care was to walke in all good conscience before God.</p>

Secondly, they are men that haue felt the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> power of God in the practise of mortification; they are new creatures, they are washed and purged. Thirdly, the Spirit of God in them hath beene a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Spirit of Iudgement, and a Spirit of burning: a Spirit of Iudgement, not onely in respect of knowledge and illumination, but also because it hath kept

                           <note place="margin">Faithfulnesse in spirituall things.</note>The Christian mans faithfulnesse ought to shew it selfe, first, in spirituall things; secondly, in temporall things vnto faithfulnesse in spirituall things fiue things are requisite. First, faith in Christ, to get sound reasons from the Word and Spirit of God,<note place="margin">Hereunto fiue things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite.</note> and a sure euidence for the particular perswasion of the heart, that God in Christ is graciously reconciled with the sinner. He <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> cannot be a faithfull man that hath not a iustifying Faith: all that time of a mans life, onely receiueth hee this honour, to be accounted faithfull, when aboue all things hee trauels after the sense of Gods fauour in the forgiuenes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of his sinnes. Secondly, faithfulnesse stands in the performance of all those Promises, Purposes and Vowes, which men in their distresse inward or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward doe make vnto God.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.</note> And therefore the Israelites are charged not to be faithfull,<note place="margin">37.</note> because when the wrath of God turned vpon them, and the strongest of them were slaine, and their chosen men were smitten, and that their dayes did consume in vanitie,<note place="margin">31.</note> and their yeeres hastily, then they cry vnto him,<note place="margin">32.</note> and seeke him in their distresse, they returne and seeke him earely, they acknowledge that God is their strength,<note place="margin">34.</note> and the most high their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: but when the Lord had beene mercifull vnto them,<note place="margin">35.</note> forgiuen their iniquities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so as hee destroyed them not, and called backe his anger; then they retu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </note> And thus <hi>Iudah</hi> is said to be faithfull with Gods Saints, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as yet the worship of God was preserued amongst them in the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent puritie, in which the old Patriarkes and Saints, did sincerely worship the God of their Fathers: hee is a faithfull man that will worship God no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then the Saints haue done, that is, precisely, according to his will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in his Word. Fourthly, faithfulnesse is exercised in the conscionable imployment of the Gifts, Graces and Talents receiued in our generall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to Gods glory, the increase of our gifts, and the inriching of our soules
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21380:20"/>

Thus doing, two commodities wee shall reape: first, it is a signe of our faithfulnesse: secondly, the gifts will increase, and to him that hath such gifts to vse them, shall be more giuen. Lastly, faithfulnesse shewes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> it selfe in mens sinceritie, diligence, constancie, and care to promote and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the causes of God, and the Church, with the conscionable discharge of all such duties as belong vnto such seruice.

                              <hi>Luke</hi> 9.23.</note> and that daily; so as they may further the building vp, and edification of Gods people. Those then are not faithfull that doe the worke of the Lord negligently, that set their hands to the plough and looke backe, that minde their owne things, honours, pleasures, profits, and preferments, and those that in the time of temptation fall away: these spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialties of faithfulnesse receiue a great increase of prayse if two things come to them: first, that mens hearts be faithfull; that is, that though they haue many wants and infirmities, and fayle much and often in well-doing, yet the desire, delight, endeauour, resolution and affection is in all pleasing and firmenesse to walke before God, without eyther hypocrisie or presumption: this was <hi>Abrahams</hi> prayse,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.8.</note> 
                           <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.8. Secondly, that men continue faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto the death, with all constancie and holy perseuerance, beleeuing in Christ, and worshipping GOD, euen to the end of their dayes, this is called for,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Reu.</hi> 2.11.</note> and crowned, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.11. Thus of faithfulnesse in spirituall things.</p>
                        <p>Faithfulnesse in temporall things stands in three things.<note place="margin">Faithfulnesse in temporall things.</note> First, in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, diligent, and carefull discharge of the duties of our Calling. It was a singular prayse in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that when his enemies fought occasion against him,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Daniel</hi> 6.5.</note> they could finde none concerning the Kingdome, hee was so faithfull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and without blame, and therefore they must take him (if euer) concerning the Law of his God.<note place="margin">A Caueat for Professors.</note> Then doth the glory of Gods people shine, when toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their constant zeale in matters of religion, they are found carefully diligent and faithfull in their callings; then whatsoeuer befals them for the Law of their God, they may beare it with all comfort and constancie, as did <hi>Daniel.</hi> But how doth it blemish the glory of profession, when men can say and see that Professors are idle deceitfull busie-bodies, and carelesse in their places and callings? they cannot build so much by profession, as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy by these scandalous and carelesse courses.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, in the right vse and profitable disposing of our riches, euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the outward things God hath giuen vs. This lyeth vpon vs, as one of the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of our faithfulnesse: nay, this is necessary to the being of this pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Dost thou aske then how thou maist get into Christ.<note place="margin">How thou maist get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ.</note> 
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> Obserue three things.</p>
                        <p>First, before thou canst be ingrafted into Christ, thou must be cut off the olde tree; eyther a new man or no man; eyther lose the World, or neuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
finde Christ; eyther disarme thy selfe of all vaine confidence, loue, delight, and support from the world and worldly men, or the arme of the Lord will neuer beare thee vp and nourish thee.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, a true Member is not but by generation in nature, nor canst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thou be a true member of Christ but by regeneration: great oddes betweene
a wodden legge, though neuer so exquisitely made, and a true legge; all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in Creation be begotten, and in Grace begotten againe.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, as they are not Man and Wife, where there is no sure making by Contract or Marriage going before; so neyther can any be in Christ, vnlesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
hee be receiued vnto the Couenant of Grace: and, as it is a mad thing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for any woman to say, Such a man is my Husband, for hee is a kinde man, and did cast his eye vpon mee, or did me a pleasure at such a time, &amp;c. So, it is as great spirituall madnesse for any Soule to pleade interest in Christ, when they can alleadge no more but his generall loue to man; or that hee offered Grace to vs in the Word and Sacraments, or that wee together with the Gospell receiued outward blessings, or such like; when men can shew no contract, no mutuall entercourse betweene CHRIST, and the SOVLE, no manner of euidence for their hopes, no witnesses from the Word, Spirit, or Children of God, for their spirituall Marriage.</p>
                        <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Who are in Christ.</note> would a man know whether hee be in Christ, these Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons likewise resolue his doubt, by a three-fold Answere: first, hee is in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21380:22"/>
Christ, if he blossome, grow, and beare fruit, euen such fruit as is to eternall life. If a man be abundant in the workes of the Lord; and grow in such graces as are communicated onely to the faithfull, hee is certainely a true Plant in this Stocke: for, by growing and fruit, is the Plant that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted knowne from the sprigge that is lopped off, and lyeth by, and is withered. A life barren and voyd of the workes of Pietie and Mercy, is a manifest signe that the person is not in Christ.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if there be in our soules the sense, and feeling, and motion of spirituall life, then are wee members: for, in a wodden legge is there no sense nor naturall motion. When men haue as much sense and feeling, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and delight in the things of the Spirit, as the Word, Prayer, fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the Gospell, with the exercise of holy Graces in the duties of Gods worship, or things otherwise belonging to the Kingdome of Christ, as the carnall man hath in the profits,<note place="margin">

                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, it will appeare by the holy communion betweene Christ and the faithfull Soule, by his co-habitation and spirituall entercourse, when Christ meetes a Christian with holy Comforts, with heauenly refreshings, with sacred answeres, with spirituall direction, and other sacred signes of the presence of Christ, in the vse of the meanes, sporting himselfe with the Christian Soule: this entercourse I say, this secret and chamber-meeting, these inward and heartie feelings, wrought by the Word and Sacraments, by Prayer and Fasting, by Reading and Conference, are certaine and sure signes and seales to proue a marriage going before. And thus farre of the foure titles giuen to the Children of God, and also of the second thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the persons saluted. Now followeth the Salutation it selfe.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Grace.</hi>] If Grace (that is, Gods fauour, and the graces spirituall that flow from thence) be of so great worth and excellencie; diuers things may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by way of profitable instruction, for our vse, out of seuerall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, if it be so great a priuiledge to obtaine grace from God, we should striue to be such as are within the compasse of the promise of grace; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, wee should get humble and lowly hearts:<note place="margin">

                           <hi>Peace.</hi>] The second thing here wished for, and to be desired of all that loue their owne good, is <hi>Peace,</hi> that is, tranquilitie of heart, with other spirituall blessings accompanying it with outward things also, so farre as they may further our happinesse: but the Scripture layes a restraint vpon the getting of this peace, and giues rules for the vse of it. For if euer wee would haue Peace, wee must first be <hi>righteous persons,</hi> that is, men that are broken in heart for our sinnes, humbled at Gods feete for forgiuenesse, and such as hang vpon the Word of GOD, to receiue the certaine meanes of our soules reconciliation, and the righteousnesse of CHRIST impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs:<note place="margin">

                              <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6.</note> then let this peace <hi>preserue thy heart and minde,</hi> and let it <hi>rule.</hi>

Let the peace of thy heart, and Gods spirituall blessing be a rule for all thy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And lastly, with all good Conscience and holy conuersation hold out, that when Christ shall come, eyther by <hi>particular Iudgement</hi> to thee in death, or by <hi>generall Iudgement</hi> to the whole world in the last day,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Esay</hi> 9.6.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.79.</note> thou maist be <hi>found of him in peace,</hi> so shall Christ be vnto thee <hi>a Prince of Peace,</hi> and <hi>guide thy feete for euer into the way of peace.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And thus farre of the good things hee wisheth vnto them, now follow the efficient causes <hi>(viz) from God the Father, and our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Diuers things may be here obserued.</p>
                        <p>First, a proofe of the <hi>Trinitie,</hi> or, at the least, a plaine proofe of two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne,</hi> vnited in one essence.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, GOD is here plainely affirmed to be a Father, and that hee is in diuers respects: first, to all by <hi>Creation:</hi> secondly, to all the faithfull by <hi>Adoption:</hi> thirdly, to Christ, by the grace of <hi>Vnion</hi> as man, and a naturall <hi>Father,</hi> as God.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, here wee may obserue, that grace and blessings must not be looked vpon without some honourable meditation of God and Christ the giuers.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, seeing beleeuers haue a <hi>God,</hi> a <hi>Father,</hi> a <hi>Christ,</hi> a <hi>Sauiour,</hi> a <hi>Lord,</hi> they are sure to be in a happy case, and may haue what is needfull, if they will seeke for it.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, wee may obserue, we can haue no comfort in the enioying or hope of any fauour or blessing, spirituall or temporall, vnlesse, first, God be our Father; secondly, wee be in Christ.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, if GOD be a Father, and CHRIST a Lord, it stands vs vpon to looke to it, that wee performe both <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>seruice.</hi> And thus of the Salutation. The Preface followeth.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The Diuision.</note>THE Salutation hath beene handled already, the Preface followeth, and is contayned in this Verse, and those that follow to the 12. Verse: in which the end and drift of the Apostle is, to winne affection to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine afterwards to be propounded: and this hee doth by shewing his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great loue to them, which he demonstrates by two things which he did for them, <hi>(viz.)</hi> he both gaue thankes vnto God in their behalfe, and also made many a prayer for them: which spirituall duties are better kindnesses and signes of true affection and respect, then all ciuill curtesies or outward complements are or can be.</p>
                        <p>These things in the Preface are first generally set downe in this Verse, and then particularly enlarged in the Verses afterwards: first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Thankesgiuing, from <hi>ver.</hi> 4. to the 9. secondly, Prayer, <hi>v.</hi> 9.10.11. In this Verse hee doth two things: first, hee giues thankes: secondly, he prayes. In the Thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing consider, first, what hee doth, in these words, <hi>Wee giue thankes:</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to whom he doth it, in these words; <hi>To God, euen the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Thus farre of the order of the words.</p>
                        <p>The Doctrines follow, which must be considered generally from the whole Verse, and specially from the seuerall words.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Two generall Doctrines.</note>The first generall Doctrine is this, that it is not enough to salute others kindely, but we must doe and performe the sound duties of loue: this is from the coherence, and condemnes the sinfull barrennesse of many that know a necessitie of no duties of loue, vnlesse it be to salute curteously.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, wee see heare that Tyrants may take away the benefit of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, reading, conference, and such like; but they cannot hinder vs of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. PAVL can pray and giue thankes in prison, for himselfe and others, as well as euer before. Let wicked men doe their worst, Gods Children will still pray vnto God. And looke how many promises are made in Scripture, to the prayers of the Saints, so many consolations are inuiolably preserued vnto them, against the rage of whatsoeuer extremitie wicked men can cast vpon them: this is a singular comfort.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Miserie breeds vnitie.</note>
                           <hi>Wee.] Doct.</hi> Miserie breedeth vnitie. The Apostle that in more prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous times iarred with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> can now hold peace and firme vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with meaner men; and therefore hee saith <hi>Wee,</hi> not <hi>I.</hi> And thus wee see it was in the times of persecution in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, the Bishops and Pastors that could not agree when they were in their Seates and Pulpits, willingly seeke agreement when they are in prison, and must come to the Stake. And so it many times fals out in common Iudgements, as the sword and pestilence:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Esay</hi> 24.2.</note> in such times the words of the Prophet are fulfilled, <hi>Like People like Priests, like Seruant like Master, like Buyer like Seller, like Borrower like Lender, like Giuer like Taker, to vsury.</hi> Great and preuailing Iudgements take away all that vanitie of conceit and swelling of pride which difference of gifts and places bred before.</p>
                        <p>The Lord for his mercies sake grant, that at the length there may be found some remedie to cure the wound and heale the breach which proud conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath made, and continued, with effects prodigious and vnheard of: lest the Lord be at length prouoked to plague with more fierce and cruell Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and worke vnion, at least in one furnace of common calamilitie: the same God, for his Sonnes sake, worke in all that any wise loue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie of Ierusalem, on all sides, that they more regard the glory of God and the good of the Church, then their owne greatnesse eyther of place or
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21380:24"/>
respects amongst men, and that they may more seeke the truth then vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie. And as for those that neyther loue the truth nor peace, the Lord open their eyes and conuert them, or else giue them to eate of the fruit of their owne wayes.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Not safe to deferre good motions.</note>] It is not safe to put ouer good motions. When <hi>Paul</hi> findeth fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to pray and giue thankes, hee doth not omit the occasion. In spirituall things delay is alwayes dangerous, but in sinfull motions the onely way ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times is to deferre the execution.<note place="margin">

                           </note> Many sinnes are preuented by the very benefit of taking time enough to execute them.</p>

                           <hi>Giue thankes.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">It is good to prayse before thou reproue.</note>] <hi>Paul</hi> giues them to vnderstand before he comes to dispraise their vices, and the corruptions crept into the Church, that hee takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their prayse-worthy vertues: hee reserues his taxation to the second Chapter;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Reasons.</hi>
                           </note> and this course hee holds with them for diuers Reasons. First, to assure them of his loue, and that hee did it not of malice, a thing especially <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to be looked to in all admonitions, in familie, or else-where, as well to praise for vertue, as disprayse for vice. Secondly, he holds this course to let them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> see that he did account them as Christians, though they had their infirmities. It is a secret corruption in the affection of the reproued to conceiue that the reproouer likes them not at all. They are not fit to reproue others, that cannot loue them for their vertues at the same time that they dispraise their faults: and therefore they are farre short of holy affections, that say, <hi>I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer liked him since I saw that fault by him.</hi> Thirdly, hee did thus, that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> might the more hate sinne, seeing it did darken their graces, which els would more appeare. Fourthly, that they might be made thankefull themselues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> for their owne graces; a shame that others should prayse God for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to vs, and wee neuer prayse God our selues. Lastly, it carryeth with it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> a secret taxation of vnthankfulnesse, as the cause of their fall: for, had they beene more thankfull for the sinceritie of the preaching of the Gospell, and for the <hi>riches of the grace of Christ</hi> offered, the honourable opinion of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie and sufficiencie thereof, to giue all sound contentment, would haue preserued them from mixing the worship of God with <hi>mens traditions,</hi> or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting contrary doctrine, and from dishonouring the mediation of Christ with <hi>Angell-worship.</hi> Then did Popish Traditions ouer-flow, when the Scriptures were contemned, and the light of them suppressed: and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, an vnthankfull man is euer a vicious man.</p>
                        <p>More specially, in the dutie here mentioned two things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>

                           <hi>We giue thankes.] Eucharist</hi> is sometimes appropriated onely to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper, but most commonly is generall to all holy thankefulnesse, especially to God.</p>
                        <p>There is a flattering thankefulnesse to men <note n="a" place="margin">

                        <p>Concerning the spirituall mans thankefulnesse to God, I propound three things onely in the generall briefely to be noted: First, Reasons to incite vs to the practise of continuall thankefulnesse to God. Secondly, for what things we are to be thankfull. Thirdly, what rules to be obserued for the manner of performance of it.</p>
                        <p>There are many reasons scattered in Scripture,<note place="margin">Motiues to thankefulnesse.</note> to incite vs to Thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse: first, because it is a speciall part of Gods worship, or one way by which we yeeld worship to God. Hence, that the Apostle accounts it a great losse, if <hi>the people cannot say Amen,</hi> when the Teacher <hi>blesseth in the spirit, or giueth thankes</hi> 
                           <note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16.</note>. Againe, when he would exhort them to liberalitie, he vrgeth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21380:25"/>
them with this reason, that the <hi>supplying of the necessities of the Saints would cause much thankesgiuing to God,</hi>

                           <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16.</note> Secondly, the Apostle hauing dehorted the <hi>Ephesians</hi> 
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from <hi>Fornication</hi> and <hi>all Vncleannesse,</hi> and <hi>Couetousnesse, Filthinesse, Iesting,</hi> and <hi>foolish Talking</hi>; hee addeth, but rather <hi>vse giuing of thankes</hi>

                              <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.3.4.</note>. As if hee would note, that thankefulnesse for Gods Blessings and Graces duely performed, would preserue them from the filth and power of these base vices. Besides, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it is a thing that <hi>becommeth the Saints,</hi> nothing better. Thirdly, it is a signe of three worthy things, wherein it behooueth euery man to be well assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: first, it is a signe of a heart that hath rightly receiued Christ, and is firmely <hi>rooted, built,</hi> and <hi>stablished in the faith</hi> 
                           <note n="f" place="margin">

Secondly, if <hi>men in all things let their requests be shewed vnto God with giuing of thankes,</hi> it is a signe of the <hi>peace of God,</hi> euen <hi>that the peace of God that passeth all vnderstanding, will preserue their hearts and mindes in Christ Iesus</hi> 
                           <note n="g" place="margin">
                              <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6.7.</note>. Thirdly, it is a signe, nay, a very meanes of a contented minde. He that can pray vnto God for what hee wants, and is able thankefully to acknowledge what hee hath in possession or promise, hee will <hi>in nothing be carefull,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6.</note> as it appeareth in the same place to the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> Lastly, it is one of the sixe principall meanes to make a man <hi>reioyce al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,</hi> as the Apostle writeth,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.18.</note> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.18.

                           <note place="margin">For what wee must giue thankes.</note>Secondly, wee must consider for what wee must giue thankes. First, for spirituall things as well as temporall, as for the Word <note n="h" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16.</note>, for Mercies in prayer<note n="i" place="margin">

                              <hi>Acts</hi> 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>35.</note>, in wrongs. Thirdly, in outward things wee must be thankefull <note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 10.3.</note>, not onely for great things done, for our states or names, but euen for the lesser and more daily fauours, as for our foode, and the creatures for our nourishment. And in speciall manner haue the Saints in all ages bound themselues to a set course of prayer and prayse ouer and for their foode: and therefore their grosse swinish prophanenesse is so much the greater, that sit downe and rise from their meate,<note place="margin">Scripture for prayer and Thankesgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for our very food.</note> like brute beasts, without any Prayer or Thankesgiuing. If any aske whether there be any expresse Scripture for Grace before and after meate, I answere, there is, and alledge these three vndeniable and plaine places of Scripture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3.4. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.6.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The manner of Thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</note>Thirdly, for the manner of Thankesgiuing, it may be found in that phrase vsed by the Prophets in the olde Testament of <hi>Sacrificing the calues of their lips</hi> 
                           <note n="o" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>vlt. Hos.</hi> 14.3.</note>. For here foure things may be obserued. First, it must be a dead Calfe, to note that all Thankesgiuing must proceed from humble and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified mindes; and therefore the Pharises thankes did not a whit <hi>iustifie</hi> them<note n="p" place="margin">Luke 18.11.14.</note>. Secondly, it must be a sacrificed Calfe. Now, in the Sacrifice three things were required; an <hi>Altar, Fire,</hi> and <hi>to lay the hand vpon the head of the Beast:</hi> An <hi>Altar,</hi> for not onely our prayers must be made in the name of Christ, but our prayses also must be tendered to God in his mediation, or they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be accepted, no more then a Calfe not laid on the Altar: neyther is it enough to lay the Calfe on the Altar, but <hi>Fire</hi> must be put to it: to note, that the bare throwing out of words of thankefulnesse, though in the name of Christ, will not serue, vnlesse wee doe also get some feeling ardencie and zeale to burne the Sacrifice. Thirdly, we must <hi>lay our hands on the head of the calfe</hi>; that is, in all humilitie wee must confesse our vnworthinesse of all the blessings or graces wee giue thankes for. Againe, in that they offer a Calfe, it signifieth that wee should not offer our thankefulnesse to God of that that costs vs nothing: wee should desire to expresse our prayse by doing some thing to further Gods worship, or relieue the necessities of others. If GOD bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e vs at home, wee should carry a Calfe to the Temple. Lastly, we must

not sacrifice to a <hi>strange God,</hi> when we giue thankes, and that men doe when <hi>they sacrifice to their nets,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.16.</note> as the Prophet speaketh, that is, when men attribute the glory and prayse of God to the meanes or second causes.</p>
                        <p>Thus of thankfulnesse in the generall.</p>
                        <p>But that which is here entended,<note place="margin">We must giue thankes for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> is, that wee should giue thankes for others as well as for our selues, which is not a curtesie but a dutie. This du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of praising God for others, growes exceeding commendable, if wee can exercise it in these particulars.<note place="margin">Foure rules of tryall.</note> First, if wee can giue thankes for those bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings vpon others, which the world accounts shamefull to enioy, as Zeale <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for Gods glory, religious Sinceritie, and Vprightnesse of heart, the Crosse
for Christ his sake, and such like. Secondly, if wee can first giue thankes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
that is, be more apt to prayse God for the vertues of others, then be forwards to taxe their faults and frailties. Thirdly, if we can doe it for <hi>all</hi> sorts of <hi>men,</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
euen our enemies <note n="q" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1.</note>. Fourthly, if wee can be thankefull for the true ioy wee haue had in other mens prosperities <note n="r" place="margin">1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.9.</note>.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>To conclude this point, if wee would haue others to giue thankes for vs, we should labour to be such, as for whom thankes may be giuen. And thus of what they doe: Now, to whom.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To God.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">As any are more heauenly minded, they are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in praises.</note>] These words hauing beene vsed in the very Verse before, teach vs two things, First, that it is no cloying to a sanctified minde to be much and often, yea, vpon euery occasion in the honourable mention and lauding of God, ascribing in euery thing glory to God: so, in heauen they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be weary of Gods prayses, no not vnto all eternitie. And certaine it is, that the more men grow in sanctification, the more easie and apt are their hearts to entertaine all occasions of communion with God, without weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or deadnesse.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>(to God)</hi> shuts out the prayses of themselues or of men. It is fit our reioycing and prayse should be directed thither from whence the blessing came.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Father.</hi>] These words are considered in the former Verse. Thus much of his Thankesgiuing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Praying for you.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">A childe of God neuer giues thankes but hee hath cause to pray, and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</note>] First, in generall from the ioyning together of these two duties, two things may be obserued: first, that a childe of God neuer giues thankes but hee hath cause to pray: for, if it be for temporall things, hee must pray both for their sanctified vse, that they become not occasions of sinne; and for their preseruation according to Gods will: if it be for spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, he hath reason to pray for increase, strength, and preseruation against falling, and such like. Secondly, on the other side, I say also, that a childe of God doth neuer pray, but hee may finde reasons to giue thankes, wee may finde mercies in any miserie; yea, it is a singular mercy to haue a hart to pray, and to haue so many large promises made to them that call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in their distresse. But the maine particular <hi>Doctrine</hi> is, that we ought not onely to pray for our selues but for others. And the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. seemes to make foure sorts of prayers for others,<note place="margin">Foure sorts of prayers for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> 
                           <hi>Deprecations, Requests, Intercessions,</hi> and <hi>Giuing of Thankes: Deprecations</hi> are Prayers for helpe against hurtfull things; <hi>Requests</hi> are Prayers for profitable things; the word rendered <hi>Intercessions,</hi> is by some taken to signifie complaints vnto God against such as wrong them, for whom wee pray: or else, it is a more set or serious implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Gods ayde with the vnited forces of the godly: and lastly, <hi>Giuing of Thankes</hi> stands in the lauding of God for blessings or graces: and in the 6. of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and in the 1 of <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. the Apostle sets downe rules to be obserued in Prayer for others:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.18.</note> in the <hi>Ephesians</hi> hee requires that they pray, 1. <hi>at all times:</hi> 2. <hi>with all manner of Prayers:</hi> 3. <hi>in the spirit:</hi> 4. <hi>with watching:</hi> 5. <hi>with perseuerance:</hi> 6. <hi>With spirituall importunitie:</hi> and lastly, <hi>for all Saints:</hi>
                           <pb n="22" facs="tcp:21380:26"/>
And in <hi>Timothy</hi> he requires that they pray;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8.</note> 1. <hi>euery where</hi>; 2. <hi>with pure hands</hi>; 3. <hi>without wrath</hi>; 4. <hi>without doubting.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alwayes.</hi>] To pray alwayes, is to consecrate euery day and night to God by Prayer: and besides, to pray vpon all occasions, with lifting vp our harts vnto God; or by vsing short prayers, which they haue beene wont to call <hi>Eiaculations.</hi> Neyther was it the dutie of <hi>Paul</hi> onely, to pray alwayes, that is, to keepe a set order of Prayers; but it is our dutie also to set apart time euery day, euening and morning, to pray vnto God our selues, and our house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds. And because these exercises of Religion are by the most wholy neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,<note place="margin">Reasons to warrant pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euery day.</note> and in roome of it, vile prophanenesse staines mens houses, I will here set downe, by the way, some few reasons to warrant a daily set course <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of praying. First, our Sauiour CHRIST teacheth vs to pray for <hi>the bread of the day,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.11.</note> 
                           <hi>euery day</hi>: as God will not promise vs bread for a weeke, a month, a yeere; so neyther will God accept of a prayer for the necessities of a weeke, month or yeere before hand, but will haue vs make as much conscience to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> pray daily, as wee haue sence of daily wants. Secondly, wee are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>pray continually</hi> 
                           <note n="s" place="margin">1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.17.</note>: now, what sence can be probably giuen of these words, if that a daily set course of prayer be not included. Thirdly, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Saints prayed euery day, an auncient practise some thousand of yeeres agoe; <hi>Dauid</hi> prayed <hi>seauen times a day</hi>; and <hi>Daniell, three times a day.</hi> Let wicked and prophane people say, what needes all this prayer; but let vs be assured, that as holinesse and grace growes in any, so are they more abundant in this worship of prayer: the holiest men haue euer prayed most: for though they haue not most neede, yet they haue alwayes most sence of their owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> needes and others to. Fourthly, if our foode must be euery day sanctified by the exercise of the Word and Prayer, then much more haue wee neede to sanctifie our selues,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2.</note> our housholds, our callings, and our labours by daily Prayer.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Lastly, Prayer is called <hi>Incense</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Now the Iewes held it an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination of desolation,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 141.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 51.17.</note> if the morning and euening Sacrifice were wanting: neyther doe wee lesse need to seeke daily the benefits of the attonement made by the sacrifice of Christ, and his intercession; then did the Iewes: and wee are euery way as much bound, as often to professe our faith in CHRIST slaine, as they did in Christ to be slaine.</p>
                        <p>And thus of the demonstratiue and vndeniable signes of the Apostles loue to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> as they are generally set downe in this Verse.</p>

                           <hi>Of Faith.</hi>] In the handling of the Doctrine of <hi>Faith,</hi> I consider it: First, in the coherence,<note place="margin">Diuers things concerning Faith, noted from the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence.</note> as it stands in the Text: Secondly, as it is in it selfe apart from that which went before or comes after.

                        <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The sorts of Faith.</note> there are diuers sorts of Faith: I will not speake of Faith <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> or <hi>speciall, infused,</hi> or <hi>acquired, formed</hi> and <hi>vnformed,</hi> but leaue them to the troublesome Schoole-men; onely I rest in the vsuall distribution which hath ground in Scripture: thus Faith is <hi>Historicall, Temporary,</hi> of <hi>Miracles,</hi> and <hi>iustifying.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>First,<note place="margin">Historicall Faith.</note> 
                           <hi>Historicall Faith</hi> is to beleeue the doctrine of the word of GOD to be true: and therein is supernaturall, and differeth from all humane know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whatsoeuer; neyther is it in the power of Nature alone to perswade men that the Scriptures are Gods Word, further then the remnants of Gods former Image doe giue a glimpse of it, and is cleared by the spirit of generall illumination.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Historicall Faith</hi> doth both vnderstand the Doctrine, and giue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent that it is true, yet doth not iustifie: and therefore their case is so much the more fearefull, that haue not so much as their ignorance any way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed, nor gotten so much as any knowledge by the Word of God.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21380:27"/>
they neuer had the particular assurance of Gods fauour in forgiuenesse of sinnes, nor will be brought to dislike, much lesse to humble their soules for those speciall sinnes wherein they haue transgressed, but nourish some one particular presumptuous sinne or sinnes, which raigning in them doth wholy engrosse and take vp that inward worship which is due to God onely. And this is the Faith of our better sort of people.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>So that, wouldest thou trie thy Faith? consider then what it is that thou makest thy refuge, and the foundation of thy comfort. What is it that thou most labourest after? is it the assurance of Gods fauour, by the application of Christ? is it the distinct applying of such and such promises of life in Scripture? dost thou liue by thy Faith in the course of life? if so thou hast met with the right Faith, without Christ it is not possible to attaine the chiefe good, neyther is it enough to beleeue that Christ dyed for sinners, &amp;c. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we labour in the day of our visitation, for the certaine and particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of the efficacie and merit of Christs righteousnesse, for the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular assurance of Gods fauour in remitting such and such our transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And because it is not easie at all times to discerne by the working of the Spirit of Adoption, the imputation of righteousnesse from Christ, therefore hath the Lord discussed the cases of conscience so comfortable in Scripture, that if men examine themselues before the conditions of God promises, they may finde in diuers of them the cleare determining of their estate. Here may be iustly taxed the grosse ouer-sight and securitie of many, otherwise the deare Seruants of God, that are no better acquainted with the promises of life, vpon the truth of which depends their happinesse, and both present and future comfort. And lastly, by the same Faith, whereby the iust are saued, by the selfe-same they liue in the course of life in this world: the ground of his Faith for his preseruation, is the prouidence of his God, whiles the men of this world wonderfully please themselues in sacrificing to their nets, ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing in their affections, the stay of their maintenance, vnto their labour, friends, inheritance, &amp;c.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The Parts of Faith.</note>Secondly, that the nature of this Faith may yet be further opened, the <hi>Parts</hi> of it must be considered. Faith is eyther in the minde, or in the heart; and by the change of both it may be discerned.</p>

                        <p>It may not be dissembled,<note place="margin">Desire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue is of the nature of faith.</note> that there are in the world many definitiues or descriptions of Faith, such as doe not comprehend in them that onely thing which is the chiefe stay of thousands of the deare Seruants of God; and that is, <hi>Desires,</hi> which may not be denyed to be of the nature of Faith. I expresse my meaning thus: that when a man or woman is so farre exercised in the spirituall seeking of the Lord his God, that he would be willing to part with the world, and all the things thereof, if hee had them in his owne possession, so that by the Spirit and Promises of God he might be assured, that the sinnes of his former life, or such as presently doe burthen his Soule, were forgiuen him; and that hee might beleeue that God were now become his God in Christ: I would not doubt to pronounce that this person (thus prising re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes at this rate, that he would sell all to buy this Pearle.) did vndoubtedly beleeue, not onely because it is a truth (though a Paradoxe) that the <hi>Desire</hi> to beleeue is Faith: but also because our Sauiour Christ doth not doubt to affirme that they are blessed that <hi>hunger and thirst after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           <hi>Fiduce,</hi> or <hi>Confidence</hi> in the hart, is a part of Faith, and shewes it selfe in this, when the Soule resteth vpon Christ, and the Promises of God, as the onely ground of all that happinesse which he must euer get vnto himselfe.</p>

                           <hi>Perswasion,</hi> or an apprehending application is the last thing in Faith, and that in the beginnings of Faith, is more in the power of the Spirit then in the sence and feeling of the conscience; yet herein it appeares, that though the Soule be tost with many temptations, and feares, and terrors, yet more or lesse, one time or other, they are much refreshed with a sweet ioy arising they know not how, from the very perswasion, that they belong to God in and for Christ.</p>
                        <p>So that if wee would try our Faith, we must examine what Knowledge we haue gotten, what Iudgement of the way of life, what Desires wee haue of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, how our hearts are setled, and what it is that supports vs.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, it preserues from many fearefull spirituall diseases in the soule: hence commeth that Metaphoricall speech of being <hi>sound or whole,</hi>

                           <pb n="27" facs="tcp:21380:28"/>Secondly, it preserues vs against the vse of ill meanes: for, <hi>He that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> maketh not hast.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">

It is most difficult for an vnsanctified minde to forbeare eyther time or meanes when profit and pleasure intise.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, how miserable is our life here many times in respect of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> with which Sathan doth fire vs?<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.16.</note> Now if there were in vs consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble respect of certaine application of Gods fauour, there is a secret power in Faith, <hi>as an Helmet,</hi> not onely to keepe off, but extinguish <hi>the fiery darts of the Diuell.</hi> And the true reason why our life is continually assaulted, and why the world lyeth vanquished vnder a thousand miseries, is onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men doe not labour for a particular assurance of Gods loue in CHRIST, which being once had, wee should soone see an happy <hi>victory ouer the World,</hi> Hell, and Death, in respect of the beginnings of many heauenly contentments.</p>
                        <p>In the third place we are to consider the benefits which the weakest Faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> obtayneth: and they are especially sixe.</p>
                        <p>First, it <hi>iustifies</hi> and giues vs a portion in the most meritorious intercession <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of Christ at the right hand of God; it is no sooner had but it makes the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner iust before God: this is euery where proued.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it gathereth men into the <hi>family of Abraham,</hi> and that as <hi>Sonnes,</hi>

                        <p>Thirdly, it makes men not onely the Sonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but <hi>the Sonnes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of God also by Adoption.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, by Faith the Sonne of God, by an invtterable presence, doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                           <hi>dwell in the hearts of the Sonnes of men.</hi>

                        <p>Fiftly, the meanest Faith, that is a true Faith, doth euer come attended with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> many holy Graces:<note place="margin">

                        <p>Lastly, Faith according to the measure of it, is the foundation of all the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> hope that makes men happy:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11.1.</note> therefore it is called the <hi>ground of the things which are hoped for, and the euidence of things not seene.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, if men would labour for the increase of Faith, and once get a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> certainetie concerning Gods fauour, they might enioy many blessings more then they doe, euen in this life.</p>
                        <p>First, it might <hi>be vnto vs according to our faith:</hi> what greater indulgence can <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be desired from God?<note place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, men might <hi>liue by their Faith,</hi> that is, they might haue from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> their Faith continually arguments both of comfort and direction,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5.</note> euen in their carriage about the things of this life.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, wee might haue the sence of peace with God, accesse vnto Grace,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wherein we might stand,<note place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, there is a power in Faith to put such life into the sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that they would be able <hi>to make vs wise,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Fiftly, how hard a thing it is for the Creature to haue accesse vnto the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Creator with any boldnesse or confidence, the lamentable experience of the world shewes; insomuch that the Apostle saith, we are naturally <hi>without God

And how vnspeakeable a mercy it is to haue a comfortable communion with God, and easie accesse for our prayers, the Saints may conceiue but not vtter.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, by Faith wee might be <hi>able to ouercome the world</hi>; so as wee might easily contemne the glory of earthly things,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.4.</note> the Millions of euill examples and scandals, the thousands of temptations, allurements, disswasiues, letts, and impediments, which the world casteth in our way, and with which wee are often entangled, insnared, and many times most shamefully vanquished, to the dishonour of God and our Religion, the wounding of our Profession and our Consciences, &amp;c.

                        <p>First, because wee haue a Sauiour, in respect of merit, both in suffering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and dying, able to deliuer vs, his <hi>Redemption</hi> being both <hi>precious</hi> and <hi>plentifull.</hi>

                        <p>There are fiue especiall <hi>Errors,</hi> with any of which whosoeuer is infected, Faith is letted.</p>
                        <p>First, when men thinke they are bound to follow their Callings, and to mind their worldly Imployments; and therfore cannot spend the time about thinking of Sermons,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Luke</hi> 14.16.</note> &amp;c. Our Sauiour, <hi>Luke</hi> 14 16. in the Parable, showes, that though men giue Heauen fayre words, yet they take not a course to get it: but what letts them?

                           <pb n="31" facs="tcp:21380:30"/>Secondly, a second <hi>Error</hi> letting Faith, is a close opinion of merit, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> stickes fast in our nature.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Faith is hindered, when the Minde is fore-stalled with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that an outward seruing of God will serue to bring them neare enough to God.<note place="margin">

                        <p>Fourthly, many therefore neuer labour to get Faith, because they thinke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it is impossible to take any such course, that they should get any assurance of the remission of their sinnes in this life, or if it be possible for others, yet it is not for them.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, others thinke it possible to be had, and it is good to be humbled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> so farre as to seeke it with teares and prayers; and they thinke they doe well that will not giue ouer, till they haue comfort that way, but yet they thinke all this adoe vnnecessary, and that they may be saued without it.</p>
                        <p>In the <hi>Heart</hi> Faith is letted fiue wayes.<note place="margin">Letts in the heart.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, when men nourish the secret euils of their hearts, both in thoughts and affections, and make not conscience to repent for them. An euill heart is alwayes an vnfaithfull heart;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12.13.</note> therefore men are exhorted to <hi>take heede of being hardened through the deceitfulnesse of sinne.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Worldlinesse</hi> is a great lett of Faith, when men alone suffer their thoughts and affections to be taken vp with continuall minding of things here below, though they cannot be charged with any great couetousnesse.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, there is in mens affections an <hi>vnwillingnesse</hi> to part with worldly pleasures and delights, and they are loath to lose their credit with their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall friends, which they say they must doe if they take this course.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the world is full of <hi>common hope</hi> and presumption of Gods mercy: men say, God is mercifull, when they haue neyther comfort from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God, nor ground of assurance, nor witnes of the Spirit of Adoption.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, Faith is letted, and men are kept from vsing the meanes to get Faith, and to seeke God while he may be found, onely through a <hi>feare</hi> least if they should examine themselues, and search whether they had a true faith or not, they should finde they had none, and then they should be troubled, and driuen vnto Melancholy despayre, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Lets in conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.</note> there are some things in mens carriage which greatly lett and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Faith.</p>
                        <p>First, <hi>a prophane contempt of the word of God,</hi> eyther men will not heare, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> but by starts, or they attend not, or not apply it to themselues, or not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate of the doctrine afterwards, or not labour for the power of it in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>the example of the multitude</hi> hinders much <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Math.</hi> 7.13.14 <hi>Luke</hi> 13.23.24.</note>, especially the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of wise-men and great-men in the world <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.45. <hi>to</hi> 50.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, some when they goe about the duties of Mortification and Faith, they are turned off before they get Faith; eyther because they finde hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart, or are ouer-charged with temptations or doubts of audience <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and acceptance, and that God will neuer looke after such broken desires, &amp;c. or else because they haue not comfort presently, they grow desperate and say they shall haue none at all, or else are vanquished with thoughts of Atheisme iniected, which many times preuailes so strongly, that they can hardly be recouered againe to any care to labour for Faith, till eyther bitter crosses or feare of Death or Hell awaken them.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, <hi>Closenesse</hi> is a great cause of want of Faith, when people will not discouer their doubts and feares, especially to their Pastors being wise and mercifull, and yet know not what to doe, and cannot get information from publike hearing. Here may be taken vp a iust complaint of the strangenesse

                           <note place="margin">The signes of Faith.</note>First, that before Faith can be wrought, the heart must be mollified by afflictions, by the continuall dropping of the word of God, by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our miserie, by Legall feare, or lastly, by terrors from God.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, before Faith can appeare, Repentance will shew it selfe, and that especially in two things:</p>
                        <p>First, in godly Sorrow for sinne past.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, in the change of the thoughts, affections and life.</p>
                        <p>As for godly Sorrow, it may not be denied, but that it may be without terrours in some, but neuer so easie in any, but these three things are true: 1. That they grieue because they cannot grieue. 2. They hate their speciall sinnes. 3. They reforme both inwardly and outwardly.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Faith, after the softning of the heart and Repentance, shewes it selfe in sixe things: First, in an honourable opinion ready <hi>to beleeue all the word of God,</hi> though it make neuer so much against our pleasure or profit. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the <hi>Combate</hi> betweene the flesh and spirit. Thirdly, by the <hi>holy Desires</hi> after remission of sinnes, and holinesse of life, witnessed by constant Prayers, and diligent vse of the meanes. Fourthly, by a fixed <hi>Resolution,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vpon the way of God, though they finde not comfort presently. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the forsaking of the world, and pleasures of sinne <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25.</note>. Lastly, by the purging out of the euils of the thoughts and affections <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9.</note>. As for Ioy, Peace, Thankefulnesse, Admiration, Loue, and Desire to conuert others, &amp;c. they belong to Faith growne, not so apparantly to Faith begunne.</p>

The defects of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants Faith.</note>Lastly, here might iustly be taxed the defects and wants that are found in the common Protestant. The Faith of the Protestant at large, is faultie: First, because hee knowes no time of spirituall birth, and yet he can tell to a day when he was borne in nature. Secondly, they seeke not vnto the meanes spirituall to get Faith. Thirdly, they rest in other things in stead of Faith, as Knowledge, Hope, &amp;c. Fourthly, their Faith is commonly eyther Historicall or Temporarie; for eyther it is enough to beleeue that Christ dyed for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or else if they beleeue the Articles of the Creede to be true, and be no Papists, but sound in the matter of Iustification, and receiue the Sacrament, especially when they are sicke, all is well, or if they beleeue the word of God to be true, or especially if they can be willing to heare Sermons, &amp;c. Fiftly, they regard not Gods promises to apply them, nor to liue by Faith, they hold both to be absurd. Sixtly, they want the iudgement that Diuines call <hi>the Iudgement of goodnesse.</hi> Lastly, they doe not beleeue that application is of the nature of Faith.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Heard of.</hi>] In that their graces are heard of, and by seuerall relation the fame of them is spread, foure things may be obserued.</p>
                        <p n="1">
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Obser.</hi> 1. Grace will be heard of, and obserued, if it be true Grace.</note>1 It is hard to haue any sauing grace, but it will be perceiued and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that for diuers causes:</p>
                        <p>First, Grace cannot be without fruit externall, and <hi>by their fruit yee shall know them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, God doth not ordinarily giue sauing Grace, but it is gotten in or after some great affliction. A man may get much generall knowledge, and goe farre in a temporary Faith, without any great paine or perplexitie, but the paines of trauaile doe vsually accompany the birth of any sauing Grace.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21380:31"/>
Neyther is there any such hearkening after a childe borne in nature, as there is after an afflicted conscience now ready to be deliuered of any eternall Grace.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Grace cannot be receiued but it workes a great change and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of disposition and practise, of affection and carriage, it will worke an alteration generall, inward and outward. Now all this stirre in reforming is lyable to obseruation.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, the Diuell vsually lyeth still whiles men please themselues with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the effects of <hi>Historicall</hi> and <hi>Temporary</hi> Faith, because they feed presumption; but so soone as <hi>Iustifying Faith</hi> is got in the least measure, and workes by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying both the heart and life from beloued sinnes (though it worke neuer so weakely) he bestirres himselfe and his agents by carnall counsell, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, reproaches, slanders, difficulties, and a thousand deuises, to make this birth <hi>painefull,</hi> and if it were possible, <hi>abortiue</hi>: the Flesh boyles, the Diuell darts fire by iniection, the World hatefully pursues and wonders at the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine restraint and retyring,<note place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>Lastly, the Graces of God are like Lampes on a hill in a darke night, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> like shining Pearles, and therefore cannot be hid.</p>

                           </note> first, for confutation of their resolution that will serue God, but it must be secretly; they will be sincere, but they like not to doe it so as euery body may note them; they will goe to heauen, but for ease, it must be in a fether-bed,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Indiscretion</hi> not the cause of the reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of true Christians.</note> and for closenesse it must be out of their Closets: these men meane to steale their passage; and these kinde of people commonly thinke, that the true cause why others are so talked of is, their indiscretion, and rash and needlesse thrusting out of themselues into obseruation; but in the whole businesse they deceiue themselues: for it is not possible to be friends with God and the World; to haue GOD, his Word, People, and Spirit, to witnesse to vs, and to haue the World to praise and applaud vs. And for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion,</hi> it is a preiudice let fall by the Diuell, and taken vp by carnall men without considering that reproachfull obseruation hath beene the lot of the wisest and holiest Saints that euer liued; yea, the portion of the Prince of the Saints. Secondly, it may be an especiall comfort to all the Seruants of God, that finde their names encountred with straying reports, and the World sodainely bent against them round about, when yet many times they rather finde purposes then practises of Grace. I say, they may gather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts diuersly: first, it is the portion of all Gods people: secondly, it is a signe they are now no more carnall persons; for, if they were of the world, <hi>the World would not thus hate his owne:</hi>

                        <p>A Question in the second place may be propounded: and that is how <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> their Faith can be heard of?<note place="margin">

                        </p>

                              <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.</note> It furthers <hi>our gathering into the bodie:</hi> It is an exceeding great helpe in the beginning of our effectuall vocation: Secondly, it furthers our <hi>edification</hi> in the building, and fits vs for our roome among the Saints. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly society doth frame vs and square vs, and many wayes fit vs for our place in this building: Thirdly, louing affection to the members of Christ and mutuall society doth much profit vs, in respect of <hi>our growth in the body:</hi> and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21380:35"/>
that till we <hi>become perfect men,</hi>

                           <hi>and attaine to the age of the fulnesse of Christ:</hi> Fourthly, this holy loue is a great fence to the iudgement against false and deceitfull doctrine: he is not easily <hi>carried with euery winde of doctrine,</hi> nor vnsetled with the vaine deceits of men, that can <hi>follow the truth,</hi> and the meanes thereof in a setled and well grounded <hi>loue</hi> to Gods children. But on the other side, how easily are such men deluded and throwne off from their purposes and comforts that did neuer ioyne themselues to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?</p>
                        <p>The second place is, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4.7.8. where the Apostle exhorteth to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie in the vse of the profits and delights of the world in meates and drinkes, riches, recreations and apparell, and withall to spend their time heere in spirituall duties, especially Prayer; watching thereunto, both to obserue all occasions and opportunities to pray, as also noting the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God wee finde in Prayer, with our owne corruptions in the maner, and the glorious successe of prayer, in preuayling with God: But aboue <hi>all things,</hi> he wills them <hi>to haue feruent loue:</hi> and yeeldeth two reasons or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues; first, <hi>the end of all things is at hand:</hi> and therefore it is best louing and making much of those, that after the dissolution shall be great heires of heauen and earth: secondly, <hi>Loue couereth the multitude of sinnes,</hi> it hideth the blemishes of our natures, and fitteth vs for the comforts of Society. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the infirmities accompany euen the Saints while they are in this vale of misery.</p>
                        <p>The third place is, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. &amp;c. where he largely perswadeth men to get holy graces into their hearts, and to expresse holy duties in their liues: among these, as chiefe, he instanceth in <hi>brotherly kindnes and loue</hi>; to this end he brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth diuers reasons: first, it will set our knowledge a worke, which else would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be <hi>idle and vnfruitfull</hi>;<note place="margin">

                              <hi>Verse</hi> 10.</note> doe <hi>make our calling and election sure</hi>: Fiftly, louing society and brotherly kindnes is a great means of perseuerance, if <hi>ye doe these things ye shal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> neuer fall</hi>: Lastly, by this means <hi>an entrance shall be ministred vnto vs aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> into the euerlasting kingdome of our Lord Iesus Christ</hi>;<note place="margin">

                        <p>Thus farre of the Motiues;<note place="margin">The helpes.</note> Helps follow. These helpes are such as serue both for the begetting &amp; nourishing of a holy loue, to &amp; with Gods people.</p>
                        <p>There are eight things that are great furtherances of holy life.</p>
                        <p>First, the conscionable hearing of the word of God, for in Gods house <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> doth the Loue fire the heart and holy affections, and teach the right orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them. How came those <hi>Colossians</hi> by their loue to the Saints, no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise but by hearing the word of truth, which discouered vnto them who were Gods children, and did daily fence them, against the scornes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches which the world laded them withall.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, we must get faith and hope as the coherence shewes: for till we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> be soundly humbled to seeke Gods fauor, and find our harts possessed with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21380:36"/>
the care for &amp; hope of a better life, we cannot receiue Gods children aright into our hearts: But no man was euer truly touched in conscience, and had vnfained desires of remission of his sinnes. Neither did euer a man seriously seeke after the things of a better life, but he did loue Gods children aboue all the people of the earth: and it is true of the measure, that as we grow in faith and hope, so we should grow in loue and in the comforts of Gods fauour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22.</note>Thirdly, would we loue brotherly, without faining, and feruently; then we must get our <hi>soules purified, through the spirit, in obeying the truth .i.</hi> we must make conscience of the duties of <hi>mortification</hi> (as of so many purges) to clense our thoughts &amp; affections, of dwelling and raigning lusts &amp; euils: for secret sins intertained and delighted in within the affections and thoughts do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly poyson affection both to God and man: this is that the Apostle meaneth where he saith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5.</note>

                           <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7.</note>Fourthly, we must <hi>stirre vp the spirit of loue.</hi> The spirit of God is a spirit of loue, and we must stir it vp by nourishing the motions of the same, putting courses or wayes of expressing loue into our minds; and by praier, meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any other meanes that may inflame our hearts to a holy affection.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</note>Fiftly, it profiteth much hereunto to get and keep in our minds, a <hi>patterne of faith and loue,</hi> euen a draught of the things that concerne faith in God, &amp; loue to the Saints: that we might alwaies haue a frame of all holy duties that concerne this holy affection: this was their care in the Primitiue times, as appeareth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</p>
                        <p>Sixtly, to be sound in these 3. things, Faith, Loue, and Patience, requires most an end Experience, and a daily acquainting our selues with the things of the Kingdome of Christ. When we are driuen by often crosses to seeke comfort in Gods children, and by much obseruation doe find the worth of the comforts that arise from holy Society with them; Many are the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible weakenesses that discouer themselues in the hearts of yonger and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Christians:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.2.</note> but it is a shame for the elder men, if they be <hi>not sound in loue, Tit.</hi> 2.2.</p>
                        <p>Seuenthly, we must by all holy means strengthen, and encourage, and set our selues vpon perseuerance in the profession of our hope,<note place="margin">

                        <p>Lastly, if we would neuer <hi>forsake the fellowship we haue one with another,</hi> as the manner of some wicked hypocrites and damnable Apostataes is, then we must with all Christian care, <hi>Consider one anothers</hi> weakenesses and wants; and be continually <hi>prouoking,</hi>

                        <p>Secondly, it appeares to be defectiue in the <hi>Obiects</hi> of Loue, in a chiefe <hi>Companion</hi> of Loue, in the <hi>Parts</hi> of Loue, and in the <hi>Manner</hi> of louing.</p>
                        <p>For the first: the onely men that are chiefely to be loued, and our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be spent vpon, are the Saints; that is, such religious persons as make conscience of all their wayes: but are these the men the common Protestant loues? Oh times! oh manners! what men finde worse entertainment in the world then these? Is not the least endeauour after holinesse chased and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued with open hates, dislikes, slanders? Can a man refraine himselfe from euill, and not be made a prey? Doth there any liue godly, and they perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him not? Away false wretch, saist thou, thou art in charitie with all men, and yet canst not beare the Image of God in a childe of God?</p>
                        <p>For the second: all true Loue ought to be accompanied with Faith; yea, it ought to be founded vpon Faith: and therefore herein is the common loue of the world defectiue, that a communion with men is not first sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by vnion with God. These men that boast so much of their charitie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer made conscience of seeking the assurance of Gods fauour in Christ, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euer trauailed vnder the burthen of their sinnes, so as to seeke forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as the true blessednesse.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the common Protestant is exceedingly to blame in the very maine duties of Loue; no tendernesse of heart, no true Hospitalitie, and for mercy to the poore the old complaints may be taken vp,<note place="margin">

                        <p>And for the last, it is easily auouched, that the Loue that is found in the most men, is neyther brotherly nor without grosse fayning and hypocrisie, nor proceedeth it from a heart in any measure purified; and lastly, it is so farre from being feruent, that it is stone colde.</p>

                        <p>There is an admirable Wisedome and Mercy of God, in the very manner of dispensing of his Graces; for hee makes one Grace crowne another, and become a recompence and reward to another: as here for Hopes sake Gods Children breake through the difficulties of Faith, and the impediments and discouragements of Loue. When God sees how many wayes the heart of man is beset in the spirituall combat, about the getting and exercise of those two Graces, hee is pleased by his Word and Spirit to trumpet out victorie by shewing the glory of heauen, and to set on the Crowne of Hope, as the assured pledge of full and finall victory: it is Hope that pluckes vp the heart of man to a constant desire of vnion with God by Faith, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with man by Loue. And the true reason why so many men vtterly neglect the care to get a iustifying Faith, and an inflamed Affection to Gods Children, is, because they haue no taste of the comforts of the euidence of a better life by Hope.</p>

                        <p>First, the true Hope layes fast hold vpon the merits of Iesus Christ onely,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and striues constantly <hi>to be established and assured</hi>

                        <p>Secondly, true Hope makes a man more humble, but the common Hope <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> makes men more wilfull and obstinate against God and his Ordinances.<note place="margin">

                        <p>Fourthly, the faithfull man can suffer for his Hope <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Acts</hi> 28.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24.</note>, but a wicked man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> can shew no chaine vnlesse it be for his sinne.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, true Hope rests vpon Gods promise, though neuer so vnlikely to be performed by outward and ordinarie meanes <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18.</note>; but wicked men with their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> common Hope are perhaps able to beleeue they shall liue well so long as they see and feele meanes, but without meanes they are without Hope.</p>
                        <p>Sixtly true Hope will <hi>acknowledge</hi> as well as <hi>know</hi>

                        <p>Seauenthly, true Hope is industrious in the vse of all meanes to come to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the end hoped;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.3.</note> but the common Hope is singularly sloathfull, it boasts of a sufficiencie of knowledge, and yet neglects the sincere vse of all Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; it affirmes deepely of going to heauen and yet cannot tell of one teare for sinne, nor one houre truely spent in mortification: but <hi>trust thou in the Lord, and doe good.</hi>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Lastly, the true Hope seekes Gods presence, and striues in sence to draw neare to God;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.26.</note> but the common Hope is then at best rest when the heart is furthest off from the care, desire, or sence of Gods presence, eyther in Gods house or abroad.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth thing that I obserue from the Coherence, concerning Hope, is the worth of the Grace. It is one of the three golden abiliments to adorne a Christian soule: and this I note the rather because it should moue vs to vse carefully and constantly all the meanes that serue to breed or increase true Hope in vs, and to get by prayer and practise all those things that cause Hope: and that wee may get and increase our Hope, wee must labour for: First, <hi>true Grace,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.16.

                           </note> it is a Doctrine of wonderfull comfort to Gods Children <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.20.</note>; ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this the peculiar aduancement of some principall Saints, as <hi>Abraham, Dauid</hi>

                              <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.</note> from hence also doth plainely arise this second Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> that the hope of Christians is in another world; there is their stay and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. When they seeke by Faith the comforts of Gods fauours, and by Loue seperate themselues to the communion with Gods Children, they finde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently such a rent from the world, and all sorts of carnall men assaulting so their rest, that a little experience learnes them the knowledge of this truth, that in this world,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24.25.</note> and from the men of this world, and the things thereof, they must looke for no peace or contentment.</p>

                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13.</note> yea, therefore as <hi>strangers and Pilgrimes we should seeke and prouide for our abiding Citie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2.</note> this Doctrine giues occasion to answere that imputation that is cast vpon many professors, <hi>viz.</hi> that forwardnesse in Religion makes them mindlesse of their businesse; and much hearing of Sermons makes them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of their callings. Men may here-hence informe themselues, that howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer Religion tyes men to honest cares and daily diligence to prouide for their families (else the very Scripture brands such Professors to be worse then Infidels, that make Religion a maske for idlenesse) yet seeing our hope is not in the world, therefore Gods Children doe well first and chiefely to seeke the Kingdome of God and the righteousnesse thereof; and so to minde an earthly calling as it hinder not an heauenly, and prouide meanes for a temporall life, as not to hinder the hope of an eternall life.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3.</note> this Doctrine may much settle and comfort Gods Children against the scornes and hates of the World and all sorts of carnall people, <hi>the World will loue his owne.</hi>

                              <hi>Vse</hi> 1.</note>The vse of this point is, First, for instruction: <hi>Let him that heareth heare</hi>

                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.16.17</note>.<note place="margin">2.</note> Secondly, for humiliation; vnder the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the lamentable estate of such people as haue not the Word preached vnto them. How doe the thousands, euen in Israell, perish through the failing or wanting of Vision? Is there not almost millions of Men and Women that haue scarce heard (by preaching) whether there be any holy Ghost? Oh the cruell torments that abide those soule-murtherers! Shall I name them? I wish their repentance, that so they might haue a new name; but because lamentable experience shewes that the vnsauory Salt seldome findes wherewith it may be salted; therefore it is the dutie of all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to bowe the knees of their hearts to God, beseeching him to inflame the hearts of those that are in authoritie, with such bowels of compassion, that they would in due time purge the Church of them, that so their names may no more be heard amongst vs. Whiles men lye sicke of the spirituall Lethargy in their owne hearts, they are little troubled with the distresse of others; but if men would euen in Gods sight duly waigh, without shifting and preiudice, these propositions, <hi>viz,</hi> that <hi>the hearing of the Word is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary meanes to conuert mens soules to God,</hi> Rom. 10.14. 1 Pet. 1.23. &amp;c.

Thirdly, for the reproofe of the disorders and vitious dispositions of men in the hearing of the Word. Many are the sorts of euill hearers: exceeding many are the wicked humours of men, by which they sinne against the Word heard: the Scripture hath noted and taxed diuers corruptions in men, in hearing, and fearefully threatened them. For the better explication of this vse I consider two things; First, the sorts of euill hearers: Secondly, their state in respect of it.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The sorts of euill hearers.</note>The sorts of euill hearers may be distinguished into two kindes: some are openly impious and audacious; some more ciuill and restrained. Of the first kinde. First, some are so wayward nothing can please them, eyther the Preacher is too terrible, or he is too comfortable. <hi>If</hi> Iohn <hi>fast, he hath a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, if Christ eate, he is a glutton</hi> 
                           <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.12.</note>: Men are so wedded to their owne conceits, and stuffed with preiudice, that they many times wilfully study, and striue to frame scandale and offence out of the words of the Teacher. Thirdly, Some heare, and are <hi>filled with wrath and enuie,</hi> and that sometimes so as they cannot restraine the signes of their rage and fretting, no not in the Sermon-time <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Luke</hi> 4.24.</note>. <hi>They gnash with their teeth, and their harts are ready to burst for anger</hi>

Sixtly, Some heare, and if they finde any power in the Doctrine of the Preacher, they enquire whether hee be not a Puritane; for they haue heard so much euill of that Sect euery where, that that one colour may serue to make them cautelous, and better aduised then to be much troubled with his Doctrine <note n="l" place="margin">
                              <hi>Acts</hi> 28.22.</note>. Seuenthly, Some will heare <hi>if he speake of this world</hi> 
                           <note n="m" place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.5.</note>: He is an excellent Preacher, that in their vnderstanding giues them libertie, and <hi>sowe pillowes vnder their</hi> fleshly and worldly <hi>elbowes.</hi> Eyghtly, Some heare fearfully, as loath to be drawne to the Sermon of any that rebukes sinne, as the people of Israel were to come nere the Mount <note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.19.</note>. Ninthly, (like the chiefe Priests and Pharises) when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that the Preacher rebukes their sinnes, seeke to lay hands vpon him <note n="o" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.45.46</note>, and as farre as the feare of the people restraineth them not, they practise to remoue him.</p>
                        <p>The ciuiller sorts of hearers are diuersly sinfull in their seuerall humors: First, some heare but it is to be rid of their diseases, that is, to see whether by heering Sermons, and comming to Church, they can asswage the trouble of their minds, and dull the stinging cares of their hearts. Secondly, some are like the young man, for they goe from the Sermon sorry that the word requireth such things as they are not willing to doe <note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.</note>. Thirdly, Some heare and say, <hi>God forbid</hi> 
                           <note n="q" place="margin">
                              <hi>Luke</hi> 20 76.</note>: It is pitty it should be so as the Preacher sayes. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Some heare because a great report goeth of the Teacher <note n="r" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.8.</note>. Fiftly, But aboue all others, they are straying hearers that are mentioned <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.22. they heare and admire, and yet leaue and forsake for any reformation or practise of what they heare.</p>
                        <p>Vnder this rancke I may referre the three sorts of hearers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. The first sort suffer the Diuell presently to take away the Word. The second sort choake it with cares and lusts. The third forsakes the profession, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and liking of it, in the time of temptation or persecution. Thus of their sorts.</p>
                        <p>The state of men transgressing against the Word,<note place="margin">The misery of euill hearers.</note> by refusing to heare it aright, is exceeding fearefull; if they could see their miserie they would doe as the Prophets require, they would cut their haire and cast it away, vnder the sence of the horror of Gods indignation <note n="s" place="margin">

                        <p>First, that it is the very word of God, and therefore true: considering the admirable antiquitie of the Storie before all other Histories: the dreadfull miracles by which it was confirmed: the certaine euent of the vaticinies or prophesies, the immutable and euery way sufficient frame of pietie, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and diuine worship, contained in it: the durablenesse of the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome thereof, which no punishments could euer extort out of the hearts of the professors thereof: and lastly, the dreadfull iudgements vpon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of it.</p>

                        <p>For Instruction, therefore wee should labour that the Word may be a Word of Truth to vs, and to this end; First, we should pray God to giue vs the spirit of Truth, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16 13. Secondly, we must repent, that we may come to the knowledge of the Truth, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. Thirdly, we may not test in the forme of Truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.22.</p>
                        <p>For Reproofe of foure sorts of men. First, such as will not receiue the loue of the Truth: With these gaine is godlines, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.10.12. Secondly, such as strangle the light of the Truth eyther of Nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or the Word; and with-hold it in vnrighteousnes, that striue against the light of the truth in their hearts, that they might sinne the more freely, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. Thirdly, such as will not obey the Truth, which yet they admire, commend, affect, &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. &amp; 5.7. Fourthly, such as by their wicked liues cause the way of Truth to be blasphemed, which Truth they both heare, and professe to obey. Thus of the second part of the description.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the word of God is described by the kind of word, <hi>viz.</hi> the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Which is the Gospell</hi>] By the Gospell is ment the Doctrine of the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of Man with his God after the fall.<note place="margin">The doctrine of a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, is principally to be taught and learned.</note> Concerning the Gospell, wee may in the generall here obserue; That of all other Doctrines, the Doctrine of a mans Reconciliation with God, is especially to be vrged and explained by the Preacher, and to be most minded and enquired into by the hearer. The knowledge and experience of this point acquaints a man with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing power of God: neuer doe men indeed see the beauty of the feet of Gods seruants,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15.</note> till they haue trauelled about the obtaining of their peace with God. If Ministers would bend the very force of their ministeries, about the sound and daily inforcing of the Doctrine of mans particular as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of his peace and reconciliation, it would produce, by Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, singular fruit. This Doctrine would iudge the very secrets of men, and giue them a glimpse of their last doome. It is a most preuailing Doctrine, and therefore extreamely enuied in the world. The high Priests and Scribes with the Elders of the people many times shew they can not abide it, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.1. Hence it is that life is not deare vnto Gods faithfull seruants, so they may in the comfort thereof fulfill their course and ministration, receaued of the Lord Iesus, in testifying the Gospell of the grace of God <note n="x" place="margin">
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 20.24.</note>.

                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore we should striue to keepe afoot the sparkles of light in this point, and whatsoeuer we loose in hearing, this Doctrine should neuer <hi>runne out.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In particular, concerning the Gospell, I enquire into three things. First, wherein this Doctrine lieth. Secondly, who receiue this Doctrine of the Gospell. Thirdly, what are the effects of it.</p>

                        <p>First, in our true repentance for our sinnes, and secondly in the infallible assurance of faith in Gods fauour, in Christ, forgiuing vs our sinnes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.15. and this duly waighed, First, reproues those that dreame of saluation, and the benefits of the Gospell without mortification: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it should teach vs to nourish faith by all meanes, by nourishing of desires; by remouing of lets; praying for it; waiting vpon hearing; behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the faith of Gods children, and deliuering vp our soules to some able and wise Pastor.</p>

                           </note>The consideration hereof should much encourage Ministers to presse this Doctrine, and neuer cease to preach it in the Temple, and from house to house, and make vse of all opportunities when a dore is opened vnto them; eyther in respect of power in their owne hearts, or in respect of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse and affection, and desire in the people <note n="i" place="margin">

Gods people also should so labour for the assurance of Gods fauor, and peace in Christ by the word, as they should store their hearts with prouision of that kinde, not onely for their death-bed when they dye, but renue the perswasion of it in their hearts daily, the better to fit them, euen in their callings &amp; speciall standings. This knowledge is not onely a Crowne and shield for their heads, but shoes also for their feet, against the filth of the times, &amp; thorny cares of the world, and all the difficulties of a daily diligence in their standings <note n="k" place="margin">

                        <p>The manner of prouidence in planting it amongst them, in these words.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And is come vnto you.</hi>] Where wee may obserue, that if the meanes of happinesse finde not vs out to worke vpon vs,<note place="margin">God sends the Word before we seeke it.</note> we would neuer looke after it: if God were not more carefull to send it, then we to seeke it, it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be had. Wee see this by common experience, that whole multitudes of people liue without any sence of the want of the Word, and did not God by some great prouidence send it them, and perswade them to the vse of it; it would neuer be had: and this comes to passe because men are dead in sinne, and sicke of a lethurgie in the very vse of the light of Nature, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of godlinesse; and besides, there is an incredible inclination in our Natures to seeke for contentment in things below, and to be pleased with any condition, rather then soundly to digest a sence of the necessitie of vsing the meanes for happinesse in better things. And lastly, this neglect of seeking the Word, comes from errours about mens estate, while they thinke that they may be in Gods fauour, and like enough to be saued, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any such adoe.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the fourth part.</p>
                        <p>The fift thing in the description is, the subiect persons to whom the Gospell came, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Colossians, and all the World.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="55" facs="tcp:21380:42"/>
                           <hi>Vnto you, as it is euen vnto all the World.</hi>] Hence wee may note, First, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Truth of God in his promises: hee promised flourishing Churches of the Gentiles; and loe, it is effected: the Word is gone out into all the World. Secondly, That the true tryall of all Doctrine is by inquiring, whether it be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> agreeable to that Doctrine wherein the world was ouercome to GOD. Though an Angell from Heauen should preach otherwise,<note place="margin">A triall of Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note> yet his Doctrine were to be detested as accursed <note n="l" place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.</note>. And therefore wee may iustly complaine of the <hi>Papists,</hi> and all popish men that chaine men downe to a necessitie of looking vpon the hundreds of yeeres neere vnto vs, and will not beare it that men should seeke ground for their Conscience, by ouer looking all the hundreds of yeeres since Christ, and minding onely conformitie to the Doctrine that first founded the Churches of the Gentiles; all Doctrines since then, though in the purest times, are to be receiued no further then they agree with the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Men must seeke the word whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it may be had.</note> that men are bound to seeke the word wheresoeuer it may be heard: for if this had not beene so, how could all the World receiue the light of the Gospell? and further, wee may see that the want of Teachers was no warrant to commit the Churches to the care of such as could not teach; a necessitie lieth in the people to seeke the word where it may be had. And therfore those Church-gouernours sinne grieuously, that in this light, create so many insufficient men, and set them ouer the flocks of CHRIST. For if want of able men had beene a reason, the Apostles should haue seene into this necessitie, to ease the labour and care of the Churches, but it is a more grieuous sinne to admit, ordaine, and place them, and yet see many worthy and able men wholy want places.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">All the world cannot signifie euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man in the world.</note> wee might here note the vanitie of their argument that would proue vniuersall grace, because Christ died for all men; for in this place here is not onely the world, but all the world; and yet here can not in any reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sence be ment all the singular men and women in the world; for there were many thousands of particular persons, to whom the Gospell came not, and therefore by all the world (as here, so in that question) may be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood all the Elect world: or if the world vniuersally, then it is true in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of offer, or not excepting out of any of any Nation; or by all the world is ment men of all sorts and conditions in the world.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">The swiftnesse and power of the Gospell.</note> Wee might here note the incredible power and swiftnesse of the Gospell, that could ouercome, and that in so short a time; and the rather if that we consider that the Magistrates generally drew the sword against it, and there were not wanting Ministers to oppugne it, euen false teachers of all sorts: and besides, the people had beene so long time settled in their false Religion,: and lastly, if wee looke vpon the meanenesse or the fewnesse of those that were Gods Embassadours to the Gentiles.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the fift part of the description.</p>
                        <p>The last thing by which the word of GOD is described,<note place="margin">

It had beene a small comfort to the Colossians to know that the word was fruitfull all ouer the World, if it had no power amongst them. There is a windie vanitie preuailes in the heads of many hearers, they thinke they doe worthily when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Sermon, praise the Preacher, tell of the working of the word in such and such, though they perceiue not that vnto them it is but a dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Many are full-mouthed, but haue empty hearts and hands: but it should be our discretion to labour the cure of this loosenesse and wandering of heart, and not to suffer our soules to be led aside from considering our owne way by any such smooth wiles of Satan. Thus of the persons; the time followeth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>From the day.</hi>] Here I obserue three things.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">There is a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for fruit.</note>First, that there is a season for men to be fruitfull in, we are naturally dry trees, or no trees. Wee are but dead stockes: neither if we should stand in Gods Orchard to all eternitie, would we of our selues beare the fruits of the GOSPEL, or exercise our selues in those faire fruits that are vnto eternall life: if before this day the Citie of Colosse had beene searched with lights, there would haue beene found no true fruits of Grace or Righteousnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them: our season to beare fruit is then when God calles for it. At some time of our life, God (giuing vs the meanes) doth set before vs the way of Life and death, affects vs inwardly with sence of our misery, or the glory of conuersion, or the necessitie of our repentance. Now when the Axe of Gods Word is layd thus neare to the roote of the Tree, it is then time to beare fruit, or else wee are in danger. The consideration hereof, as it shewes that the workes of ciuill honest men are but shadowes or blasted fruit: so it should inforce vpon vs a feare of standing out the day of our visitation. Consider with thy selfe, God cals now for repentance, and the duties of new obedience. If now thou answere Gods call, and pray God to make thee such as he requires thee to be, thou mayest finde fauour in his eyes; for God is neere them that calles vpon him if they seeke him in due time, while he may be found: but if thou delay; consider first, that thy heart of it selfe without dressing, will neuer be fruitfull: secondly, that thou art not sure of the meanes hereafter: thirdly, if thou werest sure, yet who can prescribe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the most high? Hee hath called, and thou hast not answered; therefore feare his Iustice, thou mayest call and he will not answere.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that it is exceeding praise-worthy, and a singular mercy of God; if the word of God worke speedily vpon vs; if wee yeeld and stoope with the first; if it make vs fruitfull from the first day. This liuely working of the word, first is a seale to the word it selfe; for hereby it is out of all doubt, that it is the true word of God, and this effectuall worke of Grace vpon our consciences, doth fence vs against a thousand obiections about the Word: secondly, it is the Ministers seale; as soone as he seeth this power of Doctrine; hee hath his seale from God: the fruitfulnesse of the people, is the Preachers testimoniall <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2.</note>: thirdly, so soone as we finde the Word to be a fauour of life vnto vs, it becomes a seale to our owne Adoption to life; and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21380:44"/>
therefore we should againe, euery man, be admonished, to take heede of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying the time; for not onely we want the testimonie of our owne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, while we liue without subiecting our soules to the power of the word, but exceedingly prouoke God against vs: we should consider that the holy Ghost saith peremptorily, <hi>Now is the Axe layd to the roote of the Tree, and euery Tree that bringeth not forth fruit is cut downe and cast into the fire.</hi> Note that he requireth present fruit, or threatneth present execution <note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat</hi> 3.10. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.2.</note>. Neither may we harden our owne hearts with presumption, because we see not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent execution vpon this rebellion of man against God, and the offer of his grace; for wee must know that men are cut off by more wayes then one. Some are cut off by death, as an open reuenge of the secret rebellion of the heart, not opening when the spirit of grace knocketh. Some are cut off by spirituall famine; God remouing the meanes from them, or suffering them to be their owne executioners, by withdrawing themselues from the means. Some men are cut off by Gods fearefull Iudgement, being cast into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate sence. Some are cut off by Church censures, God ratifying in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, what is done in Earth by the Church.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, hence wee learne, that if we would be truely fruitfull, we must be constantly so; not loose a leafe, much lesse giue ouer bearing fruit <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 47.12.</note>. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine flashes will not serue turne: the Lord knowes not how to intreat them, whose goodnesse is but like the morning dewe <note n="q" place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, this efficacie is limitted; First, by the kinde of Doctrine which especially makes men fruitfull, <hi>viz.</hi> the Doctrine of the grace of God: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the application of it, both by Hearing and Knowledge, and both are limitted,<note place="margin">

                           <hi>That ye heard and knew the grace of God in truth.</hi>] In the opening of these words I consider, first, the words apart: secondly, the Doctrines out of the whole. For the first: here are three things to be considered: 1. what grace of God the Gospell propounds to men: 2. what we must doe that we may haue the comfort of this, that we doe truly heare: 3. what it is to know truely.</p>
                        <p>For the first,<note place="margin">Fiue things principally to be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from Gods Grace.</note> the Gospell requires of men a deepe sence of the singular Grace or free Mercy of God towards men, and that principally in fiue things: first, in giuing Christ to mankinde fallen; and finding out so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie a meanes of our deliuerance: secondly, in accepting of the mediation of Christ in particular for the beleeuer, in the age that hee liueth in: thirdly, in forgiuing sinnes past, through his patience: fourthly, in blessing the meanes, for mans sanctification: and lastly, in allowing vnto men their lot in the inheritance of the Saints in heauen.</p>
                        <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">That we may heare the word in truth seauen things are to be done.</note> that we may haue the comfort of this, that we doe truly heare the word, seauen things are to be done: first, we must denie our owne carnall reason, wit, parts, and outward prayses, <hi>and become fooles that we may be wise</hi> 
                           <note n="r" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</note>: secondly, we must feare God, and set our soules in Gods presence <note n="s" place="margin">

                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.5.</note>: lastly, wee should especially in hearing, wait for a blessing from God, in the particular knowledge of Gods grace to vs, else all hearing is to little purpose.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, men may be said to know, and yet not truely: first, when they know false things,<note place="margin">How men may be said to know and yet not truely.</note> as in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to know the doctrine of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, Intercession of Saints, Image-worship, the Supremacie of the Pope: or in <hi>Germany,</hi> to know the Vbiquitie of Christs humane nature, vniuersall

grace, falling from grace; or that the Sacraments conferre to all, the graces they signifie, and such like. Secondly, when men haue the forme of words, and vnderstand not the meaning. Thirdly, when the notions of the truth are entertained in the minde, and not let downe into the affections; when men haue knowledge in their heads and no affections in their hearts: the Law should be <hi>written in their hearts.</hi> Fourthly, when men know things by opinion, not by faith, as the most men know the greatest part of Religion. Fiftly, when our knowledge is not experimentall in practise. Sixtly, when men know other things, but not the grace of God to themselues.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the words apart. The Doctrines follow.</p>
                        <p>

                              <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. The causes why many hearers get not knowledge.</note>First, men may heare and yet not know. Knowledge is not attayned by all that heare: and this comes to passe eyther as a curse for mens home-sins vnrepented: where Manners will not be informed, there Faith cannot: or by reason of pride and conceit of our owne wits, and that wee neede not be informed: Thus the Pharises are blinde though they heare Christ himselfe: or it comes to passe by reason of mens faultinesse in hearing, they heare carlesly, or without application, or with preiudice, or not at all: or else it is because men smother their doubts, and seeke not resolution in priuate by conference, or seeking the Law at the Priests mouth: and in many, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hearing is caused by want of catechising, when people are not fitted for preaching by information in the principles before.</p>
                        <p>

                              <hi>Doctr.</hi> 2.</note>Secondly, the hearing and true knowledge of Gods grace to a man in particular, doth make fruitfull: the salutiferans appearance of Gods grace in a mans heart, workes in a man a desire and endeauour to shew all good faithfulnesse that may adorne that doctrine, by which hee comes to know God to be his Sauiour. It teacheth men to deny vngodlinesse and worldly lusts, and to liue godly, righteously, and soberly: it purgeth vpon iniquitie, and inflames the zeale of good workes<note n="z" place="margin">

The doctrine of Gods grace hard to the most.</note>Thirdly, as other Doctrines, so especially the doctrine of our reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God, or of our particular assurance of Gods grace to vs is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hard, and men are strangely turned off from the right knowledge of it. This comes to passe (where it is effectually preached) because it is hindred by common hope, and by a resolution in many to part with no sinne for the attayning of it; and by a naturall darknesse in the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of man in matters of the Kingdome of Christ, and by the speciall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Diuill, and by pride in other knowledges. And lastly, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible auersnesse in our natures, that will not be brought to set time apart to minde this point seriously, and to apply our selues vnto the meanes that might further vs thereunto.<note place="margin">The great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance.</note> Whereas if men were assured of Gods fauour, and possessed of sauing grace, the profit of the knowledge of it, would appeare to be exceeding great: though the heart of man be exceeding dull, yet it could not but meruailously refresh vs to thinke of the pardon of all our sinnes; yea, if wee were sure of this point, and had trauelled soundly about the experience of Gods grace to vs in particular, it would for euer set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vs in the plerophorie of our religion. A man needs neuer care for disputes and the thousands of Volumes, about which should be the true Church or true Religion? for if a man by sound reasons from the word and Spirit of God, had gotten the assurance of Gods loue, hee would become as Mount Sio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.14.16</note>; the truth of Sanctification and new Obedience, together with the perfection of Redemption and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. To conclude, euery faithfull man may say as the Apostle said, <hi>By the grace of God I am that I am</hi> 
                           <note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</note>.</p>
                        <p>The vse is first for instruction, euen to labour so much the more earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the certaintie of assurance of Gods grace and free fauour to vs in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, because it will make vs abundant in the worke of the Lord, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich vs with those things that may further our reckoning against the last day. But that wee may speede in suing for Gods grace, and wayting for the tydings of his speciall loue, wee must labour to be good men, and shew it by this, that wee be <hi>men of holy imaginations</hi>
                           <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Prou.</hi> 12.2.</note>. Our vnderstandings will neuer be capable of this knowledge till the euils of the thoughts be in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure purged out and subdued. Besides, we must take heede of scorning and contemning the meanes of grace <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Prou.</hi> 3.34.</note>, and labour for a hatred of euery sinne; for till then we neuer get any sound experience of Gods fauour. So long as a man makes a mocke of any sinne, and securely against the light will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it, so long he remaines vnder the power of folly and vnregeneration <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Prou.</hi> 14.6.</note>: but especially wee must labour to get and grow in humilitie; for God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes his graces on the humble <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Iames</hi> 4.7.</note>. And if God euer comfort vs with his grace, let vs so learne to make it our portion, and to trust perfectly vpon it <note n="h" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13.</note>: as not to receiue it in vaine <note n="i" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2.</note>, but obey all the counsell of God and his Ministers that beseech vs to expresse the power of it in our liues.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the doctrine of the power of Gods grace doth bitterly reproue foure sorts of men: First, such as neglect Gods grace, and seeke not any particular euidence for it. Secondly, such as fall away from the grace of God, and giue ouer the vse of the meanes of grace <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6.</note>; which apostasie many times befals such men as will not wash off the pollution, nor by mortification stay the springing vp of some bitter roote or other within their hearts: such Apostates, when they were at the best, had in their hearts some imperious lusts and passions or other, that they made not conscience of to subdue <note n="l" place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15.</note>. Thirdly, such as <hi>turne the grace of God into wantonnesse:</hi> men that before they haue any reason of comfort, vpon the bare hearing of the promises of the Gospell, take liberty to liue licentiously, and follow their sinnes with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous abuse of Gods mercy. These are vngodly men, ordayned before to condemnation <note n="m" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iud.</hi> 4.</note>. Lastly, such as cannot abide the doctrine of Gods grace, but despise and hate the very Spirit of Grace, how sore shall their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment be <note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.</note>?</p>
                        <p>Thus farre of the Thankesgiuing for the principall meanes of Grace. The Instrumentall followes.</p>

                              <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. What a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster should be.</note>From the generall consideration of all the words I obserue:</p>
                        <p>First, it much matters to the efficacie of the doctrine what the Ministers be: he that would profit his hearers must be: First, able to teach. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee should be beloued, not a man against whom the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had conceiued vncurable preiudice, or such a one as was scandalous. Thirdly, hee had neede to be a fellow-seruant, one that will draw vvith others. Fourthly, hee must consecrate his seruice to God and the Church. Fiftly, hee must be faithfull. And lastly, one that will loue his people.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.</note>Secondly, Ministers of greater gifts, or places, or learning, may here learne how to carry themselues towards their fellow-Ministers: <hi>Paul</hi> commends <hi>Epaphras,</hi> confirmes and countenances his doctrine, and giues him the right hand of fellowship. Which example much condemnes the haughty pride and arrogancy of many great Cleargy-men, in whose eyes their brethren are despised; sometime swelling against them with enuy, sometimes openly pursuing them with censures, especially if God blesse their labours with any good successe; easily setting out with the formost to detract from their iust prayses for gifts, sinceritie, or paines: woe and a fall will be to the great pride of Cleargy-men.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the Apostle striues to winne a greater estimation to the Minister that so hee might the better fasten their respects to his Ministery, to note that where the Messenger is not in credit, the Message is easily neglected or contemned. And therefore as men would desire good successe in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of the Word, they should labour to get and retaine an honourable opinion of the Ministers. And to this end consider that they are called Gods <hi>Coadiutors</hi> 
                           <note n="o" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</note>, <hi>Ministers of the Spirit</hi>

                              <hi>Reuel.</hi> 1.20.</note>; and many other titles of dignitie.</p>
                        <p>From these words <hi>(as yee also haue learned of Epaphras,)</hi> I obserue: First that if men would be effectually wrought vpon by the word, they must plant themselues vnder some setled Ministery: they that heare now one, and then another, at one end of the quarter heare a sermon of this man, and at the other end of that man, haue their knowledge much like their paines.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, he is a true member of the Church that can shew sound grace and knowledge learned of the Teachers of the Church. It is neyther the account of the world, nor profession of true Religion, nor comming to Church, demonstrates necessarily a true member of the Church, but the effectuall subiection of the soule to be formed and wrought vpon by the Ministerie of the Word.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, it is an ordinary infirmity in the better sort of hearers that in many poynts they receiue Doctrine vpon the credit of the teachers, yeelding no other reason, but <hi>Epaphras</hi> taught so; which should awaken affection and conscience in Ministers, out of the feare of God, and sound and infallible knowledge and premeditation to deliuer what they doe deliuer, and to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nothing for certaine but the word of God.</p>
                        <p>From these words (<hi>the beloued, our fellow-seruant,</hi>) I obserue, first, that common affliction for the cause of God, workes in men tendernesse of loue. The Prison makes a great Apostle imbrace with singular loue a poore and meane Minister; the smell of the prison, and sight of the stake, (if such times should euer come againe) would frame a better amity amongst our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; ambitious men might then lay downe their personall and guilefull eagernesse of hast and hate; and humerous men would then be ashamed to deuise how to inlarge the dissention, by coyning new exceptions, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21380:46"/>
vrging of peremptory new scruples: mode stand humble men on both sides that haue sought the peace of Sion, would then haue double honour.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that hee that is faithfull is beloued; beloued I say of God and Gods houshold. It is an ill signe in a Minister that hee is not sound, when hee findes no tokens of Gods loue in his heart, nor signes of respect with Gods Seruants in this life.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that to be Gods Seruant is an high dignitie: it is here the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall glory of an Apostle, and was acknowledged and proclaymed to be the best part of a Kings title, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. the title of it. Which may serue for comfort to poore Christians: they can get no Wealth, offices, nor Honours in the world; but here is their ioy, they may get to be Gods seruants, which is better and more worth than all Honour, Besides, it condemnes the aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Cleargie: yet when they haue done all they can to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues great men, hee is a better man in Gods bookes, that by faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice can winne soules to God, then he that by his money or paines can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purchase many liuings and great dignities to himselfe.</p>

But the Doctrine I obserue is:</p>
                        <p>That euery faithfull Minister is Christs Deacon: and this may comfort painfull Ministers; for to be Christs Deacon is no base office; or to be called so, a title of disgrace: for it is a title giuen to Christ, and the greatest Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates. And concerning them is that promise that he that receiueth one of them in Christs name, shall not be without his reward <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Marke</hi> 9.35. <hi>with</hi> 37.</note>. Besides, Christ saith of them, that where hee is, there shall his Deacon or Seruant be, and his father will honour him, though the world doe not <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn.</hi> 12.26.</note>. Further, it may refresh them that they are said to be Deacons, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6.7.8. Lastly, we may see what power these Deacons haue, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. They call, they perswade, they are heard of the great King, if they complaine and informe; and they binde men hand and foote and cast them into vtter darkenesse. Onely, if Ministers would haue the priuiledges of Christs Deacons, they must put on and practise their properties. First, they must become as little Children: for humblenesse of minde and confidence in Gods fatherly care and prouidence, and for freedome from malice <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Marke</hi> 9.35.36</note>. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they must follow their Master Christ, in doctrine, in life, and in sufferings <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.26.</note>. Thirdly, seeing they haue this Deaconship, as they haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued mercy, they should not faint, but cast from them the cloakes of shame, and not walke in craftinesse, nor handle the word of God deceitfully; but in declaration of the truth should approue themselues to euery mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science in the sight of God <note n="d" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1.2.</note>. So as for the daily expressing of their doctrine vpon the hearts and liues of the people, their people might be their Epistle<note n="e" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2.3.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the 7. <hi>Verse.</hi> Out of the 8. <hi>Verse</hi> I obserue diuers things.</p>
                        <p>First, from the word [<hi>declared,</hi>] as it is here vsed and applyed to reports, I note, that those things are to be reported and spoken, that may giue light to the hearers. A good mans report tends to cleare things in the mindes of them that heare him: there should be light and a Lantherne in our words <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Prou.</hi> 6.23.</note>. To this end wee should vse wisedome, and truth, and meeknesse, when wee speake: Wisedome, by preparing our selues to speake: Truth, to report things as they are: and Meekenesse, to auoid passion; for anger is a great
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21380:47"/>
darkener. Wee should also take heede of diuers sinnes in both Tables, that greatly corrupt the hearers, not onely in the generall, but in this, that they greatly darken and make muddy the vnderstanding of man. As in the first Table, discourses or disputes of Atheisme against the Word, Religion, or Ordinances of God; Apologies for Idolaters or Idolatrous Religion, in whole or in part; the very naming of vices or Idols without disgracing or hating of them; Impatiencie or murmuring against God, and such like: And in the second Table, flattery, tale-bearing, false accusing, rash iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, answering of matters before they be heard, are great darkeners of the vnderstanding.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, in that <hi>Epaphras</hi> intending to complaine of them for their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in opinion and worship, doth here first declare their prayses and graces of Gods Spirit. It shewes that it is a worthy grace to be apt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse others iust prayses, especially when wee are to speake of their faults; for that will shew that wee are free from enuie, ostentation or disdaine, and that wee seeke not our owne things, that wee are not suspitious, nor thinke euill, nor reioyce in euill.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Loue in the spirit.</hi>] Loue is eyther in God or in man: in God there is the personall loue of Christ, the loue of the Creature, the loue of man, and the loue of goodnesse or good men:<note place="margin">
                              <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>.</note> In man there is both the loue by which hee loues God, and the loue by which hee loues man. I take it, here it is meant of whatsoeuer loue the Spirit worketh in man. Of Loue I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at large before, here onely I note briefely two things in generall. First, the necessitie of Loue: secondly, the tryall of it; both in the negatiue. For the first. If the true loue of God, and Gods children, be not in vs, we haue not faith <note n="g" place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6.</note>, nor the Spirit of God; for <hi>Loue is the fruit of the Spirit</hi>

                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7.</note>: nor the Seale of our Election <note n="i" place="margin">

And for tryall: first, of our loue to God. Wee must know, that hee loues not God that will not come to Christ for life <note n="m" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.42.</note>; that keepes not his Commandements <note n="n" place="margin">

                              <hi>Rom</hi> 5.5.</note>; that loues not the word, so as to hide (as precious treasure in his heart) the instructions and comforts of the Word <note n="p" place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.6.</note>; that is not inflamed and inwardly constrayned to an ardent desire of holy duties in that place God hath set him in <note n="q" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13.14</note>; that serues the lust or loue of his profit, sports and carnall delights <note n="r" place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.15.</note>. And for tryall of our loue to men, hee loues not his neighbour; first, that cannot doe it in the Spirit, that is, in spirituall things, and from his heart, according to the direction and motions of Gods Spirit: secondly, that doth or worketh euill to his neighbour <note n="s" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10.</note>: thirdly, that wilfully will offend his brother in a thing indifferent <note n="t" place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>In generall wee may plainely obserue that the desires of our hearts,<note place="margin">We are neyther borne, nor borne againe for our selues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note> and endeauours of our liues ought not to be imployed for our owne good onely, but for the good of others. Wee are neyther borne nor borne againe for our selues. Sanctified and holy men haue beene full of constant and ardent affections and desires after the good of Gods Children: <hi>The manifestation of the spirit is giuen to euery member to profit withall</hi>

Religious Loue seeketh not his owne things <note n="y" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</note>: wee should not seeke our owne things, as many doe, but that which is Iesus Christs, <hi>viz.</hi> that which tends to his glory, and the profit of his members: yea, Christians should serue one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other by loue: hee is not of God that hath not holy affections to promote so farre as in him lyeth, the good of Gods Children <note n="z" place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.10.</note>. Herein are the Children of God, and the children of the Diuell vsually knowne: certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which any man is in Religion,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Note.</hi>
                           </note> hee is relatiuely; if not fit to serue the body, then not fit to be of the body; he is not a Saint, that seekes not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints.</p>

                              <hi>Vses.</hi>
                           </note> First, to shew the misery of such as haue no inflamed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires after the good of Gods Children. Secondly, it may giue vs occasion to examine our selues, what good the body of Christ reapes by vs. If any Christian of lesse power, gifts and meanes in the world, aske; what good can I doe to Christians? I answere, if thou canst doe nothing else, thou canst pray to God for them, and desire their good, reioyce in their prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and mourne for their miseries: neyther let this be thought a meane and vnprofitable seruice to the body; for wee see here a great Apostle imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe about such worke: yea, thou dost benefit the body by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping an holy order in thine owne worke, walking in offensiuely. If one stone flye out of the building it may breede great annoyance to the whole. Thirdly, this should teach vs to auoid what lets our desires or abilities to serue the Brethren by loue, and what may wrong the body: Take heede of worldlinesse, euen these carking cares, or plodding thoughts, about earthly things: vse the world, but serue it not: take heede of irreligiousnesse or the common prophanesse of the world: take heed of rash censuring, and the customary libertie of speech to iudge, and master-like to taxe the actions of others: lastly, take heede of presumptuous and scandalous courses of life. And here also may be gathered a comfort to afflicted consciences, that are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:21380:48"/>
distressed, because they finde not what they would in themselues: they must know that our great way of tryall of sinceritie, is by the constant vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their harts, in the desires of good to the Church and people of God. And therefore though they cannot speake so much good of themselues as were meete, yet it is a great grace of God, that they haue inflamed affections to wish all spirituall prosperitie to Gods people, and to blesse them in the Name of the Lord.</p>

If it be asked what wee should pray for, or wish vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. I answere, wee should pray; first, that God would restraine the Diuell and all wicked men, that profession be not dishonoured in the birth of it, by scandalous persons: for it is one of the first practises of the Diuell, to thrust vp wicked men into profession,<note place="margin">What thou shouldest pray for.</note> that so the glory of sinceritie might be darkened. Secondly, that the word might haue free passage with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interruption or hurtfull opposition. Seldome doth powerfull preaching make a diuision in the heape, but the Diuell and diuellish men striue to wring the Fanne out of Christs hand, that the winnowing may cease. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that separates the precious from the vile, and without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, yeelds comfort to the gracious, and terrours, as the onely present portion of the prophane, is exceedingly opposed of the world. Thirdly, that they may grow in grace. But, to omit other things, the Apostle here shewes by his owne example that wee should pray; first, that they may truely know the will of God in Christ: secondly, that they be discreete and wise in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as well as in vnderstanding: thirdly, that they may walke worthy of the Lord, &amp;c. fourthly, that they may increase in knowledge: fiftly, that they might perseuer, being strengthened with Gods might: lastly, that they may lead a patient and ioyfull life. And wee should be thus carefull of the good of others, both because God requires it, and the Saints haue practised it; and besides, if thou haue any grace, thou standest or fallest with others, in respect of the credit of profession.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Since the day that wee heard of it, wee cease not to pray for you.</hi>] First, from the coherence of these words with the words following, wee may note the great efficacie of Prayer, how mightily it preuayles with God: it is a way by which a Christian may exceedingly helpe himselfe and pleasure his friends. The prayer of the righteous auayleth much, both for helping of the body, and healing of the soule <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iames</hi> 5.16.</note>. If two sound-hearted men agree in earth, in a suite to God the Father in heauen, they preuaile with incredible successe, they get what they would haue <note n="b" place="margin">

                           <note place="margin">Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prayer.</note>And that wee may be incouraged to Prayer, there are diuers things that might vndoubtedly perswade vs to resolue of the efficacie of prayer. First, <hi>Gods Commandement</hi>; certainely God will not require prayer but that hee meanes to heare it <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.15.</note>. Secondly, <hi>The Nature of God,</hi> he is <hi>a Father,</hi> and hath the <hi>compassions of a Father. Though Abraham would not know his seede,</hi> if they had suites to him, <hi>and Iacob be ignorant of his posteritie; yet God will heare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme</hi> 
                           <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Esay</hi> 63.16.</note>: <hi>Though a mother should forget</hi> her motherly compassions, <hi>yet God will not forget his</hi>

                              <hi>Esay</hi> 49.15.</note>: and therefore if <hi>earthly Fathers,</hi> that haue a great deale of ill nature in them, <hi>can giue good gifts to their children,</hi> and that because their children aske them; <hi>how much more shall God our Father,</hi> who is perfectly compassionate, <hi>giue good things</hi>; yea, the best things, yea, the very fountaine of all good, <hi>his holy Spirit, if we aske him</hi> 
                           <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 7 9.</note>? Thirdly, <hi>the manner of Gods presence of grace</hi>; when wee haue any suites, hee is not farre off, or hard to come to, as earthly Princes are, and great men in the world many times;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21380:48"/>
but <hi>hee is neare to all that call vpon him in truth</hi>

                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.18.</note>; yea, for more assurance of this, that hee is ready to receiue petitions, it is said, <hi>His eares are open to the cry of the righteous:</hi> he is so farre from being absent, that there is not so much as any little impediment in his eare. God is euer ready to heare, if our harts were ready to pray. Fourthly, <hi>The property of Gods liberalitie</hi>; he holds it a great blemish and dishonour to his bounty, eyther to deny when hee is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, or to reproach when hee hath giuen; eyther to except against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or to sticke at the greatnesse of the gift <note n="h" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iames</hi> 1.5.</note>. Fiftly, <hi>the assistance of the spirit of Adoption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Spirit helpes our infirmities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though wee know not how to pray as wee ought,</hi> yet that shall not let audience; for <hi>The Spirit it selfe will make request for vs, euen in the sighes which cannot be expressed</hi>

                              <hi>Hose</hi> 7.14.</note>: besides, many times it comes to passe that men speede not, because they are not humble. Wee should so prize and esteeme holy things, as wee should exceedingly reioyce, if wee could get but the crummes that fall from the Fathers table. This Humilitie is euer ioyned with great Faith and wished successe in all suites to God. Againe, it is to be noted, that men may be deceiued about the successe of Prayers: for the decree for our succours may goe forth at the very beginning of our suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, though the knowledge of it be not reuealed vnto vs till afterwards. Further, God heareth prayers diuersly; sometimes, he heareth to grant the very thing wee desire; sometimes he heareth, and granteth, and giueth, not the very things we desire, but that which hee holds to be best for vs, and for the distresse wee are in: so hee was said to heare CHRIST, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. Lastly, God doth heare and grant, and yet deferre to giue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that for our great good many times: hee deferres that hee may proue vs, that our faith may be the more kindled, that his benefits may be more sweet when they doe come, and that wee may know by the want, that it is his gift, when they are bestowed, and that wee may be more carefull of the good vse of his graces, gifts, and benefits, when wee haue them.

                        <p>Thus of the <hi>Will</hi> of God.</p>

                           <hi>Knowledge.</hi>] This is the Grace by which the Will of God is apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The originall word is three wayes accepted: Sometimes, for <hi>Knowledge</hi>; so ordinarily: Sometimes, for <hi>Acknowledgement</hi>; as it is translated in these places: <hi>Luke</hi> 1.4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. Sometimes, for <hi>Knowing againe.</hi> All three sences may be here well considered off.</p>
                        <p>First, of <hi>knowing</hi> Gods Will. Here I consider three things: first, what we must know: secondly, why: or, the motiues to perswade to seeke for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: thirdly the meanes to be vsed thereunto.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What wee should seeke to know.</note>For the first: wee must know that God doth approue of vs in Christ: the approuing will. And this is so necessary, that our hearts can neuer be rid of the occasion of feare of our Reprobation, till wee doe know it <note n="g" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</note>. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, wee must know what God hath determined of vs: his determining will. To this end hath God giuen vs his Word and Spirit, that wee might know what hee hath prepared for vs, if wee loue him <note n="h" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.</note>. Thirdly, we must labour to know what hee requireth of vs: his prescribing will. It is said of <hi>Dauid. Acts</hi> 13.22. that hee did all the wils of God; and so should we also labour to know, and by practise expresse the power of all Gods wils: and the rather, seeing we haue fulfilled, not the will, but <hi>the wils of the flesh</hi> from time to time <note n="i" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.3.</note>.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Motiues to knowledge.</note>For the second: there are many things might inflame vs to the desire of knowledge. For this is the glory of Gods Elect, not riches, not strength, not carnall wit <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.24.</note>. It is the singular gift of Gods grace, and speciall portion of his Chosen <note n="l" place="margin">

                              <hi>Iob.</hi> 21.14.</note>. <hi>Knowledge?</hi> Why? it is more excellent then all things: all but losse and dung in comparison of it <note n="o" place="margin">

                        <p>Thirdly, what must wee doe that wee may attaine to the knowledge of Gods will?<note place="margin">Rules for attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> I answere: First, we must get to be true members of Christ: for <hi>No man knoweth the Father but the Sonne, and they to whom the Sonne reuealeth him</hi> 
                           <note n="s" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27.</note>. Secondly, we must conscionably practise what we doe already know by the light of Nature, or generall light of Religion, and then Christs gracious promise lyeth for the further reuelation euen of sauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note n="t" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.17.</note>. Thirdly, men neuer soundly prosper in the attainment of sauing knowledge: till they haue beene in the furnace of affliction of Conscience: after men haue beene wounded in spirit and their hearts smitten within them, they will then know, and endeauour themselues to know <note n="u" place="margin">

                        <p>But this Question may be excellently answered out of two places of the Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, in the 12. of the <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.2.3. The Apostle shewes that a man must doe fiue things, if hee would know what the good, and acceptable, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect will of God is. First, hee must deuote himselfe to a religious course of life: this hee cals <hi>sacrificing</hi> of our selues to God, <hi>Vers.</hi> 1. Secondly, hee must no more follow the fashions of the world. Thirdly, hee must by prayer, and the vse of all the meanes, repent for the sinnes of his minde, and get a new minde to put his knowledge in. <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. Fourthly, hee must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and trying, often examining himselfe, and trying his euidence concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the faith of Gods good will to him, as the hope of his glory. <hi>Vers.</hi> 2.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:21380:50"/>
Fiftly, hee must not be ouer-curious to prie into such knowledges as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne him not; but be wise to sobrietie, labouring especially by hearing and practise, to get within compasse of the knowledge of his owne Iustification, Sanctification, and Saluation, <hi>Vers.</hi> 3.</p>
                        <p>Againe, in the 5. of the <hi>Ephesians, Ver.</hi> 14. to 22. to gaine the true light of Christ, and vnderstand Gods will, the Apostle shewes that wee must doe nine things. First, wee should awaken our selues out of the spirituall slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our hearts; labouring, by prayer and meditation of our danger, to force open the eyes of our mindes; <hi>Awake thou that sleepest, Ver.</hi> 14. Secondly, wee must forsake the company of wicked and carnall men, that haue no taste nor feeling of things that belong to the kingdome of God; <hi>Stand vp from the dead,</hi>

Some say that the one of them conceiueth the obiect of felicitie; the other, the meanes by which men attaine it. Some thinke they differ thus, that the one vnderstands of God absolutely, by Scripture, as he is; and the other considers of God by collation, or comparison with the creatures, by experience, as hee is tasted to be good: but the plainest and soundest diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is this, that <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> is contemplatiue knowledge; but <hi>Wisedome</hi> is actiue knowledge: the one giues rules for practise, the other for Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and contemplation.

                        <p>The first part of sauing Knowledge is here rendred <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and is <hi>Contemplatiue Knowledge.</hi>

                           <hi>Contemplatiue Knowledge</hi> hath in it two things, <hi>Apprehension</hi> and <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; that is, the power to discerne Doctrine, and the power to meditate

of it; both are needfull, and in both men are exceeding wanting; especially in the power of Meditation. If you aske mee what the obiect is about which wee should meditate, it is answered before; it is the Will of God, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, approuing, prescribing and disposing. And it is no wonder, that men get so little knowledge, or are so vnable for contemplation, because euery one is not capable of it; <hi>the Scorner may,</hi> in a passion, <hi>seeke Wisedome, but hee cannot finde it</hi>

Besides, the meanes must be vsed: especially in Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is exceeding hard to hold any course constantly, but the ground must be from matter of prayer,<note place="margin">Rules for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.</note> or hearing, or reading. Further, many things are required to fit a man to capablenesse, and power, of holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation: First, <hi>Chastitie of heart,</hi> and affections; for, such as are <hi>carryed about with lusts are euer learning, but neuer come to the knowledge of the truth</hi> 
                           <note n="m" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6.</note>
                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondly, <hi>Meekenesse,</hi> or rest of heart from the hurry of disordered affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and troubled passions; hasty affections and a foolish minde are insepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; hee that is passionate can lift vp no holy thoughts, but hee can easily <hi>exalt folly</hi>

                              <hi>Prou.</hi> 14.29.</note>. Thirdly, <hi>A good minde,</hi> that is, an vnderstanding, not exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in imagining and plodding of euill: men of wicked imaginations are vtterly disabled from contemplation. Fourthly, <hi>Humilitie,</hi> or a tender sence of ones owne wants and vnworthinesse: the proud-conceited man, for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Meditation, is of an emptie minde, vnlesse it be that they dote about questions, or strife of words, or vaine disputations, that tend to nothing but strife or vaine ostentation <note n="o" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4.5.</note>. Besides, a heart fatted and fleshed with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous hopes, or profits and pleasures, and hardened through long custome and practise of sinne, is almost wholy blinded in the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Kingdome of Christ; <hi>These men haue eyes, and see not; and eares, and</hi> are as if they <hi>heard not</hi>

                        <p>To passe from this poynt of <hi>Knowledge Contemplatiue,</hi> I conclude onely with the consideration of the 8. of the <hi>Prouerbes,</hi> where it is the drift of the holy Ghost to perswade men to seeke to store their hearts with knowledge, both for sense and Vse. Wisedome cries to be heard. God would faine fasten knowledge vpon all sorts of men. Now if any should aske why Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is so importunate, or wherefore they must set all aside to get her; there are three Reasons giuen. First, because wee are naturally foolish, and not wise in heart: there is no inward substance of sound knowledge in vs, <hi>Vers.</hi> 5. Secondly, the things to be imparted are the most excellent in heauen and earth,<note place="margin">Diuers obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against Knowledge answered.</note>

                           <pb n="81" facs="tcp:21380:55"/>Thus of walking, or holy conuersation in the generall: now in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, that wee might walke in an holy eminencie, three things (as is before noted) are here vrged.</p>
                        <p>First, that wee should <hi>walke worthy of the Lord.</hi>] That is, so to know and consider the singular mercies of God in Christ, as to endeauour to expresse our thankefulnesse in the obedience of our liues, in such a measure as might become the mercies of God. Before I open the words further, I consider in the generall, two things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That the obedience of the faithfull is raysed by the contemplation of the mercies of God:<note n="2" place="margin">Generall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations.</note> which should teach vs, as we desire more to abound in good fruits, so to be more in the assurance, and often meditation of Gods loue to vs: more knowledge of this kinde would worke more obedience; and a confused knowledge of Gods mercy is vsually accompanied with an vnconstant obedience. Besides, this reproues the dangerous and sinfull abuse of Gods mercies in the common people, that vse to pleade their safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie (notwithstanding their sinnes) by the alledging of the mercy of God to sinners: whereas it is most certaine, that the right knowledge of Gods mercy would make men afraid to sinne; <hi>There is mercy with thee that thou maist be feared,</hi> saith the Psalmist <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 130.4.</note>: and it is the infallible signe of a true conuert, that hee doth feare God and his goodnesse <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Hos.</hi> 3.5.</note>: euery man can feare God and his Iustice, especially in some kindes of iudgements; but a childe of God doth neuer more tenderly feare God, then when he hath grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test taste of Gods mercies.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The Papists would finde merit of workes in this Verse: both because holinesse of life is so much vrged, as also because here is the word [<hi>worthy</hi>] vsed, as if the Apostle should grant, that they might be worthy of, and merit the blessings of God.</p>
                        <p>My answere is,<note place="margin">Against merit of workes.</note> First, that merit cannot be founded vpon Scripture; and secondly, it cannot be founded vpon this Scripture. For the first, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not merit for many reasons in Scripture: first, we are not our owne men, we are so tyed vnto God that gaue vs beeing in Nature and Grace, that when wee haue done all wee can doe, our owne mouthes must say wee are but vnprofitable Seruants <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Luke</hi> 17.</note>. Secondly, <hi>all our sufficiencie to doe any good is of God, not from our selues</hi> 
                           <note n="d" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Phil</hi> 2.13.</note>. Thirdly, God gaines nothing by vs, <hi>If thou be righteous, what giuest thou to him?</hi> or, <hi>what receiueth he at thy hands</hi> 
                           <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iob</hi> 35.7.</note>? Fourthly, men talke of their well-doing, but what shall become of their sinnes? If the Papists will first goe to hell for their sinnes, and stay all that eternitie there, then afterwards if God create another eternitie, they may haue hearing to relate what good they haue done: the curse of the Law will be first serued; the punishment of <hi>Adams</hi> one sinne barred the plea for any reward for former righteousnesse. Fiftly, what comparison can there be betweene the glory of heauen and our workes on earth <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18.</note>? Sixtly, it is worthy to be obserued, that it is mercy in God to set his loue vpon them that keepe his Commandements, <hi>Ezod.</hi> 20. <hi>Command.</hi> 2. Seauenthly, we are so farre from meriting, that wee are taught to pray God <hi>to giue vs our daily bread</hi>; we haue not a bit of bread of our owne earning. Eightly, the Sanctification of the most righteous is but begunne in this life. Lastly, vnto all these Reasons adde the further Testimonie of these Scriptures, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. and 11.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.9.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, this place hath no colour for merit: for (to passe ouer that reason, that the Scripture requireth good workes, therefore our workes merit, as a most false and absurd argument:) the words [<hi>worthy of the Lord</hi>] cannot be applyed to merit by any meanes: for in as much as the Lord had bestowed many of his fauours already vpon them, and giuing his hand
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:21380:56"/>
and writing, and seale for the rest, they cannot by any workes afterwards be said in any colour to merit what is past. They are vrged, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. to bring forth fruits worthy repentance: now it were absurd to thinke that the fruits afterwards borne, should merit repentance, which God gaue before; for that is to affirme that not onely a wicked man might merit his owne conuersion, but that hee might merit it by the workes hee would doe after his conuersion, which I know not that any Papist will affirme: and the like reason is there of the phrase here vsed.</p>

                        <p>In generall our righteousnesse must exceede the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees; we must be so farre from resting in the custome and practise of the vile sinnes that abound in the world, that we must not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, with this, that wee be ciuill honest men, and well thought of in the world: for Gods mercies challenge more at our hands then ciuill honesty <note n="g" place="margin">

That wee may please men we must obserue these Rules: 1. Wee must be carefull to please God, else it is iust with God, that though we striue to please men, yet we should not attaine to it, because we are not in the first place carefull to please God. 2. We must get that <hi>Philanthropian,</hi> loue of men into our hearts, but especially <hi>Philadelphian,</hi> the loue of the Brethren, for this ingenders care and diligence to please, and makes the labour thereunto seeme no basenesse or burthen. 3. In the generall corruption of our callings wee must liue innocently. <hi>Samuel</hi> is much set by, and pleaseth the people, when hee stands by <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> men so egregiously corrupt. 4. If wee would please in conuersing, wee must learne to beare infirmities <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.2.</note>. 5. Wee must practise those vertues that especially win fauour: as curtesie, meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, candor, faithfull dealing, (though it be to our hinderance) wee must giue soft answeres, ouercome euill with goodnesse, be slow to wrath, and forgiue, and not reuenge. 6. Wee must hate those vices, and auoid them, which in conuersation appeare hatefull amongst men; as back-biting <note n="l" place="margin">

                        <p>Concerning good Workes, I propound three things:

                              <item>2 What rules must be obserued to make our workes good workes.</item>

                        </p>

                           <note n="1" place="margin">What workes are good workes.</note>For the first: the workes that are <hi>done to be seene of men</hi> are not good works <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.5.</note>. The workes of persecutors are all nought <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.39.40.</note>: all workes are nought that haue not repentance going before; for good workes are the workes of the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Acts</hi> 26.20.</note>: all the workes that are done too late are thrust out of the Catalogue of good workes; as to cry to God after a man hath stood out all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and seasons of grace <note n="d" place="margin">

                              <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.</note>. Lastly, doth not the world hate them?<note n="g" place="margin">

They must be warranted by the word of God: if wee <hi>doe truth, wee must goe to the light that our deedes may be manifest, that they are wrought in God</hi>

Lastly, the ends must be good: and the ends of all good workes are, 1. The glory of God: 2. The discharge of our obedience: 3. The edification of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: 4. The testification of our Faith and Thankefulnesse: 5. The esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the punishment of sinne, and the destruction of the wicked: 6. The answering of our high calling in Iesus Christ: 7. The obtayning of the glory of Heauen.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note n="3" place="margin">What workes are good works in particular.</note>For the third: in our conuersation with men there are diuers kindes of good workes; some spirituall, some corporall: they are good workes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct, admonish, incourage, reproue, and pray for others; to pull an infant, or weake man out of a flaming fire, is a good worke, and such is it to recouer
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21380:58"/>
a sinner, by admonition, counsell, &amp;c. It is a good worke to couer infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; yea, a multitude of them: and to forgiue trespasses, and to ouercome euill with goodnes: so also they are good workes to grieue with them that grieue, in giuing honour to goe one before another, to lift vp the iust praises of others, to lend to the needy, and to giue liberally and chearefully towards the relieuing of the necessities of the poore, especially them of the houshold of Faith.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, from the manner of phrase, [<hi>bearing fruit in euery good worke</hi>] these things may be obserued: First, that good workes are fruits: for they are such things as shew our Faith, proue our planting, and yeeld vs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in Gods acceptation of them. Secondly, that a religious minde will labour to get fruit of euery sort; hee will not know a good worke, but hee will desire to carry some fruit of it. Thirdly, a Christian man carries his fruit, both because hee carries the blessing of his well-doing, and because he is neuer without some fruit, as also he shall be sure his workes will goe with him, when all things else shall leaue him.</p>
                        <p>Thus farre of the eminencie of Christians in holy conuersation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Increasing in the knowledge of God.</hi>] Whereas a Question might be asked what should wee doe that wee might attaine to the holinesse of life before described? These words containe an answere to it, that they must <hi>increase in the knowledge of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The words in themselues stand of three parts: First, the Grace, <hi>Knowledge:</hi> Secondly, the Measure of it, <hi>increase:</hi> Thirdly, the Obiect, <hi>of God.</hi> Of the Grace it selfe I haue intreated before, onely from the repetition two things may be obserued.</p>

                           </note> wee had neede to be often vrged, and put in minde, and stirred vp to seeke knowledge, wee are naturally so vnapt to spirituall things, that <hi>line must be vpon line,</hi> and <hi>precept vpon precept</hi>

                        <p>Secondly, men are not onely to seeke knowledge, that they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted and sanctified, and liue a righteous life; but euen after all these are attayned,<note place="margin">We must still seeke to get more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> wee must still be industrious to get more knowledge: because knowledge inlarged giues the comfort and sence of grace receiued: else a man may haue Faith, and yet for want of knowledge liue without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of it.

                              <hi>Doct.</hi> 2.</note> that increase of knowledge is a great furtherance of holy life: the preuayling of sinne in the life of the Iewes, was caused by the preuay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ignorance <note n="u" place="margin">
                              <hi>Esay</hi> 1.3.</note>. Therefore there is no mercy, nor pietie in the Land, because <hi>there is no knowledge of God in the land</hi>

                           <hi>Of God.</hi>] Our knowledge must be of God foure wayes: for the first, it must be spirituall and diuine knowledge, not humane, naturall, and earthly. 2. It must be of God; as hee is the author of it, we must seeke it from aboue, by prayer. 3. It must be of God, as he is the end of it, it must draw vs nearer to God. Lastly, God must be the obiect of it, we must know Gods Name. In this last sence here are two things imported.</p>
                        <p>First, that euen after regeneration there may be sometimes some working of the seedes of Atheisme. So wretched is the euill nature of man, that in this respect there is cause many times to hang downe the head with horror, shame, and bitter mourning of heart, and confusion of face.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that increase in holy conuersation doth abate the mouings of Atheisme: as any be more holy, so they are more freed from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them. Be first holy, and then be an Atheist, professed or resolued, if thou canst.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the knowledge of God foure things are to be considered: 1. How hee is made knowne: 2. Who they are that God chargeth with this, that they know him not: 3. How it comes to passe that man knowes not his God: 4. What wee must doe, that wee may know God.</p>
                        <p>

By his workes; and that either in generall, as God hath stamped vpon them some markes of his invisible things <note n="l" place="margin">

particular workes, as the founding of the Earth, the hanging of the Clouds, the spreading out of the Heauens, the recoyling of the Waters, leauing an habitation for man; terrours of Conscience, Plagues vpon wicked men at their wish, answearing of Prayers, Miracles, the Soule of Man, and state of Diuels.</p>

                           <hi>Power</hi> is one of the Attributes they call in Schooles <hi>relate:</hi> the Power of God is infinite, both in respect of Essence (for it is as large as the Essence; yea, it is the Essence it selfe) and in respect of Obiects, hee hath not done so much, but farre beyond our capacities, hee could doe infinitely more: and so is it infinite in respect of continuance. Yet to speake of it according to our capacities;<note place="margin">What God cannot doe.</note> it is restrayned, 1. By his Will; hee cannot doe what his Will is against: 2. By his Glory; hee can doe nothing against his owne Glory: 3. By his Nature, hee cannot lye, &amp;c. because it is against his Nature: 4. In some respects by the nature of the Creature; so as whatsoeuer destroyes the essentiall definition of the Creature, God cannot doe: as God cannot make a man vnreasonable, and yet hee remaine a man; hee cannot make a body infinite, and it remayne a body still: 5. Sometimes by the condition and qualities of the Creature; as, <hi>Be it vnto thee according to thy Faith:</hi> 6. By im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilitie; I say, by that which is simply impossible, for there are many things vnpossible in respect of vs, which are not onely possible but easie to God. And therefore the common-people reason foolishly; <hi>God can saue me, therefore hee will doe it:</hi> and the Papists as willfully; <hi>Christ can be present in the Sacrament, therefore hee will.</hi> For besides that they will neuer proue his body can lie in all places, at one time, truely and locally present, remayning a true body; they also reason but absurdly, till they finde his will to be there in their manner.</p>

                           <hi>Power of his Glory.</hi>] There are foure Reasons why the Power of God should be said to be the <hi>Power of his Glory,</hi> or glorious. 1. Because it will neuer leaue strengthening,<note place="margin">Who see Gods glory.</note> till it bring to Glory. 2. Because the power of all the meanes of saluation is from heauen, and therefore a glorious power. 3. Because Gods Glory sets his Power aworke, in as much as by promise it lyes ingaged to his people. 4. It is a glorious Power, because of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and things that are vsed in Gods worke, as God himselfe, the Sonne of God, the Spirit of God, ordinances that are of God, and men specially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated by God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Doctrines.</hi> First, the perseuerance of Gods Children is most certaine: so long as there is Power in God or Glory, they cannot fall away by losing their happinesse.</p>
                        <p>This poynt hath abundant and apparant confirmation out of the old Testament in these places,<note place="margin">
                              <p>Foure Reasons why the power of God is said to be the power of his glory. About falling from grace and perseuerance. Proofes that Gods elect cannot fall away.</p>
                              <p>This Doctrine doth not tend to securitie.</p>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.10.13.14 <hi>Esay</hi> 42.3. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36.24.25.26.27. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 32.40. <hi>Hos.</hi> 2.19.

                        <p>Secondly, there is little reason of presumption in this Doctrine: for, as Power will preserue, so Glory will reuenge: if such as are in couenant with God returne to sinne, woe vnto them, Gods Glory will not beare it; and he hath many wayes to scourge them: for by their sinnes they may bring vpon themselues crosses of all sorts <note n="s" place="margin">

We must take heede of quenching the Spirit: when a man puts out the holy motions of the Spirit, hee quencheth his owne ioyes. 4. We must, by all meanes, preserue an honourable respect of the word publikely preached: despise not prophecying. 5. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there be some things wee heare, doe specially affect vs, and concerne vs, we must be carefull with all heedfulnesse to keepe those things whatsoeuer we forget: try all things, but keepe that which is good. 6. In our practise wee must not onely auoyd euill, but all appearance of euill, else if wee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet others with griefe or offence of our carriage, it will be iust with God we should finde little rest, or contentment in our selues. Lastly, wee must endeauour to be sanctified throughout, inwardly and outwardly, in soule, body and spirit, hauing respect of all Gods Commandements, and retayning the loue of no sinne, so shall we reape the blessing of all righteousnesse, and procure to our hearts the ioyes that are euerlasting.</p>

                        <p>The second part both of the Chapter and Epistle followeth,<note place="margin">The order of this second part of the Epistle.</note> and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned in the 12. <hi>Verse,</hi> and the rest to the 23. And it hath in it the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Doctrine. This Doctrine propounded stands of two parts: for it concerneth eyther the worke of Redemption, or the person of the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The worke of Redemption is considered of in the 12.13. and 14. <hi>Verses:</hi> the person of the Redeemer is entreated of from <hi>Verse</hi> the 15. to the 23. The worke of Redemption is two wayes considered of: first, more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, in the 12. <hi>Verse:</hi> secondly, more particularly, <hi>Vers.</hi> 13.14.</p>
                        <p>In the worke of our Redemption, as it is propounded in this <hi>Verse,</hi> three things are to be obserued: 1. The efficient cause [<hi>God the Father.</hi>] 2. The subiect persons redeemed [<hi>vs.</hi>] 3. The Redemption it selfe, as it is eyther in the inchoation and first application of it on earth, and so it lyeth [<hi>in making vs fit</hi>;] or in the confirmation of it, what it shall be in the end: and so it is praysed, first by the manner of tenure [<hi>inherit</hi>;] secondly, by the adiunct companie, [<hi>Saints</hi>;] thirdly, by the perfection of it [<hi>in light.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Giuing thankes.</hi>] The blessings of God vpon euery true Christian, are such, as they require continuall thankefulnesse to God for them: such I say, for the worth of them, for number, for freenesse of gift, for continuance, and as they are compared with what God bestowes vpon others in the world.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To the Father.</hi>] A sanctified heart that hath sence of grace, so sees God, the first cause of all blessings, through the second and next causes, that it maketh God the principall obiect both of prayer and prayses: it is a great sinne not to acknowledge the instrument by which wee receiue any good; but it is a great impietie not to giue that which is due, to the principall Efficient.</p>

Now such men as are borne of God by regeneration, as well as of man by generation,<note place="margin">Markes of a childe of God.</note> are wont to be described in Scripture by such markes as these.

                        <p>Secondly, if God be our Father, it should teach vs; First, to care lesse for the world, and the things thereof: we haue a Father, that both knowes our wants, and hath all power and will to helpe vs and care for vs <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.32.</note>. Secondly, to come to him in all crosses, and make our moane to him that <hi>seeth in secret:</hi> for if <hi>euill fathers</hi> on earth, <hi>know how to giue good things to their children when they aske them, how shall not our heauenly Father giue vs whatsoeuer wee aske in the Name of Christ</hi> 
                           <note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.11.</note>. Yea, it should teach vs patience vnder, and a good vse of all crosses <note n="o" place="margin">
                              <hi>Hos.</hi> 12.9.</note>. Thirdly, to be willing to dye and commend our spirits to God that gaue them; seeing in so dying, wee commit them into the hands of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This made Christ willing to dye, and this should perswade with vs also <note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>Luke</hi> 13.46.</note>. Lastly, it should teach vs to glorifie God as a Father: wee call God Father (many of vs) and thus wee speake, but <hi>wee doe euill more and more,</hi> and dishonour him, not liuing like the children of the most High <note n="q" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ier.</hi> 3.4.5.</note>. If hee be our Father, let the light of our <hi>good workes shine before men, that they may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie our Father</hi>

                        <p>Thirdly, this point serues for Consolation, and that many wayes: First, against the feare of our owne weakenesse; <hi>It is not our Fathers will that one of the little ones should perish</hi> 
                           <note n="t" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.14.</note>: <hi>None is able to take them out of his hand</hi> 
                           <note n="u" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.29.</note>. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, against our doubts about prayer: <hi>Whatsoeuer you aske the Father in Christs name it shall be giuen you</hi> 
                           <note n="x" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.23.</note>. Thirdly, against all the troubles of this world: if hee haue beene a <hi>Father of Mercy,</hi> to forgiue thy sinnes, and giue thee grace, he will be a <hi>Father of Glory,</hi> to crowne thee in a better world in the inheritance of his Sonnes <note n="y" place="margin">

the <hi>sufficiencie</hi> of his death, not in respect of the <hi>efficiencie</hi> of it. Secondly, in respect of the common oblation of the benefits of his death externally in the Gospell vnto all.

                           <note place="margin">Fiue sorts of men not made fit.</note> that are not made fit? First, such as are in heart disioynted, so as indeede they care for the doctrine of no Church: and thus Atheists and Epicures are vnfit. Secondly, such as are in heart fastned to a false Church, though in shew they be members of the true: thus Church-Papists are not fit. Thirdly, such as receiue Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and care for it, but onely as it may fit the humours of such as are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and may serue the currant of the present times: and thus tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Politicians are not made fit. Fourthly, such as admit some parts of Gods worship, and stand in professed enmitie, and dislikes of the iest: and thus the common Protestant of all estates and degrees; they thinke if they come to Church to seruice, and be no Papists, it will serue turne, though they neglect, yea, contemne, yea, commonly despight Preaching, priuate Prayer, true Fasting, religious Conference, and Fellowship in the Gospell.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, and lastly, among the better sorts that are hearers, and constant hearers, there are many not made fit for the Kingdome of God: for many hearers rest in an Historicall Faith and externall righteousnesse, eyther <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying the seede,</hi> by suffering the Fiends of hell, those inuisible fowles of the Ayre, to take it away, or <hi>choking the seede</hi> by worldly cares, or if they get a <hi>taste of the good word of God,</hi> and <hi>of the powers of the life to come,</hi> by their wicked reuoults and <hi>backe-slidings,</hi> they shew themselues not fit, nor worthy the Kingdome of God.</p>

                        <p>First, because hee now obtaynes it in the times of the Gospell, which times in comparison with the times of the old Testament, are called times of light: the light of the Iewes being spread abroad among the Gentiles, and exceedingly enlarged by the rising of the Sunne of righteousnesse.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, because this inheritance can neuer be assured without the light of knowledge.<note place="margin">A three-fold light in man.</note> In the vnderstanding of man there is a three-fold light of knowledge; <hi>Naturall, Euangelicall,</hi> and <hi>Celestiall:</hi> the <hi>Naturall</hi> light is the light of Reason: the <hi>Euangelicall</hi> light is the light of Faith: and the <hi>Celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> light is the light of Heauen. Before wee can see our inheritance in the light of Heauen, wee must first see it in the light of Faith: and as for the light of Reason it will doe no good for any euidence in this tenure.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, because this inheritance is held with true ioy on earth, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ioy in heauen: and Ioy is expressed by the word <hi>light,</hi> in many places in Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, in respect of the admirable communion that a Christian hath with God and Christ, who is <hi>light of light; that true light, Iohn</hi> 8.12.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, because of the certainetie of this inheritance, it is said to be held in light. It is worthy the noting, that <hi>Catharinus,</hi> a Papist, writing vpon this place, thus vnderstands the meaning of <hi>Light</hi>: and is much
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21380:66"/>
offended vvith those that pleade for vncertayntie of assurance.</p>
                        <p>Sixtly, <hi>in light,</hi> that is, in Heauen: and the light of Heauen is an excellent light, both for the perfection of it, and the continuance of it. It is a perfect light: for there shall be on Gods part a cleare reuelation, and on mans part a cleare vision and for continuance; that light shall neuer be ouercome of darkenesse; nay, it shall neuer admit any mixture of obscuritie, in as much as Heauen is a Citie that <hi>needes not the Sunne nor Moone to shine in it, for the glory of God doth lighten it, and the Lambe is the light thereof, Reuel.</hi> 21.23. In the meane while till God translate vs to this light of heauen, let vs labour to settle our hearts in the light of Faith and certainetie, and glad our hearts with the light of the Spirit and ioy, choosing rather to dye then to forsake the face and presence of God, the fountaine of all true light both in earth and heauen.</p>

First, the darkenesse of Sinne <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.13.</note>. Secondly, the darkenesse of ignorance, which as a vayle, couers all flesh <note n="b" place="margin">

Lastly, the wicked man is in danger of vtter darkenesse, euen of the darkenesse of hell: out of all this wee may see the extreame misery of all carnall persons, vpon whom the Kingdome of darkenesse breakes in, and preuayles so many wayes: and therefore accursed is their misery that can liue in this estate without sense, or remorse, or feare. If Securitie as a wretched Lethargy, had not ouergrowne mens hearts, how could they eate, drinke, sleepe, marry, giue in marriage, &amp;c. when they finde themselues in the power of such fearefull and horrible darkenesse?</p>

                           <hi>Power.</hi>] This darkenesse gets power, and preuayles ouer the world, by the vnwearied labour of the Prince of darkenesse: who as hee seduced our first Parents, to extinguish the fayre light in which they were created, (whence flowed an vniuersall darkenesse vpon all mankinde) so doth hee still, as God of the vnregenerate world, worke effectually, in binding mens mindes more and more, that the light of the Gospell might not shine in their hearts, both by hindering by all the wayes hee can, the meanes of light, and by leading man on from sinne to sinne, till custome haue worne out sense, and bred a very liking of darkenesse more then the light. And thus poore man runnes from darkenesse to darkenesse, and from dungeon to dungeon, till hee fall vnto the euerlasting dungeon of vtter darkenesse,

Inchoation, though not in respect of Consummation; though they be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, yet the vayle is not whole, but many pieces are torne off; though they be in a dungeon in this world, yet a great window is broken downe, and much light appeares; though there be sinne in them, yet it raignes not; though they must dye, yet the sting of death is pulled out; though they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the same afflictions that wicked men doe for the matter, yet they are not the same for nature and vse: they are not curses or punishments, but onely chastisements, and tryals, or preuentions.</p>

And as a tree may be truely remoued, and new planted, and yet not presently beare fruit: so may a Christian be truely translated, and yet in the first instant of his conuersion hee may not shew forth all that fruit he doth desire, &amp;c.</p>

The pulling vp of the tree, shadowes out three things in the conuersion of a sinner. First, seperation from the world: hee cannot be in Christ that hath his heart rooted in the earth, and keepes his old stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding amongst these trees, the wicked of the world. Secondly, deliuerance both from originall sinne in the raigne of it (which is the moysture of the old earth) and also from hardnesse of heart, (for <hi>translating</hi> hath remouing of the mould and stones that were about the roote.) Thirdly, godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row raised by the sense of the stroakes of the Axe of Gods threatnings, and by the losse of many sprowts and branches that were hidden in the earth: A Christian cannot scape without sorrow; for hee hath many an vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table sprowt of vanitie, and sinfull profit and pleasure hee must part with. The setting of the tree notes both our ingrafting into Christ by the Spirit of God through Faith, and our communion with the Saints, (the fruitfull trees in Gods Orchard) as also it notes our preseruation by the infusion of the sappe of holy graces.</p>

                           <hi>Ans.</hi> Because God hath giuen all the power to the Sonne, and this Kingdome is assigned ouer to him. The merit of this happinesse is onely in Christ, and the vertue that gathers vs into this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is onely from Christ, and no man commeth to the Father but by Christ.</p>

                           <hi>Sonne of his loue.</hi>] Christ is the Sonne of Gods loue: first, because hee is most worthy of all others to be beloued. as <hi>Iudas</hi> is <hi>the Sonne of perdition,</hi> that is, most worthy to be damned. Secondly, because hee was from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting begotten of the loue of his Father: hee is Gods naturall Sonne. Thirdly, because he is infinitely filled with the sense of his loue: so they are said to be the <hi>Children of the marriage,</hi> that are full of ioy, in respect of the marriage. Fourthly, because it is hee by whom loue is deriued into others: It is hee that makes all other Sonnes, beloued. Lastly, in respect of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature: he is that Sonne vpon whom God hath shewed his principall loue, in respect of the gifts, with which that Nature is admirably qualified. The meditation of this, that CHRIST our Sauiour is the Sonne of Gods loue, is very comfortable; for hee is like to speede in any thing hee requests the Father for vs, and hee will be sure to preserue vs. That himselfe is a Kings Sonne, yea, Gods Sonne, yea, a King, and God himselfe; and so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely beloued of the Father: it is an excellent thing to be Christs member, seeing hee inherits so great loue: and if God gaue vs this Sonne so deare to him, how shall hee deny any thing, seeing neuer can ought be so precious, but that <hi>with Christ he will willingly giue it?</hi>

                        <p>IN the former Verses our Redemption is considered, as God the Father is the efficient cause of it. In this Verse it is considered as CHRIST is the Instrumentall cause of it: in the Verse foure things are to be noted. 1. By whom wee are redeemed (<hi>viz.</hi>) by the Sonne of Gods loue, implyed in the first words. 2. Who are redeemed [<hi>wee,</hi>] that is, the faithfull. 3. how wee are redeemed, (<hi>viz.</hi>) by his bloud. 4. With what kinde of redemption, not by redemption from losse in estate, or seruitude in body, but from sinne in the soule.</p>

                           <hi>In whom.] Doct.</hi> That is, the Sonne of God is the redeemer of the sonnes of men: hee that had no sinnes of his owne, did worthily cancell other mens: hee that was in no debt, paid our debts. In this worke of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wee may see Pietie it selfe beaten for the impious man: and Wisedome it selfe derided for the foolish man: and Truth it selfe slaine for the lying man: and Iustice it selfe condemned for the vniust man: and Mercy it selfe afflicted for the cruell man: and life it selfe dying for the dead man. None can redeeme vs but Iesus Christ: hee onely is God and man, hee onely was deputed hereunto, hee onely it is that is the first borne, the brother, and the kinsman <note n="a" place="margin">

                        <p>Secondly, it is to be noted, that hee saith (<hi>in whom</hi>) not (<hi>by whom</hi>) to teach vs, that the comfort of our Redemption is not then had when Christ,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:21380:69"/>
as Mediator, doth pay the price: but when, as our Head, hee receiueth vs to himselfe: we must be in Christ before we can be pardoned: it is a vaine thing to alledge that Christ dyed for vs, vnlesse wee can cleare it, that wee are the members of Christ by conuersion and regeneration: wee must be in Christ before the Diuell will let goe his hold: wee must be in Christ before wee can receiue of the influence of his grace; for that descends onely from the Head to the Members: wee must be in Christ before we can be couered with his garment: and if wee be not in the Vine we cannot perseuer.</p>

Thirdly, by <hi>violent Ablation,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> redeemed <hi>Lot,</hi> by force rescuing him: but this way did not stand with Gods Iustice.

                           <hi>Forgiuenesse of sinnes.</hi>] The doctrine of remission of sinnes is many wayes comfortable: it is a comfort, 1. That sinnes may be remitted <note n="e" place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.1.</note>: 2.

                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 6 14.</note> he must search out his sinnes by the Law, and mourne ouer them in Gods presence, striuing to breake and bruise his owne heart with griefe in secret, in the confession of them to God, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9. <hi>Hos.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.12. <hi>to the end, &amp;</hi> 13.1. Thirdly, vvee must take heede of the sinne against the holy Ghost: which beginning in <hi>Apostacy,</hi> is continued in <hi>Persecution</hi> of the knowne Truth, and ends in <hi>Blasphemy</hi>; and is therefore a sinne vnpardonable, because the sinner is vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly disabled of the power to repent. And howsoeuer all sinnes against the holy Ghost are not vnpardonable, but onely that sinne that hath the former three things in it; yet the man that would haue euidence of pardon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must take heede of all wayes of offending against Gods Spirit: and therefore must take heede of speaking euill of the way of godlinesse, of contemning the meanes of Grace, by which the Spirit workes, and of tempting, grieuing or vexing of the holy Ghost within his owne heart or others. Fourthly, he must daily attend vpon the preaching of the Gospell, till the Lord be pleased to quicken his owne Promises, and his heart vnto the ioyfull application of the Comforts of Gods Loue, continued in his Word. And when men come to Gods presence to seeke so great a mercy as the pardon of sinne, they must aboue all things, take heede of wilfull hardnesse of heart, least their vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes to be directed by Gods Word, be requited with that curse that God should grow vnwilling that they should <hi>repent, and hee should forgiue them</hi>

                        <p>Christ, is the Image of God three wayes: 1. in Operation, because it is he that worketh Gods Image in vs: 2. in Apparision, because he appeared for God, to the Fathers in the old Law: 3. in Person, and that in both natures, both as God and Man; for the most perfect Image of God, is Christ, God: the perfect Image of God is Christ, Man: the vnperfect Image of God, is Man.</p>

Thirdly, as his Humane Nature is qualified with Knowledge, Righteousnesse, Puritie, and other gifts: for if man be Gods Image in respect of this, Christ is so much more.

And yet notwithstanding, though God be not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to sense, hee is visible to vnderstanding: and though Nature cannot see him, yet Grace can.

                        <p>Hitherto our Redeemer is described, as he stands in relation to God: now, in the second place, he is described as he stands in relation to the Creatures.

Things are begotten three wayes: 1. <hi>Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> onely by comparison, or in some respects: 2. <hi>Corporally:</hi> 3. <hi>Spiritually</hi>: some things doe beget without themselues, as bodies doe; but this is more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobly and basely; some things beget within themselues, as doth the Spirit or soule, more perfectly. But the most perfect and vnvtterable glorious gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is the begetting of the Son of God, by God. The way of God in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who can finde out? and his generation who can tell? His waies are not as our wayes; yet a glimpse of this great worke, we may reach to two wayes:
<list>
                              <item>1 By way of <hi>Negation,</hi> as they say in Schooles.</item>
                              <item>2 By way of <hi>Comparison.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, by denying that vnto God, which hath imperfection in it. In the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Creatures vve may see something into the generation of the Sonne of God. There are eight things in the generation of the Creatures, vvhich are not in this begetting of the naturall Sonne of God. 1. The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures beget in time, because themselues are first begotten: but this is not in God, Christ is of the Father, but not after the Father: there is here a prioritie in order, but not in time. 2. The Creatures beget by affection (this is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection) but God begetteth by Nature. 3. The Creature begets vvithout him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, so as Sons are diuers, and diuided from the Father, because they are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite: we are of like nature to our Fathers,<note place="margin">
                              <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>.</note> but not the same nature: but it is not so in God; for Christ is not diuided from the Father, as he is the naturall Sonne of God. 4. The generation in the Creature is not without corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or diminution of the nature of the Begetter: but here, God the Father begetteth without corruption or diminution, by a way diuine, inenarrable, and incomprehensible. 5. Our Children are lesse then their Parents; but Christ is as well Coequall as Coeternall. 6. The Creature communicates but a part of his substance, but God communicates the whole. 7. The father and sonne, among the creatures, are two in number, one in Specie onely; but
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:21380:71"/>
in God it is not so: for the Son of God is another, but not another thing; he is another,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Alius,</hi> but not <hi>aliud.</hi>

                           <hi>viz.</hi> in Person, but not another thing in Essence. Lastly, the creature begets mortal creatures, &amp; propagates but a being for a time, but God begets a Sonne immortall by nature, such as can neuer die in the nature so begotten.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, this generation is shadowed out by some comparison vvith Creatures: the riuer and the spring are two, yet not diuided; so is the Sun and the Beames of it, the Sauor &amp; the Oyntment are together, and yet the Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not corrupted: but the principall comparison is in the Minde and the Word; the Minde begets the Word naturally, without passion or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, within it selfe; so as the Word begotten, remaines in the Minde, the Word afterwards, clothed with a voyce, goeth into the eares of men, and yet ceaseth not to be still in the Minde: This in many things, as you may see, is like to the generation of God, by the Father. But all these are but shadowes; the glory of the thing it selfe cannot be expressed by any words of man or Angels.</p>
                        <p>The consideration of this Doctrine should inflame vs to the loue of such a Sonne, who being as hee was, coequall and coeternall with the Father, yet was pleased to delight himselfe in Gods earth,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Prou.</hi> 8.22.31.32.</note> which is man. And we should for euer hearken and attend to the words of this wisedome of God, who tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs the secrets and the very bottome of his Father. And seeing this is the Sonne, of whom GOD hath spoken, to the dreadfull astonishment and wonder of Heauen and Earth, woe vnto them that sinne against the Sonne, and prouoke him to anger: How shall they be broken to pieces like an earthen Vessels? But blessed are all they, that with all feare and trembling,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.5.7.9.11.12.</note> and with all reuerence and affection, subiect themselues to the Scepter of his Kingdome, and trust in the loue of the Father, through the merits of the Sonne. Thus of the consideration of Christ, as he is begotten of God: it is here added that he is first begotten.</p>

                           </note>; and here is tearmed the first begotten Sonne of God. He is first begotten, as God, two wayes: 1. in Time, he was before all other things. Of this afterwards. 2. in Dignitie, he is the foundation of all that respect, by which others are made Sonnes: he is first begotten, as Man, not in time, but in dignitie and operation: first, in respect of the miraculousnesse and wonderfulnesse of his birth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; so are none other borne: secondly, in respect of his Resurrection, in which God did as it were beget him againe: thus hee is afterwards said to be the first borne of the dead: thirdly, in respect of preheminence; as he is the right of the first borne, being made heyre of all things.</p>
                        <p>The Vse is diuers:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6.</note> First, let all the Angels of God worship him. Secondly, it should kindle in our harts godly sorrow for our sinnes. If we can mourne for the death of our first borne,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.12.</note> how should we be pierced to remember, that our sinnes haue peirced Gods first borne? Thirdly, we should neuer thinke it strange to suffer in this world,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29.</note> seeing God spared not his owne first borne. Lastly, it may be a great comfort to Christians; and that two wayes: first, because they shall be accepted with God, in, and for, Christ, who is the first borne, and hath receiued a blessing for all the rest: secondly, because in Christ they themselues are accounted as Gods first borne, in comparison of other men: God will vse them as his first borne, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.22. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. <hi>Psal.</hi> 89.27.

                           <hi>Created.</hi>] God workes not as the Creatures doe, God workes in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant: Angels worke sodainely: Nature workes by little and little, and by degrees. There is a threefold effusion of the goodnesse of God: 1. by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: 2. by Spiration: 3. by Creation.</p>
                        <p>The Workes of God are eyther Internall and imanent, and are in the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, by an act internall and eternall; and thus Predestination is Gods worke; or externall and transient, passing to the Creatures, by an act externall and temporall. And these workes are eyther workes of Nature, or workes of Grace:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Quae est in fieri. qua est in sacto</hi>
                           </note> the workes of Nature respect her, eyther as shee is in making, or as she is made: the latter workes are workes of Prouidence, the former, are workes of Creation.</p>
                        <p>A difference must be made betweene creating, generating, and making. A thing comes into beeing, of nothing, by Creation: of something, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: and of a substance, by generation. Creation is of God, by himselfe: Generation is of Nature according to God.</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it was in him, as that decree, and fore-appointed head and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which all the other things should be placed and consist: thus he is said to be the <hi>beginning of the Creatures of God.</hi>

Concerning this creation of all things, I onely note two things: First, how they were created: secondly, the errours that sprung vp against this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                        <p>Now, <hi>All things were created.</hi>] First, <hi>most freely,</hi> without any necessitie that compelled God thereunto <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.9. <hi>&amp;</hi> 115.3.</note>. Secondly, <hi>without any labour,</hi> motion, or mutation of himselfe, with a becke onely; and by his omnipotent Word <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.9.</note>. Thirdly, <hi>of nothing:</hi> of nothing I say, negatiuely, in the Creation of the first masse of all things; and of nothing priuatiuely, in the second Creation of things, out of the first masse or Chaos. For though in the order of nature, and by men, nothing is made of nothing, yet this extendeth not to God and the first Creation. Fourthly, <hi>most wisely,</hi> so as there flowed in the Creation, a <hi>goodnesse</hi> to euery Creature, so as <hi>they were all good,</hi> in Gods account <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31.</note>: This Goodnesse in Man and Angels, was Gods Image in them. Fiftly, <hi>in time,</hi> with time, <hi>in the very beginning</hi> of time <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1.</note>. Sixtly, <hi>in the space of sixe dayes</hi>; not at one time onely, and this shewed the Creatures disabilitie, that could not forme it selfe when the first matter was created. Herein also God shewed his power, and that hee was not tyed to second causes, as he declared when he gaue light to the world, while yet there was no Sunne.</p>
                        <p>Then herein he teacheth men to dwell long vpon the meditation of the Creation, seeing God himselfe did prolong the Creation for so many dayes, which yet he could haue dispatched in an instant.</p>
                        <p>There were foure errors about the Creation:<note place="margin">Foure words confute foure Errours.</note> Some said the world vvas eternall: some said, though it were not eternall, yet it had a materiall begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it was made of something: Some said, God made the superiour Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures himselfe, and the inferiour by Angels: some, made two beginners of things; they imagined that one Beginner made things incorruptible, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, made things corruptible. The very first Verse of the Bible, confutes all foure Errours: the word, <hi>in the beginning,</hi> shewes the world was not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: the word <hi>Creation,</hi> notes, that it was made of nothing; when he saith, <hi>God</hi> created all, hee excludes Angels: and lastly, when hee saith, God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Heauen and Earth,</hi> hee shewes hee was the onely beginner of all sorts of Creatures.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Sorts of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> the distinction of the Creatures followes: here they are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished three wayes: 1. by Place, some are things in heauen, some things in Earth: 2. by Qualitie, some are visible, some are inuisible: 3. by a subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of the inuisible; some are Thrones, some are Dominions, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thrones,</hi>

                           </note> 
                           <hi>or Dominions, or Principalities, or Powers.</hi>] These words are diuersly interpreted. Some thinke, there is no necessitie to vnderstand them of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; but in generall of all Empire, and of the order of <hi>oeconomie,</hi> among the Creatures, in Marriage, Lawes, or Gouernments, in heauen or Earth. Some restraine the words, to order amongst men onely. Some vnderstand by Thrones the Pallace of Gods Maiestie, and the seate of blessed immortalitie; and the rest of the words they interprete of Angels. But the commonest opinion, and most auncient, is to vnderstand all the words of Angels onely: But in this there is not agreement, for some thinke the Apostle speakes by way of Concession, as if hee should say; Be it so that Angels are <hi>Thrones</hi> and <hi>Dominions, &amp;c.</hi> (as the Iewes and false Apostles affirme, when they goe about to perswade you to Angell-worship) yet if that were granted, Christ onely were to be worshipped, because he made all those; and what excellency they haue, they had it from him. Others thinke that the Apostle reckoneth vp the excellent'st things in humane gouernment, and giues them to Angels, to sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow out their glory; and consequently, the glory of Christ that made them.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21380:73"/>
I thinke there is no hurt in their opinion, that giue all these words vnto An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:<note place="margin">Why Angels are called by these names.</note> And they are called <hi>Thrones, Dominions, Principalities,</hi> &amp; <hi>Powers,</hi> because God by them gouernes the Nations, and as some thinke, moues the Heauens; restraines the Deuils, workes Miracles, foretels things to come, protects the faithfull, and exerciseth his iudgements vpon the world: yet so as these names may be giuen to all Angels, in diuers respects, and vpon occasion of diuers employments: Or they may be giuen to some Angels for a time, and not for euer. Or if it be yeelded that those names doe distinguish the diuers sorts of Angels, and their order; yet it will not follow, that wee can tell their sorts,<note place="margin">The Vses of the doctrine of Creation.</note> as the bold <hi>Dionisius,</hi> and the Papists haue aduentured to doe.</p>

                        <p>The doctrine of Creation cannot but be a doctrine of great reproofe and terrour to wicked men; because those goodly Creatures, being Gods workemanship, will plead against them, and make them inexcuseable in the day of CHRIST; in as much as they haue not learned to know and serue God with thankefulnesse and feare, that shewed his Wisedome and Power, and other the inuisible things of God, in the making of all those Creatures <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19.</note>. And besides, from the great power of God, in the Creation of themselues and other Creatures, they may see that they are in a wofull case, that by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning striue with him that made them: for hee hath the same power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them <note n="f" place="margin">

                        <p>And further, if God made all, then he knowes all, and so all the sinnes of the sinner; and in that he made all, he hath all at his command as Lord by creation; all Armies, to raise them against the wicked for their subuersion.</p>

Though it be a great thing to gather men againe into couenant with God, and to open the eyes of men, blinde with ignorance, and to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the soules of men that haue long lyne in the prisons of sinne and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; yet we may be assured that God, by the ordinances of Christ, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish all the great things of this spirituall kingdome; because hee was able to create the Heauens and Earth.

Thirdly, in the vse of the Creatures, wee should be carefull to expresse the glory of Christ, by giuing thankes, by magnifying his Wisedome, Power, Goodnesse, &amp;c. and by distributing them, according to his appoyntment, as to the poore, and to the maintenance of the worship of God: for seeing they are his, and for him, wee should despose of them as he requires. Lastly, it should keepe vs from the vse of all ill meanes: for seeing it is for Christ, we should not lye, deceiue, vse false weights, runne to Witches, or take any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vngodly course; for he needes not our lye, nor desires to be helped by any sinnefull course.</p>

                        <p>That Christ might become our Head, wee must consider what hee did in fitting himselfe thereunto: and secondly, what he doth in vs. For him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, hee tooke the same Nature with his Church; else had the Church beene like <hi>Nabuchadnezzars</hi> Image. Yet as hee tooke our Nature, so wee must know that he bettered it. The Head differs in worth from the Body, because therein is seated the minde, which is the noblest part of man: so in the humane Nature of Christ, dwels the Godhead bodily; and by expiation, in his owne person, Christ takes away the sinnes of the Church, which else would haue letted all Vnion. And lastly, hee exalted his suffering Nature, and seated himselfe aloft, as meete to haue the preheminence, and become Head of all the faithfull: And as the Head is there seated, so are the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: for, 1. they are collected out of the World, by the sound of the Gospell: Let them lye hidden in the world that meane to perish with the world. 2.

                        <p>First, in vaine doe the wicked enemies of the Church pride themselues in the greatnesse of Learning, Power, Meanes, &amp;c. thinking to suppresse the being or glory of Christs Church on Earth; for <hi>the stone that the Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders refused, will proue the Head of the corner.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, in vaine doe the Papists goe about to maintaine their ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Head; for the Church is neither without a Head, nor many-Headed.

                        <p>Thirdly, in vaine doe carnall men plead their hopes in Christ, when they can yeeld no sound reason to proue they are Christs members. They are not members of this body vnder this Head, that want Faith; that haue not the spirit of Christ; that are not quickened with the life of Grace; that are not wrought vpon by the word of Christ, nor built vpon the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Prophets and Apostles, that feele no influence of graces from CHRIST; that want the knowledge of Prophets, or mortification of Priests, or victory ouer the World, as Kings; that eyther pride themselues in their owne ciuill righteousnesse, or can fall away wholy, and for euer.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, if the CHVRCH be the Body of CHRIST, and wee Members of this Body, wee should learne to carry our selues one towards another, <hi>in all humblenesse of minde, and long-suffering, supporting one another, and keepe the bond of peace in the vnitie of the spirit</hi>

                           <pb n="124" facs="tcp:21380:77"/>Lastly, all discontentments with our place or calling, or estimation in the body, and all contempt, or enuy, at the gifts or place of other Christians, should be banished out of our hearts <note n="v" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.15 22.23.26.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the excellency of Christ, in relation to the Church, as it is briefly propounded: the explication followes.</p>
                        <p>The head hath three Priuiledges, or excels all the Members in Order, Perfection, or Vertue, and Efficacie. The preheminence of Christ is three wayes considered. First, in respect of the dignitie of Order, <hi>verse</hi> 18. of order I say, toward the Members. Secondly, in respect of perfection in himselfe, in the fulnesse of grace, <hi>verse</hi> 15. Thirdly, in respect of Vertue, Efficacie, and influence toward the whole body, <hi>verse</hi> 20.</p>
                        <p>The primacie of CHRIST in order, or relation to the Members, is twofold. First, in the estate of Grace, <hi>He is the beginning.</hi> Secondly, in the respect of the state of Glory, <hi>Hee is the first begotten of the dead.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Hee is the beginning.</hi>] Christ may be sayd to be the beginning, in three respects. First, as he is the first fruits, for whose sake the rest are accepted, and blessed. Secondly, as hee is the repayrer of the world, decayed by mans sinne. Thirdly, as hee is the beginning of the good things that are in the Church: hee is both the obiect and efficient cause of faith. Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication flowes from his death, and new Obedience from his Resurrection: Iustification is wrought from his obedience.</p>

                        <p>There is a threefold primogeniture of Christ: Hee is the first begotten. First, in respect of eternall generation; as he is the Sonne of God. Of this before. Secondly, as hee is borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi>; for shee is said to bring forth her first begotten Sonne <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.</note>. Thirdly, when God raised Christ out of the Graue, hee is said to beget his Sonne, for so the words of the second Psalme: <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day haue I begotten thee,</hi> are applied to the Resurrection of CHRIST <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33.</note>. In that Christ is said to be the first begotten of the dead, three things may be noted, as implied heere, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the members of Christ: and three things concerning Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as Head.</p>
                        <p>First, concerning the Members, these things may be gathered:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That not onely wicked men, but the true members of Christ dye, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. The consideration of this, that the godly must dye, may serue for many Vses: first, <hi>Why doth vaine man dye then without wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> 
                           <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iob</hi> 4.21.</note>?
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:21380:77"/>
secondly, how shall wicked men escape <note n="g" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iob</hi> 21.32. <hi>Esay</hi> 28.</note>? their Couenant with Death must needes be disanulled: thirdly, it should cause vs deepely to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the vanities of this life <note n="h" place="margin">
                              <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2.16.17</note>: fourthly, it should cause vs to take heede of <hi>Eues, Least yee dye</hi>; for it is out of all question, dye wee must, and therefore meete it were, wee should prouide for it, without mincing or procrastina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: lastly, we should incourage our selues, and dye like the members of Christ, with all willingnesse, Faith and Patience.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The gouernance of Christ reacheth as well to the dead as to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Members. This the faithfull were wont of old to note, when they would say a man were dead, they would say, hee was <hi>ioyn'd to his people.</hi> This should be a great encouragement vnto godly men to dye.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 From Coherence; that if wee would haue Christ to be the first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to vs when wee are dead, wee must subiect our selues to his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, that hee may be the beginning of true Grace to vs while we liue.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, concerning the Head, these three things may be noted:</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That hee was among the dead, and this was good for vs: for thereby hee dissolued the power the Diuell had to inflict death, or the feare of it, vpon his Members <note n="i" place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15.</note>, and thereby hee finished the expiation of all our sinnes, thereby he ratified Gods Couenant, thereby hee kils the power of sinne in vs, and thereby he takes away the curse of our naturall death.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That he was not onely among the dead, but he was begotten among the dead, that is, raysed from death to life; and this also was profitable for vs, for hee rose to our Iustification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.23.24. to our viuification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. to our deliuerance from wrath to come, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That hee is not onely begotten, but the first begotten among the dead; and that in three respects. First; as hee was more excellently raysed then any of the dead are; for he carryed no corruption to the graue; and <hi>hee saw no corruption</hi> in the graue, and hee was but a short time vnder the power of the graue. Secondly, in respect of time; hee was the first that rose from the dead <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>Acts</hi> 26.23.</note>. Thirdly, in respect of efficacie; it is hee by whose power all the rest rise <note n="l" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20.22 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.28.</note>.</p>
                        <p>This must needes be a great comfort to vs while wee liue, against the time our bodies must goe into the house of darkenesse, the darkesome lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging in the graue; onely, let vs seeke the vertue of the Resurrection of Christ in this world, and the experiment of the vigor of it, first vpon our soules, in plucking vs vp out of the graue of sinne, to walke before God, in newnesse of life <note n="m" place="margin">
                              <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.</note>.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That in all things hee might haue the preheminence.</hi>] These words are added for further amplification or Explanation of the former. They giue vnto Christ a primacie and preheminence in all things: First, ouer both liuing and dead: as hee is the beginning to the liuing, and the first begotten to the dead. Christ then hath the preheminence, he is first in all things, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.23.<note place="margin">Hee is first in diuers respects.</note> He is first many wayes: first in Time, as before all things: first in Order, hee hath a primacie of order, hee is the first to be reckoned and admired in the Church: first in the Dignitie of Person, hee excels in both Natures all that is in the Church or euer was: first in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree <note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.5.</note>: first in Gouernment <note n="o" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.27. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.4. <hi>Esay</hi> 9.</note>: first in Acceptation with God <note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5.</note>: lastly, he is first Effectiuely, as the cause of all the respect, order, and excellency in others: hee is the Roote out of which springs all the glory in the Church.</p>
                        <p>The vse is, first, for Terrour to all those that sinne against Christs prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, as they doe in a high degree;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Vses.</hi>
                           </note> that hauing <hi>begunne in the Spirit,</hi> will <hi>end in the flesh</hi>: such as hauing <hi>knowne the way of righteousnesse,</hi> afterwards <hi>turne from the holy course, with the Dogge to the vomit, and with the Swine to the wallowing in the mire</hi> 
                           <note n="q" place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 20.21 <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.4.19.</note>. Secondly, the consideration of Christs primacie and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:21380:78"/>
preheminence, should learne vs to take heede of climbing in the Church; it is dangerous to desire to be chiefe; it is almost the sole power of the Head of the Church <note n="r" place="margin">

Lastly, let it be our care both in heart and life, to yeeld Christ the preheminence; which we shall doe, if we labour to know nothing more then Christ crucified; if wee minde the things of Christs Kingdome, more then the things of this life; if wee make him our chiefe refuge by Faith, for all happinesse and reconciliation; if wee make him our ioy; reioycing more in Christ then carnall men can doe in the World,<note place="margin">How wee may in life yeeld Christ the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence.</note> (for a discontented life denyes Christ the preheminence;) if the zeale of Gods house can eate vs vp; if in all our actions wee performe the worship of God first; if we sticke not to confesse and professe Christ; if wee honour the faithfull, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the vile, and ioyne our selues to such as feare God, though they be despised in this world: and lastly, when we can in all things rather chuse to please God then men.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THere is great reason Christ should be acknowledged head, as in the former Verse, by reason of his primacie and preheminence; so in this Verse, by reason of the plenitude that dwels in him: No naturall head so full of senses, as hee is full of Grace.</p>
                        <p>It is to be noted in the generall, that the head should excell the members in gifts: and therefore it is a fault in Cities, when the people chuse vnto themselues vnmeete men to be their Heads.

And it is likewise a great shame to such Rulers of the people, as are so farre from repressing disorders, that they are disordered themselues and their housholds. So domesticall Heads likewise, if they would not see swearing, lying, whoring, passions, idlenesse, &amp;c. in their Children and Seruants, they must be free from ill example themselues, and be as heads, excelling the rest of the family in gifts and good behauiour.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Reconciliation is our first step to happinesse.</note>The principall poynt in the whole Verse to be obserued, is, that man hath then attayned the chiefe good, when his soule is reconciled to GOD: this is the summe of all that which Christ hath procured for his Church. <hi>Blessed are the people, whose God is the Lord.</hi> Others may be more rich then they, but none more happy; for heereby man is ioyned to the fountaine of all good, and not onely hath interest in his fauour, but reapeth vnspeake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able benefits by communion with his Attributes, Word, Workes, Holinesse and Glory.

That our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation cannot be hindered or altered: 2. That it ariseth from no sodayne motion in GOD, but is aunciently decreed: 3. That we are not reconciled for our merit; for it was decreed before we had done good or euill: 4. That the reasons of the reiection of some, and the gathering of others in time, are iust, though not alwayes exprest, because there is no decree without Gods counsell: 5. That if euer wee would haue the comfort of our Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, wee must make sure our Reconciliation; wee can neuer know Gods eternall loue to vs, till wee finde the experience of this fauour in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation: the Prisoner knowes not what fauour is in the Kings breast, till his Pardon comes.</p>

The world is now restored by the same wisedome it was first made.</p>
                        <p>Gods Image is restored in vs, by him that is the eternall Image of the Father. The middle Person in the Trinitie is the Mediator betweene God and Man, the naturall Sonne makes men Sonnes by Adoption: it is Christ that both can and ought to reconcile vs. He could not doe it if he were not God; he ought not to doe it if he were not man <note n="b" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Act.</hi> 4.13.</note>.</p>

                           </note> if we consider what eyther hee was, or what wee were. The <hi>Lord in the forme of a Seruant,</hi> procures the saluation of the Seruant: he that was <hi>the beginning of Gods workes,</hi> repayes him, that at best, was the last of them. God descended from heauen to earth, that man might ascend from earth to heauen: God is made the Sonne of man, that man might be made the Sonne of God: he that was rich became poore, to make vs rich; the immortall became mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, to make vs immortall. Hee is a Physitian to vs sicke, a Redeemer to vs sold, a Way to vs wandering, and Life to vs dead. Secondly, this should teach vs in all suits to God, to seeke to Christ the Son of God: it is he must offer vp our Prayers, procure our Pardon, and make our Peace; yea, it is hee and none other. Thirdly, we should seeke the <hi>testimony of Iesu,</hi> as well as his Ransome: if hee witnesse to our Reconciliation, wee neede neuer doubt of it: if hee giue no witnesse, wee can haue no assurance. The Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of Iesus is giuen, partly by the Promises of the Word, (he putting spirit and life into them for our particular comfort,) and partly by the vvit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Spirit of Adoption, in the vnvtterable feelings and ioy of our hearts <note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Esay</hi> 55.6. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.6.</note>.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reconcile.</hi>] The word imports a restoring of one to Amitie, from which hee was by his owne fault fallen. There is a three-fold estate of man: there is the estate, 1. of Innocency; and here the man is at Amitie with God: 2. of Corruption; and here is mortall enmitie betweene God and man: 3. of Grace; and here they are made friends, and the League renewed. Into the first estate wee came by Creation; into the second by Propagation; and into the third onely by Regeneration. The distinct knowledge of this three-fold estate of man, cleares Gods Iustice, from the blame of all those plagues, broke in vpon mankinde, through corruption: and it should scarre wicked men out of their wretched condition, as they are by nature
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:21380:80"/>
seruants of corruption. And it greatly commends the mercy of God, that could loue vs when wee were enemies.</p>
                        <p>In the performance of this worke of Reconciliation or Mediation, there are sixe distinct things done by Christ: the first is <hi>Discretion,</hi> or <hi>Dijudication</hi> of the cause: hee takes notice of the state and businesse of the Church. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, hee doth report the Will of God, the Couenant and Conditions of agreement with God, to the Church, Thirdly, hee makes Intercession for the offending party. Fourthly, hee satisfies and expiates for sinne. Fiftly, hee applyes that Satisfaction. Sixtly, he conserues the Elect in the state of Reconciliation. Discretion and Relation belong to the Propheticall office: Intercession and Satisfaction to the Priesthood: Application and Conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to his Regall Office.<note place="margin">Who are not reconciled to God in Christ.</note> Enquire then whether thou be reconciled to God in Iesus Christ. I consider it negatiuely; thou art not reconciled, if thou be not enlightened and inspired with the holy Ghost, to lead thee into all truth. For if Christ did reconcile thee, as a Prophet, hee must teach thee both by his Word and Spirit. Againe, thou art not reconciled, if thou haue not consecrated thy selfe to kill the beasts, thy sinnes, in sacrifice before the Lord; and by the Spirit of Intercession, to poure out thy soule in Gods sight. When Christ reconciles as a Priest, he poures vpon man the spirit of Compassion and Deprecation <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.12.</note>: Thou art not reconciled, if Christ beget thee not by the immortall seede, or rule thee not by the Scepter of his Word, or conserue thee not, in vprightnesse, with respect to all Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.</p>

Because there is for their sakes a reconciliation with all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in generall; for corruption is taken from the whole, though not from euery part: 3. Because God doth not receiue their persons into fauour, but all things that belong vnto them, that may concerne their felicitie: 4.

The Elect are all things, worth all, better then all. Kingdomes and Scepters and all the glory of the earth, is nothing in Gods account. As all is now corrupt with sinne, God would haue it knowne, hee stands not bound to any in the world, or the whole world, but onely to the Elect. 2. It should teach vs to know no man after the flesh, that is, not to respect men for their Lands, apparrell, titles, parentage, &amp;c. but for Grace <note n="f" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16.</note>. 3. Wee should not much wonder at the disorders are in the world: for were it not for the Elect, it would soone appeare, by the ruine of all, how little God cared for rebellious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates. 4. It is a great comfort, no one of the Elect shall perish; for all things be reconciled. 5. It should teach vs to make much of them that feare the Lord. Let them be in stead of all things in our account. Lastly, seeing all things are reconciled, now let vs keepe the peace, euen the vnitie of the Spirit, in the bond of Peace <note n="g" place="margin">

Secondly, when men vse the Sacraments but as bare signes, not discerning spiritually the presence of the Bloud and Body of the Lord. Thirdly, when men come thither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, being not called, nor within the compasse of the Couenant by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion.

Secondly, to shew the necessitie of it: It is not possible to be saued, but by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted righteousnesse of Christ. Thirdly, to shew that all things in Christs action and Passion, were meritorious, least men should superstitiously dote or dreame vpon his Bloud, or the word of the Crosse, or the signe of it, or the like. There is no merit in Bloud, but as it was in him. Fourthly, to exclude the worship of Angels, which abuse began then to grow among the <hi>Colossians.</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>On Earth.</hi>] Note here two things. First, that eternall life is begunne in this life: wee shall neuer see Gods face in Heauen, if wee taste not of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour on Earth. And if this must be begun on earth, why doe men deferre so great a worke as their reconciliation, as if it belong to heauen rather then to be done on earth; yea, this taxeth the slownesse of heart, and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of Gods Children. This knowledge, ioy, affection, &amp;c. is the same thou must haue in heauen. And wee should learne hence, to liue on earth, like the Citizens of Heauen, that new Ierusalem. Citizens will not liue so rudely as the Country Swaines, much more oddes ought there to be betweene <hi>Sarazons</hi> and <hi>Hagarens,</hi> if I may so say; much difference betweene them that dwell in Sion, and those that haue no portion but in Sinay. Gods Children are the Sonnes of the Free-woman, and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; wickedmen are the Children of the Bond-woman, and forrainers, and strangers from the Common-wealth of Israell.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, where hee saith, <hi>vpon the Earth,</hi> and yet <hi>in Heauen,</hi> I might note the vncertaintie of our abode on earth: wee haue nothing to possesse but the out-side of the earth, which is ready to shake vs off daily.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>All things in Heauen.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Whether An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled in Christ or no.</note>] For the meaning of these words, wee know, that there are in Heauen, both Angels and Saints. And it may be questioned whether Angels be reconciled in Christ or no: though Angels sinned not, yet Angels haue gain'd by Christ, a more perfect adhering to God, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing in their standing,<note n="q" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.9.</note> encrease of knowledge, and of Ioy <note n="r" place="margin">
                              <hi>Luke</hi> 15.10.</note>; yea, the Angels are reconciled by Christ thus, that is, they are made friends with vs, with whom they are at enmitie: yet I thinke this is not meant here, but the Saints onely are intended, because it seemes, he entreateth here of Christ,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:21380:82"/>
not onely as head (for so hee is head of Angels) but as Mediator betweene parties fallen out. Whence wee may note two things: first, that the very Saints now in heauen, once needed the merits of Christ; none come there but were first reconciled, which may be a comfort to the afflicted spirits of mourning and drooping Christians, if they consider that the greatest Saints did neede remission of sinnes as well as they. And besides, it pounds to pieces merit of workes, inasmuch as they come not into heauen, but by the merits of Christ. Secondly, wee may learne that Christ merited not onely our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but our grace and glory.</p>

                           <note place="margin">Sixe things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued from the coherence.</note>From the generall consideration of the matter contained in this Verse and the next, with the Coherence, sixe things may be obserued.</p>
                        <p>First, that CHRIST is a true head, to euery particular Church.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that then is any people happy, and not before, when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell gathers their soules to God.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, they cannot be miserable, that cease to be strangers and enemies to God, whatsoeuer their outward estate be.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Doctrine must be applyed, for the humiliation of Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: so to <hi>Dauid,</hi> for the conuincing of the wicked: so to <hi>Ahab,</hi> for the tryall and detection of the temporary Faith: so to <hi>Herod,</hi> for the hardening of the reprobates, and their reiection, and cutting downe by the Sword of Gods seruants, and for the speciall consolations and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of Gods Seruants. And therefore Ministers should employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in application, and to that end should study for power of matter, as well as forme of words, and turne themselues into all formes, requesting, beseeching, reprouing, &amp;c. with all diligence and sinceritie. The People also must know that their profiting lyes in application: and to this end, they should attend, meditate, repeate, pray, striue against Securitie and Obiections, keeping aliue the sparkes that are kindled in their soules. When a man can conscionably apply the Word, it shewes, hee truely hates sinne, and is a true hearer.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, men may know particularly, they are reconciled; which both checkes Securitie,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11.</note> in not labouring for this knowledge; and confutes Papists, and drowsie Protestants, that say it is presumption to thinke so.</p>
                        <p>Sixtly, Experience giues sure testimony to the Doctrine of the Gospell: then wee know profitably, when wee know the doctrine in our owne case, as the <hi>Colossians</hi> here their Reconciliation. Wee neede not wonder

then, if wee see that the most powerfull parts of practicall Diuinitie haue little or no testimonie, or if it be, it is darke and seldome, from the most men; yea, from many Church-men. The cause is, they neuer had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience themselues. And we should learne to esteeme their iudgement most, that doe draw Religion most into practise; for <hi>God will shew the humble his way.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And you.</hi>] In the gathering of Soules, God workes beyond desert, and many times beyond probabilities. If wee respect the men, they were Gentiles, hardened by hundreds of yeeres, in custome of sinnes: if wee respect the meanes, it is <hi>Epaphras,</hi> none of the greatest of the Apostles. Which should teach vs to <hi>liue by Faith,</hi> and vse Gods ordinance with confidence: As in the businesse of conuersion, so in matter of preseruation, knowing that God is not tyed to desert or meanes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Also.] Doct.</hi> The Church and Kingdome of Christ is in this world still in progresse; Christ hath not done, when hee hath conquered Rome spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, that had conquered the world before corporally, but here is a fresh increase and a new; <hi>You also.</hi> And thus it will be still, till the end of the world: and therefore wee should euery one doe what wee can to helpe forward the Kingdome of God, and the adding of such soules as yet belong to the vocation of Christ. And this wee may doe, both by furthering the Gospell preached, and by seeking a holy seede; getting within the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant our selues, and by education, labouring to mend that which by propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation wee haue marred. Yea, the consideration hereof, should much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage vs in the combate against Sinne and the World: for in the warre, Souldiers vse to gather spirit and valour vpon the tidings of new supplies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Now.</hi>] Men are not reconciled till redemption be applyed: Christ dyed before, but they were not reconciled till now: It is not safe for men to rest in the Historicall beliefe of Christs death: eyther learne to dye to sinne, to crucifie thy flesh, and to take vp thy Crosse daily, or else forbeare to mention CHRIST; for it is in vaine, thou hast no part as yet in Christ.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hath.</hi>] Though Sanctification, while wee tarry in this world be vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yet Reconciliation is past so soone as a man is turned to GOD. Gods rich fauour may stand with the many wants and infirmities of man: but then we must remember it is free and gracious: for if we be perfectly reconciled and yet not perfectly sanctified, then it must needes follow, wee are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled from our owne workes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hee.</hi>] That is Christ, which being againe mentioned, shewes, 1. that hee is God, seeing Reconciliation is here giuen to him, which was before ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Father. 2. It proues that in the one essence of God are more Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons then one. 3. It proues that Christ dyed willingly: hee is not onely the meanes but the vndertaker of our Reconciliation <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14.</note>: hee is not onely the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but the Priest also.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reconciled.</hi>] The repetition or application of this word and worke to the <hi>Colossians,</hi> shewes that there is one constant way, that God holds vnalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably with all his people. No sort of men can be happy, vntill they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled: if men will not minde their peace, and sue out their pardon in Christ, their hope will fayle them; there is no other way to be saued.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the words of Coherence: There remaines both their misery in this Verse, and the remedy of it in the next Verse.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Strangers and Enemies, &amp;c.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Good to think much of our misery.</note>] In generall wee may first obserue, that it is profitable for men to know and meditate of their naturall misery, though men be neuer so vnwilling to it; yea, though they be already deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from it. For the consideration hereof shewes men the neede of a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21380:83"/>
Sauiour, and as a Schoole-master traynes them vp to Christ: it mollifies the stony hearts of men; it breedes watchfulnesse ouer our nature, when wee know it is so poysoned and corrupted: it makes vs compassionate ouer others in their distresse or infirmities: it sets an high price vpon spirituall things, and makes vs account Gods fauour our greatest ioy: it makes vs cleaue to God in a perpetuall Couenant. To omit many other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that arise hereof, it reproues the seldome teaching and learning of the doctrine of mans naturall miseries.</p>

                           <hi>Quest.</hi> But what hurt is it to carnall men to be thus estranged? <hi>Ans.</hi> There is no safetie against dangers, where God is not to protect men: there is no comfort in affliction, where one can neyther looke to God, nor the Saints, for succour and comfort.</p>
                        <p>The God of this world doth rule effectually in all the Children of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, they are in bondage to the world, they are in bondage to their owne flesh, euen to a passionate, blinde, hard hart, and rebellious nature. They want the delightfull refreshing of all the blessings of God, his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, graces or outward fauours: All glory is departed from men, when God is gone. Besides, obstinacie may cast them into a reprobate sence and eternall death may swallow them vp.</p>
                        <p>That wee may be deliuered from this strange estate of separation, the bloud of Christ must be applyed, wee must become new Creatures, our peace must be preached, accesse must be had to God by prayer, wee must be ioyned to Gods Children, we must be built vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, and our soules must become Temples for the holy Ghost to dwell in: all this is set downe in the second of the <hi>Ephesians</hi> from <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. to the end of the Chapter.</p>
                        <p>And to this end we must take heed of <hi>working iniquitie</hi>

                        <p>Lastly, if it be so great a misery to be estranged, woe be to them that lye in this misery, and regard it not: the lesse sense the more danger; and most faultie is that frowardnesse in any, that professe to feare Gods Name, that voluntarily bring a curse vpon themselues, by estranging themselues from the societie of the faithfull. But let all that know Gods mercie in their reconciliation, reioyce in their deliuerance from this miserie.</p>

                        <p>And all this shewes the great misery of wicked men: and how can they but be miserable, that are in the estate of enmitie? All seueritie will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Iustice, all their vertuous prayses but fayre sinnes: stript they are of all the peculiar priuiledges of the Saints; and that which men would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to doe to their enemies, God will certainely, by an vnauoydable proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doe to them. All the Creatures are against him: a wicked man is as hee that should alway goe vpon a Mine of Gunne-powder: eyther by force or by stratagem, the Creatures will surprise him.

                           <hi>In euill Workes.</hi>] If the dependance, and the words themselues be duely considered, wee may here gather fiue things: First that the euill workes of the sinner, cause the strangenesse and enmity aforesaid. Secondly, that a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man can like himselfe well enough, though his very workes, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behauiour be euill: <hi>He can blesse himselfe in his heart, when his iniquity is found worthy to be hated</hi>

Fourthly, that hee that allowes himselfe in one sinne, will pollute himselfe with many sinnes.

                        <p>First, there is no remedy for the sinner, but the death of his Sauiour: how foolish mankinde hath beene distracted about the cure for their mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, is lamentable to consider: <hi>Adam</hi> gets Figge-leaues, and Israell a foolish Couer <note n="a" place="margin">

                        <p>Secondly, It is profitable to be much in the meditation of Christs suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, that it might sincke into our minds, that we must goe out of our selues for happinesse; and such meditations open a way to godly sorrow <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ezec.</hi> 12.12.</note>. They tend to the mortification of sinne, and they incline the heart of a Christian to be willing to suffer with him: for hee suffered as the Master, wee are but Seruants: hee suffered for others sinnes;<note place="margin">The good that comes by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating of Christs suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</note> wee deserue more then wee can suffer by our owne sinne. Hee suffered all sorts of crosses, and infinite much: we suffer butlight affliction. And the thought of his sufferings, may make vs willing to contemne the world, seeing hereby wee discerne that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not of this world. Yea, we owe vnto Christ the remembrance of his sufferings. It is a small thing he requires of vs, when he wils vs to thinke on him often, what he hath endured for vs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In that body of his flesh.</hi>] These words note Christs Nature: yet wee must consider which Nature: in Christ there were two Natures in one person, personally vnited: his diuine and humane Nature. His diuine Nature was from Eternitie, Immutable, Immortall, Impassible. His humane Nature, was conceiued, and borne in time; Mutable, Mortall, Passible; one and the same: without time begotten of the Father, the Sonne of God: without Mother; and in time borne of the Virgin, the Sonne of Man without Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Sonne to both, Naturall &amp; Consubstantiall. These Natures are in one person, for that God and Man might become one in Couenant: one is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come God, &amp; man in person. These Natures are personally vnited: this vnion is personall, but not of persons; and it is a vnion of Natures, not naturall.</p>
                        <p>In these words the Apostle speakes of the Nature assumed, <hi>viz.</hi> his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. And there are two things to be noted in these words. First, that hee saith, <hi>that body,</hi> not <hi>the body.</hi> Secondly, that he saith not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>his body,</hi> but <hi>that body of his flesh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That body.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Christs body more excellent then all other bodies.</note>] Heere hee points out a speciall excellency in the body of Christ, aboue all other bodies in Heauen and Earth: for his body was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne, formed by the ouershadowing power of the holy Ghost; so is no mans else. 2. It is assumed into personall vnion with the diuine Nature.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:21380:85"/>
3. It was honoured with speciall Prophecies, Types, and Sacrifices. 4. This body was offered vp as a full expiatory Sacrifice. 5. It is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred to the end of the word, in the Sacrament.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Christs body not like ours in two things.</note>
                           <hi>Body of his flesh.</hi>] To note, that it was a true Body, like vnto ours; and to distinguish it from his Sacramentall and misticall body. In two things Christ body was not like ours, and in three things it was like. It was not like: first, in the manner of subsisting: it was not independent, or a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it selfe. 2. In the vitious actions of the substance of it, no sinne, eyther could or ought to infect it: Could not; because originall sinne was restrained by the Holy Ghost: Ought not, because in it a purgation for our sinnes must be made. In three things it was like ours: first, in substance, he tooke our whole Nature; he was the seed of the Woman, of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">In three things it was like.</note> the Sonne of man, &amp;c. And hee tooke the parts of our Nature, both soule and body. 2. In properties, and thus hee assumed both the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the whole Nature, in that hee was finite, and create. And in the parts, as in the soule, hee assumed, Vnderstanding, Will, Memory: and in the Body, Figure, Quantitie, and Circumscription, &amp;c. 3. In infirmities, for hee assumed not onely our Nature, but the infirmities of Nature. But wee must know that hee tooke the defects, or infirmities, they call misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: not those they call damnable.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the Doctrine of his Nature: his Sufferings follow.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Through death.</hi>] The death of Christ doth reconcile vs, in as much as it ratifies the couenant, and takes away the guilt of the sinnes of the former Testament, and the vertue of it eats downe the power of present sinnes, and destroyes the power of our naturall death.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Christs death differs from ours, in three things.</note>Christs death differs from the death of all the Elect, in three things. First, in that in death he sustained not his owne person, but dyes as our suretie, and so is a sacrifice for sinne. Secondly, he was in death a whole burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering; for as hee died in body, so his soule was <hi>an offering for sinne,</hi> in as much as he sustained the sence of the infinite wrath of God in his Agonies. Thirdly, in that his death was the death of him that was the Sonne of God. Hitherto of the doctrine, of the Nature and sufferings of CHRIST, the Vses follow.</p>
                        <p>First, for Instruction. The consideration of all this should teach vs, 1. to vallew reconciliation,<note place="margin">Vses of Christs death.</note> with all the graces that flow from it, according to the worth of the meanes by which they are procured. If there were no other way to know the worth of Gods Fauour, Knowledge, Spirituall refreshings, and Graces, yet by the price, paid for the purchase of them, we may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne they are worth more then all the world. 2. It is not possible for vs to hate sinne, vpon the consideration of so pregnant an example of the odiousnesse of it, when the imputation of sinne brought the Sonne of God on his knees, to his death. <hi>O the soule Lethargie,</hi> that hath ouergrowen vs! 3. That wee may haue the profit of the Incarnation, and Passion of CHRIST, in his naturall body, wee must be carefull to get into his misti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body. 4. The Apostle vseth the Meditation of Christs humiliation to the death, as an argument to perswade vs to Compassion, Mercy, Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the Spirit; Vnitie, Humilitie, Clemency, and meekenesse of minde, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1. <hi>to</hi> 9.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, wicked men may here see what smart they are like to feele from the vnpartiall iustice of God. Doth hee not spare the body, the flesh, the bloud, the life, of his owne Sonne, when he became but a suretie for sinne? How shall vngodly men, euer enemies, and neuer sonnes, that themselues haue committed sinne, escape, when the day of wrath shall come?</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, godly men may heere see great reason of comfort, not onely by
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:21380:85"/>
considering the great loue of Christ, and the great benefits must needes flow from his death; but if but two things be weighed: 1. the honour done to our Nature, in that in the humanitie of Christ it is ioyned to the diuine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This makes amends for that breach that is made by the damnation of millians,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6 7,</note> in our nature. 2. The great certainty of Gods couenant, of Grace and Mercy. For <hi>a mans couenant, if it be once confirmed, no man abrogates it,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 9.</note> 
                           <hi>or addeth, or taketh from it:</hi> therefore, much more Gods Couenant shall stand vnchangeable, being ratified and confirmed by the death of Christ.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the Meanes.</p>
                        <p>The end followes, in these words: <hi>To present you holy, and without spot, and vnblameable in his sight.</hi> And in these words, is both the presentation, and the sanctification of Christians to be considered.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To present you.</hi>] The originall word is very significant, and diuersly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted: it signifies to restore: so <hi>Asts</hi> 9.41. to assemble, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.26. to make present: so <hi>Acts</hi> 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>33. to make ready, furnish, purge, or make cleane, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.24. to make acceptable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8. to make manifest, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. to proue euidently, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.13. to assist, and stand too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.2. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>16. to offer by way of dedication, or gift to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.22. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28.</p>
                        <p>It is true that Christ restores vs,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.27. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.6.</note> collects vs, brings vs into Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, clenseth vs, makes vs acceptable, assists, and defends vs, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests vs to be holy. But I take it principally in the last sence, he presents vs by dedication to God. Thus Christ shall present vs wholy, both at the day of iudgement <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10.</note>, and in the day of death, when he shall deliuer the soule to God. Thus also Christ doth present vs in this life: 1. When by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospell, he seuers and segregates vs from the world, and brings vs into Gods household. 2. In Iustification, when clothing vs with his owne righteousnesse, hee becomes our Iustification. 3. in new obedience: and that two wayes: first, when hee presents our workes, couered with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession. Secondly, when hee causeth vs to present our selues to GOD, both by Prayer &amp; consecration of our selues to Gods Seruice, and holines of life. It must be euery mans care then to seeke, his presentation from Christ, and to that end, by Couenant, Prayer, and practise, deuote him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to a subiection, to all the ordinances of CHRIST.</p>
                        <p>Thus of Presentation: Sanctification followes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Holy,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">How the words are to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.</note> 
                           <hi>vnblameable, and vnreproueable in his sight.</hi>] At the first sight I should encline to vnderstand these words, eyther of Iustification, or our consumate holinesse at the day of iudgement; but that the sway of interpreters force me to expound them of Sanctification. It is greatly to be weighed, that a man in this life should be heresaid to be holy, vnblameable, and vnreproue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or as the other Translation hath it, without fault in his sight. For the better conceiuing of it, wee must compare with these words, other Scripture, wherein is giuen vnto the godly, that they haue cleane hands, and a pure heart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 24.4. that they are pure, <hi>Prou.</hi> 21.8. vpright in heart, <hi>Psal.</hi> 97.11. sanctified throughout,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.61.</note> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.23. perfect, or vndefiled in their way, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.1. perfect, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48. faultlesse, <hi>Iud.</hi> 24. without spot, and blamelesse, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.14. walking in all Gods wayes, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.58. and that they keepe Gods couenant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 78.8.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 132.22. Thus <hi>Noah</hi> is said to be perfect, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Ezekiah</hi> walked before God, with a perfect heart, <hi>Esa.</hi> 38. <hi>Dauids</hi> heart was perfect, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Zachariah,</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> were both righteous before God, and walking in all the commandements of the Lord blamelesse, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.6.</p>
                        <p>The question is, how those sayings should be true, and in what sence they are ment: And for the clearing of the doubt, the way is not simply to reiect the propositions, as impious, and vntrue, and hereticall, as some igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:21380:86"/>
and malicious persons doe: but seeing they are the sacred words of Scripture, to consider what it is may be attained, and what God requires of vs. To thinke with the Papists, or Anabaptists, that any mortall man can performe the obedience required in the morall Law, perfectly; so as neuer to commit sinne against the Law, is a most blasphemous, detestable, and cursed opinion, for there is no man that sinneth not: the best of the Saints haue had their thousands of sinnes. But those places are to be vnderstood of the righteousnesse of the Christian, as hee is considered to be vnder the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, and the Gospell, not of legall perfection, but of an Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall innocency, and vprightnesse.

                           <hi>Continue.</hi>] Three things I propound concerning perseuerance. First, some reasons to moue vs, to labour, to hold out, and continue. Secondly, rules to be obserued, that we might continue. Thirdly, the helpes the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full haue to further their perseuerance.</p>
                        <p>For the first: Vnlesse we continue, wee shall neuer haue the full truth of God, nor be made free by it: nor haue found comfort, that wee are the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Christ <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.31.32</note>. Neither is any man <hi>fit for the kingdome of God, that puts his hand to the plow, and lookes backe</hi>

                           <note n="f" place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.19.</note>. <hi>It had beene better</hi> (for men) <hi>neuer to haue knowen the way of righteousnesse, then after they haue knowne it, to turne from the holy Commandements, deliuered vnto them. For if after they haue escaped the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of Iesus Christ, they be againe entangled, and ouercome; the latter end will be worse then the beginning</hi> 
                           <note n="g" place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19.20.</note>. Yea, the very children of God by backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding, may fall into a miserable condition; <hi>the powers of Hell may assault them</hi>

                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 77.11.</note>. They may goe to the graue with vnrecouerable affliction: yea, they may lose some graces, without all restitution in this world: as the ioy of their saluation plerophorie, or full assurance, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>For the second:<note place="margin">Eyght rules for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> If thou wouldest continue, thou must obserue eyght rules. First, thou must get a continuing faith: get thee an infallible assurance of Gods fauour, arising from the wise Application of Gods promises, and the sure witnesse of Gods spirit <note n="i" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.40.</note>. Secondly, thou must at first be throughly cleansed of all thy filthines; making conscience to repent of all sinne, and haue respect to all Gods Commandements. And thou must be sure thou get a <hi>new heart:</hi> for the olde heart is deceitfull, and will not hold out in any thing that is good <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26.27.</note>. Thirdly, thou must continue to vse the meanes of preseruation: thou must still heare, pray, read, conferre, meditate, and receiue the Sacraments; for the spirituall life is preserued by meanes, as well as the naturall. Fourthly, thou must ioyne thy selfe to such as feare God, in the societie and fellowship of the Gospell. The affections, and desires of many, are blasted, and soone vanish, like a morning cloud, for want of communion with such as are able to direct, comfort, admonish, or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them <note n="l" place="margin">

Sixtly, thou must so receiue the truth of the doctrine of Christ, as thou be also ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to confesse it, and professe it, amidst the different opinions, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of men <note n="o" place="margin">

                        <p>Lastly, thou must be euer wary, and take heede of crosse teachings, and the puffs of contrary doctrine: and withall; take heed of coldnesse, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the truth, and of discord, with such as feare God. Many times personall discords worke through mens singular corruptions, apostacy from the truth once receiued <note n="q" place="margin">

And out of all this wee may discerne the cause of the backe-sliding of many, eyther they were deceiued by a temporary faith; or neglected the constant vse of Gods ordinances, or were sleightly in mortification; or they forsooke the fellowship of the Saints; or they were tost with contrary doctrine; or they were people of vnruly affections; or were seduced by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret lusts.</p>

                           <hi>Grounded, and stablished in the faith.</hi>] It is not enough to get Faith, and continue in it; but wee must be grounded and stablished: and when he saith, stablished in the Faith, wee must vnderstand, the Doctrine, profession, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, assurance, and effects of Faith. And this establishing, and grounding of our hearts, hath in it foure things, <hi>to wit,</hi> particular Knowledge, Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Resolution, and Contentment.</p>
                        <p>To be thus established,<note place="margin">The priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of an established and grounded heart.</note> would fortifie vs against all the changes, and alterations of estate, or Religion in after-times: and as the Coherence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, it would much further vs, in the attainement of an vnstained and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebukeable life: whereas of doubting can come nothing but the shunning of God, the libertie of sinne, and desperation, and the like. Besides, this grounded establishment in Faith, would free our profession from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonours, which an vnsetled or discontented Faith, or life, doth cast vpon vs. <hi>Atheists, Papists, Epicures,</hi> and <hi>Belly-gods,</hi> if this were in vs, would be astonished to see the power of Religion, in our resolued contentment, and to consider how vnmoueable wee were; so as the gates of Hell could not preuaile against vs. Besides the vnsearchable solace that a peaceable and rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conscience would breed in vs.</p>
                        <p>That we might be thus grounded,<note place="margin">What we must doe, that wee might be grounded and stablished.</note> and stablished, diuers things are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be obserued. 1. Wee must be founded on the Prophets, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.20.</note>; we must be daily conuersant in the Scriptures. 2. We must be much in prayer, but in practise of prayer; wee must nourish the hatred of euery sinne; and daily labour to encrease in the reformation of euill. And it is a great helpe to be much with such as feare God, and call vpon God with a pure heart. It would much establish vs, to see the faith, affections, feruency, and power of Gods spirit in others, in prayer <note n="g" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.22.</note>. 3. There is a secret bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of God, in setling a mans heart, followes vpon well doing: so as to be abundant in Gods worke, is a great meanes of stedfastnesse; whereas a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and barraine life, is both vncomfortable, and vnsetled <note n="h" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.58. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19.</note>. 4. We must pray God to giue vs a <hi>free</hi> and ingenious <hi>spirit</hi>

                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.12. What a free spirit is.</note>: wee must pray to God to giue vs a minde, cheerefull, speedy, full of incitations to good, glad of all occasions to doe good: free from the staine of the sinnes of the Time, Nation, or Calling, and from the raigne of former lusts, inclineable to serue God, and our Brethren by Loue: fearing the Gospell more then the Law, and Gods goodnesse more then his iustice. 5. Wee must set an order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in Faith and Life. It is exceeding behoouefull in matter of opinions, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vp our soules to some sound frame of Doctrine, in which wee will euer quietly rest; and in matters of life, to gather out of the Commandements a platforme of liuing, that might fit our owne cause <note n="k" place="margin">

Lastly, wee must consecrate our selues to God, endeauouring daily to practise what wee daily heare: for <hi>hee that commeth to Christ, and heareth his sayings, and doth them, is like a man which hath built a House, and digged deepe, and layed the foundation on a Rocke; and when the flood arose, and the streame beat vehemently vpon that house, it could not shake it, because it was founded on a Rocke</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> This is occasioned diuersly. First, sometime for want of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct direction, or carefull examination, about the Application of the signes of Gods fauor: some Christians haue not the signes cleerly &amp; distinctly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: others that haue them, &amp; know the vse of them, grow sloathfull and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21380:89"/>
negligent, and are iustly scourged with the want of the glory of this esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, sometimes it comes to passe, for want of vsing priuate meanes more conscionably; as Reading, Prayer, or Conference.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, it is so sometimes with Christians, because of some sinne they lye in, without repentance; there may be some sinne, which they too much fauour, and are loath to forsake, whether it be secret, or more open.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Vnfruitfulnesse, and barrennesse in good workes may cause it: for if Faith did beare fruit vpwards, it would take roote downewards.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, many are grieuously pressed, vnder legall perfection, being not able distinctly to discerne the benefit of the Couenant of grace, in freeing them from the curse, and rigour of the Law. The ignorance of this one point, hath, and doth couer the faces and hearts of millions of Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, with a perplexed confusion, and feare without cause.</p>
                        <p>Sixtly, many professors liue in much vnrest, for want of discerning things that differ, and the right vse of Christian liberty.</p>
                        <p>Seauenthly, there is a kinde of luke-warmenesse in practise, after hearing, which is in many scourged with the withholding of this rich grace of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall stedfastnesse. I say, luke-warmenesse in practise: for it may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that many heare with great affection, and continue to be stirring, in expressing their liking of the Word, and yet are exceedingly negligent in the conscionable and daily practise of such rules, as in the ministery of the Word they seeme to receiue with admiration, and great liking.</p>
                        <p>Eyghtly, this comes by reason of the want of patience, and a meeke spirit: some Christians are froward, passionate, transported with violent affections, eyther of anger, or wordly griefe: and these seldome or neuer, gaine any long rest, or continuall contentment: troubled affections, greatly hinder setlednesse, euen in the best things.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, many professors reuolt to the world, and giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to an vniustifiable libertie, in following eyther their profits, or their pleasures. And therefore no maruell, though Grace and true Religion, thriue so slowly in them, when they eate vp their hearts and liues with these cares and delights of life.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto of Faith. Now of Hope.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Be not moued away from the hope of the Gospell, whereof yee haue heard.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Though by Faith wee are interressed in GODS fauour, and our soules garnished on earth with diuers graces, as the fruits of Faith, and our liues protected with caelestiall priuiledges; yet the glory of our kingdome is neither of this world, nor in this world. Hope must guide vs to future things, as well as Faith to present: and therefore the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> doth with great reason teach vs to <hi>blesse God,</hi> for <hi>begetting vs againe to a liuely hope</hi>
                           <note n="n" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.</note>: our whole happinesse may be branched out into these two parts. First, what we haue already on earth; and secondly, what wee looke to haue hereafter in Heauen. The one, Faith procures, the other, Hope assures. Now in that wee haue not all our happinesse here, but hope for it else where, it should teach vs diuers things.</p>
                        <p>First, wee should effectually pray vnto GOD to giue such sound <hi>wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and reuelation,</hi> by his word and spirit, <hi>that wee may indeed know this hope of our calling</hi>

                              <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.18.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, in all troubles, wee should be the more patient, seeing wee holde our full and finall deliuerance, when wee shall feele no more troubles or crosses, by Hope. Perfect saluation is had here onely by Hope <note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</note>.</p>

                           <hi>Not moued away.] Doct.</hi> It is not enough to haue hope, but we must get to be vnmoueable in it: for as the Authour to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> shewes, wee should be diligent to get and haue a <hi>Plerophorie,</hi> or full assurance <hi>of Hope to the end</hi>

                        <p>The Vse is two-fold: first, it may reproue that vnsetlednesse, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentment is found in men,<note place="margin">

                           </note> in the times of their affliction, when euery crosse can moue them away from their confidence. Wee would thinke him a strange man, that in time of peace, would walke vp and downe with a Helmet on him, and when hee were to goe into any battell, or fray, in the middest of the fight, when it was at the hottest, would take his Helmet, and throw it off him. And yet so strange are wee. In prosperitie, wee out-brag all men with our hope in God, and our strong confidence; but when the Deuill, or the World, begin to deale their blowes, and to molest vs with sharpest assaults, then we grow hartlesse, or impatient, and throw away our hope, when wee haue most need of it. Secondly, it should teach vs to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after this vnmoueablenesse of hope; which, that it may the better be done, two things are to be looked to. 1. that our hope be a true hope: 2. that wee vse the meanes to make this hope vnmoueable.</p>
                        <p>And for the first, wee must consider three things. First, what hope is not true hope. Secondly, what persons haue no hope. Thirdly, what are the effects or properties of true hope. Some things of many, in each of these, shall be instanced in.</p>
                        <p>First,<note place="margin">What hope is not true hope.</note> there is a hope, of which men shall one day be ashamed: such is, mens hope in their riches <note n="x" place="margin">

                        <p>Secondly, there are many sorts of men in the world, concerning whom it is plaine in Scriptures,<note place="margin">Who haue not true hope.</note> they haue not hope. For in the generall, there is no hope in any vnregenerate man <note n="c" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.12.</note>; and in particular it is cleere, there is no true hope. First, in the ignorant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>10. Secondly, in prophane men, that make not conscience of sinne, <hi>Psal.</hi> 115.11. Thirdly, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous, that blesse their hearts against the curses of the Law, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 29.19. Fourthly, in the hypocrite; for though he haue wouen to himselfe, out of the bowels of his poysonous breast, a faire webbe of hope, yet <hi>it shall be as the house of the Spider,</hi> one swope of Gods Beesome shall easily lay him and his hope in the dust of miserie <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iob</hi> 8.13.</note>. Lastly, it is not in workers of iniquitie, that make a Trade of sinne, and euery day plodde about mischiefe.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, true hope is most stirring in affliction, and then it shewes it selfe by foure things.<note place="margin">Which are the effects or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of true hope.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, By Profession: it will not onely know, but <hi>acknowledge that truth, which is according to godlines</hi> 
                           <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1.2.</note>. It will confesse, &amp; professe; wheras the common hope, seldome, or neuer at any time, holds it conuenient to be so forward.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:21380:90"/>
Secondly, by Abnegation; for it will endure scornes, losses, temptations, oppositions, &amp;c. It is not moued away by the carnall reasons of the flesh; the disdaine of carnall friends; the violence of vnreasonable aduersaries, or the like: the chaine will not feare it, nor the reproach shame it <note n="f" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10.</note>. It will be busie, though it haue no thanke for his labour <note n="g" place="margin">
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 28.20.</note>: And secretly, it <hi>will not haste</hi> to ill meanes, to get out of distresse <note n="h" place="margin">
                              <hi>Esa.</hi> 28.15.16</note>: Whereas the common hope is frighted with the noyse of a chaine, and put out of countenance with a scoffe of disgrace: it will speake CHRIST faire, but loose nothing for his sake: it likes preaching well, but it will neuer beleeue it is so as the Preacher sayes: it loues GOD aboue all, but yet it must haue a care to see to it, at any hand, that such and such friends be not displeased: it will be better aduised then to be in danger of such and such troubles. And if it be hard be stead, it will venture to send to a Wizard, to vse now and then a lye, or an oath, or a little fraud, and false dealing, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, by Mortification: <hi>Hee that hath this hope, purgeth himselfe, that he may be pure, as Christ is pure</hi> 
                           <note n="i" place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3.</note>. It stirreth vp to much prayer, confession, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, fasting, and spirituall reuenge. Hee that hath most hope, is most in the humiliation of his soule. It is not as the world conceiues, that Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the way to desperation: but the common hope hath no hands to doe good workes; nor eyes to shedde these teares; nor stomacke to abide this fasting; nor flesh to endure this reuenge; nor tongue to speake this language.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, by Perseuerance: <hi>It will not cease from yeelding fruit</hi> 
                           <note n="k" place="margin">

                           <note place="margin">What wee must doe, that we might be vnmoueable.</note>Now that wee might be vnmoueable in this Hope, we should wait pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently vpon Gods ordinances, that wee might abound in the <hi>comforts of the Scriptures,</hi> increasing in Knowledge and Wisedome <note n="m" place="margin">

                        <p>Thus of the Duty, and the Obiect [<hi>Grace.</hi>] Now of the Meanes, by which it was wrought, which was the <hi>Gospell</hi> preached.</p>

                           <hi>Of the Gospell.] Doct.</hi> The <hi>Gospell</hi> is the ordinary meanes to breed hope in a mans heart <note n="r" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim</hi> 2.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16.</note>, and therefore it is called <hi>the Gospell of the Kingdome</hi>; and <hi>the Gospell of Saluation</hi>

                              <hi>Math.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.13.</note>.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Of which yee haue heard.] Doct.</hi> The <hi>Gospell</hi> is then most effectuall when it is preached: and more particularly, what efficacie is in preaching, may appeare by these Scriptures following: <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Esa.</hi> 55.4. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. <hi>&amp;c.

                        <p>Againe, in that the Apostle alleadgeth the efficacie of the Doctrine they heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to proue that they ought not to be moued away from it: wee may note, that that Doctrine which conuerts soules to God, is true; and men ought to continue in it. The Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2. proues his Doctrine to be true, by this seale of it: and this must comfort faithfull Teachers, against all the scornes of men, if they gather soules to GOD, and breed hope in Gods people. And the people must hence confirme themselues in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, to sticke to their Teachers, when God hath giuen this Testimony to their ministeries. Thus of the Exhortation.</p>

                           <hi>Which was preached vnto euery Creature vnder Heauen.</hi>] These words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the first reason, and it stands thus: In as much as the doctrine taught you, is the same Doctrine that hath beene taught to, and receiued by, all the Elect; therefore yee ought to continue in it, and neuer be moued from the Grace wrought by it.</p>

                              <hi>Ans.</hi>
                           </note> Some vnderstand the meaning to be this: that the Apostle intends to note,<note place="margin">How the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to euery creature.</note> by the preaching of the Gospell to euery Creature, onely thus much; That it was now no more confined in <hi>Iudea,</hi> but was published to Gentiles as well as Iewes: and so it was preached to euery Creature, in as much as all mankinde had as much interest as the Iewish Nation. Others thinke the speech imports no more, but that the fame of the Gospell was spread by the Merchants and other that lay at <hi>Rome, Ierusalem,</hi> and other great Cities, vnto all knowne Countries of the world. Others thinke it is no more then if hee had said, it was published farre and wide: as in <hi>Iohn</hi> they say, <hi>the whole world goeth after him</hi>; but they meane a great multitude; an vsuall Hyperboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call speech. Lastly, others thinke, that when he saith, it was preached, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it should be preached to euery creature; the time past being put for the time to come, to import, that it shall as certainely be done, as if it had beene done already. But I take, it is meant of the preaching of the Gospell by the Apostles and Euangelists, in the conuersion of so many Nations to the Faith of Christ.</p>
                        <p>There may be seauen Obseruations gathered out of this speech of the Apostle. First, that Doctrine onely is true which is agreeable to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Apostles, by which the world was conuerted to God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we may see that no power is like the power of the Word of GOD: here it conuerts a world in a short time: And our eyes haue beheld that it hath almost in as short time restored a world of men, from the power of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist. Thirdly, we may by this phrase be informed, that the words, <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>euery one,</hi> are not alwaies in Scripture to be vnderstood vniuersally, of all the singular persons in the world, as the vniuersalists conceiue. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they were but a few Fisher-men that did this great worke, and they were much opposed and persecuted, and in some lesse matters they iarred some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time among themselues. Whence wee may obserue, that Doctrine may be exceeding effectuall, though 1. but few teach it; 2. though they be but of meane estate and condition; 3. though it be opposed by crosse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary teaching; 4. though it be persecuted; 5. though the people be indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>zled in sinne and superstition, as these Gentiles were; 6. though the Preacher be often restrayned; 7. though there be some dissention in lesse matters. The fift thing that may be gathered hence, is, that in the conuersion of sinners, God is no respecter of persons; men of any age, nation, sexe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, life or qualitie, may be conuerted by the Gospell. And sixtly, it is plaine here, that preaching is the ordinary meanes to conuert euery crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: so as ordinarily there is none conuerted but by preaching. Lastly, if any one aske what shall become of those nations, or particular persons, that neuer yet heard of the Gospell; I answere, the way of God in diuers things
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:21380:91"/>
is not reuealed; and his Iudgements are like a great deepe: It belongs to vs to looke to our selues, to whom the Gospell is come.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the first Reason.</p>
                        <p>The second Reason is taken from the testimony of <hi>Paul,</hi> and hee giues a double testimonie; 1. By his Ministery; 2. By his Sufferings.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Whereof I</hi> Paul <hi>am a minister.</hi>] Out of these words many things may be noted:</p>
                        <p>First, in that the Apostle, notwithstanding all the disgraces and troubles that befell him for the Gospell, doth yet lift vp the mention of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie therein, as an inducement to the <hi>Ephesians</hi>: It may teach vs, that the glory of Gods truth is such, as no man neede to be ashamed to teach or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it; nay, there can be no man or woman, to whom it may not be their chiefest glory, whatsoeuer carnall Worldlings or timerous <hi>Nicodemites</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of it.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, in that so great an Apostle doth not disdayne to yeeld his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie, of purpose to shew that <hi>Epaphras</hi> their Preacher had taught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what hee had likewise taught: it sheweth that it is the property of faithfull and humble Ministers to strengthen the harts and hands of their Brethren; though they be their inferiours, and then it will follow, that they are proud, and enuious, and malicious persons, that by crosse teaching la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to increase their bonds, whom God hath honoured with successe in their labours in the Gospell: such are they, that in many places striue to pull downe as fast as others build, making hauocke in the Church, and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their whole might in their ministery to hinder the sinceritie of the Gospell, and the conuersion of sinners.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, in that the Apostle vrgeth his owne testimonie, [<hi>I Paul,</hi>] it sheweth that the testimony of one Apostle is better then a thousand others; One <hi>Paul</hi> opposed to many false Teachers: which should teach vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse much in the Doctrine of the Apostles and Prophets (which are of like authoritie.) And the rather, because the best of other men may erre; nay, haue erred: and therefore a heape of humane testimonies should be of no value against one Scripture. And as the people should try the Spirit by this witnesse, so should Preachers make conscience of it, to take more paines to informe the consciences of the people, by the testimony of the Word, then by humane authoritie, of what sort soeuer.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, in that here is but one <hi>Paul,</hi> that comes in, to confirme the truth of the Gospell, it shewes that many times the soundest Teachers are the fewest in number. Here it is so in the best times of the Church: so it was before; there was but one <hi>Michaiah</hi> for foure hundred false Prophets: so in Christs time there was a swarme of Pharisaicall, proud, vaine-glorious, hypocriticall, silken Doctors, that loued the chiefe roome, and sought pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, teachers of libertie and strife, defenders of traditions, and their owne glory and greatnesse, when Christ and his Disciples were by their enuy scorned, as a few precise singular fellowes.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, in that the Apostle stileth himselfe by the name of <hi>Paul,</hi> and not of <hi>Saul</hi> it may intimate that men truely regenerate hate the vaine name of their vnregeneracie: it is a foule signe when men can glory in the titles and names of their lewdnesse and sinne past.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, in that the Apostle tearmeth himselfe a Deacon, (for so the word translated <hi>Minister,</hi> is in the originall) it notes his great humilitie: it was a happy time in the Church, when the Apostles called themselues Deacons: and then began the Church to decay in true glory, when Deacons would needes be Apostles: great titles haue euer beene dangerous in the Church.</p>

                        <p>THese words containe the Apostles second testimonie, and it is taken from his sufferings for the Gospell: and hee conceiueth that they haue great reason to perseuer in the loue of the truth, since hee hath with ioy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured so many things for the confirmation of the doctrine he had taught.</p>
                        <p>In these words I note two things: First, the Apostles ioy in affliction: secondly, the Reasons which moued him vnto this reioycing. His suffering in which hee doth reioyce, he amplifies by the time [<hi>now</hi>;] and the diuers sorts of crosses he endured, which he expresseth indefinitely, when he saith plurally, [<hi>my sufferings</hi>;] as also by the vse of them, [<hi>for you,</hi>] that is, for confirmation of your Faith and encouragement.

Ninthly, that no afflictions can seperate them from the loue of God in Christ, with many other reasons, which I might instance in, besides those mentioned in the end of this Verse. If any yet aske, how Gods Seruans haue attained to such Ioy, since there are worlds of people, that in their troubles, could neuer be induced to conceiue of such contentment, by any reason could be brought them; I answere, that there are diuers things in Gods Children, which are not in wicked men; which are great causes of, and helpes to ioy in tribulation: As, first, they will receiue the light, and treasure vp holy knowledge, which they finde singular vse of in their Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: whereas an ignorant mind is vsually attended with a distempered hart <note n="i" place="margin">

And to thinke of the grace or prosperitie of other of Gods Seruants, is many times a great comfort in trouble. But I rather thinke the words are to be referred to [<hi>Sufferings</hi>] and then the sense may be, <hi>for you,</hi> that is, for the doctrine, which as the Apostle of the Gentiles, I taught you: Or for the confirmation of your Faith, and encouragement to like patience. And the rather, because the <hi>offering of him vp for the sacrifice and seruice of their Faith,</hi> was as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration of the first fruits to God, vpon which followed a greater blessing vpon the whole Church.</p>

                           </note>The consideration hereof should teach Gods people, not to faint at the troubles of their Teachers, since they are for them, (though to carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it seemes contrary,) yea, the Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.13. saith, <hi>it is their glory.</hi> Which also shewes the vaine paines that wicked men take, when they perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute faithfull Teachers: for though they thinke thereby to plague the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that so greatly relie vpon them; yet indeede God turnes all so for the best, that those sufferings are for them, and not against them. And if wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men were thus perswaded, they would spare such wicked labour: and if the godly could beleeue this, it would make them vnmoueable in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for what shall make against them, if this kind of troubles make for them?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And fulfill the rest of the afflictions of Christ.</hi>] Some of the late Papists ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from these words, that CHRIST did not suffer all that was needfull for mans deliuerance from sinne, but left a deale to be suffered by his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, especially men of principall note: and hence grew their <hi>Supererogation, Satisfactory paines,</hi> and <hi>Indulgences.</hi> But that this cannot be the meaning of this place, is cleare, first, because that doctrine is contrary to other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as <hi>Esay</hi> 53.4.5.6.8.10.11.12. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.30. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. <hi>to</hi> 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14.25.26. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 49 7. Secondly, themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iudges, this sense brings in a grosse absurditie: for if the words be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the suffering Christ left to his people, to endure for satisfaction for sinne, then it will follow, that <hi>Paul</hi> suffered all was wanting, and so there should remaine none for any other to suffer; for he saith, <hi>he suffered the rest of the sufferings of Christ.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Fulk</hi> say, that none of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did here thus vnderstand the words:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>August. tract.</hi> 84. <hi>in Iohn.</hi>
                           </note> and it is plaine, that S. <hi>Augustine</hi> is flat against this sense, when hee saith, <hi>Though Brethren dye for Brethren, yet no bloud of Martyres is shed for remission of sinnes: this Christ onely hath done.</hi> And <hi>Leo,</hi> a Pope, could say, <hi>The iust receiue, not giue Crownes.</hi> And out of the fortitude of the faithfull, arise examples of Patience, not gifts of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse. Fourthly, the next Verse cleareth this: for hee did thus suffer, <hi>according to the dispensation giuen him of God.</hi> Now, hee was giuen to <hi>edifie,</hi> not to <hi>redeeme</hi> the Church. Fiftly, their Schoole-Diuines are against them; the Glosse hath it thus, <hi>Pro vobis,</hi> i. <hi>Confirmandis in doctrina Euangelij. Aquinas</hi> doubts not to say, that <hi>to affirme that the Passions of the Saints are added to make vp, or fulfill the Passion of Christ, is hereticall. Caietan</hi> referres the words, <hi>quae desunt</hi> vnto <hi>in carne mea.</hi> The plaine meaning is, that the Apostle did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that measure of affliction that GOD in his counsell had appointed him to endure for the Name and Gospell of CHRIST, and the good of the Church, in the confirmation and encouraging of mens mindes in the truth of the Gospell.</p>

                           <hi>Of Christ.</hi>] His sufferings may be said to be the sufferings of Christ,<note place="margin">How our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the afflictions of Christ.</note> ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Christ is taken for the whole mysticall body, (which is not strange in Scripture; for by <hi>Christ,</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. hee meaneth the body of Christ,) or as hee is the head of the Church: and so the afflictions of Gods seruants may be said to be his sufferings; eyther because they be such as hee should suffer himselfe, if hee were on earth; or because they were laid vpon him by Christ, for the Churches good; or because they were for Christ and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; or because they deserue nothing, but all the praise is Christs; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the sympathie of Christ with the Christian, who accounts them as if they were his sufferings. And in this latter sense I thinke chiefely, these words are to be taken: for it is certaine, Christ doth so feele the miseries of his people, that hee accounts them in that respect, to be his owne miseries, as these places shew, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.42. <hi>&amp;c. Phil.</hi> 3.10. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Acts.</hi> 9.4. Hence grew that witty diuision of Christs sufferings into <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>; so as the first should be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the sufferings he endured in his owne person, and the latter of the sufferings he felt in his members.</p>
                        <p>The consideration of this,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Vses.</hi>
                           </note> that Christ accounteth the afflictions of his members to be his owne, may serue for diuers vses: For first, it shewes that they be in a wofull case, that haue ought to doe against Christ Ministers, or any of his Seruants. They would easily graunt it, that the Iewes were brought into great distresse, by the wrongs they did to Christ himselfe; then must it also follow that they cannot scape scot-free, that despise, reuile, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, or any way abuse the Messengers or Seruants of Christ, since hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts it as done to himselfe. Secondly, this may be a wonderfull motiue to stirre vs vp to be industrious in well-doing, and in helping and relieuing the poore Members of Christ, since we are sure to haue thankes and reward from Christ himselfe, as if wee had done it to him. Lastly, in all our suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings wee should striue that wee might be assured that our sufferings are his sufferings. And that it might be so, wee must be sure of two things: 1. that <hi>wee be found in him</hi>

Besides, when a mans heart is setled, and grounded in the truth, and in the assurance of Gods loue, what should disquiet his soule that knoweth nothing to mourne for but sinne, and the absence of God? and nothing ioyous, but what comes from the light of Gods countenance?</p>

                        <p>Lastly, we may here note the wonderfull loue and compassion of Christ, that pittieth not onely our soules but our flesh, accounting what wee suffer, to be as his sufferings.

Of the Church,</hi> are also of two kindes: Eyther, <hi>Chastisements,</hi> or <hi>Tryals.</hi> Sufferings <hi>for the Church</hi> are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of two sorts: Eyther, <hi>Expiation,</hi> and so Christ onely suffered; or <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome</hi> for confirmation of Doctrine, or incouragement in practise, and so the Saints haue suffered for the Church.</p>
                        <p>The principall Doctrine from hence is, that the particular sufferings of Gods Seruants, especially the Ministers, serue for the good and profit of the whole body.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Vses.</hi>
                           </note> The Vse is manifold: First, wee should hereby be informed to minde the good of the Church, and to seeke the aduancement of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the good of religious persons, aboue our owne estate. Our care should be most for the body of Christ, and wee should reioyce in any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice wee could doe to the Church of God. Secondly, such as are called to suffer, should labour to shew all good faithfulnesse, zeale, constancie, and holy discretion, seeing their sufferings concerne more then their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Thirdly, this should stirre vs vp to pray for such as are in trouble for good causes, since their afflictions are some way for our sakes <note n="t" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11.</note>. Fourthly, this may encourage poore Christians, that complaine they haue not meanes to doe good; they may be hence informed, that if God call them thereunto, they may doe good, yea, to the whole Church, by their sufferings: no wants can hinder, but that the poorest Christian may profit others, by prayer, fastings, counsell, admonitions, comfort and suffering. Fiftly, since the sufferings of the righteous are for our confirmation and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee should vse the meditation of such sufferings, when we finde our selues inclineable to discouragement, or impatience, or doubting. Lastly, this greatly reproues carnall Christians, which are so taken vp, generally, with the care of their naturall bodies, that they haue vtterly neglected the care and seruice of the mysticall Body. And in as much as men are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally so barraine in doing good, it is a plaine signe there is no hope that euer they would suffer for God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="157" facs="tcp:21380:93"/>Secondly, further hence may be noted, that the Doctrine or Sufferings of the Saints, are no priuiledge or benefit to any but the true Church; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Papists haue no cause to boast of <hi>Peter</hi> and the Saints, so long as they remayne a false Church.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, we may also obserue hence, that they only are the true of Church, who are of the body of Christ; and therefore we must be sure, we be mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, before we glad our hearts with our priuiledge in the Church. And a member of Christ thou art not,<note place="margin">Who are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ.</note> vnlesse, 1. thou beleeue the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of thy sinnes; for we are ingrafted onely by Faith: 2. Vnlesse thou haue had in thy soule an influence of holy graces from Christ, as from the head: 3. Vnlesse thou <hi>worke the workes of Christ,</hi> and bring forth the fruits of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed life; for thereby thou must try whether thou be a true plant in this Vine. And lastly, if thou be of this body, thou hast some roome in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Gods Children, or else it will be hard to proue that thou art a fellow member.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, here wee may see, that seldome comes there any good to the Church, but there is suffering for it; it cannot be redeemed but Christ must dye: and if the merit of this Redemption be applyed, <hi>Paul</hi> must dye. It is an ill signe thou hast no true grace, when thou sufferest nothing for the grace thou trustest to: It is an ill signe that God is not with the Watch-men of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> when they suffer nothing for the efficacie of their doctrine. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may any thinke this may be preuented by meekenesse or wisedome, for the treasures of both these were in Christ, and yet hee was a <hi>man full of sorrowes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And for conclusion,<note place="margin">Arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the crosse.</note> out of the whole Verse wee may gather together a number of Arguments against the Crosse: 1. <hi>Paul</hi> suffers: 2. One may reioyce notwithstanding afflictions: 3. The longer wee beare the crosse, the better able wee shall be to endure it; this may be gathered out of the word [<hi>Now.</hi>] 4. They are such as Christ accounts his: 5. They come from the decree of God: 6. Their measure is set by God: 7. We beare them but in our course, others haue gone before vs, and after vs must others follow: 8. Christ suffered the great brunt of Gods wrath; our sufferings are but small reliques, or parcels, that are left behinde. 9. The measure will once be full, and that shortly: 10. They are but in the flesh for the most part: 11. Christ respects the troubles of our flesh, as well as the affliction of our spirit: 12. We must profit the Church by our sufferings.</p>

                           <pb n="158" facs="tcp:21380:94"/>From the Coherence with the 23. Verse, I note, that if men would be established in Faith and Hope they must be subiect to the power of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of Gods Seruants. From the Coherence with the former Verse, I note that if the Ministers of CHRIST doe finde that their seruice is auaileable and powerfull to profit the soules of the people, they must not thinke it strange, that they fall into many tribulations.</p>
                        <p>From the generall consideration of the whole Verse, I obserue, both the dignitie and the restraint of the Ministery. The dignitie of a Minister stands in three things: first, that hee is Gods Ambassadour: Secondly, that by his Commission hee is sent vnto Gods people, who are the onely Worthies of the world: thirdly, that a great part of the efficacie of the word, rests by Gods appointment vpon him and his Office. The restraint is likewise in three things: first, hee is a Minister or Seruant; not a Lord or Sauiour: secondly, he receiues his commandement from God: he must not runne of his owne head, nor hold his office by meere humane ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: thirdly, the word of God must be his ground and rule, for all his dealing, in dispensing the things of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of God.</hi>] God is the dispenser of all good things to the Church, but in speciall of the Ministry of his Seruants, both in respect of the Embassage, and the calling of the Embassadour; and in respect of the efficacie of the Embassage; both in the preparation and power of the Teacher, and in the hearts of the hearers.</p>

                           <hi>To fulfill the word of God.</hi> Diuers things may be hence obserued. First, the Word is that speciall treasure, and the chiefe portion that God hath left, both to Ministers and People. Secondly, whatsoeuer the word seemeth to to be vnto carnall men, yet it is certaine, God will see to it, that all that is in it shall be fulfilled. Thirdly, the Preachers of the Gospell, are the meanes to set the word a working. And therefore no wonder, though troupes of people that are not subiect to the ministery of the word, finde little power in it. Besides, it euidently confutes those that thinke by reading at home, to get enough both for knowledge and saluation: for it is preaching that by Gods blessing and ordination doth put life into the word, and brings it into accomplishment.<note place="margin">How the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters fulfill the Word.</note> Fourthly, <hi>Quest.</hi> How may we conceiue of it, that Gods Ministers doe fulfill the word? <hi>Ans.</hi> The word is said by them to be fulfilled foure wayes: 1. if we respect preaching it selfe: 2. if we respect the manner of preaching: 3. if we respect the suffering that followes preaching: 4. if we respect the efficacie of preaching.</p>
                        <p>For the first: <hi>Paul</hi> may be said to fulfill the word, in that he doth preach, as he was by his commission appointed: he was charged by God to preach and in obedience to Gods word or will, hee did preach it. It is not enough for Ministers to receiue commission to preach, but they must fulfill it: and therefore woe to those Loyterers, and Non-residents, that care more to fill their barnes, then to fulfill their ministration.</p>
                        <p>For the second: Ministers are said to fulfill the word, when they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their Commission in a due manner: and this they doe; first, when they preach with all diligence: secondly, when they hold out to the end, not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king paines for a Sermon or two, or a yeere or two, till they can get prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but with all constancie, perseuering in the labour and worke of their Ministry, till their course be ended, and the fight finished <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</note>: thirdly, when they reueale all the counsell of God, that is needfull for their hearers: thus <hi>Paul</hi> fulfilled the word. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.18.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Ministers fulfill the Word by afflictions, for thereby they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the hearts of their hearers: as also, thereby is fulfilled vpon them that which is in Scripture so oft fore-told, should befall the faithfull dispensers of the word <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16 <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.</note>.</p>

                           <hi>Quest.</hi> Can all Ministers shew their bonds for the Gospell? <hi>Ans.</hi> Nay, some can shew the liuings they haue lewdly gotten, their ease, their dignities, their resisting of the word, faithfully taught by others, the disgraces they haue cast vpon their Brethren; but alas, their paynes or sufferings may easily be reckoned. But woe vnto them; for, for all the euill they haue done, they haue brought euill vpon their owne soules: the Lord Iesus shall consume them with the breath of his comming.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, in respect of the efficacie of the word, it is fulfilled by them; for many great things, threatned or promised in the word, were to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished by them, some extraordinary, some ordinary. The extraordinary, were bound to certaine times, such as were heretofore, the calling of the Gentiles, and the induration or obstinacie of the Iewes; and such as are now in doing, or to be done, as the reclayming of the world, by the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Gospell, the downefall of Antichrist, and the gathering of the Iewes: These things haue beene promised in the word, and haue, are, and shall be, wonderfully fulfilled by the ministry of preachers. The Ordinary are ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the Church at all times: and thus the Word is fulfilled in the elect, and in the reprobate. In the elect, Ministers fulfill the Word; 1. In conuerting those by the word, which were fore-ordained of God <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.19.</note>. 2. In conueying Christ to their soules: so as the word is not a bare history of the merit, and grace of Christ, but is fulfilled in the application of Christ <note n="c" place="margin">

To teach vs in all temptations or afflictions, to run to the word preached, for thereby God will certainly performe all needfull consolation, or direction, or humiliation. 4. To informe Ministers, that they must adde indefatigable paines, since so much is to be fulfilled by them. 5. To admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish stubborne sinners, to take heed of prouoking God, for if the word may not be fulfilled in their saluation, it shall be fulfilled in their induration.</p>

                           <hi>Ans.</hi> There are remnants of naturall blindnesse, euen in the best: and the sinne that hangs on so fast is not without pollution, and an obscuring propertie. Faith also, that should haue principall vse in conueying this light, is not without some mixtures of doubts and other drosse. Affections are not without their fumes, which beeloud the vnderstanding: sometimes they want the meanes, sometimes they are negligent in the vse of them; and to see perfectly is the onely priuiledge of <hi>the new Ierusalem, that is aboue.</hi>

                           </note> for Information, for Instruction, and for Consolation.</p>
                        <p>First, it reproues the horrible prophanenes of those that so securely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the Gospell, so sacred a Mysterie: and fearefull is the curse with which God doth auenge the quarrell of his word, euen this, that vnto these men, the Scriptures both read and preached, are <hi>a sealed Booke</hi> 
                           <note n="m" place="margin">
                              <hi>Esay</hi> 29.11.</note>. And is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell a Mysterie? then singular is their dotage and madnesse, that say, they know as much as any of them all can teach them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, wee may hereby be informed concerning the necessitie of preaching: the greater the Mysterie is, the greater neede of laborious and studious men, that are thereunto set apart, to make manifest those secrets of the Kingdome: for this is the <hi>appointment of God our Sauiour, that by preaching committed to certaine men,</hi> thereunto sanctified, (as the Apostle saith,) <hi>the word promised before the world beganne, should be manifested in due time</hi> 
                           <note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2.3.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, this should teach vs diuers duties: 1. Let euery man <hi>account</hi> of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:21380:96"/>
faithfull Teachers, as <hi>the Ministers of Christ, and such as dispence the Mysteries of God</hi> 
                           <note n="o" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1.</note>. 2. Wee must bring Faith to the Gospell, else it will not profit <note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1.3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2.</note>: Reason and Sense are no competent Guides or Iudges in these diuine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries. And the Lord hath commanded these secrets to be manifested and reuealed by the Scriptures, for the triall of his Elect, and for the exercise of their obedience, in beleeuing as well as in doing <note n="q" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25.26.</note>. 3. As wee should bring a resolution to beleeue Gods word in all things, though it be neuer so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to sense, and to common reason of the world. So when the Lord doth reueale his Promises and Statutes to vs, wee should hide them in our hearts as great Iewels and worthy Treasures, meete to be kept in our secretest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and the very bowels of our Affections <note n="r" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.34.</note>. 4. This Doctrine vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the necessitie of obseruing the rules of preparation: and to this purpose wee may finde fiue things charged vpon vs, all drawne from this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Mystery of the Gospell. First, wee must be sure wee he <hi>turned to the Lord by true repentance</hi>; for till then, <hi>the vaile cannot be taken away</hi> 
                           <note n="s" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16.</note>: though the word were neuer so plaine in it selfe, yet wee cannot discerne it, by reason our vnderstandings are couered with a vaile, and no man can looke vpon this bright Sunne, till his <hi>eyes be annointed with eye-salue</hi>
                           <note n="t" place="margin">

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in as much as the <hi>Booke is sealed with seauen seales, and no man nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> is able powerfully to vnfold and open Gods eternall comforts to the conscience of man for his saluation, saue onely <hi>the Lyon of the Tribe of Iudah,</hi> which is also the <hi>Lambe slaine, hauing seauen eyes, which are the seauen Spirits of God</hi>: therefore in acknowledgement of his <hi>wisedome and power,</hi> we must goe vnto him, importunately begging this <hi>Blessing, for his glory,</hi> that the Booke may be opened, euen to enrich vs <note n="u" place="margin">
                              <hi>Reu.</hi> 4.1.3.4.5.6.12.</note>; and that to this end hee would make acceptable the <hi>odours</hi> of our desires and prayers to God. Thirdly, we must remoue letts; for if it be a mysterie in it selfe, wee had not neede to bring hardnesse of heart with vs, or worldly cares, or troubled affections, or a sluggish spirit, or preiudicate opinions, or inordinate lusts, or any such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments. Fourthly, wee must bring with vs the loane and aduantage of former doctrine communicated to vs: for <hi>to him that hath</hi> for practise and increase, <hi>shall be giuen; but from him, that hath not</hi> for imployment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionable vse, <hi>shall be taken away that which hee hath</hi>

                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11.12.</note>. Fiftly, wee must bring a <hi>pure Conscience,</hi> as a holy vessell, to receiue this <hi>mysterie of faith</hi> in <note n="y" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.9.</note>: and the conscience is then pure, when it is purified by the bloud of Christ, and doth daily excite the desire of puritie of heart and life, bearing with the loue and liking of no sinne.</p>
                        <p>Ministers also must here learne, with all reuerence and painefulnesse, to behaue themselues as becommeth those great Mysteries: they must not onely be cleane themselues by holinesse of heart and life, but must in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to the People, and the holy feare of the Maiestie of Gods truth and presence, teach with power, frequencie, perspecuitie &amp; authoritie, and since the Lord hath made them his Stewards of his Mysteries, and holy Iewels, and Treasures, it is <hi>required of them that they be faithfull</hi> 
                           <note n="z" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1.</note>, both in applying them to the right owners, and in setting them out according to their truth.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the meditation hereof may serue for singular comfort to all those that finde mercy from the Lord in the reuelation of his Mysterie: <hi>blessed are their eyes that see it, and their eares that heare it</hi>

First, it should cause vs to feare him that cannot onely change vs, but mowe downe with his Sithe whole generations of men, <hi>before whom the nations are but as a little dust of the ballance, or drop of the Bucket</hi>: and we should also magnifie and adore that God, that is of himselfe subiect to no change, and liues for euermore <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Reuel.</hi> 4.10.</note>. Secondly, it should make vs in loue with the <hi>world of worlds</hi>: and to admire the blessed estate of such as shall be accounted worthy to obtaine that world, and the resurrection from the dead <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Luke</hi> 20.25.</note>, to such an Angelicall and vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition; and to this end we should be quickened to a serious prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the world to come, seeing we haue but our turne and course vpon earth, wee should <hi>not fashion our selues to this world</hi> 
                           <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2.</note>: wee should refuse to square our actions according to the lusts and humours of men<note n="d" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.2.</note>: let vs serue, not the time nor the fancies of men, but <hi>the King of times</hi> 
                           <note n="e" place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17.</note>. Secondly, wee should looke to it, that neither the cares of this world choake, nor the God of this world hide or take from vs, the <hi>word of the kingdome</hi>

Thirdly, and if wee must not serue the men of the world, nor the things of the world, much lesse may we serue sinne: for if any <hi>man be a seruant</hi> to sinne, <hi>hee shall not abide in the house to the next world</hi>

Fourthly, this may abate the great opinion of the wisedome of this world: for what shall it profit mee to haue great skill to get money and meanes for this life, if I haue no skill or wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for the sauing of my soule? What shal it aduantage me to haue a nature and carriage, tilled and fitted for the winning of friends for this world, if I know not how to make me friends for a better world? what auaileth it to haue gifts for an eminent place, in mans Common-wealth, and for want of grace be not acknowledged of the Common-wealth of Israell? to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:21380:97"/>
is it to be a Disputer of this world, and in the day of Christ to be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp with amazed silence, as not hauing a word to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For if the Children of sinne, be so industrious to make shift for their time, how much more should the hearts of the Children of eternitie be enlarged to an inflamed care of large prouision for their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall estate? Fiftly, this should embolden vs to a willing forsaking of our selues, in the worst of all outward trials, which is, <hi>to forgoe euen all for Christs sake and the Gospels,</hi> if wee be put to it. What great thing is it to part with that little <hi>All</hi> that wee haue in this world, seeing it could serue vs but for a little time, and at length wee must leaue all? and besides, by a voluntary abregation wee shall be aduantaged in the gaine of an eternall recompence of reward a hundred-fold better.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, in that the Gospell is hid from whole Ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Generations of men, wee may see that whole multitudes may bee in a miserable estate; and that it is no priuiledge for any in sinning, that many are such sinners. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Neither is multitude, or succession of men, in one minde for matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, any note of the true Church. For here are whole ages, and many successions of men, that all liued and died without the knowledge of the Gospell: it is a slender prop for faith to rest on, to say our Fathers, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> liued and died in this or that minde or opinion. Further, wee may obserue hence the infectiousnesse of sinne: how naturally it will spread, euen to the poisoning of whole Worlds of men. If sinne but once get a fountaine if the Lord stoppe it not, into what riuers of contagion will it defuse it selfe? <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Also, we may see how fearefull a thing it is to fall into the hands of an angry God, since the liues of so many millions cannot finde pitty or pardon with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> him. And the insensiblenesse of sinners may hence be noted also. When would those ages and generations of men haue awaked out of their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous sleepe, if the Lord by the voyce of his Sonne, and his Seruants, had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> not awaked them? Moreouer, it may be manifest from hence, that the Lord in dispencing his grace, is not moued by any outward things: for what can any person or people haue to commend them by to God, which those Nations had not? Lastly, we may here see it verified, that Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are like a great deepe: it is not for man to conceiue that hee should be able to search into them. Yet least any should stand still, and be swallowed vp with amazement, at the fall and ruine of those worlds of men, let him consider of these things following.<note place="margin">

Fourthly, that the reasons of this dealing may be iust, though not exprest vnto vs. Fiftly, that Christians are charged to be wise to sobrietie: they may not let their thoughts runne as farre as they will, but must let God alone with his secret iudgements. Sixtly, that the things are now strange and obscure, shall be more fully reuealed in the day of Christ, when all shall be cleered and made manifest.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, wee may hence see that the word will make great alterations where it comes.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that God is tyed to no place nor people: if the Iewes will not bring forth fruits worthy of the Gospell, but despise it; the Lord will prouoke them to enuy: euen calling vnto himselfe a people that sought him not.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, that they that are last may be first, and that they that now are not vnder mercy, may goe to Heauen before vs.</p>
                        <p>Fiftly, that as any people are more sensible of their miserie without grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they more see the riches of their calling. The Gentiles that wallowed in sinne, and wickednesse, see a wonderfull glory in Religion, when by the Gospell they are conuerted. And that may be the reason why Publicanes and sinners are so deepely affected, and inwardly touched, when ciuill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men are scarsely moued with any sence of the need of their conuersion.</p>
                        <p>Sixtly, their conuersion may assure vs, that none are so miserable but the Gospell can make them happy.</p>
                        <p>Seauenthly, wee may see cause to bewaile the hardnesse of our hearts. Can the Gospel conquer so mightely and effectually, these worlds of people, to the obedience of faith, and such a tender sence of the glorious riches thereof: and are our hearts no more melted and stirred within vs? Though the Lord cry and roare, and stirre vp himselfe in his iealousie, as a man of warre, yet are we deafe, and heare not; and blind, and see not.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>The hope of glory.</hi>] The riches of a Christian are eyther in this life, and so it lies in the grace of IESVS CHRIST; or else in the world to come, and so it is glory, euen a most glorious and admirable excellency of felicitie; which shall haue in it eternall righteousnesse, and the continuall blessed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of God, eternall ioyes, and perfection of all things round about, euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting honour, and singular esteeme, most sweet societie with holy Angels, and blessed Saints, with vnspeakeable peace, and rest; together, with that admirable clarification of the very bodies of the righteous.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, wee may in these words note, that where Christ will glorie in another world, there hee is the hope of glory in this world.

                        <p>Two things are in the verse to be obserued: the Meanes, and the End: the meanes is preaching; which is amplyfied by the parts of it, <hi>admonishing</hi> and <hi>teaching,</hi> and by the manner of it, <hi>in all wisedome.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Whom we preach.</hi>] The reason why the Apostle falls so often into the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and praise of their preaching, is to rescue it from the contempt, vnder which many times it lay disgraced.</p>
                        <p>There are foure things may be obserued here,<note place="margin">The honour of Ministers.</note> which tend to expresse the honour of the ministery in this place. 1. They are as it were, the Lords high treasurers, to dispense the riches of the kingdome of Iesus Christ. And if such an office be in such request vnder earthly Princes, what is it to be so honoured of the Prince of all Princes? All the world is beholding to the ministery, for they shew that Mine of incomparable Treasure; they dig it vp; they offer it as spirituall Merchants: yea, the Lord by them doth as it were, particularly inrich all Christians. 2. This honour of publishing the Gospell, is now taken from the very Angels, and giuen to them: now <hi>Wee,</hi> not the Angels, preach vnto you. 3. They haue the best subiect that euer men had to intreat of: all other Sciences are base, in comparison of them, they intreat of Christ, and grace, and glory, for euer by him: nay, 4. herein differs preaching from all other relations whatsoeuer, that they doe not preach of Christ, but they preach CHRIST, that is, they giue what they speake of.</p>
                        <p>And these three little words expresse diuersly the duty of Ministers.<note place="margin">The dutie of Ministers.</note> 1. they must preach, that is plaine. 2. they must preach diligently, which may be gathered from the expressing of it in the present-tence: It was not a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent excuse, wee haue preached as diligently as any in our young times, or before we came to such preferment: No, this must be the comfort of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and his continuall plea; wee doe preach; not, wee haue preached. 3. They must preach CHRIST, that is, that part of Diuinitie that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes Redemption, Iustification, and Sanctification. 4. They must labour in preaching, to expresse as much as lies in them, consent. Consent, I say, with the Prophets, and Apostles, and consent with their fellow Ministers; <hi>Wee,</hi> not I, there is one onely truth for all Ministers to teach. 5. They must resolue to winne the honour and reputation of their ministery, for the worke of it, not from the reward of it: they must get their credit by preaching, not by their great liuings.</p>
                        <p>And from hence also is impliedly to be collected the iust reproofe of many Ministers.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Such as preach not:<note place="margin">The reproofe of Ministers.</note> some would preach and cannot: some can preach but will not: some neither can nor will, all shall be iudged accordingly in the day of Christ, when hee shall call for an account of their Stewardship.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Such as preach, but not Christ; and these are not all of a sort: for 1. some preach themselues, not Christ: or if they paint out Christ, it is in their owne likenes; so as vnder his name they commend themselues to the world. 2. some preach, but it is beside Christ: in raking together mens inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And surely, that so great affecting of humane authorities in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it is with a kinde of neglect of the search of Scriptures, as if
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:21380:102"/>
they wanted wit or power, cannot be iustified. 3. Some preach, but it is against Christ: and such are they that care not couertly to contradict the maine Doctrines of Christ, or else bend themselues in their whole ministery to <hi>strengthen the hands of the wicked, and make sad the harts of the righteous.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, such as preach Christ; but it is for enuy: and to increase the bonds and disgraces of others, or it is not diligently, or they preach not Christ crucified, they teach not soundly the doctrine of mortification: or they preach not Christ risen againe: they teach so coldly, so barrainely, so insufficiently, as if Christ were still in the graue: some there be that preach of Christ, but it is chiefly of his Crowne and Scepter: they are neuer kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, till they get into questions of Church-gouernement: they teach their hearers the doctrine of reforming of Churches, when they had more need to teach them how to reforme themselues, and their households.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Admonishing and teaching.</hi>] There is some a-doe among Interpreters, to put the difference betweene these two words. Some thus: Admonishing them that are out of the way: teaching them that are in the way. Some thus: Admonishing them that are ignorant: teaching them that haue knowledge. Some thus: Admonishing those that teach false doctrine, or contradict the truth: teaching such as are desirous to learne the truth. Some thus: Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing about things to be done: teaching about things to be knowne. Some thus: Admonishing to stirre affection: teaching to informe the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. But I thinke there is no necessitie thus to restraine the sences, so as it may be thus. Admonishing, that is, checking, rebuking, warning the ignorant, wandring, wayward, slothfull, dull, or prophane hearers both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things to be done and knowne: and teaching the rest the whole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ.</p>

                           <hi>Admonishing</hi>] From this word, these things may be obserued.</p>
                        <p>First, Preachers must intend to rebuke sinne, as well as to direct or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <note n="a" place="margin">

                        <p>Secondly, men commonly neuer care for instruction, to grow in Christ, till they be touched with the rebukes of the word for sinne,</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, preaching may be said to admonish in diuers respects. 1. the very sending of the Word preached to any place, is a warning to men to looke to themselues, and repent <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 17.3.</note>: for then is <hi>the Axe layd to the roote of the Tree</hi>

                              <hi>Math.</hi> 3.11.</note>. 2. Because preaching doth set before vs such examples as doe admonish <note n="d" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.11.</note>. 3. Because by it Christ secretly <hi>smites the earth,</hi> that is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of carnall men, that are so glued to the earth <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Esa.</hi> 11.3.</note>: many a time is their hearts smitten, that the world little knowes of; but especially, by preaching are the publike abuses in the liues of men publikely reproued.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Euery man.</hi>] Euery one needs to be rebuked and admonished: and there is no man nor woman but they are bound to stoope to the rebukes of the Word; whether they be rich or poore, learned or vnlearned, Iew or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, young or old, in authoritie, or vnder authoritie, conuerted or vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Vses.</hi>
                           </note>The Vse of all should be to teach vs to know them that are ouer vs, and admonish vs in the Lord <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.12.</note>. Now there are diuers reasons to perswade men to be willing to suffer admonition: 1. It is noted to be in Gods account a beastly qualitie to rage, or to be sencelesse, when we are rebuked: therefore <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>be not as the Horse or Mule</hi> 
                           <note n="g" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 32.9.</note>. 2. If wee will not be rebuked, <hi>sinne lyes at the doore</hi>

                              <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.12.</note>: and wee know not how soone wee may be arested with iudgement. 3. Thou mayest by stubbornesse prouoke the Lord so much, that in his very iudgement hee may set a continuall edge vpon the word, to rebuke thy conscience, so as <hi>rebukes</hi> being now turned into a punishment, the Lord may consume thee by them, eating vpon thy conscience <hi>as a moth</hi>

till hee haue wearied thee with his secret buffets and terrours, and then in the end, cast thee off into a <hi>reprobate sense.</hi> Woe is vnto man, when the Lord in his Word, or by his Spirit, sets himselfe to disgrace and vexe him. 4. <hi>Instruction is euill onely to him that forsaketh the way, and hee that hateth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection shall dye</hi>

Lastly, great is the profit of admonition, to such as are wise to make vse of it, as these places show, <hi>Psal.</hi> 141.5.6. <hi>Iob</hi> 5.15.16.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 36.8. <hi>to</hi> 16. <hi>Prou.</hi> 28.13.</p>

                           <note place="margin">What we must doe to profit by preaching.</note>] This is the second part of preaching: this also is absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: we shall not partake of Christs riches, or be fit to be presented to God without it. Now that wee may profit by publike preaching, wee must pray God by his Spirit to lead vs into all truth <note n="o" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.</note>: and wee must striue to be truly humble, for <hi>the Lord will teach the humble his way</hi>

                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.9.</note>: and wee must be much in confessing our owne sinnes vnto God in secret <note n="q" place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Euery man.</hi>] This is againe added, and not without reason: for it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: First, that euery man is bound to liue vnder some teaching and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monishing Ministerie. Secondly, that the people, yea, all Gods people, must be instructed; contrary to the doctrine of the Papists. Thirdly, a right per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of this, that the word will admonish and teach euery man, would make men more quiet vnder rebukes, and more willing to be taught. Hee saith not, <hi>you,</hi> but <hi>euery man</hi>; to import that the word hath not a particular quarrell at some one man, but will finde out the sinnes of all men, &amp;c. Wee see by experience that this is the sore in many mindes, that eyther the Preacher should meddle with no body, or not with such as they: hee must not meddle with great men, or not with Schollers and learned men, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In all wisdome.</hi>] These words may be vnderstood eyther of the subiect mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taught, or of the instruments, the Teachers; or of the effect in the hearers.</p>
                        <p>For the first:<note place="margin">Why the word is called wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> the word of God is well called wisedome, eyther as it is the patterne, or Image, or resemblance of Gods euerlasting wisdome, which from all eternitie in his counsell hee had conceiued: or as it portrayeth out Christ, who is the naturall wisedome of God: or as it vnfoldeth the depths of Gods wise prouidence, especially in his Church: or comparatiuely with all the formes of Doctrine, conceiued by the wisest of the Gentiles, or any carnall men.</p>
                        <p>For the second:<note place="margin">What it is to teach in all wisedome.</note> these words may be referred to the Teachers, and then the sence is, they must teach in all wisdome. They are called wise men <note n="r" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.</note>, and that they may teach in all wisdome: first, they must be sure they teach truth, and not errours: neither errors of Doctrine, nor errours of fact. It is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous shame for Preachers out of the Pulpit, of purpose to disgrace some kinde of men to report of them things vtterly vntrue: especially to fayle often or vsually this way. Secondly, they must labour to expresse the power of the spirit, as well as a sound forme of Doctrine. Thirdly, they must make vse of all opportunities and aduantages, to worke vpon the people, when a doore is opened. To preach wisely, is to preach seasonably. Fourthly, they cannot preach in the wisedome of God, if they hunt after and effect that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21380:103"/>
which the Apostle cals the wisedome of words <note n="s" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17.</note>: or excellency of words<note n="t" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1.</note>. Fiftly, there is a speciall wisedome in fitting doctrine to the state of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to giue euery one his owne portion.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, it may be said to be in all wisedome, by effect in the hearers; as being such a preaching as tends to worke true wisedome in the hearers, as well as other graces: a wisedome I say, by which they vnderstand their owne way <note n="v" place="margin">

                           <hi>That wee may present euery man.</hi>] The hearers are said to be presented to God by their Teachers in diuers respects: First, as they gather them out of the world, into the profession of the Faith of Christ. Secondly, by framing and working vpon the hearts of their hearers, fitting them for Christ, euen in the presence of Christ, in his ordinances. Thirdly, by forcing men through the strength of terrour or comfort, to runne and present themselues to God. Fourthly, they may be said to doe it in respect of their prayers, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the suites of the people vnto God. Fiftly, they shall present them at the day of Iudgement, when euery Teacher shall say, <hi>Here Lord I am, with the Children thou hast giuen mee.</hi>

To this purpose they should honour them, maintaine them, obey them, shew their hearts and states to them, &amp;c. And woe is vnto them that despise Gods Ministers, or discourage them; that hate their doctrine, or shun their societie: howsoeuer they account of them, yet these are the men should haue made way for them to Christ, they are of his Priuie Chamber, and the dust of their feete shall witnesse against contemners; yea, the time shall come, when they would be glad to haue them excuse them to Christ<note n="c" place="margin">

                        <p>IN this Verse is contayned the seauenth reason to inforce the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and it is taken from the great paynes and strife of the Apostle, and the great successe the Lord was pleased to giue to his paines.</p>

But I take it as it is here, <hi>Whereunto</hi>: and so it may be referred eyther to the Exhortation in the three and twentieth Verse, or to perfection in the Verse before. It is sure that the perfection of Ministers labours should be the perfection of their hearers. It is not enough to know how to preach Sermons, but it must tend not onely to beget men vnto Christ, but also to build them vp, which is a wonderfull hard worke, and few Ministers are well skilled herein; and therefore Ministers should much consult with God, and the people should pray constantly, and earnestly for their Teachers.</p>

What shall I say? our very Calling needes dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction out of the word, and our crosses and temptations cause vs to feele a daily neede of the comforts of the word to be applyed to vs: the godly are to be incouraged in well-doing, and that continually; and wee all neede to be called vpon daily, for reformation and preuention of sinne. Grace will not hold out without meanes, and Knowledge must be encreased; and a daily Ministerie is of singular vse to prepare vs for death, and weyne vs from the world. These and many other be the reasons of daily preaching, which should greatly reproue such Ministers as labour not, eyther for want of gifts, or pluralitie of places, or distraction of businesse, or for very idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or vnwillingnesse to take paines.

                           <hi>According to his working that worketh in mee mightily.</hi>] Before I consider particularly of these words, I note how feelingly the Apostle speakes of Gods Prouidence, and with what affection hee sets out the obseruation he made of it: which greatly shames the most of vs, that are so excessiuely dull in apprehending, and so affectionlesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the thought of things. Now if any would know what should be the reason wee are so dull, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle so tenderly sensible of Gods power and prouidence: I may answere, that a number of vs are not throughly perswaded of Gods particular proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: besides, hee was excellently acquainted with the word of God, and thereby, hee saw liuely, how euery promise or threatning came into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: there could hardly any thing fall out, but hee remembred some
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:21380:104"/>
Scripture that fore-told or fore-shewed it. And no question he knew how vnable the meanes was to worke without Gods blessing, he knew what vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitnesse was in man: now wee giue too much to the meanes. Further, it is certaine, that such holy men as hee, sought Gods blessing by prayer, and therefore now they were affected, when they obserued what followed their prayers. And besides, the Apostle did walke with God in a great measure of sanctitie and holy care in all things to keepe his communion with God, whereas wee are estranged by our corruptions, and for the most part neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in a daily walking with GOD. Lastly, hee was humble, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of his owne gifts, and had consecrated himselfe, and deuoted his life to Gods glory, and therefore hee was sensible of the glory of God in his working prouidence.</p>
                        <p>But the maine particular Doctrine is,<note place="margin">It is God that workes in the ministery of the Word.</note> that in the Ministery of the Gospell there is Gods speciall working: for it is Gods worke to raise vp men that will labour in the Gospell, considering the ill successe in many hearers, and the infirmities in themselues, and the strange discouragements from the world: and when the Lord hath gotten him Labourers, it is his working, that they can get fit Meditations and Affections into their hearts in priuate, and fit vtterance in publike: it is not Art and Learning alone that will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them with powerfull matter. And thirdly, it is Gods working to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the power of the word to the hearers, so as the heate of it goe not out before it kindle in the peoples hearts. What shall I say? it is Gods mighty working that the people are preserued and daily built vp by the word in Grace. All which should teach vs to place our Faith, not in men but in the power of God. And let wicked men be aduised least by resisting the Ministery they be found fighters against God: and it may be a great comfort to a Minister to; for if God worke for vs and by vs, it matters not who be against vs. And lastly, Christians should make much of, and be thankfull for, and greatly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire all Knowledge and Grace gotten from the word, for it was wrought by the very finger of God.</p>

                  <head>THE ANALYSIS of the second Chapter.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo things are conteined in this Chapter. First, the continuation of the exhortation begun in the 23. verse, of the first Chapter, to v. 7. Secondly, a dehortation, from verse 8. to the end.</p>
                  <p>The exhortation is continued two waies: First, By alleaging more reasons, v. 1.2.3. Secondly, by prolepsis, remouing sundry obiections, v. 4.5.6.7.</p>
                  <p>There are three reasons to presse them to care of perseuerance in the doctrine they had receiued: The first reason is taken from the care of the Apostle, for the deliuerie and defence of the Gospell, in these words, <hi>I would you knew what great fighting I haue for your sakes, and for them of Laodicea, and for as many as haue not seene my face in the flesh,</hi> vers. 1.</p>
                  <p>The second reason is taken from the effects of the Gospell, and they are two: 1. consolation, <hi>that your hearts might be comforted:</hi> 2. loue, <hi>and knit together in loue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third reason is taken from the adiuncts of the Gospell, and they are three: First, certaintie, <hi>vnto all riches of full assurance of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi> 2. Sublimitie, <hi>to the acknowledgment of the mysterie of God euen the Father and of Christ,</hi> v. 2. Thirdly, perfection in these words, <hi>in whom,</hi> or, <hi>in which are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge,</hi> v. 3.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the reasons; The answer of obiections followes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 1. Why doth the Apostle vrge vs so largely with this exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Sol. <hi>This I say lest any beguile you with inticing words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. But how doth he know our estates being absent. <hi>Sol.</hi> To this he answereth, that though hee were <hi>absent in the flesh, yet he was present in spirit,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> 3. But is it charitie to entertaine surmises of vs, <hi>Sol.</hi> He saith he did <hi>reioyce</hi> in their <hi>order and stedfastnes</hi> present; But he wrote this to warne them to take heed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Tell vs at once what you would haue vs do. <hi>Answ.</hi> v. 6.7. two things are to be done: the first concernes holy life, the second faith. Concerning holy life, there is first a precept, <hi>walke on.</hi> second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a rule, after which that precept is to be squared, viz. <hi>as yee haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> Concerning faith, there is first a precept,
<pb facs="tcp:21380:106"/>
they must be <hi>rooted, built vp, and stablished.</hi> secondly, a rule, <hi>as they had been taught.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus of the exhortation: The dehortation followes, from v. 8. to the end. There are three parts of the dehortation. First, he setteth downe the matter from which he dehorts, v. 8. Secondly, he giues six reasons to confirme the dehortation, from vers. 9. to 16. Thirdly, he concludes and that seuerally from v. 16. to the end.</p>
                  <p>In the 8. verse he sets downe three things from which he dehorts. 1. From <hi>Philosophie,</hi> which he calls <hi>vaine deceits.</hi> 2. From <hi>traditions of men.</hi> 3. From the ceremonies of <hi>Moses,</hi> which he calls the <hi>rudiments of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reasons are, 1. because they are not after Christ, v. 8. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in Christ there dwels all the fulnes of the Godhead bodily, v. 9. where note an excellent description of Christ; <hi>In him,</hi> he notes his person; <hi>the Godhead,</hi> his diuine nature; <hi>corporally,</hi> his humane nature, and <hi>dwells,</hi> the vnion of both; and for the measure, it <hi>is in all fullnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because we are compleat in Christ, without any of these things, v. 10. Here note the persons, <hi>yee,</hi> the time, <hi>are,</hi> the benefit, <hi>compleat,</hi> the author, <hi>Christ,</hi> the limitation, <hi>in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Because we are circumcised without hands, and therefore need not circumcision made with hands, and consequently no ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. This reason is propounded, v. 11. &amp; confirmed by prolepsis, v. 12.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Circumcision without hands fiue things are to be noted. 1. the persons, <hi>yee.</hi> 2. the time, <hi>are.</hi> 3. the manner, set down negatiuely, <hi>without hands.</hi> 4. the form of it, affirmatiuely, <hi>putting off the bodie of the sins of the flesh.</hi> 5. the efficient cause, <hi>the circumcision of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But it followes not we are circumcised without hands, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore need not circumcision with hands. <hi>Sol.</hi> It followes to vs now in the new Testament, because we haue baptisme in steed of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision with hands: we are <hi>buried with Christ by baptisme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But was not Circumcision a more liuely signe. <hi>Sol.</hi> It was not, which he shewes to be true, both in respect of mortification, <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him,</hi> and in respect of viui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ication, <hi>raised vp together with him by baptisme,</hi> which is amplified by setting downe what is required in them to whom baptisme is thus effectuall, viz. <hi>the faith of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Because none of these can helpe vs in miserie, nor further to happinesse, when we want it, v. 13. The words in themselues expres a twofold estate of Christians, First, what they are by nature, and so 1. they were <hi>dead</hi> in actuall <hi>sinnes.</hi> 2. they were in the <hi>vncircumcision of the flesh,</hi> in respect of originall sinne. Secondly, what they were in the state of grace, 1. they <hi>were quickned.</hi> 2. they were <hi>forgiuen all their sinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Because Christ hath cancelled the <hi>Chyrographie</hi> that was against vs, which were these ceremonies, v. 14.15. concerning these, two things may be noted. 1. what the ceremonies were in themselues. 2. how the Church was discharged of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21380:106"/>For the first, they were for honor, <hi>ordinances of God,</hi> for vse, <hi>hand-writings,</hi> for effect, <hi>they were against vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the second, Christ <hi>on the crosse cancelled them, fastned them,</hi> and <hi>tooke them out of the way:</hi> yea hee spoiled the deuills, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed ouer them openly, who had the power to serue execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for forfeitures, v. 15.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the reasons: the conclusion followes from v. 16. to the end. The conclusion hath three branches. For first hee concludes against ceremonies, v. 16.17. Secondly, against philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie, v. 18.19. Thirdly, against traditions, v. 20. to the end.</p>
                  <p>In the conclusion against ceremonies, note 1. the things which are named to bee abrogated, viz. the respect <hi>of meats and drinks.</hi> 2. of times, which are threefold, 1. <hi>daies.</hi> 2. <hi>moneths.</hi> 3. <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> these are the things, v. 16. The reason is v. 17. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these are <hi>but shadowes of things to come, and the bodie is Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the conclusion against philosophie, note first the thing which in speciall hee reasons against, viz. <hi>Angell-worship.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the reasons by which he condemnes them that brought it in, 1. they did it hypocritically, vnder pretence of <hi>humblenes of minde.</hi> 2. they did it ignorantly, <hi>aduancing themselues in things they neuer saw.</hi> 3. they did it proudly, <hi>rashly puft vp in their fleshly minde.</hi> 4. they did it dangerously: their danger is laid downe, and amplified; Laid downe in these words, <hi>not holding the head,</hi> amplified by a digression into the praises of the mysticall bodie of Christ, 1. for ornament, <hi>furnished.</hi> 2. for vnion, <hi>knit together by ioynts and bands.</hi> 3. for growth, <hi>increasing with increase of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the conclusion against traditions, obserue, first the matter condemned, <hi>why are yee burthened with traditions,</hi> amplified by the kinds, <hi>touch not, taste not, handle not,</hi> v. 21. Secondly, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, 1. <hi>yee are dead with Christ,</hi> v. 20. 2. Yee are dead from the <hi>rudiments of the world,</hi> therefore much more from traditions. 3. They are <hi>burthens.</hi> 4. The matter of them is light, and vaine, and idle, v. 21. 5. They all <hi>perish with the vsing.</hi> 6. They are after the commandements and doctrines of men, v. 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> But there seemeth to be a depth in them. <hi>Sol.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that they haue a shew of wisdome, and that in three things. 1. <hi>In voluntarie religion.</hi> 2. <hi>In humblenes of minde.</hi> 3. <hi>In not sparing the bodie.</hi> But yet he censures them two waies. 1. It is but a <hi>shew</hi> all this. 2. It with-holdeth the honor due vnto the bodie, <hi>neither haue they it in any estimation to satisfie the flesh.</hi> v. 23.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And if you say I know not your estate, I answere though I be absent from you in the flesh yet I am present with you in the spirit, and if you thinke that this discourse implies that I dislike you, know that I do truly reioyce to heare of your good order of life, both publike and priuate, and how stedfast your faith in <hi>CHRIST</hi> is.</p>
                  <p>Now if you aske me at once what is the summe of all I would haue you to doe, I answere that as concerning holy life, I would haue you walke on in the same manner as ye haue receiued <hi>CHRIST</hi> hitherto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21380:107"/>And for matter of faith,<note place="margin">
                        <p>Verse <hi>7. Rooted and built vp in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye haue been taught, abounding therein with thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>8. Beware lest there bee any man that spoile you through Philosophie and vaine deceit, through the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, and not after Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </note> I would haue you by all meanes to seeke to be further rooted and built vp and stablished in the assurance of faith accordingly as you haue been taught, but by any meanes remember to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in all thankfulnesse to <hi>GOD</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the happie estate you are in: And thus for what I haue to exhort you to in matters of doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Now I must enter vpon matter of dehortation, take heede, least any man of what gifts or profession soeuer, make a prey of your soules, and carry them away as a spoile: And in particular looke to it in three things, first in Philosophie, not simplie in the doctrines of Philosophie, but in such deuises, and vaine fancies, as vnder colour of such speculation, or from the authority of Philosophers are brought in by any. Secondly, take heede of traditions of men. And thirdly, of the ceremonies of <hi>Moses,</hi> which were things at first brought in to be as the <hi>A.B.C.</hi> or alphabet to traine vp the people of <hi>GOD</hi> in the principles: But now this and the other are not to be regarded for many reasons, whereof the first is, they are not after <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides there is such an infinite fulnesse in <hi>CHRIST,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <p>Verse <hi>9. For in him dwelleth all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the godhead bodily.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>10. And ye are compleat in him who is the head of all principality and power.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </note> by reason of the diuine nature that dwels by an vnexpressible vnion in the humane nature, that we need not seeke to any thing else but only vnto <hi>CHRIST.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And you your selues in <hi>CHRIST</hi> haue all compleatnes, and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency by reason of your mysticall vnion with him, and such is the fulnes of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> that the very Angels those excellent and potent creatures, are subordinate to him, and acknowledge him as their head, which by the way shewes that they are not to be worshipped.</p>
                  <p>And to speake yet more expresly what should you do with circumcision or any part of the law ceremoniall,<note place="margin">
                        <p>Verse <hi>11. In whom also ye are circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of CHRIST.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>12. In that yee are buried with him through baptisme, in whom yee are also raised vp together through faith of the operation of GOD, which raised him from the dead.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>13. And you being dead in your sinnes, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision of the flesh hath he quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together with him, forgiuing you all your trespasses.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>14 Blotting out the hand-writing of ordinances, that was against vs, which was contrary to vs, and tooke it out of the way, nailing it to his crosse.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </note> seeing in <hi>CHRIST</hi> ye haue receiued that which was signified by circumcision; for in him you are circumcised not with the hands of men, as they were vnder the law, but by the finger of the spirit of <hi>GOD</hi>: which standes in the mortification of that bodie of sinnes, which ye were guiltie of while ye were in the flrsh, and this ye haue by the vertue of <hi>CHRISTS</hi> circumcision.</p>
                  <p>And if you say that <hi>Abraham</hi> had the circumcision without hands, and yet was circumcised in the flesh, I answere that we haue baptisme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of that circumcision, and therefore need it not: and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause baptisme doth so liuely set out our spirituall buriall and resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with <hi>CHRIST,</hi> which all they attaine vnto that haue the faith of <hi>GODS</hi> operation, that is, that can beleiue that which <hi>GOD</hi> by his power will do what he promiseth in baptisme, grounding their faith vpon the resurrection of <hi>CHRIST</hi> from the dead.</p>
                  <p>And further this should moue you to disregard those things, because they neither could help you, when you were miserable, nor conferre the benefits vpon you, which you inioy without them, for in your estate of nature you were dead in actuall sinnes, and in respect of originall sinne you liued in the vncircumcision of the flesh: and since you were quickned by true regeneration you haue obteined the forgiuenesse of all your sins, and therefore what would you haue more from these things.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the ceremonies though they were ordinances of <hi>GOD</hi> at the first, yet they were hand-writings against vs, and now <hi>CHRIST</hi> hath
<pb facs="tcp:21380:108"/>
cancelled them, and fastened the obligation vpon the crosse, and so taken them out of the way, and therefore you should neuer more haue minde to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <p>Verse <hi>15. And hath spoiled the principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and powers, and hath made a shew of them open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hath trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed ouer them in the same crosse.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>16. Let no man therefore condemne you in meat and drinke, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moone, or of the sabbath daies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>17. Which are but a shadow of things to come: but the body is in Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>18 Let no man at his pleasure beare rule ouer you by humblenes of mind, and worshipping of Angels, aduancing himselfe in</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>19. And hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not the head, whereof all the body furnished and knit together by ioints and bands,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>20. Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the world,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>21. As, touch not, tast not, handle not.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>22. Which all perish with the vsing, and are after the commandements &amp; doctrines of men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>23. Which things haue indeede a shew of wisedome, in voluntary religion and humblenesse of minde, and in not sparing the body, neither haue they it in any estimation to satisfie the flesh.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </note>And the rather because our Sauiour hath not only cancelled them, but he hath spoiled the Diuels which had power to execute the forfeitures of these bonds, I say both in himselfe on the crosse, and in vs daily he hath and doth spoile them, and triumph ouer them, and make an open shew of them, so as we are freed from the danger of their arrests.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore I come to the conclusion which I direct distinctly, first, against the ceremonies, then against philosophie, and lastly against tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. First, I say let no man condemne you, (or if they do care not for it) condemne you I say for any of the ceremonies, whether it be about meates or drinkes, or about the ceremoniall daies, or monethes, or sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathes, that were required in that law.</p>
                  <p>For these and all the rest were but shaddowes of things to come, and now in <hi>CHRIST</hi> we haue the substance and body of them.</p>
                  <p>The like I say against philosophie and in speciall against Angell wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. let no man beare rule ouer your consciences, for they that bring in this doctrine do it hipocritically vpon pretence that it tends to make men humble, and they do it very ignorantly, for they neuer saw the kingdome of Angels, nor what is done in heauen, and most proudly doe they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance themselues, swelling in the vaine conceits of their fleshly mindes.</p>
                  <p>Yea they that bring in this doctrine fall from the foundation, and hold not <hi>CHRIST,</hi> who is the head of the Church, of whom euery member doth depend, and the whole body is excellently furnished, and indissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly knit together, and increase with the increasing of <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And lastly for traditions I wonder at it you should be clogged with them, seeing you are deliuered from them in the death of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and they are not so honorable as the ceremonies of <hi>Moses,</hi> but are vile burthens.</p>
                  <p>Thinke but with your selues, how vainely they impose vpon you, when they say, touch not, tast not, handle not.</p>
                  <p>Besides all these are perishable things, and fit nothing at all to eternall life, and further they are euidently the common documents and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises, and doctrines of men, that neuer had warrant in the word of <hi>GOD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true they finde out many faire pretences to blinde mens eyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as that hereby we shew speciall zeale to <hi>GOD</hi> in doing more then he commandeth, and these things seeme to tend to humilitie and the taming of the flesh, but all these are but shewes, and therefore naught whatsoeuer they say, because they yeeld not a due respect euen to the body of man.</p>

                        <p>Thus wee see the order and generall meaning and dependance of all these first 7. verses.</p>
                        <p>In this first verse the Apostle would stirre vp the Colossians to constancie in the Gospell receiued, by shewing his great care and daily strife for them and their good.</p>
                        <p>It is not vnlawfull in some cases to praise a mans selfe; the Apostle heere doth it: nor is it vnlawfull to vse rhetoricall insinuations, to winne and excite affection in the people. <hi>Paul</hi> would perswade by shewing his owne care for them. But sure it is, Ministers shall hardly euer profit the people, or power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21380:110"/>
perswade with them vnto constancie in receiuing and retaining the care of their doctrine, vnlesse they shew their owne care in teaching, and their owne loue to the people they would perswade.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>What a great conflict.] Paul</hi> shewes his great loue to them: hee fighteth for them, and this he did when in all likelihood he should imploy his cares for himselfe, being now in such straits, as it were in the middest of death, and the rather they should be affected with this proofe of his loue in them, because they were absent from him.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For.</hi>] This <hi>for</hi> shewes an <hi>aitiologie</hi>; for it points to a dependance vpon the last verse of the former chapter: there he had shewed what paine hee tooke, and how mightily the Lord had shewed his power in working through his ministerie. Now he tels of a fight and combat, which euidently imports, that when the Gospell workes vpon mens consciences, and the ministerie of Gods seruants proues effectuall and powerfull, there will follow some stirre and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, there will be a conflict and strife.</p>
                        <p>Yet hence also may be gathered, that the grace of the Gospell is excellent, and worthie the hauing, else there would not be so much adoe to hinder it.</p>
                        <p>

And in the Apostles times Tyrants with their ciuill or rather vnciuill sword did fight against the truth: so did heretickes with the tares and poison of their infectious doctrine: so did the Infidels also with slanders and outrages. And though these cease, yet opposition will rise from other sorts of men: for in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall all men of wicked life will be <hi>contrarie to sound doctrine</hi> 
                           <note n="g" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.</note>; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly both worldlings and epicure, doe in all places discouer their dislike of the faithfull and diligent preaching of the Gospell, in as much as the word would restraine the excesse of their pleasures and <hi>cares of life</hi>; yea the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill honest men of the world, though they giue heauen good words, and can be long more quiet then the former, yet let once their inward corruption bee ransacked, or their speciall euils powerfully vnmasked, they will become like horses and mules, they will strike at all that crosseth the praise of their quiet estate. And for temporizers, it is wonderfull euident, that in all places they hold it a point of their care, to see that sound preaching be disgraced. For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer by Gods singular mercie amongst vs in this Nation, by the lawes of the Kingdome, preaching is both established and protected with honour, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in practise people of all degrees tend to libertie, and many great ones like not that preaching that should discouer or restraine the greeuous excesses of the time: hence it is that such as serue the humours of men, and run in the current of prophanenesse, doe euery where take all aduantages to disgrace painfull and godly Preachers and preaching. Besides, such is the hellish spight and rage of Papists and popish persons in all places, that in imitation of their

Lastly, this opposition many times is made by corrupt teachers, men that either are poysoned with vnsound opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, or otherwise be of corrupt and ambitious mindes, <hi>as Iannes and Iambres resisted Moses, so doe these resist the truth</hi>

They fight euen by their sufferings: they winne many battles by their very patience, and faith in affliction, by enduring the <hi>fight of affliction.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The consideration of this fight, may first awaken carelesse Ministers, in as much as they proportion out such a course of preaching as they can escape blowes, it giues iust cause of suspition that they are combined with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, in that they are let alone and not opposed.</p>
                        <p>Againe, this may both sound an alarme, to all faithfull Ministers to arme, and prepare for a fight: and it may comfort them, in that this hath been the case of the best of Gods seruants. And withall the people may learne how to be affected to their godly Teachers: doe your Ministers so many wayes la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and striue for you, and shall not you striue for them, by apologie, prayer, care, and all wayes of iust defence?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I would you knew] Q.</hi> Why was the Apostle so desirous they should know, his care, patience, fighting &amp;c. for them? <hi>Answ.</hi> There might be great cause of it. 1. To remoue all conceit that he did not respect them. 2. To incourage them to constancie in that doctrine for which he suffered so much. 3. It might arme them with patience to suffer, if they should be called to it, considering his example. 4. That so they might be stirred vp the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to pray for him. In generall this shewes that it is not enough, that wee loue one an other, but we must manifest it, especially affection between the Minister and his people should not be concealed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For you and for them of &amp;c.</hi>] There were two sorts of godly men in the Apostles times. 1. such as were conuerted mediately by the Apostles, in their own persons. 2. such as were conuerted by others sent of the Apostles. The Apostle here shewes he loues these latter as well as the former.</p>
                        <p>There is a communion with the absent members of Christ, euen with such as we neuer saw in the face, a communion I say in the same head, and in the same spirit, and in the same priuiledges, of a regenerated life. And we see here we are bound to desire and indeuour the good of the absent Saints aswell as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:21380:111"/>
the present, we may fight for the absent, by prayer, by apologie, by our suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and by vsing the meanes of consolation or information, yea herein is a liuely tryall of our true loue, to the brethren, if we can loue them wee neuer saw, for the grace of God we heare to be in them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For them of Laodicea.</hi>] Though there were many Cities of this name, yet I thinke this is the Laodicea mentioned Reuel. 3. If the estate of these Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans be well marked as it is there described, we may obserue, That in matters of religion and Gods worship, they were neither <hi>hot nor cold,</hi> That they thought they had as good hearts to God as any, that they were in loue with no sauing grace, that they were vtterly ignorant of the doctrine of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, that they would take no paines either about iustification or sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. yet no doubt God had his remnant among these, Christ was <hi>Amen</hi> in this Church, he did faithfully performe his promises, and they were such as by a <hi>new creation</hi> of God were begotten againe, euen amongst so carelesse a multitude. The generall securitie of a people, doth not simply dissolue the couenant with a people, and the Gospell is with all care to be taught, though but the <hi>tythe</hi> of men be wrought vpon by it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And for such as neuer saw my face.</hi>] Two things may bee here further noted.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That we haue the profit of the prayers and holy indeuours of such as we neuer saw in the flesh.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That it is a great benefit to enioy the presence, of those that are eminent in Gods seruice, for that is implyed in the words. Certainly it is one thing should make vs willing to die, because then wee shall see the Worthies of the Lord, <hi>face to face</hi>; if so much griefe, Act. 20. because they should see Pauls <hi>face no more,</hi> then what ioy shall it be when we shall <hi>sit downe in the kingdome of heauen, with Abraham, Isaac and Iacob.</hi>

                        <p>In the beginning of this verse is conteined the second reason, taken from the effects of the Gospell, which are two: the first, consolation, the second, establishment of their hearts in brotherly loue; the rest of the words of this verse belongs to the third reason, as shall appeare afterward.</p>
                        <p>This is the fruit of the care and earnest strife of godly Teachers in their painfull labours of the gospell, that it breeds much comfort in the hearts of Gods people, and likewise greatly confirmes them, and settles them in the mutuall loue one of an other: it <hi>knits their hearts together.</hi> And contrariwise we may generally here note the hurt and mischiefe that false and corrupt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers bring vpon men. They hinder the consolation of Gods people, in that they draw them away from God the fountaine of all consolation: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they withdraw them from the societie and fellowship with the Saints.

                        <p>Note here with what feeling the Apostle speaks, when he falls vpon the mention of Christ, and the Gospell: he abounds in powerfull affections and admirations of these things, which may wonderfully abase and humble vs, for our barrennes both in thoughts and affections, and words, when we haue to deale with the things that belong to the kingdom of God.</p>

If they be vnderstood of Christ, yet there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie to vnderstand them, as these treasures are in Christ himselfe only, but as they are in his members by communication. 3. If as it is in him, yet it is not necessarie to vnderstand it of all knowledge in generall, but of that which is needfull for the saluation of the elect. 4. If of all knowledge, yet the Apostle saith not that it is in the soule of Christ, but in Christ. 5. If in the soule, what wisdome? not increate and infinite, but created wisdom.</p>

                           <hi>Are hidden</hi>] The admirable excellencies of wisdome and knowledge in Christ are said to be hidden, 1.

                           <hi>Of knowledge and wisdome.</hi>] The different termes may note but the same knowledge in Christ, but for our capacities varied: It is true that there is in Christ a most admirable perfection, both of the knowledge of contemplation, and of the wisdome and discretion of working and practice, and thus it was in him, in his owne obedience, and is still by participation to his members to make them wise and discreet, as well as full of vnderstanding and iudgment: sure it is that Christ would be rich vnto vs, in the gift of holy discretion, as well as in the gift of holy vnderstanding, if wee would seeke it of him, for he is <hi>made vnto vs of God wisdome</hi>
                           <note n="a" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</note>, neither can true wisdome be found in any men vnder the sunne, that haue not the true grace of Christ, neither can any Christian be found without the grounds of heauenly wisdome, such wisdom I meane as none of the wisest men in the world could euer attaine, for though it be true, that there may be and are many deficiencies in such as otherwise truly feare God, yet if the best wisdome be inquired after, the meanest and simplest Christian doth exceed the greatest and exactest politician, or <hi>disputer of this world.</hi> For what wisdome can it be for a man to haue excelling skill to know the secrets of nature, or the order of ciuill affaires, or the wayes to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance his own outward estate, and yet know no certaine and safe way how to saue his owne soule?</p>

                        <p>Whereas the Colossians might aske, why the Apostle is so large in vrging them to constancie, he shewes in this verse, that it is to preuent the inticements of seducers.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is the dutie of euery Minister to labour by all possible meanes, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue his people, that they be not beguiled: tis not enough to teach them true doctrine, but they must be watchfull, that neither Sathan nor euill men infect and corrupt them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. It is the vsuall practise of the deuill, when the word hath wrought with any power in any place, to assay by all meanes, to draw away and deceiue the mindes of the people: let men looke to themselues, and not liue securely, for certainly the deuill will attempt them with all cunning and fraud.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. If these words be compared with the Apostles exhortation in the 23 verse, of the former chapter, it will appeare manifestly, that one reason why many are deceiued, is their vnsetlednes, in the doctrine of faith and hope: if they had been established in their assurance of Gods fauour in Christ, and and the hope brought by the Gospell, they could not haue been so deceiued, and beguiled, or not so easily.</p>

Pithanalogie, which the Apostle condemns is a speech fitted of purpose, by the abuse of Rhetoricke, to intice and by tickling the affections of men, to please and seduce; and herein properly lyes the abuses of Logick or Rhetorick in matters of Diuinitie, when out of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp; some subtle purpose to deceiue, vaine and false arguments are varni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and coloured ouer, and made probable to the mindes of the simple: yea though the matter taught be sometimes truth, yet many mindes are beguiled, from the power and profit of it, by placing their respects and affections, vpon the wisdome of the words and the affected artificiall frame: otherwise there is singular vse both of Logicke and Rhetoricke, when they are applied to set out the wisdome of God in his word, vnfolding the hidden depths of the power of the word of God: the very preaching of the Gospell is exceeding effectuall, when without affectation, men vse their arte, to expresse the natiue force and life of the words of the holy Ghost in scripture: but the chiefe thing in generall, is for vs hence to learne, that heresie and error, was neuer so vnclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, but it was presented to the world with great colours and probabilities; many simple people wonder that Papists or Brownists should be able to say so much for their idolatrie or schisme: but we must know, that any heretikes that euer were, haue brought great probabilities for their heresies as well as they. The deuill were wonderfull simple, if he should thinke, to bewitch men so far, as to beleeue with any confidence, things that had manifest apparance of falshood, that cannot be. Thus in generall.</p>
                        <p>Now in particular, concerning the corrupting or deceiuing of the soules of men, wee may consider three things. 1. The miserable estate of the soule, that is deceiued, or beguiled, or corrupted. 2. How the soule is corrupted. 3. The meanes to preuent it.</p>
                        <p>For the first, looke what the carcase is when it is putrified, such is the soule when it is corrupted, it is spiritually loath some, and wonderfully vnpleasing vnto God, and cast out of his sight: and the more is the miserie of such soules, because to plead that they were deceiued, will not serue turne; wee may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue or be deceiued, but God will not be mocked.</p>
                        <p>For the second, if we aske by whom or how the soule is deceiued or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted?
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:21380:116"/>
It is to be answered generally,<note place="margin">Who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers.</note> wee must take notice of it to beware: the two great deceiuers, are the deuill and Antichrist <note n="a" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. 2 <hi>Thess</hi> 2.</note>. It is true that by the malice of Sathan, and frowardnesse of wicked men, Gods faithfull seruants are euery where called deceiuers <note n="b" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note>. They that most labour to preserue mens soules from corrupting, are most charged with seducing; but these are so called and are not.</p>
                        <p>The most ordinarie deceiuers, are 1. carnall friends, 2. the profits and pleasures of life, 3. euill companie, this corrupts like leauen, 4. carnall reason, 5. sinne <note n="c" place="margin">

                        <p>Thirdly, if we would not be beguilde and deceiued, wee must looke to three things, 1. we must get a stedfast faith in Iesus Christ, plerophorie or full assurance of Gods fauour is a wonderfull preseruatiue against corruption of doctrine or life.<note n="3" place="margin">Rules to preuent beguiling.</note> 2. we must constantly cleaue to the meanes, vnto which God hath giuen testimonie by the power of his presence, and blessing; wee should get vnder the shelter of a powerfull ministerie, and this will be a rocke of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. 3. we must preserue vprightnes of life, and our care of innocencie in what we know to be required: contrariwise, so long as we are vnsetled, and want assurance, especially if we liue not vnder the power of the word, we are in continuall danger to be drawne away: and so it is with vs too, if wee fall vnto the loue of any sinne, of knowledge; for corruption of life is many times scourged with corruption of doctrine and opinions.</p>
                        <p>But if we would haue more abundant caution for our preseruation, then I will follow the similitude of beguiling amongst men, from whence by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, we may learne many things, for our caution and obseruation.</p>
                        <p>Men that would thriue in their estates, and would not be beguiled in the world or wronged, obserue most an end, these rules. 1. They will buy such things as are durable, not toyes or trifles: so should we, we should set our hearts vpon eternall things, and not minde earthly things, which will last but for a short time, and when death comes, if we trust vpon earthly things, wee shall finde our selues deceiued. 2. They will know their commodities themselues that they sell or buy: so should we both for the sinnes wee would part with, and the opinions, or duties, wee would purchase. 3. They will know the persons, with whom they deale: so should wee try the spirits. 4. They will haue all the securitie may be had: so should we see all warranted by the scriptures, for other securitie we cannot haue put in that is sufficient: if the deuill or the world or corrupt teachers, tempt and intice vs, wee must put them to it, to put vs in securitie from the scriptures, which because they cannot doe, we must wisely reiect them. 5. Men that deale for much, are glad to seeke the protection of some great men: so should we seeke the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the great God. 6. If men doubt in any thing about their estate, they will presently consult with their friends, and in difficult cases they will haue opinions of Lawyers too: so should we doe if we would haue our states safe, wee must propound our doubts one to another, especially to our Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that they may resolue vs out of the word of God.</p>

                        <p>These words depend vpon the former, as the answer of two obiections; First they might say, How doth he know our estates? to which he answers in the first words, That though it were true, that <hi>he were absent,</hi> in respect of <hi>the flesh,</hi> yet it was also true, that <hi>he was present in the spirit,</hi> both in that his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, carried him to a daily thought of them, and so to a willingnes vpon all

occasions to take notice of their estate: and besides, as some thinke, hee was acquainted with their estate extraordinarily, by reuelation of the spirit. And thus also he secretly giues them notice to looke to their waies: for hee takes notice of all that passed amongst them. How carefull should we be in all our courses, as well as they? For we haue the spirit of God in vs, and the people of God round about vs. Heere also Ministers may take notice of their duties: their spirits should cleaue to their people, and their daily thoughts and cares should runne vpon them, they should still obserue them, and watch ouer them in the Lord.</p>

Many are so diseased, that they thinke, if a man reproue them or admonish them, that then he hates them altogether, and likes nothing in them: but the Apostle to preuent that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the praise of their life and faith. A holy minde can reioice in the good things of those he warneth or reproueth.</p>

                        <p>Now that men may attaine to this Eutaxie and good order in Common-weales, they must reade the law of God, and let that be a generall guide to them, and they must propound sanctitie as well as felicitie as the end of their gouernment; and in calling to office, they must be carefull not to set the feet where the head should be, but to chuse men that feare God and hate couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and are men of courage. The feare of God and courage is wonderfully wanting in all sorts of Magistrates. And as for courage, in respect of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, what are they the better if they haue a good man, that will doe no good, then if they had euill men, that would doe no euill? Yet in truth Magistrates, whether good or euill men, doe much euill by suffering euill to be vnpunish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But to returne to the point, Magistrates that would preserue order, must giue good example themselues, and mend the disorders of their own hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds, and bring such a sympathie and loue of the people, as they should both preserue their authoritie, and yet remember that they rule their brethren. And in their gouernment they cannot obserue order, vnlesse they punish vice as well as command or prouide for vertue and wealth. Besides, they must take away the persons or places that are occasions of disorder, and they must charge and remunerate as well as punish. Finally, the people out of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of conscience must striue to liue in order, with reuerence and feare

yeelding ready obedience and furtherance to those that are placed in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer them.</p>

There is order also to be respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the vse of things ecclesiastically indifferent. There is order in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination of persons, in the ministerie, some to rule, some to teach, some to exhort, some to distribute.

Satan striues aboue all things to keepe men in a dead sleepe, that they might not <hi>awake to liue righteously,</hi> or expresse the power of godlinesse. 7. Many are so set in the way of the vngodly, that their very euill societie chains them downe to a necessitie of dissolutenesse. 8. Many are put out of all order by their daily distempers and disorders in their families. Lastly, some faile and fall through very discouragement, receiued either from opposition, or contempt, or scandall.</p>
                        <p>Now if any be desirous to know in generall what he should doe to bring his life into order,<note place="margin">Rules for bringing our liues into order.</note> I shall profitably aduise fiue things: First, that hee doe reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely withdraw himselfe from the sinnes of the times, and keepe himselfe <hi>vnspotted of the world,</hi> in respect of them. Now the sinnes of the times are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, pride of life, contempt of the Gospell, coldnesse in faith and religion, swearing, profanation of the holy Sabbath, domesticall irreligiousnesse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, vsurie, whordome, drunkennesse, and <hi>drinkings,</hi> oppression and speaking euill of the good way. Secondly, that hee obserue the more vsuall corruptions of the calling of life he liues in, and with all heedfulnesse shunne them, whether he be Magistrate, Minister, or priuate person. Thirdly, that he especially striue against and subdue the euils that by nature he is most prone vnto. Fourthly, he shall doe wonderfully profitably, if hee would get a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of duties out of the whole law,<note place="margin">Vse of cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues.</note> that directly concerne himselfe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, which is very easie (especially by the helpe of some that are experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) to bedistinctly gathered, labouring to shew all good faithfulnesse in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of pietie as well as righteousnesse, and to striue for inward pietie as well as outward, resoluing to continue, as well as once to begin. Hence it is, if wee marke it, that the holy Ghost in diuers Scriptures drawes for the people of those times diuers catalogues, either of grace which specially tended to their praise, or of duties that most fitted their state, or of sinnes that they must most carefully auoid, as being most commonly committed: yea it could not but be of excellent vse, if we did taske our selues to the more strict obseruation of some of those catalogues, either of grace, or sinnes, or duties, as wee might perceiue they most fitted vs.</p>
                        <p>But if euer we would goe about the order of our liues,<note place="margin">More rules.</note> wee must in generall 1. labour to weaken the loue of earthly things. 2. We must resolue to <hi>keepe our hearts with all diligence,</hi> I meane we must with all care and conscience striue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst inward sinnes. 3. We must put on a minde to <hi>liue by faith,</hi> whatsoeuer befall vs. 4. If we fall, we would speedily recouer our selues by confession and praier, and not accustome our selues to sinnes either of omission or commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The causes of vnsettlednesse.</note>And for the third thing, the reasons why many men shew not this vnmoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse, and stedfastnesse, are diuers: some haue not faith at all<note n="a" place="margin">2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.2.</note>, some haue not a true iustifying faith, but either rest vpon common hope, or an hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall or temporarie faith. In many the presumption of certaintie doth hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der stedfastnesse it selfe. Some want powerfull meanes, that should establish them; and some hauing the publike meanes, are iustly blasted in their faith because of their daily neglect of the priuate meanes. And this reason may be giuen also why some of the better sort are not yet stablished, namely because they are so hardly excited and perswaded seriously to trie their owne estates, by the signes of Gods fauour, and markes of saluation. And for the worser sort, they shun triall, because they know before hand their state is not good, and besides they liue in some one master sinne or other, which they cannot be perswaded to forsake, and therefore resolue at least for a time to liue at a venture, and referre all to the vnknowne mercie of God.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The means of stedfastnesse.</note>4. If we would be established in beleeuing, 1. we must be much in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of the promises of God. 2. we must be much in prayer, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of secret sinnes, obseruing the comforts of Gods presence, and keeping a record of the wonders of his presence, and striuing to retaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:21380:118"/>
the assurance, wee sometimes feele in prayer. 3. wee must cast about, how to be more profitable in well doing: An orderly life, especially fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in our places, doth maruellously though secretly, establish and settle a mans heart in faith 1. Cor. 15.58. whereas it is almost impossible, that a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren life should haue much stedfastnes, of assurance; againe, would wee yet further know, how it comes to passe, that some men get such a stedfastnesse aboue many others? Obserue then and you shall finde, that when they finde the pearles of grace, and the meanes, they will sell all to buy them: Now the loue to the meanes, is like death or Ielousie, that cannot be resisted, there is in them a constant coueting of the best things, with a true hunger and thirst after them, and if they offend God they cannot be quiet, till they returne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse their sinne, and get fauour: they will not liue dayes and weeks in a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie neglect of communion with God, and therefore reape this vnmoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesse, as the fruit of their daily conuersing with God.</p>
                        <p>Thus of stedfastnes in it selfe.</p>
                        <p>Now in the contrarie, concerning an vnstedfast faith, I propound two things to be considered, 1. The effects or consequences, and concomitants of it: And then the kinds of vnsetled faith.</p>
                        <p>Not Scripture onely, but vsuall experience shew the many inconueniences that attend such as are not stablished in the faith.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. They want the many comforts,<note place="margin">The inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of an vnstedfast faith.</note> the stedfast faith feeleth. 2. They are disquieted with euery crosse. 3. They are tost with the winde of contrarie doctrine, yea the very truth is sometimes yea with them, and sometimes nay: sometimes, they are perswaded, and sometimes, they are not. 4. They finde a secret shunning of the ordinances of God, when any approach should be made vnto God. 5. The feare of death is almost inseparable. 6. They are sometimes frighted with feares of perseuerance, besides their daily danger to be foyled, by the baites of Sathan and the world.</p>
                        <p>Vnstedfastnesse may be considered three wayes.<note place="margin">Vnstedfastnes of faith three wayes.</note> 1. as faith is weake. 2. as faith is weakned. 3. as stedfastnes is lost.</p>
                        <p>For the first, in the first conuersion of a man vnto God, while they lye yet in the cradle of godlinesse, They are assayled with much doubting and many feares, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quest.</hi> But what might some one say,<note place="margin">How weake faith may be discerned.</note> How can faith then be discerned in the midst of so many doubts and feares? <hi>Answ.</hi> The truth of their faith and grace appeares, 1. By their earnest and constant desire of Gods fauour. 2. By the tendernes of the conscience in all their actions, and their daily feare of sinning. 3. By their frequent complaints of vnbeleefe, and secret mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for it. 4. By the lowlinesse of their cariage, euen towards the meaner sort of those that truly feare God. 5. By their desire after the sincere milke of the word. Lastly, by their indeuour to walke inoffensiuely.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quest.</hi> But seeing their faith is true,<note place="margin">Causes of the vnsetlednes of faith weake.</note> what is the cause of the vnsetlednesse of it? <hi>Answ.</hi> They are vnsetled, partly because they haue yet but a small measure of sauing knowledge: and partly because they discerne not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations, offered to them: and partly for want of application of particular promises, that belong vnto them: and sometimes it is for want of some of the meanes: and in some it is, because they see a greater power in some of their corruptions, then they thinke can stand with true grace.</p>
                        <p>Now for the remedies of this vnsetlednes;<note place="margin">Remedies for faith weake.</note> This weake faith will grow setled more and more, if they continue vpright in the vse of the meanes, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as their reformation and victorie ouer sinne increaseth, and as they grow more and more confirmed in the diuorce from the world, and carnall companie, and they grow more <hi>expert in the word of righteousnesse,</hi> especially after the Lord hath refreshed them, with the frequent comforts of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21380:119"/>
and presence, besides conuersing with the faithfull and established Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: And all this the sooner, if they doe propound their doubts, and by asking the way, seeke daily direction, especially if they resigne ouer their soules to the ministerie of some faithfull and mercifull man of God, who as a nurse shall daily feed them, with distinct and particular counsell and comfort.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the vnstedfastnes that accompanieth faith weake.</p>
                        <p>Now there is an vnstedfastnes accompanieth faith weakned, that is such a faith as was sometimes stronger; For the clearer vnderstanding hereof, I consider three things. 1. The causes of this weaknes of faith. 2. The signes to discerne it. 3. The remedies.</p>
                        <p>There may be diuers causes or meanes to weaken strong faith.<note place="margin">Causes of faith weakned</note> 1. Losse of meanes. 2. secret sinnes ordinarilie committed, not lamented, not reformed. 3. Presumptuously to vse ill meanes to get out of aduersitie. 4. Relapse to the loue of the world.</p>
                        <p>The signes to discerne it,<note place="margin">Signes of faith weakned.</note> are 1. the sleepinesse of the heart. 2. feare of death. 3. constant neglect or secret contempt of fellowship with the godly. 4. The ceasing of the sensible working of Gods spirit within. 5. Raigning discontentment. 6. Securitie vnder knowne sinne.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Remedies for faith weakned</note>The remedies are 1. A serious and sound examination of the wants and faults, which by this weaknes they are fallen into. 2. A constant and daily iudging of themselues, for their corruptions, till they recouer tendernesse of heart, and some measure of godly sorrow for them. 3. It will be expedient that they plant themselues vnder the droppings of a daily powerfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie. 4. The meditation of their former feelings. 5. The vse of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper; this is a meanes to confirme faith both weake and weakned. Lastly, they must hold a most strict watch ouer their hearts and liues, till they be re-established in a sound course of reformed life.</p>

                        <p>Now for the remedies of this losse of stedfastnesse,<note place="margin">Remedies for the losse of stedfastnesse.</note> they must know that there is required of them, a speciall humiliation, note that I say a speciall humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation: For they must in priuate afflict their soules before the view of their speciall sinnes, and Gods feirce wrath, with strong cries and sighes vnspeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble making their moane before God, They must <hi>cry vnto God out of the deepe,</hi> as the Psalmist saith. Besides they must shame themselues openly by making
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:21380:120"/>
themselues vile before the people of God, so did <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>; yea they must voluntarily resigne ouer themselues vnto Gods scourging hand, being so desirous to be cleansed of their sins, as to be contented God should wash them throughly though it were with many crosses. And further they must be reuenged of their owne flesh, by streitning and curbing themselues in their lawfull desires and delights. Thus of their speciall humiliation: Now secondly, they must take speciall paines to recouer their faith in God; and to get pardon of their sinnes, They must crie daily vnto God, they must search againe and againe in the records of Gods promises, especially waiting vpon the preaching of the Gospell, to see when the Lord will returne and haue mercy by reuiuing of their hearts with the comforts of his presence. And for this they must be wonderfull careful of the spirit of grace, to stir it vp by daily prayer, and to obserue with all watchfulnesse the stirring of it, resoluing with al thankfulnes to acknowledge any measure of the reuiuing of the spirit.</p>
                        <p>Lastly when they are in any measure recouered, they must looke to two things. 1. They must forsake all appearance of euill. 2. They must vse a continuall watchfulnesse, and with feare and iealousie looke to their hearts, euen in their best actions: least Sathan beguile them, and they reuolt againe, and then their case of reciduation be worse then the former, <hi>blessed is the man that feareth alwaies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus of the losse of stedfastnesse, especially, as it is in the cureable, for there is a losse of stedfastnes, and the ioy of Gods saluation euen in the elect, which in this life is incureable; Of this I can say little, because the Scripture is in this point exceeding sparing, and because the iudgements of God especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of this kinde are exceeding deep, who can wade into them? only a word or two of it. This losse is incureable two wayes, sometimes in the crosse or iudgement it brought vpon the offender, sometimes in the vnstedfastnesse it selfe; for sometimes though the Lord restore inward ioy and assurance, yet hee will not remooue the outward signe of his wrath, sometimes hee drawes backe the outward affliction, but doth not restore the inward comfort, or not in so great a measure, so as some of Gods children, may die without the sense of the ioy of Gods saluation till they come to heauen, yea they may die in great terror and despaire: yet the Lord may be reconciled, and they may truely repent, though these terrors or iudgements bee not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased: because God many times will thereby purge the publike scandall and cleere his owne iustice: Besides, such spectacles doe giue warning to a carelesse world, to let them know that God hath treasures of wrath for sinne if they repent not. Thus of the doctrine of stedfastnesse of faith, and vnsted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse also; now briefely for some vses of it.</p>

                           </note>It may serue for great reproofe, of the great neglect of seeking this sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse of faith. We may complaine aswell of the common Protestant, as of the Papists heerein, for they are alike aduersaries to the assurance of faith; let such as are touched with feare of God and desire to beleeue, trauell more and more for attainement heereof, and to this end cleaue to the sure word of the Prophets and Apostles, and labour in the practise and exercise of all holy and Christian graces.</p>
                        <p>And for particular consideration of the troubles and losses of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, we may note 1.

                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.</note>, or to walke after the appointment of his will expressed in his word, but it is chiefely to continue a daily care of holy perseuerance in the graces and duties of holy life, holding fast our communion with Christ, this the Apostle thinks wonderfull needfull to be often vrged and pressed by all meanes vpon vs, so shamefully doe many fall away, and so cursedly is the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity that is in Christ Iesus pursued by the Diuell, and the flesh and the world, and so necessary is the endeauour to preserue the glory of perseuerance in all well doing to the end. Oh this perseuerance, it is a wonderfull thing, and where is the man that doth not lose something of what he had? Oh that wee could be soundly awakened to the care of it, or that wee had mindes that would bee willing to doe any thing wee could to further it: but alasse there is not a heart in vs, there are diuers excellent directions in the word to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme vs heerein, if we were not ouercome with sluggishnesse.</p>
                        <p>There are diuers things which if they were looked to at our first setting out, we were sure to hold out and continue walking in Christ.<note place="margin">Rules for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance to bee obserued in our first conuersion.</note> As,</p>
                        <p>If men did at first put their hearts to these questions of abnegation, so as they would bee throughly aduised, if thou haddest asked thine owne heart these questions; Canst thou take vp thy crosse and follow Christ? Canst thou suffer aduesity with the righteous? Canst thou professe Christ amidst the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinions of multitudes of men? Canst thou bee content to deny pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and reason, and thy desires and pleasures and credit, and all for Christs sake? if not, thou wilt certainely fall away, and therefore better neuer beginne.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. At mens first setting out they must take heede they bee not sleightly in their reformation and mortification: but doe it throughly, not sparing to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict their Soules with sensible and sound godly sorrow: for else they will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward repent of their repentance: whereas if it were done with sound ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and serious humiliation, this would be an vnmooueable foundation of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21380:121"/>
rest and encouragement to faith and wel-doing. It is a great question, whether such will hold out that come in without sorrow for sinnes.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Men must at first looke to their kinde of faith: we see many are grossely deceiued: temporary faith maketh such a shew, that vnlesse it be throughly tried it will deceiue many: and there is a maruellous loathnesse in our nature to abide the triall, though we know it be plainely heere required <note n="d" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</note>; whereas if wee did get a continuing faith at first, wee might haue the more assurance of holding out.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It would much further perseuerance if wee did at first endeauour, that knowledge and affection might bee inseparable twinnes: not to bee much proud of knowledge without affection, nor to trust much to zeale without knowledge: either of these may be alone in men, that will fal away shamefully.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. When men goe about reformation, they should doe it throughly, and be sure their hearts are renewed: for the old heart will not hold out long to endure the hardship of a reformed life: and if some sinnes haue beene fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and spared, though they lie still for a time, yet afterwards they will reuiue and shew themselues. We see in some, what a doe there is to leaue some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and faults, they are seauen yeeres many times before they can bee perswaded to forgoe them, resting in the reformation of other faults: wheras there is no assurance that they walke with a right foot in the Gospell, till they make conscience of a ready reformation of euery knowen sinne, and till they reforme throughly they are like to fall away, whatsoeuer faire shew of zeale and forwardnesse they make.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. In particular diuers men are to be warned of passion and violent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if thou meane to prosper in thy perswasion of reformation, then speedily <hi>cease from anger and leaue of wrath,</hi> else there will bee little hope that thou wilt not returne <hi>to doe euill</hi>

Be sure thou continue in the carefull vse of the meanes, as the word, prayer, conference and Sacraments, else know that when once thou giuest way to a customarie hardnes of heart in the vse of the meanes, or neglect of them, thou art neere either some great sinne or temptation, or some great

It is a maruellous great fault, to call the loue of God into question vpon euery occasion, whereas men cannot glorifie God more then to liue by faith, &amp; to be vnmouable in it: God takes litle delight in a soule that will withdraw it selfe vpon euery occasion by vnbeleefe.

                           <p n="1">1.

                           <p>Here diuers things may be noted.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That the people should labour for a reuerend estimation of the doctrine they receiue from their faithfull teachers.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That as faith commeth by hearing, so doth the establishment of faith also.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That it is wonderfull dangerous to neglect either the charge of our teachers when they vrge vs to assurance, or the rules by which they guide vs out of the word of God, for the attainment of it; if we would goe about it, when our teachers call vpon vs, the Lord would be with his ordinance to blesse it to vs; we should be afraid to delay, when we are taught how to confirm our soules in faith and grace.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. The faithfull Ministers do greatly labour to establish their hearers in the assurance of Gods fauour, and the duties of holy life.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Abounding therein with thanks-giuing.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In these words the Apostle shuts vp all; wherein his intent is to stirre them vp to thankfulnes, that as they did thriue in the meanes or matter of faith and holy life, so they should glorifie God by all possible thankfulnesse for it: as he would haue them abound in faith and holinesse, so also in thankfulnes to God. This may wonderfully smite our hearts: for if we obserue our wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched euill dispositions, we may finde that we are wonderfully bent to the very habit of vnthankfulnesse: and therefore it is iust with God many times, that we doe no more thriue in victorie ouer our corruptions, or in the power of diuers graces, or in the progresse of duties, because we doe not more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and constantly acknowledge the goodnesse of God we haue had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of. Oh that it were written vpon our hearts, and grauen deepe in our memories, that nothing becomes vs more then to abound in thankfulnesse, no fairer sight then to see the Altar of the Lord couered with the calues of our lips; neuer can the estate of a child of God be such, but he hath exceeding great cause of thankfulnes for his happinesse in Christ.</p>

                           </note>It is vaine deceit foure wayes. 1. When it propoundeth and teacheth diuellish things,<note place="margin">How Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy becomes vaine deceipt.</note> as the philosophy of the Pagans did: As in their Magickes, when they taught the diuers kindes of Southsayings, coniurings, casting of natiuities, and a great part of Iudiciall Astrologie. 2. When the placets and opinions of Philosophers that are false, are iustified as true. As their doctrine of the worlds eternity, or the soules mortalitie, or the worship of Angels, or their Stoicall fate and destinie, or their vilde opinions about the chiefe good. 3. When the principles of philosophie, that in the ordinarie course of nature are in themselues true, are abused to denie things propounded in the Gospell aboue nature. As those maximes, that of nothing nothing is made. And that of a priuation to a habit there is no regression, and that a Virgin cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. The first is brought against the creation of God, wheras it is true of the second cause only. So the second is brought against the resurrection, whereas it is true only in the ordinary course of nature. 4. When the truest and best things in philosophie are vrged, as necessarie to saluation, and imposed as meet to beioyned with the Gospell.</p>
                        <p>Philosophy may yet be vsed, so as shee be content to be a seruant not a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse. If when Gods word reueales any thing absurd in her, that then shee will humble herselfe, and acknowledge her blindnesse, and bee admonished by diuine light. And on the other side, men may be corrupted with philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, and that diuers wayes.<note place="margin">When men are corrupted by philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</note> 1. If men vse any part of philosophy that is diuellish, as too many doe. 2. If men neglect the study of the Scriptures, and spend their time onely in those humane studies. 3. When men mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure all doctrine by humane reason and philosophicall positions. 4. When men depend not vpon God, but vpon second causes. 5. When men striue to yoake mens consciences with the plausible words of mens wisedome. Hence also we may note, that false doctrine may be supported with great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of wisdome and learning, as was the corruption of those false tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. We may not thinke that Papists are fooles, and can say nothing for their religion: but if the Lord should let vs fall into their hands to trie vs, wee must expect from diuers of them great shewes of learning &amp; colours of truth.</p>

                        <p>There is another distinction about traditions,<note place="margin">A distinction about traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and that is this. 1. Some things are founded vpon Scripture, and did alwaies tend to further godlines, and are therefore Apostolicall and to bee obserued: as all the doctrines of the word, and the publike assemblies of prayer and preaching. 2. Some things were founded in Scripture, and were sometimes profitable, but now are out of all needfull vse: and therefore though they be Apostolicall, yet they binde not, as the tradition of abstaining from things sacrificed to Idols, and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and bloud. 3. Some things haue not foundation in the word, yet may further pietie, if vsed without superstition, and therefore not vnlawfull, as the obseruation of the feast of the Natiuitie of Christ, and such like. 4. Some things haue no foundation in Scripture, nor doe at all further piety, but are either light or vnnecessarie, or repugnant to the word, those are simply vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
                        <p>Traditions were both in the Church of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Traditions in the Church of the Iewes.</note> and in the Churches of the Gentiles; the Iewish traditions were called the traditions of the elders, not because they were enioyned them by their Sanadrim or Colledge of Elders, but because they were brought in by their fathers after the captiuity, the most of them after the rising of the sect of the Pharisies. For among them was that distinction, of the Law written, and the law by word of mouth: this Law by word of mouth is the <hi>Cabalisticall Theologie,</hi>

                        <p>In the primitiue Church they had by degrees one after another a great number of traditions: such as these; To stand and pray euery Sabboth from Easter to Whitsontide; The Signe of the Crosse; to pray towards the East; the annointing of the baptized with oyle; the canonicall houres; Lent and diuers kindes of fasts; the mixing of water with wine; the addition of diuers orders in the Church, as Canons, Exorcistes, Ostiaries,  Holy-dayes; to sing <hi>Halleluiah</hi> at Easter but not in Lent, and such like.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, it cannot well bee denied, but that the libertie taken in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue times to bring in traditions, opened a doore to Antichrist.</p>

                        <p>The third thing from which hee doth dehort is the Rudiments of the world.</p>

                        <p>By the Rudiments of the world hee meaneth the lawes of <hi>Moses,</hi>

                        <p>Those lawes were called Rudiments or Elements,<note place="margin">Why called rudiments.</note> as some thinke, because the Iewes and false Apostles held them as needefull, as the foure elements of the world: or else because in their first Institution they did signifie the most choice and fundamentall principles of the Gospell, that were necessary for all to know that would be saued; but it is most likely they are called so by a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Relation to the Abcedaries, that as little children beginne at the Alphabet and so goe on to higher studies, so did the Lord giue those lawes, as the A. B. C. of the Iewes, to bee their Paedagogie, in the infancie of the Church.</p>
                        <p>Now they might be said to be <hi>of the world,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Why of the world.</note> because they were externall rites and subiect to the sight and sense: and because they consisted of a glory that was more worldly then spirituall, and because worldly men doe most stand vpon that which is externall.</p>
                        <p>Tis the drift of the Apostle to disswade from the obseruation of those rites, because now the law of <hi>Moses</hi> was abrogated. Abrogation is a plausible doctrine in popular estates; Proclamation concerning immunities from tributes and taxations, or concerning Isonomie, that is, indifferent libertie for all to be competitors for honors or free for profits of a common-wealth, those were wont to be wonderfull gratefull to the multitude, and such is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of abrogation in Diuinitie: yet because it may be abused by Epicures, it is to be more carefully opened.</p>
                        <p>The Law may be said to be abrogated diuers waies.<note place="margin">The law ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated 4. wayes.</note> 1. When it is anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated or obsolete, so as men are neither bound to dutie nor punishment: and thus the ceremonies are abrogated. 2. When the punishment is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, onely the obedience still remaining in force, as in the law of stealth. 3. It is abrogated to the guiltie, when the punishment is transferred on an other, so as the law cannot exercise her force vpon the guilty person. 4. It is abrogated, when it is weakned and eneruated by transgressors: to breake the law is to loose or dissolue the law; thus wicked men by their liues abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quest.</hi> But is the whole law of <hi>Moses</hi> abrogated? <hi>Answ:</hi> No; for though <hi>Moses</hi> be said to giue place to Christ, that doth not import a change of the law, but of the Law-giuer. <hi>Moses</hi> gaue three kinds of lawes, Morall, Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, Ceremoniall.</p>
                        <p>For the morall Law,<note place="margin">How the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall law is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated. <hi>Rom</hi> 8.1.2.</note> it may in some sort be said to be abrogated, as 1. In respect of the curse and malediction, as it did worke anger and made execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for so <hi>there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Iesus,</hi> in as much
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:21380:126"/>
as the <hi>law of the spirit of life hath freed them from the law of sinne and death.</hi> 2. In respect of the inexorable rigour and perfection of it:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom</hi> 6.14.</note> for we are not now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law but vnder grace. 3. In some sense it is abrogated in respect of iustification: for now it is no more required of the godly, that they should seeke iustification by the law, but by Iesus Christ. Againe, we must distinguish of the persons: for the law still lyeth on the necke of the vnregenerate, but in the former respects is abrogated to the faithfull, for against them there is no law,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 5 23. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. How the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall Lawes are abrogated</note> but the law is giuen to the vnrighteous.</p>
                        <p>Now for the Iudiciall lawes of <hi>Moses,</hi> they were as it were ciuill lawes, concerning Magistrates, Inheritance, order and processe of Iudgments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, mariage, bondage, diuorce, vowes, vsurie, and trespasse between man and man.</p>
                        <p>These Iudiciall lawes must be considered two waies. 1. As they binde the Iewes, as they were men, that is, in a common and generall right, and so those lawes are perpetuall in the nature and equitie of them. 2. As they bound the Iewes as they were Iewes, in a personall, nationall, or singular right: And thus where the reason of a law is particular, there the law is so, and binds not other people, but as it may fit their Common-wealths.</p>
                        <p>The Ceremoniall lawes did concerne sacrifices, and sacraments, and other holy things, and rituall obseruations. Diuines haue a saying, that <hi>the Iudicialls</hi> are <hi>dead,</hi> but <hi>the Ceremonialls</hi> are <hi>deadly.</hi> That the Ceremonies are abrogated, was signified by the renting of the vaile of the Temple, yea the Temple it selfe is destroyed, as will more fully appeare when I come to the 15. verse.</p>
                        <p>And thus of the rudiments of the world; Hithervnto also of the matter of the dehortation: the reasons follow.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And not after Christ.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>These words conteine the first reason against philosophie, traditions and ceremonies: they are not after Christ, and therefore to be auoided, lest our soules be spoiled. These things were not after Christ, 1. because they no way tended to the furtherance of heauen &amp; reconciliation with God, which in Christ we should principally looke to. 2. Because they were no way war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ed, or approued, or commanded by Christ: Christ when he came impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed no such things. 3. Because they doe now no way lead vs after Christ, but from him rather, in as much as we rest in those works done, and neglect the commandement of God. Lastly, they feed the humors of carnall men, and draw away mens mindes from the spirituall worship of God in Christ.</p>
                        <p>Hence we may note an answer to that question, whether the Gentiles may not be saued without Christ by philosophie? The Apostle determines that the soule is spoild by philosophie, if it be not after Christ.</p>
                        <p>Againe, hence we may learne a note of tryall concerning the truth of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions: that religion which is not after Christ, is a false religion. for this is a foundation, that euerlasting happinesse must be expected from Christ alone.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, here we may note, that sinnes against Christ will be accompted for, though they were not forbidden in the morall law. we haue now another law in the Gospell, so as whatsoeuer is not after Christ is a great transgress<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Thus of the first reason.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div n="9" type="verse">
                        <head>

                              <p>For in him dwelleth all the fullnes of the Godhead bodily.</p>
                           </q>
                        </head>
                        <p>These words conteine the second reason: and it stands thus; If in Christ there be all diuine fullnes and sufficiencie, then there needs no supply from humane inuentions, either for doctrine, or worship, or manners: but in Christ there dwells all fullnes euen from the ocean of all perfection, and therefore let no man spoile you through philosophie, traditions or ceremonies, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>For the explication of the Minor, we may conceiue of the words of the text thus; There is in Christ all fullnes of wisdome as the Prophet of the Church, therefore there needs no philosophie. 2. There is all fullnes of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Christs satisfaction as Priest of the Church, therefore there needs no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piating ceremonies. 3. There is all fullnes of power and efficacie in Christ as king of the Church, therefore there is no need that we should help him with inuenting traditions to vphold the liues or godlinesse of Christians, or any way to further the ordinances of Christ.</p>
                        <p>This verse conteines in it selfe an excellent proposition concerning Christ, viz. That the Godhead is in the bodie, that is, in the humane nature of Christ; And this is amplified, 1. by the manner of presence, <hi>he dwelleth there.</hi> 2. by the measure, <hi>in all fullnes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The word <hi>Corporally</hi> hath been diuersly interpreted. <hi>Corporally,</hi> that is, truly and indeed. <hi>Corporally,</hi> that is, not in shew or shadow only, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, in comparison of the shadowes of the law, or prefiguring signes. He dwelleth not in Christ as he did in the Temple. <hi>Corporally,</hi> that is, according to the flesh. <hi>Corporally,</hi> in respect of the manner of his presence, not as he is in all creatures by efficacie or power, nor as he is in the Saints by his grace, nor as he is in the blessed by glory, but corporally, that is, by vnion with the person of the word; but I thinke it is safest and plainest, to take it in the third sense, viz. corporally, that is, in his humane nature.</p>
                        <p>Christ is commended in the praise of his relation 1. to the Godhead in this verse. 2. to Saints and Angels, v 10.</p>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. It is no more then to affirme, that the humane nature is vnited to the deuine in the fulnesse of it. Or 2. That it is incorporate, or made flesh incarnate, or hath a body ioyned to it. Or else 3. Let it be granted of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation in the flesh of Christ: yet it followeth not that therefore it is there included. For it is so in the flesh whole, that without the flesh it is euery where. For the diuinitie is not only immense that it can be euery where, but also most simple, that it can be and be euery where whole, as the soule in the bodie and the light is in the sunne, and yet not included there, yet trulie and whole there.</p>

                           <note place="margin">How Christ was like vs, &amp; how vnlike.</note>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> That this may be cleerely resolued, we must know that what is said in this verse notwithstanding, Christ in his humane nature was like vnto vs. But for euidence, I shew briefly in what he was like, and then in what he was not like. He was like 1. in that he tooke a true body, not fantasticall. 2. He tooke a true humane body, and not a caelestiall body, and he was indued with a reasonable soule. 3. He had the essentiall faculties of both. 4. He had the very infirmities of our nature, I meane such as were not sinful. Now Christ was vnlike vs in bodie, in soule, in both: <hi>In body,</hi> 1. In his conception there was a difference, for we are of <hi>Adam</hi> and by <hi>Adam</hi>: but he was of <hi>Adam</hi> and not by <hi>Adam,</hi> for he was not begotten but made: and so originall sinne was auoided, and some thinke his very body had all the parts at the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21380:127"/>
formed. 2. His body was not corruptible, it saw no corruption. In soule he differed two waies. 1. In that it was without sinne. 2. In that it was indued with gifts aboue men and Angels. In both there was difference. For 1. They subsisted from the beginning in the diuine nature, and did not make a person of themselues. 2. They are admitted vnto the grace of adoration, so as now Christ-man is worshipped though not properlie as he is man.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the natures of Christ: the vnion of them followes, in a double consideration. 1. Of the manner, in the word <hi>dwell.</hi> 2. Of the measure <hi>in all fulnesse.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dwell</hi>] There are two kindes of vnions in Christ. 1. Of the soule and body. 2. Of both those with the person of the word, the later is heere meant.</p>
                        <p>There are 2. questions about vnion in Theologie,<note place="margin">Distinctions of vnions.</note> that are wonderfull full of difficultie. 1. The vnion of three persons in one nature. 2. The vnion of two natures in one person. This latter is in Christ, hee is begotten as God, created in respect of his soule, and borne in respect of his body.</p>
                        <p>There are diuers vnions. 1. Substantiall in the Trinitie. 2. Naturall in soule and body. 3. Carnall in man and wife. 4. Misticall in Christ and the Church. 5. Personall in Christ, for in him as soule and body are one man, so God and man are one Christ.</p>
                        <p>It is much easier to tell how this vnion in Christ is not then to tell how it is. Negatiuely thus.</p>
                        <p>Things are vnited three waies; Some things are compounded and made one, yet the things vnited are not changed, mingled, or confounded, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine perfect: as many stones vnited in one building. 2. Some things vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are perfect, but yet changed and not what they were: as the body of a man made of the vnion of the foure elements. 3. Some thinges remaine whole and not changed but vnperfect of themselues, as the soule and body of themselues apart. Now this vnion of Christ is not after any of these waies. Againe this vnion in Christ is. 1. Not by bare assistance or presence <note n="o" place="margin">

                        <p>Concerning this first sort of knowledge in Christ, strange things are said by Diuines, but the summe of all is this. 1. That the soule of Christ by this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Though he know the thinges that are and shall be, yet, he knowes not such things as shall not be, and yet God can do them. 3. What he doth know by this finite light he knowes not so plainely as the word doth. 4. It seeth not things at one view or altogether, but one thing after another. Thus of his immediate or blessed knowledge.</p>
                        <p>The second kinde of knowledge is habituall or infused knowledge. By this knowledge, he knowes all that can be knowne of man or Angels, yea of all of them together, of this hee speakes <hi>Esay.</hi> 11.3. There are foure wordes to expresse it, <hi>wisedome, vnderstanding, knowledge,</hi> and <hi>counsell</hi>; by the first hee vnderstandeth celestiall and diuine things; by the second things seperate from matter, as the Angels; by the third things naturall; and by the last things to be done. But this knowledge is much inferior to the former, for thus hee knowes not the diuine essence. Of experimentall knowledge the holy Ghost spake <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52. when he said <hi>Iesus increased in wisdome,</hi> and that must needes bee in such knowledge as hee got by obseruation by degrees in the world. Thus of the wisedome of Christ.</p>

Churches: and I haue spoken of it before, more then men of wrangling na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and corrupt and enuious mindes did well take, though no more then what is ordinarie in the writings of learned men: I shall not need therefore to say much of it in this place. The power of Christ is twofold, <hi>increate</hi> and <hi>create.</hi> Increated power, is the power of his diuine nature, and so he is omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent.

                        <p>In the state of exaltation; there befell Christ 4. things. 1. a wonderfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of glory. 2. the grace of adoration with the diuine nature. 3. the power of administration of all things in heauen and earth <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.</note>. 4. a iudiciarie power, viz. to be the Iudge of the whole world <note n="e" place="margin">

                        <p>Thus of the second effect.</p>
                        <p>The third effect of this vnion in Christ, was his mediatorship, as remaining perfect God he became man; so without any mutation of himselfe, he is by this vnion become perfect mediator between God and man, the true high priest, and the only head of the Church.</p>
                        <p>The fourth and last effect of this vnion, is the communion of the effects: there are diuers operations of both natures, yet they meet in one worke done <hi rend="sup">f</hi>: the worker is the person; the fountaines of operation, are the two natures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their properties: the actions are some proper to the diuine nature, some to the humane, yet the outward fact or thing effected is the worke of both natures. Thus of the effects of this vnion in Christ.</p>
                        <p>Now the effects that flow to vs from hence, are either in Christ for vs, or in vs by Christ.

                        <p>The vbiquitaries doe abuse this place, for they alleage that this place proues, that the essentiall proprieties of the diuine nature are communicated really to the humane, and so they say Christ is in his humane nature omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, euery where present and omniscient: this they fall vpon to establish his reall presence in the sacrament. But that this place cannot fit their turnes, may appeare by these reasons, 1. He saith, <hi>in whom,</hi> that is, in which person the Godhead dwells &amp;c. now it is not doubted by any, but that the person of Christ i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Be it, <hi>in which bodie</hi> the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwells &amp;c. yet this proues nothing for them, for so hee dwells in the Saints, and yet they doe not say, they are euery where present. 3. When he saith, <hi>all fullnes,</hi> this <hi>fullnes</hi> notes the essence as well as the proprieties: now I hope they will not say the essence is wholy communicated to the bodie of Christ. 4. <hi>All fullnes</hi> imports all attributes as well as some, now all attributes are not communicated: as for example, the bodie of Christ was not eternall.

                           <hi>Who is the head of all principalitie and power</hi>] It is true that Magistrates be in great place on earth and haue principalitie and power, and may be so called iustly, but that is not meant here.

                        <p>The Angells are diuersly called in Scripture: they are called <hi>spirits</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse their nature, and <hi>angells</hi> to expresse their office, as messengers sent of God: they are called <hi>sonnes of God</hi>

Angells are most spirituall creatures without bodies: they mooue like the winde vnresistably, easily without molestation, and in an vnperceiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time: and for their number, I am not of their fond opinion that thinke they are ment in the parable of the 99. sheep, as if they were so infinite beyond the number of mankind: yet without question, their number is exceeding
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21380:130"/>
great and almost incomprehensible, and cannot be knowne of vs in this world <note n="n" place="margin">

They wonderfully excell in knowledge, and that naturall, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, and experimentall. But to speake a little more expresly, I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Angels, 1. What they are in themselues, here called <hi>principallities</hi> and <hi>powers.</hi> 2. What they are in relation to Christ, who is said here to bee their <hi>head.</hi> 3. What they be in reference to the body of Christ.</p>
                        <p>The Angels in themselues are principalities, for their excellencie of nature and estate. They are called powers for their wonderfull force they haue ouer other creatures at Gods appointment. The words do not import any hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie among the Angels, for howsoeuer we are not to thinke there is any A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxie among those glorious creatures; so it hath been bold presumption in those either Iewes or Scholemen or Papists that haue trauelled in it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a fantasticall number of orders amongst them. For their excellencie of nature, as they are here called principalities, so else where they are called, <hi>starres of the morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sonnes of God,</hi> yea <hi>Gods</hi> 
                           <note n="o" place="margin">

                           </note>. And for their power it is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great ouer the creatures: as when an Angell could destroy all the first borne of Egypt, and to ouerthrow so many thousand in <hi>Senacharibs</hi> armie: an Angell set <hi>Peter</hi> out of prison, an Angell caried <hi>Philip</hi> in an instant, they can strangely winde themselues into mens imaginations, so as they can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to men in their dreames <note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>Math.</hi> 1.</note>. As euill Angels can suggest tentations, so do good Angels holy motions. They haue power ouer the Deuils to restrain them, but worke miracles they cannot but by the power of God; the Angell in the 8. of <hi>Iohn</hi> could moue the waters, but he could not of himselfe cure the sicke. Thus of Angels in themselues.</p>
                        <p>In relation to Christ so they are implied to be of the body, and Christ to be their head. Now we may not maruell at it that Christ should be the head of Angels, for there be diuerse distinct benefits which Angels from thence do receiue,<note place="margin">The benefits Angels haue by Christ.</note> which by naturall creation they had not. It is a benefit that they are vouchsafed a place in the misticall body vnder Christ that they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, as it were into the new order in Christ. 2. A peace is made betweene them and man in Christ. 3. The roomes of Angels falne are supplied by the elect, the society of Angels being much maimed by their fall. 4. They are refreshed with singular ioy for the conuersion of the elect; besides the inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of their knowledge, that they are vouchsafed the vnderstanding of the secrets of the Gospell. 5. They receiue from Christ confirming grace, and so assurance that they shall neuer fall: which is their cheife benefit. 6 Their obedience in it owne nature is vnperfect <note n="q" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iob.</hi> 4.</note>, though not sinfull, and therefore may neede to be couered by Christs perfections.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do for the body of Christ.</note>Thus of the relation to Christ. Now if any aske what relation they haue to the body of Christ, and what they doe vnto it: I answer, by propounding both what seruice they do to the body, and in what maner. For the first, they are like Masters and Tutors to whom the great King of heauen sends out his children to nurse. God out of the rabble of best men doth adopt children to himselfe and after commit them to be kept by those most noble citizens of heauen <note n="r" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.</note>; Besides they execute iudgment vpon the enemies of the Church. They attend vs at the houre of death and carry our soules to heauen <note n="s" place="margin">
                              <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.</note>. They shall gather our bodies together at the last day <note n="t" place="margin">
                              <hi>Math.</hi> 24.</note>. Lastly for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all designments for our good they stand alwaies looking on the face of God to receiue commandements <note n="u" place="margin">
                              <hi>Math.</hi> 18.10.</note>. Now for the manner in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament they are reported to haue sometimes appeared vnto men, sometimes in their dreames, sometimes in visions, the Prophets being rauished, into an extasie, without true bodies, but not without the forme of bodies. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they appeared in true bodies, either such as were for the time created of nothing, or else formed for the seruice of some preexisting matter, or else
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21380:130"/>
they vsed the bodies of some liuing creatures: for if the Deuill could speake in the Serpent, why might not some good Angell vse other Creatures: as some thinke the Angell spake in Balaams Asse. But for this kinde of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themselues to men in the new Testament it is ceased, especially since the primitiue times, so as now we cannot describe how the Angels doe performe their seruice to the Church.</p>
                        <p>Now for the vse of the whole, in as much Christ is the head of principalitie, and powers, we may comfort our selues diuers waies. If Christ fill the Angels, how much more can he out of his fulnesse fill vs, in the supplie of all our wants? againe, shall we not reioyce in the grace here is done to vs, in that wee are vnited into communion with Angels vnder our head? yea and that such glorious creatures, are appointed to be our attendants, why should wee feare when Christ and his Angels will be so readie about vs? further this may also instruct vs, we neede not be ashamed of Christs seruice, seeing the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels follow him and depend vpon him. A prince that kept great princes to be his domesticall seruants, were like to be much sought to for preferment of such as would follow him? Oh how should we long after Christ who is head ouer such glorious creatures as the Angels are?</p>

                              <p>In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands, in putting off the bodie of the sinnes of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ.</p>

                        <p>Here is the fifth reason, and is peculiarly addressed against those Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the Iewes which ioyned the Law with the Gospell as necessarie to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. By circumcision they were initiated to the Law of Moses: and if circumcision can adde nothing to vs nor perfect vs any way in Christ, then neither can the Law it selfe. We haue that in Christ of which circumcision, and the law were signes, we are circumcised in the spirit and therefore neede not to be circumcised in the flesh, and in Christ we haue the accomplishment of what was shadowed in the law.</p>
                        <p>Might some one say the consequence is strange: we are circumcised in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit therefore we need not be circumcised in the flesh.<note place="margin">

                           </note> For answere hereunto, we must know that in the time of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this consequence was of no force: yet now in the new it is exceeding strong. For now we haue not only accomplished what was signified by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, but Christ hath appointed another signe in steed of it, viz. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, especially this is cleare amongst the Gentiles, which neuer were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised in the flesh.</p>
                        <p>There is imported vnto vs in this verse a twofold circumcision.<note place="margin">A twofold circumcision.</note> 1. The circumcision made with hands <note n="a" place="margin">

                        <p>Concerning circumcision made in the flesh, there is an obseruation of a fourefold time. 1. There was a time wherein it was not, viz. from the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till <hi>Abrahams</hi> daies. 2. There was a time wherein it was necessarie, viz. from <hi>Abraham</hi> till Christ. 3. There was a time wherein it was tolerable, viz. for some few yeares after Christ. 4. There was a time wherein it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, and vtterly vnlawfull, viz. since the Apostles times to the end of the world <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Circumcision had a double signification,<note place="margin">What cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision signified.</note> for partly it looked to Christ, and partly to the members of Christ. As it looked to Christ it signified 1. That they should haue a Sauiour that was circumcised, that is free from all sinne.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:21380:131"/>
2. That he should come of the seede of <hi>Abraham.</hi> 3. That he should sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for sinne by effusion of bloud, for all bloud in the old testament was tipicall. Now as it looked to man, it signified. 1. That by carnall generation we were vncleane, and out of couenant with God. 2. That the faithfull haue interest in the blessed seede. 3. That our hearts must bee circumcised, by the painefull mortification of sinne, and the painefull casting away of sin, as a wretched foreskin: and that we should suffer affliction of spirit for sin, till our hearts were as sore, as were the <hi>Shechemites</hi> bodies. 4 That wee are adopted into Gods fauour and communion with Saints, and distinguished from all other men. 5. That all holinesse of life and forgiuenesse of sinne must be had in societie with the seede of <hi>Abraham.</hi> 6. That through bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the crosse the first fruites or our bloude should be readie to be offered for him that died for vs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The end of circumcision.</note>The ends why circumcision was appointed were, 1. To teach them by signification the things before mentioned. 2. To be as a sacrament initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie to let them into the Church. 3. To be a partition wall betweene them and the Gentiles, and as fetters to restraine them from societie with them. 4. To binde them to keepe the whole law <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3.</note>. 5. To be a seale both of the righteousnesse of faith <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</note> and of their right and possession of the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> as a tipe of heauen <note n="f" place="margin">

                        <p>There were three sorts of citizens in the old Church of the Iewes, Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, proselites and religious men. Isralites were of the seede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> those were bound to circumcision necessarily <note n="g" place="margin">
                              <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.12.14.</note>. Proselites, were Gentiles conuerted to the Iewish religion, those for the strengthning of their faith did subiect themselues also to circumcision and the ceremoniall law. Now there were certaine religious men of the Gentiles conuerted, and embraced the couenant of God, but were not subiect to circumcision: such were <hi>Naaman,</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> and others.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Why it was abolished.</note>Now this circumcision after the comming of Christ was abolished. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all effusion of bloud must cease when Christs bloud was shed. 2. The partition wall was now taken downe, and therefore there needed no signe of difference. 3. The priesthood was changed, and therefore the rites belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to it also. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But Christ himselfe is said to be the minister of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision<note n="i" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.</note>. <hi>Solut.</hi> That was true. 1. As he was giuen to the Iewes by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation to performe what was promised to their fathers. 2. He was a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster not of the law (which he abolished and fulfilled in his comming) but of the Iewes among whom he was conuersant: for he preached not to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. He was a minister of circumcision, that is, he was a Preacher among the Iewes, as <hi>Peter</hi> was the Apostle of circumcision. Thus of circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made with hands.</p>
                        <p>Now concerning circumcision made without hands, 5. things in this verse may be noted. 1. The persons circumcised, <hi>ye.</hi> 2. The time, <hi>are.</hi> 3.

the holy Ghost doth not only tell the thing, but explicate it by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons, as here. 4. The hard places of Scripture are Gods chests, wherein hee hides his treasure from wicked men. 5. God hereby prouides for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant nourishment of the faithfull, that though now they finde a sweet rellish in the word, yet if they come again to the same word, there is such depths in it, they may finde more food in it. 6. God somewhat aimes at the humbling of the proud heart of man, and will hereby make him see his wants, and many waies buffet him. 7. To excite in vs so much the more diligence. 8.

                        <p>Circumcision without hands is a wonderfull worke of the spirit of grace,<note place="margin">What circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands is.</note> wrought by the word vpon the members of Christ, vpon their receiuing into the mysticall bodie, by which corruption of nature is wounded, beloued sins cast away with sorrow, and the sinner receiued into an euerlasting commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God and his Saints. Now that there is such a worke as this in euery child of God, is apparant by these places of Scripture, Deut. 10.16. &amp; 30.6. Ier. 4.4. Rom. 2.26. and this text.</p>
                        <p>The first thing here to be considered is the persons both in themselues, <hi>ye,</hi> and in their relation to Christ, <hi>in whom,</hi> and to other gifts mentioned before, and imported in the word <hi>also.</hi>

There are three sorts of hearers in the Citie; Some wholy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, such as will mend nothing, nor like to heare of mending. Some open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sincere, professing constantly this circumcision without hands. A third sort, partaking of the properties of both the former: for they agree with the best in these things: 1. In the loue of the ministerie and Ministers that preach faithfully. 2. In the taste of the powers of the life to come, finding the word often of singular power, so as they receiue it with ioy and great admiration. 3. In the defence of the truth they seeme as forward as any: these are neere the kingdom of God, as the <hi>Scribe</hi> was; these are more then halfe perswaded, as <hi>Agrippa</hi> was; these are fired with desire many times to know what to doe to be saued, as the <hi>young man</hi> in the Gospell was; but alas all this brings them within the compasse of none of Gods promises: and if they looke not to it, fearefull apostacie will be the end of all this, and they may proue most spite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full aduersaries of the same ministerie they admired, and proud contemners of the same remorse, with which themselues were often smitten, and so their latter end be ten times worse then their beginning.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quest.</hi> But what doe these men want, or what are their defects, that they should not be right for all this, hauing such great affection to the word, yea euen when it is most sincerely taught?</p>

                           <hi>Answ:</hi> Alas there are diuers things too apparant in their estate. For first, they ioyne not themselues with such as feare God in fellowship in the Gospell. 2. They shunne by all meanes the crosse for righteousnesse sake. 3. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

not all Gods commandements: there are some sinnes they will not leaue: there are some corruptions they are so engaged vnto, that they wil at no hand leaue them. 4. Some of them forsake not the very sinnes they seem to detest and sometimes to cry out against; they cry out vpon swearing, and yet (vile beasts as they are) they will sweare still, yea and that most fearefully, yea after many remorses of conscience for it. 5. They will not be perswaded to vse all Gods ordinances: indeed they heare constantly, and to any mans thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, with great attention, but they pray not in their families, they will not vse the help of conference, they read not the scriptures with any order or consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp;c. 6. You see they are not carefull of their companie, they neither shun the appearance nor the occasions of euill, they giue not ouer their going, nor their resort vnto vngodly companie. 7. They haue not been truly humbled by godly sorrow for their sinne. Lastly, they haue sinceritie in respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; in some they like it, in others they doe not like it. they <hi>loue not all the Saints.</hi>

He rests in the worke done, he beares himselfe vpon the externall worke of holines: he serued God, for he was at Church: he is regenerated, for he was baptised; hee hath praied to God, for he stretched out his hands. 2. His praise is of men and not of God. 3. He wholie neglects the power of godlinesse and the exercises thereof. 4 He is disordered in his life laden with iniquitie. 5 He is senselesse or incorrigible vnder publicke iudgements. 6. He vsuallie op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth and persueth him that is <hi>borne after the spirit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. We may note here that God is not tied to meanes, he can worke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands. What is then the estate of wicked men? no hands of men or angels can make them happie, it is a worke done without hands. Oh how honorable is the worke of mortification of a sinner? it was a glorious worke to make those huge heauens, and this mightie earth without hands: such is the glorie of our spirituall circumcision: wee see also here how little beholding the kingdome of Christ is to this world: their hands will not be gotten to set it vp, God must doe it without hands. Lastly we should learne in all estates to liue by faith and rest vpon God, whether in affliction or tentation or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of sinne, though we see not meanes, yet let this comfort vs God can helpe vs without hands.

That we must mortifie it, by confession of sinne, and godly sorrow, with strong cries calling vpon God for helpe against it. 4. That we must search the records of Gods promises, and by faith lay hold vpon him. For till we can shew a better draught of happinesse then the flesh doth, we do in vaine go about to charme it. 5. We must silence it: not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to obiect, or excuse, or extenuate, or denie.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto in generall of the flesh and the mortification of it. Now more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially we must consider here, 1. the matter to be mortified, viz. the <hi>body of sinnes.</hi> 2. The manner, in the words <hi>put of.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sinnes</hi>] Two things may be here noted; the one is implied, the other is exprest: that which is implied is, that God doth not require this circumcision in other things but only in sinnes. 1. Regeneration doth not oppose the flesh in the substance of it: we are not required to cut off any parts of the body, nor to destroy any faculties of the soule; and the same I say of the complexion or constitution of the bodie, it doth not require the melancholie man should be made sanguin. 2. This circumcision reacheth not to the naturall desires of the flesh, I meane such as are needfull to the being of nature, as to eate, sleepe &amp;c. 3. Nor to the morrall proiects. 4. Nor to the remainders of spirituall light, as sparkles of Gods Image. 5. Nor to the outward necessary helpes of life, as horse, land, friends &amp;c. only it restraines those when they are hinderances to godlinesse. The vse is therefore wisely to discerne between the meere naturall defects arising from the constitution of our bodies, and the sinnes and disorders of our soules: for this spirituall circumcision will not cure mens bodies, but only sanctifies mens mindes.</p>
                        <p>Againe, we should learne of God here how to deale with our enemies: he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:21380:133"/>
distinguisheth between nature and the sinne of nature: so should we; wee should oppose their sinnes, but loue their persons.</p>
                        <p>The second thing here to be noted, is, that our sinnes are from the flesh: yea if the flesh did not by defect, action, approbation or consent, giue way to sinne, the deuill and the world could fasten no sinne vpon vs. Diuers persons should be informed herein: when they fall into grieuous euill, they cry out of their ill lucke, or of ill councell, or ill companie, or of the deuill; but they should indeed cry out of their owne ill nature, for the rest could not haue hurt them, but by the wickednes of their owne disposition: and wee should all grow suspitious of the flesh and his motions, reasons, desires, &amp;c. and in time to mortifie her with all her lusts.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bodie of sinnes</hi>] He saith not onely that there are sinnes in the flesh, but a bodie of sinnes: that is, a huge masse or lumpe of sinnes, linked together as the members of our bodie are. The sins of the fleshly may be called a bodie in diuers respects.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In respect of that harmonie and vnion of sinnes one with another in practise, so as if one sinne be practised, many will accompanie it: as in <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, the sinne was to eat the forbidden fruit; but that would not be alone, but was attended with doubting of Gods word, with faith in the deuill, with most in ordinate pride or desire to be like God, with discontentment with their present condition, with vile ingratitude, with apostacie from all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, with prophanation of the sacrament, with wilfull murther of all their posteritie, and euill concupiscence. <hi>Cain</hi> was angry that God did not accept his prophane sacrifice: but would this sinne be alone? no, for there followes it the hatred of his brother, the falling of his countenance, the reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of Gods admonition, coloured hypocrisie, murther, and blasphemie. When desire of gaine infects the hearts of Trades-men, we see by experience, it will not be alone, a number of transgressions growes with it, as loue of the world more then God, neglect of sinceritie in the vse of Gods ordinances, swearing, breach of Sabboth, rigorous dealing with inferiours, vnmercifulne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> to the poore, selling by false weights and measures, vsurie, if not otherwise yet in selling time, deceit, lying, oppression by ingrossing of wares or incroaching vpon the trades of others.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In respect of vnion in continuance after they are committed, thy sinnes committed vanish not, but by adding sinne vnto sinne, thou makest vp a very bodie of sinne, and so in Gods sight they stand compacted together as the very limbes of a monster.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. These sinnes may be called a bodie, because they are committed by the bodie, as the externall meanes of them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The masse of sinne in the fleshly man may be called a bodie of sinnes, for that it hath many things like vnto the bodie of man: or many compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may be taken from the bodie of a man to expresse the sinnes of the flesh. As the bodie of man is a faire substance made of base matter:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Similes.</hi>
                           </note> so sinne in it selfe is most vile, though it be coloured ouer by the deuill or the world with the faire proportion of profit or pleasure. And as there be many members in the bodie, so there are in the sinne of the fleshly man: as some members in the bodie are outward, some inward, so are our sins. As men would be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of their bodies, were it not for their clothing, especially if there be any deformitie: so would men of their sinnes, were it not for their great places, or faire excuses, and wretched shifts they haue to hide their deformities. And as the bodie of the prisoner in a dungeon is alike a true bodie, with his that sitteth on the throne: so sinnes that are secret, that are neuer so closely committed, are sinnes, as well as such as are openly done. As his bodie is a true bodie, that yet wants a legge or an arme: so it is in some, though they be not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21380:134"/>
or adulterers, yet they may haue a bodie of sinne in them. As the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bodie cannot liue, if you take away food and clothing: so neither would sinne, if we did not loue it, approue it, defend it, excuse it, and if wee take away carnall reason and ill companie. And as the bodie of Princes is better clad, then the bodies of poore men, yet it is alike, a bodie of clay and corruption: so are the sinnes of great men, though men doe not speake so openly of them.</p>

                           </note>Now for vse of all. First, here we may see a difference between the sinnes of the regenerate, and the sinnes of the vnregenerate: in the godly after cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, there is not a bodie of sinnes, the nest of sinne is scattered, sinne is not in his full strength, he doth not giue his <hi>members as seruants to vnrighteousnes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, here men may try the truth of their repentance, that is not true repentance, that mortifies some one or few sinnes, but that which mortifieth a whole bodie of sinnes.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, this shewes the greatnes of Gods mercies, that can forgiue or take away a whole bodie of sinnes and transgressions.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, this may be a great comfort to afflicted consciences, that cry out of the multitude of their sinnes: if thy sinnes were as many as the ioynts of thy bodie, and as strong as the bodie of <hi>Goliah,</hi> yet the Lord can forgiue, and true repentance will pull them downe. This is the matter to be mortified, the manner followes.</p>

                           <hi>Put off</hi>] Sinne must be put off as the begger puts off his raggs, and as the Master puts off his false seruant, and as the porter puts off his burden, and as the husband puts off his vitious wife, and as the serpent puts off his skin.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">4. Things in mortification.</note>There are foure things in mortification distinct. The first is the dislike of sinne: the second is the confession of sinne: the third is the godly sorrow for sinne: the fourth is forsaking of sinne; this last is here meant, by putting off of sinne: and this the Lord stands vpon, as a thing he will neuer dispense with the want of it: as these places shew, Prou. 28.13. Esay 55.8. Ier. 7.3.4. Esay 1.16.17. Psal. 119.9. Ephes. 4.22. &amp;c. 1. Pet. 4.1.2.3.4.

                           <hi>Quest.</hi> But can the flesh be so mortified, and sinne so put off, that it shall cease to be any more in this life?<note place="margin">What the flesh doth in the godly.</note> 
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> No, for euen in the children of God, the flesh will raise infirmities, it will let the vnderstanding, it will be framing euill thoughts, it will lust against the spirit, it will not alwaies allow what good is done, or to be done; it will present euill, when good is to be done; it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell against the law of the minde, yea sometimes the soule of the poore sinner is led captiue for a time, by his imperious flesh.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Q.</hi> But how can it then be said to be put away? <hi>Answ.</hi> Sinne is put away, first if it <hi>reigne not,</hi>

It is put away, if men take <hi>no care to fulfill the lusts of it.</hi> Secondly, if there be a constant combat in some degree against it: if we finde a striuing, and constant fighting against the corruptions of our nature: if we pray against it, iudge our selues for it, and mourne ouer it, with an vnfeined desire to forsake it: this desire to be put off, is one true degree of forsaking of sinne.</p>

                           <hi>By the circumcision of Christ</hi>] There is a twofold circumcision of Christ.<note place="margin">A twofold circumcision of Christ.</note> First, that which he suffered in himselfe.

                           <hi>Quest.</hi> But why was Christ circumcised,<note place="margin">Why Christ was circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> seeing there was no cause of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision in Christ: for nothing could be signified by it, seeing he was the Messias himselfe, perfect God and man, nor was there any impuritie in him, the amputation whereof should thereby be signified, he was a Lambe without spot, a high Priest separate from sinners, the couenant of the promised seede was in himfulfilled, and he came to abolish circumcision: and lastly, tis hee that circumciseth the hearts of others?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Christ was circumcised, thereby to shew himselfe to be true man. 2. thereby to honour the institution of circumcision, as he had done other parts of the Law. 3. that the Iewes might not cauill, and say, they would not receiue an vncircumcised Christ. 4. to commend the vertue of obedience by his example. 5. that he might beare the burthens of them, that being vnder the law, were not able to beare the burthens of the law: God by this signe as by an imitating rite, did subiect him to the law, he hereby professing himselfe a seruant to the law to make vs free. 6. hee was circumcised and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to signifie his vnion with both Churches, both of the old and new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, hee was circumcised, that our hearts, by the vertue of it, might be circumcised: for as his death killeth sinne in vs, and his resurrection raiseth vs vp to newnesse of life, so doth his circumcision, circumcise our hearts.</p>
                        <p>Hence we may gather comfort against the difficulties of mortification, for Christ will be pleased to deriue vertue from his owne circumcision: yea it is a pledge to assure vs, that as certainly as he was circumcised himselfe, so he will see to it, that our hearts be circumcised: if wee will cast our selues vpon him, and by faith come vnto him, there is no sinne so linked, but in Christ we may haue some deliuerance from it. On the other side, it shewes the miserie of all such, as liue in the loue of their sinnes, and minde not mortification: this shewes they are not in Christ yet, for they cannot be in Christ, except they be circumcised. Lastly, it may serue for instruction at once to all that hope for freedom in Iesus Christ, to shew the proofe of their interest by their circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion spiritually; and to speake distinctly of it, we must vnderstand that the Lord, that requires this circumcision of vs, extends his precept, both to the heart <note n="*" place="margin">

Now for our eares, they must be circumcised, 1. in the vnpreparednes, or want of attention in hearing the word. 2. in receiuing tales. 3. in communicating with the sinnes of others, by a willing hearing of their wickednesse.

                        <p>In the former verse the Apostle hath laid downe the first reason, and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted it principally against Iudaisme: we haue spirituall circumcision in Christ, and therefore we need not carnall circumcision, and so by consequent none of the ceremoniall law. Now in this verse he meeteth with obiections.</p>

                           <hi>Ob:</hi> 1.

                        <p>
                           <hi>Buried together with him</hi>] Three things may here be noted. 1. the buriall of Christ. 2. the buriall of the Christian. 3. the vnion of both. For the first, that Christ was buried, was storied by the Euangelist <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ioh</hi> 19.</note>, and fore-signified by <hi>Ionas</hi> as a type <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.39.40.</note>, and fore-prophecied of by <hi>Esay</hi> the Prophet <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Esay</hi> 53.9.</note>: he was buried in Ierusalem, the place where the dying sacrifices had giuen warning of his death, but it was without the Citie, both to answer the type, Leuit. 16. and to signifie that his sufferings belonged to Gentiles, as well as to Iewes: Hee was buried in Caluarie, the place commonly appointed for condemned men (and not in Hebron, where some thinke <hi>Adam</hi> was buried) to note that his death was to be auaileable for the condemned men of <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as for <hi>Adam</hi> himselfe. He was buried in another mans graue, to signifie that he died for other mens sinnes.</p>
                        <p>Now for the second, viz. the buriall of Christians; they may be said to be buried euen whiles they liue (for of the buriall of the bodie he cannot meane here) in diuers respects.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In respect of disgrace and reproch: the throats of wicked men are often <hi>an open sepulchre</hi> 
                           <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.</note>, into which if the names of the godly fall, they are buried for the extremitie of disgrace and reproch with which they couer them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In respect of <hi>abnegation,</hi> or the deniall of the loue and care for earthly things: and so we are buried to the world, when like dead men we care not for it, but deuote our selues to the contemplation of heauenly things.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In respect of <hi>mortification</hi> of our sinnes: the scripture by diuers meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors expresseth the diuers degrees of mortification. For first there is the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21380:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wounding of sinne, when the sinner is pricked with remorse by the law. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the condemning of sinne, when the sinner keeping a spirituall assise, doth examine, confesse, and iudge himselfe guiltie before the Lord. Thirdly, the crucifying of sinnes, when the sinner racks his owne soule by godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, driuing in the nailes of Gods threatnings, with acknowledgment of his owne deserts, and restraining his flesh through a spirituall reuenge, not caring to expose himselfe to the shame of the world, so that in Christ hee may finde atonement for his sinnes. Fourthly, the killing of sinne, when the sinner puts off the bodie of sinnes, and forsaketh his euill waies. Now then after this followeth the last degree,<note place="margin">Of the buriall of sinne.</note> and that is here the <hi>buriall of sinnes.</hi> Certainly there remaines euen after true repentance in the very godly, a great deale of hidden corruption of nature, inward wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drings, &amp; distractions after the world, sudden euill propositions against God, or his word, or prouidence, or presence, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, or peoplei; mpatience, secret pride, and somtimes hypocrisie; a frequent rebellion within against good duties, vnthankfulnes, frequent omissions, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther of holy duties, or the care of the power of them, hastines, or anger, impure desires, thoughts of reuenge, besides a great deale of disorder he may finde in desires, thoughts of reuenge, besides a great deale of disorder he may finde in himselfe both at home and abroad. Now it is not enough, nor may he rest in the former repentance, but he must proceed euen to the remoouing of these remainders of corruption: death commonly ariseth out of the disease of someone part, but buriall couers all. The worke of reformation and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, many times begins at the care of some few principall sinnes: but wee must neuer be quiet, till we burie the whole old man with his works; so that in one sense, the buriall of sinnes, is nothing else, but the progresse of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Againe, after we haue forsaken our sinnes, to burie them, is to keep a diligent watch ouer our nature, and to take downe our flesh, yea sometimes with refraining of lawfull delights or pleasures. Further the buriall of sinne, it may import our care, after we haue left our sinnes, to remoue them out of sight; both out of Gods sight, by suing out our pardon, and out of the sight of our consciences, by quieting them in the application of the bloud of Christ, and the promises of grace, and out of the sight of others (so farre as our sinnes were scandalous also) by shewing forth our repentance, and care to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide all appearance and occasions of like sinning.<note place="margin">Their priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that haue attained to the buriall of sinne.</note> Great is the glory and happinesse of Christians, that haue attained to this buriall of sinne, for these serue God in a neere acquaintance with him, these haue <hi>ouercome the world,</hi> these can <hi>stand</hi> before <hi>death</hi> and <hi>iudgment</hi> vnapalled, these are mightie in the <hi>power</hi> of Gods ordinance, these know <hi>the secrets of the kingdome of God,</hi> these are without the reach of the <hi>Law,</hi> and feele not the sting of crosses, these are had in singular honour with God, and the holy Angells of heauen, and the prouidence of God is vsually eminent towards these. Now for the third, might someone say,<note place="margin">How our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall buriall depends vpon Christ.</note> what hath the Christians buriall to doe with Christ, how is there any relation between them? <hi>Answ.</hi> Our spirituall buriall in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse of mortification depends vpon Christ diuers waies. 1. In that he hath required and made gratious promises to it. 2. In that the efficacie of the meanes by which it is wrought, comes from Christ. 3. In that it is accepted of God onely for Christ and through his intercession. 4. In respect of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he was buried as well as we. But chiefly in respect of vertue, our buriall of sinne is wrought by a vertue arising from Christs buriall in the graue.</p>

                        <p>Secondlie for instruction, to be carefull to bury our sinnes: but here take heed of the dissimilitude,<note place="margin">Dissimilitude in two things.</note> for in some things the comparison cannot hold: as here in two things; for first when we bury the bodies of our friends, we bury them in hope they shal rise againe And secondly we mourne because we must part with them: but both these must be denied here. It is the propertie of the wicked, to part with their sinnes with sorrow, because they must leaue them: or else with hope that at length they may returne to them againe. But let all such as feare God be otherwise minded:<note place="margin">Note this rule</note> especiallie let vs learne from this comparison of buriall to aduantage our selues in what we may in mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: if the master be buried, we know all his seruants will attend the funerall: so is it with vs in the mortification of sinnes,<note place="margin">Similitudes.</note> if wee light vpon the master sins and drag them to the graue, we shall be sure of all the attendants, they will follow to the funerall.

                        <p>Now in respect of pietie to God, it is a very resurrection through the power of Christ, to bring a man to acknowledge God, and his truth, and glory, against reason, profite, or pleasure; to make a man <hi>walke with God, setting the Lord alwaies before him:</hi> to bring the will of man to a holy subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Gods will, in crosses, temptations, wants &amp;c.

                        <p>And howsoeuer in the matter of holy duties, there are strange imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the very godly, yet their desire, prayer, purpose, and indeuour, is to approue themselues to God herein, and they do attaine to it, in some comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table beginnings, and they go on with a holy increase, both of strength and desire.

Neither ought their terrors to amaze them: for it is Christs manner, to bring vs downe to the graue, that he may raise vs vp: the feare of hell now afflicteth thee, that thou maist not be hurt hereafter.

Againe, we see we haue not comfort of our baptisme, till the power of holinesse in some measure appeare in our liues.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, for instruction: we should all examine our selues whether wee haue faith or no; and whiles we haue meanes of assurance, make vse of all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages to settle our hearts in the faith: and to this end we should deliuer vp our soules to be nursed vp in the words of faith and wholesome doctrine.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, we might here be greatly comforted, if we had true faith; wee see God can denie nothing vnto faith: it should be to vs, in the sacraments, in mortification,<note n="3" place="margin">Rules if we would reason for Gods power to the effect.</note> and in graces and duties, according to our faith.</p>

                           <hi>Of the operation of God.</hi>] The doctrine of Gods power and working, is of singular vse in the Church; great is the interest of Gods seruants in his power, and therefore great cause they haue to rest vpon it. The elect onely can reason for Gods power to the effect: he is able to doe it, therefore he will doe it: but then these three things must be noted.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. They must be beleeuers, that looke for this priuiledge. 2. They must bring a particular faith, to draw out this power of God into operation. 3.

                        <p>The sixt reason of the dehortation is conteined in this verse, and it stands thus; That which cannot helpe vs when we are in miserie, nor further vs to happinesse when we want it, is not to be followed nor rested vpon; but such things are philosophie, traditions, and ceremonies, they cannot heale the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our natures, nor raise vs out of the graues of sinne, nor any way procure vs the pardon of our transgressions; or thus, If in Christ we be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from the power of our sinnes by his quickning grace, and from the guilt of them, by the free pardon which is to be had by his meanes, then wee need not goe any whither else, neither to philosophie nor traditions, &amp;c. but so it is, and so the very Colossians found it in their case, as the words of the text expresse, <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The words in themselues expresse the twofold estate of Christians in this world, what they are by nature in their vnregenerate estate, and what they are by grace in the state of grace.</p>
                        <p>In the state of corruption two things are true of them, and are true of all men, 1. They were dead in actuall sinnes. 2. They were then in the vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision of the flesh, and likewise dead in it. In their estate of grace he puts them in minde of two benefits, 1. Regeneration. 2. Remission of sinnes.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the coherence and order of the words.</p>
                        <p>Diuers things may be noted in the generall.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. We may from hence be informed of the fruitlesnes of philosophie, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions or ceremonies, of <hi>Moses,</hi> they cannot make a miserable man happie, they cannot infuse the least sparke of spirituall life into any.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We see the Apostle thinks it meet to put men often in minde of their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:21380:139"/>
miserie by nature, and great reason, for it exalts the praise of the <hi>riches of Gods grace in Christ:</hi> And it may serue to humble men for their falls after calling, and to keep them still suspitious and watchfull ouer a nature, that hath been so prone to sinne and securitie in sinning; it may serue to eat down the prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our nature to vaine boasting, and confidence in the flesh; and it should much excite men to the loue and care of godlinesse and pietie, with all life and power, seeing they haue been so long slaues to sinne.</p>
                        <p>And lastly, the Apostle rips vp this matter of purpose to withdraw their mindes from traditions, and philosophicall dreames.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Dead in sinnes</hi>] They were dead in sinnes, both if you respected their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like estate, or each particular person. If you looke vpon publike states before they are framed and reformed by the word, what are they but heaps of men dead in the graues of sinne, and senselesse in their sinfull courses? and thus it is with euery particular person, the words import that he is guiltie of many sinnes,<note place="margin">The swarmes of sinnes in vnregenerate men.</note> and he is dead in them also. Naturally euery man is guiltie of secret atheisticall conceits, of vnbeleefe, of ignorance, of hardnes of heart, of swarms of euill thoughts and affections, of hurtfull passions and lusts, besides his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the knowledge of God, and that warmth of the holy affections of loue, feare, trust, and ioy in God. Who can sufficiently rip open the vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, lukewarmenes, hypocrisie, inconstancie, and presumptuous profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that is in our hearts by nature, in matters of Gods seruice? how do men daily offend, either by not calling vpon the name of God, or by taking it vp in vaine? who can number the othes, lyes, reproches, curses, flatteries, and filthy communication hath and did daily infect the mouths of men? Oh the world of sinnes wee are actually guilty of against God, or men, or our owne selues, publike, priuate, secret, open, inward, outward, in prosperitie and aduersitie, in the Church or familie, or abroad in mens conuersation. Alas we can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne but a glimpse of that sinne and guiltinesse that is in vs by nature, and this is the increase of their miserie in all their sinnes, they are dead in them.</p>

                           <note place="margin">What spiritual death in sin is.</note>The spirituall death in sinne is an vnutterable losse of the life of God, by which the sinner is senselesse, and carelesse in extremitie of miserie, vnto his owne euerlasting ruine, if the Lord preuent it not by regeneration. Now that men are in this case by nature, these Scriptures proue, Eph. 2.1.2. Math 8.22. Ioh. 8.25. Rom. 8.10. Luk. 15.32. Reuel. 3 2. Iud. 12. 1. Tim. 5.6. Neither let any deceiue themselues, about their estate, for a man may be dead in sinne, and yet be aliue in the flesh: yea thou maiest be a <hi>wise man</hi> in the flesh <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom</hi> 8.7.</note>, or <hi>a prince of this world</hi>

                        <p>Now this spirituall senselesnes is called a death, because it is a priuation of spirituall life from the soule, as the naturall death is from the bodie. 2. because it tends to eternall death.</p>
                        <p>The vse may be fourefold. 1. For information; No wonder wicked men can come and goe from the word of God, and not be touched, alas they are dead men: and so is it with them in respect of the iudgments of God; alas if thou couldest rowle a mountaine, vpon a dead man, he would not feele, so
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:21380:139"/>
is it with a man dead in sinne; and further we may here obserue, that to liue yea to die quietly, is no signe of a man in a happie case: for if this death in sin be not cured, thousands of people may die quietly, because they die senseleslie; they feele no more of the feare of hell, or iudgment, or Gods anger, then if they were already dead in their bodies, they would feele outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities: I know that God many times can lay terror vpon the flesh of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, and make their spirits drinke in, of the bitter anguish arising from the feruencie of Gods burning displeasure; but I say if God let them alone, vsually the most would die in a wretched senselesnes, and inconsideration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither able nor willing to entertaine the thoughts of what must presently and necessarily befall them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This may serue for confutation; and so 1. of the Papists about their freewill. How can there be this free will in a dead soule? we are dead in sin, and therefore of our selues mooue not vnto life, till God quicken vs by his word and spirit. 2.

                        <p>Their miserie in respect of originall sinne, is exprest in these words,

                        </p>
                        <p>These words be diuersly interpreted; some thus, In the vncircumcision of the flesh, that is, in the flesh which is vncircumcision, that is a thing hatefull vnto God. Some make these words to be the signe of their death in sinne: as if he would say, your very vncircumcision that is in your flesh (which are Gentiles) is a token that you are strangers from the life of God. Some thus; And you hath hee quickned, which were dead in respect of your sinnes and carnall life, which ye liue in the vncircumcision, that is, in your estate of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilisme. Some make these words expresse the cause of their death in sinne: Thus in the vncircumcision of the flesh, that is, for your fleshly vices which caused that death in sinne. But I thinke with those that vnderstand by the flesh originall sinne, and by the vncircumcision, their miserie in respect of it, implied in the allusion to the circumcision literally taken.</p>
                        <p>Originall sinne is called flesh,<note place="margin">Why originall sinne is called flesh.</note> because the flesh is the instrument by which it is propagated. 2. Because it is the subiect in which it is. 3. Because it is the end it driues vs to, viz. to satisfie the flesh and to seeke fleshly things.</p>
                        <p>This originall sinne here called flesh,<note place="margin">What original sinne is.</note> is a spirituall kinde of disease, gall, leauen and poyson, which daily diffuseth it selfe throughout the whole man, and still infecteth it: though this be not the whole nature of the sinne; for to speake distinctly,<note n="3" place="margin">Things in originall sin.</note> in originall sinne there are three things, 1.

Oh what cause haue ciuill honest men to know, that though they come to Church, and pay euery man his owne, and be no drunkards nor adulterers &amp;c. yet their case cannot be good, for though they liued neuer so honestly outwardly, yet the very vncircumcision of the flesh, makes them miserable; the inward corruption of nature, is an abomination to God, who <hi>searcheth the heart and reines</hi>: yea what cause haue all men to be humbled and abased in themselues, considering how vncleane a beginning they haue? how can men be so quiet, and yet be so diseased, with so filthy a leprosie, as is originall sinne? if this disease were in the bodie as it is in the soule, how would men lament their distresse?</p>
                        <p>Hence also may we see what a wofull estate all wicked men are in, that take <hi>care for the lusts</hi> of this leprous <hi>flesh,</hi> and <hi>sow to it.</hi> What should I say? may we not see hence the necessitie of regeneration? assuredly <hi>except we be borne againe, we can neuer enter into the kingdom of heauen</hi>: this impure poysoned na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ours, may not enter into Gods holy place.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. That God doth certainly forgiue men their sinnes, when he giues them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <p n="2">2. That where God forgiues our sinnes, he heales our natures too, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quickning and forgiuing are here ioyned together; and herein Gods pardons differs from all the pardons of Kings. Men may forgiue the treason or fellony, but they cannot giue a nature that will offend no more, but now it God forgiue a man, he will certainely giue his good spirit to mend his nature, and clense him from his sinne.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That howsoeuer iustification go before sanctification, yet it is sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion first appeares, therefore quickning first named.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That it is a singular happinesse to obtaine of God the forgiuenesse of our sinnes.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That if we were vsed according to our deserts, God must neuer forgiue vs, it is his free grace.</p>
                        <p>The vse of all may be first for great reproofe of the generall carelessenes of the most men, that will take no paines at all to get the pardon of their sinnes, but wholie neglect the seeking of the assurance of it. Now this monstrous neglect of so admirable a benefit comes first from ignorance: men know not their wofull miserie in respect of their sinnes. 2.

Againe, this neglect ariseth from the forgetfulnesse of mans latter end, if men knew the time of the day of the Lord, they would get their pardon confirmed if it were possible, least it should come vpon them vnawares. Lastly, this comes from the loue of sinne, men are loath to leaue their sinnes, and therefore not carefull to seeke forgiuenesse of them.</p>

                        <p>This Verse and the next containe the seuenth reason of the dehortation, it is laid downe in this verse and amplified in the next. The argument may stand thus: If the ceremonies were a <hi>Chyrographe</hi> or hand-writing against vs, when they were in force, and if now Christ haue cancelled that writing, then we ought not to vse them againe; but such they were, for they were a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing against vs, and Christ hath remoued them by fastening them vpon the crosse, therefore we ought not to reuiue them againe: or thus, it the debt be paid and the obligation cancelled, then is it a fond course to cause the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation wilfullie to be of force againe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hand-writing</hi>] This hand-writing is by diuers diuersly referred, for some thinke it is to be referred to the couenant with <hi>Adam</hi>; all mankinde in him was bound to God, this obligation he brake and so the forfeiture, lay still vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our necks till Christ paid the debt, and cancelled the obligation. Some referre it to the law of Moses in generall, and say the people did binde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto it, Exod. 14 by the rites there vsed. This bond was forfeited by the Iewes and lay vpon them. Some referre it to the morrall law in speciall, and therein we did enter into bond which was called the couenant of works: the rigor and curse of this law lieth vpon all mankinde, and when God sues out this bond men are carried to prison, euen to the prison of hell. Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it to the conscience of men, and say that an euill conscience is a <hi>Chyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphe,</hi> a bill of debt, and it accuseth by ordinances, that is, it taketh conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions from the law of God to arrest, or condemne the sinner. But most vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie it is referred to the ceremoniall law, by some of them men did enter into bond, as by circumcision, so saith the Apostle, he <hi>that is circumcised</hi> is <hi>bound to keepe the whole law,</hi> Gal. 5.5. By others of them men made bills of debt, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision confesseth corruption of nature by propagation. The washings were open confessions of the foulenesse of our liues; in the sacrifices men subscribed to their owne death and damnation: for they confessed they had deserued to die in steed of the beast.</p>
                        <p>The words may be true of all, but most principally of the ceremoniall law. In generall he here intreateth of deliuer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>nce from the ceremonies of <hi>Moses,</hi> then, two things may in particular be noted, 1. What the ceremonies were in themselues. 2. The manner or meanes how the Church was discharged of them. For the 1. if we require what they were? They were 1. for honor, <hi>ordinances</hi> of God. 2. for vse, <hi>hand-writings.</hi> 3. for effect they were <hi>against vs,</hi> or contrary to vs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ordinances</hi>] Some read <hi>for ordinances,</hi> some read <hi>by ordinances,</hi> some <hi>with ordinances,</hi> and some <hi>of ordinances.</hi> They that read <hi>for ordinances,</hi> say the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing was for ordinances, that is, either in fauor of the decrees that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21380:142"/>
vs, or for the better assureing of the keeping of the ordinances; it was <hi>by ordinances</hi> viz. euangelicall, for they say the decrees of Christ did euacuate the lawes of <hi>Moses.</hi> They that read <hi>with ordinances,</hi> say that the hand-writing was the debt of death which Christ tooke away with the ordinance; that is the externall rites and rudiments of <hi>Moses.</hi> But I thinke the sense is cleere as it is here rendred <hi>of ordinances.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And so the point to be obserued is, that the ceremonies imposed vpon the Iewes were Gods ordinances, which may shew vs that God did take vpon him the right to binde the conscience, of men, by ceremonies. 2. Seeing Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are freed from them by God himselfe, therefore the Apostle would haue them stand to their libertie. 3. This should exalt the praise of the morrall law; if they were bound to obserue the very ceremonies because they were Gods ordinances, then much more should wee bee carefull to keepe the morrall.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Hand-writings</hi>] This word notes their vse, because men are by nature wonderfull slow to acknowledge their misery, therefore the Lord in all ages did driue men vnder their hands as it were openly to make profession of their owne sin-guiltinesse and fall, that so Gods iustice might be clered: Therefore were the sacrifices required presently after the fall; and baptisme now is of like nature to shew vs our naturall vncleannesse, that need to be washed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Against vs</hi>] In effect they were against vs. The ceremonies were against vs, that is against the Iewes 4. waies, 1. As they were bills of debt. 2. As they told the longing wife that her husband was long after to come. 3. As they proclaimed God infinitely hating sinne, so as he must haue attonement in bloud and that daily. 4. As they were transgressed in respect of the right manner of obseruing them.</p>
                        <p>Now though these ceremonies belong not to vs Christians, yet we are in the same debt by nature, that they were, though wee haue not that way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing our debt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quest.</hi> But how could that which God commanded them to do be against them? <hi>Answ.</hi> Many waies, 1. When they failed in the matter, as when they offered strange fire or sacrificed their sonnes. 2. When they did anger God by omissions, or delaies, as when <hi>Moses</hi> tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>led out the circumcision of his sonne. 3. When they did it for wrong ends, as when the whore would sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to colour her whoredomes, Pro. 5. or when men did thinke thereby to make amends for their sinnes, Ier. 7. or when they vsed them for the hurt of Gods children, as <hi>Balaam</hi> vsed his sacrifice. 4. When they mingle their owne inuentions with Gods ordinances; and their feare towards God was taught by the precepts of men. 5. When they did vse them, as a burthen, and it was a wearinesse to them. Lastly, when they that vsed them were wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, and did vse them without knowledge, or faith, or repentance for their sinnes, or the care of the due manner, as many places of scripture shew. And thus may the very law of God be against vs still, aswell as against them.</p>
                        <p>The vse of all this cheifly may be to shew, the miserie of euery impenitent sinner, his sinnes are vpon record, there is the hand-writing against him, let him looke vpon sacrificing Iewes, and there he may behold man daily in effect saying thus. Thus must it be done to the man that repenteth not of his sins, the obligation lies forfeited, and the Lord may call vpon him for his debt of 10000. talents when he hath not a farthing to pay, and then he will be cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prison.</p>
                        <p>Againe when he saith [<hi>vs</hi>] he shewes that this is the estate of all men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, there was a hand-writing against the very Apostle himselfe, and such as were in the visible Church, therefore he saith against vs. Thus of what the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:21380:143"/>
ceremonies were in themselues. Now of the discharge from them, there two things may be noted, 1. The manner, <hi>Christ put them out, tooke them away, fastned them.</hi> 2. The meanes, viz. <hi>the Crosse.</hi> The summe is, that Christ Iesus by his sufferings on the Crosse, paid our debt, and freed vs from the hand-writing that was against vs; the anger of God conceiued against vs, for the forfeiture, was thereon by the bloud of Christ appeased <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom</hi> 5.9.</note>, and forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes and debts, therein merited <note n="b" place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.7.</note>; And by the bloud of Iesus, the faithfull ouercome the deuill <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Reuel.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.28.</note>, that had power to destroy, by reason of the forfeiture; and because none of the former agreements would serue by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of mans weaknes, therefore God makes a new couenant, and seales it by the bloud of Christ vpon the Crosse <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Zach</hi> 9.11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.18.</note>; and if we would be assured of our release, in particular, First, for the forfeiture in Paradice, we receiue an atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the bloud of Christ <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 11.12.17.</note>; And he that from the curse in Paradice had power ouer death, was now by Christ destroyed <note n="f" place="margin">

For information; we may see what a case sinne sets vs in by nature, and how hatefull the nature of sinne is: if wee haue any thing to doe with God, why our sinnes lie like so many blocks in our way, and Christ Iesus only can lift them out of the way; and can our wretched hearts delight in sinne, seeing they nailed Christ to the Crosse? It is an easie thing to rent an obligation amongst men, but it was not so easie, to get ours cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, it could be rent in no place, but on the Crosse, Christ Iesus himselfe must be fastned to the tree, that he might fasten our cancelled hand-writing therto: and if God spared not his owne Sonne, when he came about this businesse of cancelling the hand-writing, what thinke we shall be the case of all wicked men, that die in their sinnes, and must suffer the whole forfeiture to fall on their necks? if what Christ endured on the Crosse were so painefull, they must not thinke to escape. Hence also we may see what wonderfull cause we haue to loue the Lord Iesus, that hath done all this for vs, Oh how precious should his memorie be amongst vs? Finally, here the faithfull should gather singular comfort against the law, sinne, death and hell, seeing here they may be informed all these were nayled vpon the crosse, and Christ hath openly declared that he hath cancelled whatsoeuer might be to shew against vs, for any forfeiture or debt of ours whatsoeuer; And shall not wee take heed of running in debt againe, by sinning, after the sprinkling of the bloud of Iesus Christ? or shall wee wretchedly binde our selues to the law againe, by plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our iustification before God by the works of the law?</p>

from the ceremoniall Law, as is before declared) mightily conquered by Christ; and therefore to reuiue againe the ceremonies, was to renue the bond, and to stand still in danger of the deuills executions.</p>
                        <p>The words are a most portly and deep allegorie, and they carrie newes of a remarkable victorie: the battell was fierce, cruell, prodigiously difficult, bloudie on the best side, and if Christ had been a iote lesse then he was, there had been no remedie,<note place="margin">Newes of a strange victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> nor hope. The battell was first fought between Sathan and man, with a depth of fraud and crueltie and hellish inuisible spight: the day was lost, man with the wofull issues of the conquest, was either cast downe wallowing in bloud, or scattered with pursuing crueltie: no sooner sprouting in the life of nature, but smitten with the venome of spirituall infection, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued with the bondage of more then cruell seruitude, not pittied, not helped: more forfeitures laid vpon him then he could finde words to acknowledge. Now one man commeth into the field in the right of millions, (that could not stand in their owne quarrell) challengeth the victors, with singular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion calleth backe the scattered, raiseth a mightie expectation, exposeth himselfe to the danger, with incredible furie is encountred, one with millions or legions of deuills, of incomprehensible rage, and long beaten experience, and the infinite anger of God, was kindled against this one man as a suretie for the rest.</p>
                        <p>Now in this text is a report of the happie successe of the battell; newes of a most victorious conquest: the deuills spoyled, the elect restored, with vnut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable hymnes attend the conquest; the wretched spirits are in chaines, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to infinite shame, and dragged after the chariot of triumph, as he ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the new Ierusalem.</p>
                        <p>In generall two things may be obserued: First, that Christ is God; he was brought in before, quickning, pardoning, filling, circumcising the heart, now here spoyling the deuills, and triumphing ouer them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. We may here comfort our selues with this, that the deuill shall neuer haue successe against Christ, and his kingdom, God hath cursed all his waies: and yet we finde by experience, the deuill will not giue ouer, though he hath neuer so ill successe from day to day: which may awaken many wicked men, who are herein like the deuill, no ill successe can make them giue ouer, their ill courses. Againe, would we not be spoyled and crossed in the successe of that we take in hand, and be made like the deuill in ill successe, then let vs take heed of his qualities, be not like him in crueltie, in fraud, in lying, in accusing, or enuying the children of God: for if thou be, thou art sure with the deuill, to be accursed and rebuked of God.</p>
                        <p>Now for the particular opening of these words, wee must vnderstand that they haue been three waies interpreted. First, some Papists say this battell was fought in hell, when Christ fetched the Fathers out of <hi>Limbus:</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation I reiect, not only as a fond conceit obtruded vpon the world, but because the most popis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> writers could see no such thing in this place, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it otherwise.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, some orthodox writers say this battell and triumph was both begun and ended before Christs death. The deuills encountred Christ two waies vpon the crosse: visiblie and invisiblie. Visiblie, by inspiring wicked men with vile prouocations to vexe him, and molest him; as the impenitent theefe <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.38.</note>, the Rulers of the Iewes <note n="b" place="margin">

                        <p>The victorie i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> described in this verse, and it is said first <hi>he spoiled them,</hi> which is diuersly read and referred; For some vnderstand it, he spoyled the deuills: some of the Fathers put in a word, and read it, <hi>after he had spoyled
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21380:144"/>
himselfe of his flesh,</hi> and so it is a comparison borrowed from wrestlers, or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that first put off all might hinder them; and so Christ that hee might ouercome, first laid downe his flesh, vpon the crosse. And where the text saith, he made a shew of them openly, the Holy Ghost alludeth to the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of great Victors: their manner was, in the place where they did ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, either to cut downe the armes of great trees, and therevpon hanged the spoyles or weapons, of the vanquished: or else they built some stately pillars, and there painted or wrote vpon, the conquest with other monuments of victorie; So did Christ openly serue the deuills, openly before God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the world he defeateth them, and by a new way, by suffring, gaue occasion to all to see the shaking of the hellish kingdom; where he is said to triumph ouer them, therein is an allusion to the third degree of victorie, they were won: to lead their captiues after the chariot of triumph into the Citie with great pompe: thus did Christ to the wicked spirits, either vpon the crosse, or in his resurrection.</p>

                        <p>All this being considered, where is the ignominie of the crosse, seeing the deuills erected a crosse for themselues, when they plotted to crucifie Christ? And why should we be afraid of suffrings, seeing the crosse is Christs triumph? and let vs resolue also to ouercome by suffrings <note n="f" place="margin">

                        <p>Lastly, let vs neuer iudge of Christ or Christians by their outward shew: great things may be done in the kingdom of Christ, which are not discerned by carnall reason; Here we see a great adoe, trophies, triumphs, yet the world tooke no notice of it: so is there incomparable glory euen in this world in the soules and liues of Christians, which the blinde multitude neuer takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. And thus much of the second interpretation.</p>
                        <p>The third and last interpretation, is of those that limit not the time of this victorie to the crosse, but consider it generally, and in steed of the words [<hi>vpon the same crosse</hi>] read [<hi>in himselfe</hi>] and thus doe the most Interpreters new and old read it; And so this victorie is vnderstood not so much of what Christ did attaine in his person, as what he doth in vs: by the conuersion of sinners, by the Gospell, he daily spoyles principalities and powers, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs ouer them, &amp;c. and so these words are a consequent of the putting out of the hand-writing mentioned in the former verse.</p>

                           <pb n="71" facs="tcp:21380:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>Foure things are in these words to be considered: <hi>who, whom, what,</hi> and <hi>by what meanes.</hi> For the first, it is the second <hi>Adam</hi> that vndertakes this battel, he that is God and man, he of whom the prophecies ranne, he that by a voice from heauen, at his baptisme was acknowledged the only champion, twas he that sent the challenge by his fore-runner <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> he it is that foyled Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than in many <hi>Monomachies,</hi> this is he that now comes forth in the Gospell in the seuerall ages of the Church to spoyle these principalities and powers.</p>
                        <p>Now for the second, the spoyled are called <hi>principalities and powers.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Principalities and Powers</hi>] These termes are giuen to the good Angells, Eph. 3.10. and to great Magistrates and Princes on earth, Eph. 1.23. In effect they are giuen to Christ, Esay 9.6.7. but vsually they are restrained to euill angells, and so they are called either considering them as they were before their fall, or as it is vsually conceiued, it notes their estate euen since their fall.</p>
                        <p>The two words note two things in the euill Angells, <hi>Excellencie</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; Excellencie,</hi> so they are <hi>principalities; Abilitie,</hi> so they are <hi>powers.</hi> Their <hi>excellencie</hi> is two waies to be considered, 1. in themselues. 2. their soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ouer the world.

                        <p>Now whereas he saith he hath spoiled him, it is true of the time past, 1. In the person of Christ himselfe. 2. In the merit of our victorie. 3.

                           <hi>And made a shew of them openly</hi>] These words containe the second degree of victorie, and are true in a double sense: For first he hath made a <hi>shew of them,</hi> in that he hath discouered them and made them known to the Church. This is a dragging of them out of their cells of darknesse in the light of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, by shewing their natures, and practises, by vnmasking them to the view of the soule: thus are they displaied in the doctrine of the gospell, and the soules of the righteous behold this detection of Sathan from day to day by the word, with as much admiration as euer the <hi>Romanes</hi> did behold any great rebell, or barbarous rebell or monster, subdued, and in triumph brought into <hi>Rome</hi>: Neither may this detection of Sathan seeme to be the least part of Christs victorie: for it is certaine it is a worke that euill men or euill angels neuer beare but vanquished.

                           </note> we see Christ will neuer cease till he hath finished this victorie.

Here also mens waiwardnesse may be reproued, that cannot abide it to heare talke of the diuell or his courses: this is but a worke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than in them to hinder their saluation, for to make an open shew of them is one part of Christs victory.</p>
                        <p>The word rendred openly signifieth sometimes eminently <note n="b" place="margin">

                           <hi>And triumphed ouer them</hi>] Here is the third part of the victory. This tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph was first begunne in the resurection and ascension of Christ <note n="g" place="margin">
                              <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7.</note>. 2.

The soule is mounted in the chariot of the word, praier and holy liuing; this chariot is followed with the applause of Angells, and the approbation of the Saints; the place is in the new Ierusalem on earth, in the temple of their God. The chariot is drawne with white steeds, sincere teachers; it is prouoked and driuen on by the spirit of God: and the effect of all is a heart inspired with heauenly ioies and refreshings. 3. As it begun in Christ, and is continued in the life of a Christian, so this triumph shall be perfitted in death, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summate in the resurrection to the eternall dissolution and confusion of all wicked men and diuels.</p>
                        <p>Now for vse of this;<note place="margin">

in repentance for their sinnes: they had rather be his prisoners, then such princes: rather slaues to Sathan, then sonnes to God: rather dragged into captiuitie with the diuell, then carried in the chariot of triumph with the Saints.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If such honors be done to Christians, and such ioyes had in a Christian estate, Oh then let it be the praier of euery godly man daily to God, as Psal. 106.4. <hi>Remember me O Lord, with the fauour of thy people, visit me with thy sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, how should it excite in vs a desire to walk worthy of such a victory? yea how should it inspire vs with spirituall magnanimitie to resist Sathan, and with a holy scorne to disdaine his filthie tentations, and in all estates to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane our selues so as might become men that know and beleeue that Christ hath spoiled principallities and powers for vs &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Hitherto of the seuen reasons of the dehortation. The conclusion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes in these words and the rest to the end of the chapter: and it hath three branches; For 1. he concludes against Iudaisme in these words. 2. Against philosophie, vers. 18.19. 3. Against traditions, vers. 20. to the end.</p>
                        <p>In these words is contained both the conclusion it selfe vers. 16. and the reason vers. 17. and the drift is to shew that the ceremonies of <hi>Moses</hi> are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, and therefore they should not receiue them, or hold themselues bound vnto them. This was foretold Dan. 9.17. it was signified by the renting of the vaile; and these ceremonies were solemnly and publickelie laid downe, in the first councell, which was held by the Apostles, at Ierusalem, Act. 15. And they were then so laide downe that the Apostle after giues order to the Church that those ceremonie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> should neuer be vsed, nor any other deuises, but such as might be to edification, order and decencie, and were without offence.</p>
                        <p>The ceremonies named in the text, are the difference of meates and drinkes, and the obseruation of times, concerning which he writes more sharpely, Gal. 3.1.3. &amp; 4.10. &amp; 5.9. &amp; 6.12.</p>
                        <p>In the law there were three sorts of meates that legallie were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, 1. The meate offrings. 2. The shewe bread. 3. The cleane beasts. The meate offring was a type of Christ our nourishment. The shewe bread was a type of the Church in her mysticall vnion. And the cleane beasts (knowne by chewing the end, and diuiding the hoofe) were types of the Christians both meditation and discretion, in the meanes of his holy conuersation. And for the confirmation of this place, the Apostle
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21380:146"/>
elsewhere shewes euidently that the difference of meates is taken away, 1. Tim. 4.1.2.3.4.</p>
                        <p>The difference of times in the law is here said to be threefold; of daies, of monthes, of Sabbaths.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In respect of an holy day</hi>] The originall and most translations word for word haue it thus, <hi>in part of an holy day</hi>; but in diuers senses: some say in part of an holy day: First, in partition of a festiuall day from a not festiuall day, aswell in daies, as in monthes, or Sabbathes. Some say, <hi>in part,</hi> for they could not obserue all ceremonies, being absent from Ierusalem. Therefore the Apostle would haue them to receiue none at all, seeing they could not receiue them all. Some say in part of an holy day, that is in that part of them which concernes daies &amp;c. but it is more plainly as it is here rendred.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Or of the new moone</hi>] They did obserue the Calends, or first daies of euery month.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Or of Sabbath daies</hi>] There were diuers sorts of <hi>Sabbathes, of daies, of yeares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or seuens of yeares,</hi> The Sabbathes of daies were either <hi>morrall,</hi> viz. the seuenth day, which God did chuse; or <hi>ceremoniall</hi>: the ceremoniall Sabbathes were either more solemne, such as were the three great feasts, <hi>passeouer, pentecost,</hi> and <hi>tabernacles</hi>; or lesse solemne, such as were the feasts of blowing the trumpets <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.24</note>, and the feast of expiation <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Leuit.</hi> 16.32 33.34.</note>. The Sabbath of yeares, was euery seuenth yeare<note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Leuit.</hi> 25.4.5.6. <hi>to</hi> 11.</note>. The Sabbath of seuens of yeares, was the Iubile, which returned euery fiftie yeares. We see here then that the Apostle shewes that we are deliuered from the bondage of the obseruation as before of meates, so now of Sabbathes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obiect.</hi> But is the Sabbath day that was morrall abrogated? <hi>Sol.</hi> No, the Apostle speakes here of the ceremoniall law, not of the morrall, and of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Sabbathes, not of the morrall Sabbath, the word is in the plurall number.</p>
                        <p>The manner of propounding the conclusion is to be obserued.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Let no man condemne you</hi>] These words may bee referred either to Gods children or to false teachers; in the first sense it is thus: let none <hi>condemne you,</hi> that is, doe not shew such loue to these ceremonies, hereafter, that thereby you incu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if they bee referred to false teachers, then it is thus: let no man whatsoeuer perswade you that you are condemned, or iudged of God for omitting the obseruation of the ceremonies; care not for their censures, neuer trouble your consciences about it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Which are shaddowes of things to come</hi>] Here the Apostle with full saile driues into the hauen, by shutting vp with this vnauoidable argument. These cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are but shaddowes of that substance which now we haue, and therefore it is a foolish thing, to striue about the shaddow when we haue the substance.</p>
                        <p>Ceremonies were shaddowes in diuers respects,<note place="margin">Ceremonies were sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes in diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</note> 1. In respect of certainty of signification: the shadow is a sure signe of the body; so was this of Christ to come. 2. In respect of causation; the body causeth the shaddow, so is Christ the cause of all ceremonies. 3. In respect of the obscuritie of signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: a shaddow is darke so were the ceremonies. 4. In respect of cessati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a shaddow is quickly gone, so were the ceremonies, they were not to last for any long time. Lastly, they were shadowes as they were types, so the lambe was a shadow of Christ, and the arke of the Church &amp;c. They were shadowes not giuen to iustifie, but to shew iustification by Christ.</p>
                        <p>It is added <hi>of things to come</hi>] to keepe off the blow from our sacraments, which are no shadowes of things to come, but of things past.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But the body is in Christ</hi>] The words are diuerslie interpreted: some referre the words to the next verse, but without reason: some supplie a word <hi>body,</hi> and read, but the body is the body of Christ: but the plaine meaning is, that
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:21380:147"/>
the truth and substance of all the ceremonies is now inioyed by the Church in and by Christ, in whom all is now fulfilled, and therefore heauen should now suffer violence, and the <hi>children of Sion should now reioice in their King</hi>; and Christians <hi>should stand fast in the libertie that is brought vnto them in Christ Iesus.</hi>

                        <p>The Apostle makes foure obseruations vpon these that bring in this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Angels. 1. That they attribute that to themselues, which is proper to God; namely to beare rule ouer the consciences of men in matters of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they pretend to bring in those things, because they would haue men thinke humbly of themselues. 2. That they thrust in for oracles, not things they haue seene and heard, but deuised of themselues. 3. That those things were founded on no other foundation then the opinions of men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately pleasing themselues in their owne deuises. 4. That this course tends to the high derogation of the honor of Christ, who onely deserues all glorie, and by whom alone all the suits of the Church are dispatched. The men then that vrge these things are, 1. Hypocrites, they pretend one thing and intend an other. 2. They are ignorant persons. 3. They are proud and insolent in selfe-conceit. 4. They are prophane without Christ.</p>

                        <p>And whereas they giue the knowledge of all things vnto them, they rob God of his glory, who only is the <hi>knower of the hearts of men,</hi> 2. Chron. 6.30.

and it is granted Isai: 63.16 that <hi>Abraham</hi> knew them not, and <hi>Israel</hi> was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of them. And whereas they obiect that <hi>Abraham</hi> in the 16. of <hi>Luke,</hi> is said to know that they had <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets bookes, we answer that that is spoken parabolically not historically; they may as well say that <hi>Lazarus</hi>
had fingers, and Diues a tongue, &amp;c. but were that granted, yet it followeth not, that because the doctrine of the Church was reuealed vnto him, therefore he knew all things.</p>
                        <p>The second thing they giue is adoration, contrary to the flat prohibition of the Angell himselfe, in the Reuelation, who chargeth <hi>worship me not,</hi> Reuel. 19.10. and without all example in scripture, or the least sillable of warrant for it; besides we see here Angell-worship in expresse words condemned.</p>
                        <p>The third thing is inuocation, praying to them, which likewise is contrary to scripture, for <hi>how shall we call on them on whom we haue not beleeued</hi>

                           <hi>In humblenes of minde</hi>] It was the practise of Satan and pretence of false Teachers, to thrust in this corruption of Angell-worship vnder this colour, that it tended to keep men in humilitie, and to make men to know their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the great maiestie of God, and to acknowledge their gratitude to the Angells for their seruice: this hath been the deuills wont to hide foule sins, vnder faire pretences, and vice vnder the colours of vertue.</p>
                        <p>This may serue notably for the confutation of the Papists, about their Saint and Angell-worship; for is not this their smoothest pretence, to tell vs by comparison, that men will not goe to great Princes directly with their suites, but will vse the mediation of some Courtiers, and so they say they must doe to God. This you see was the old deceit in the primitiue Church, and therfore worthily we may say to the people, let none of the popish rabble <hi>defraud you, through humblenes of minde.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Againe, is the deuill ashamed to shew sinne in his owne colours? doth he maske it vnder the colour of virtue? Then where shall those monsters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that declare their sinnes as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and are not ashamed of open villanies and filthinesse? Such are they that will constantly to the alehouse, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be ashamed of it: such are our damned swearers: such are those filthy persons, that know they are knowne to liue in whoredome, and yet neuer blush at it, nor learne to repent: such are these in this Citie that liue in open contention, who care not against apparant right to maintaine continuall suits and wranglings, though they know all men detest almost the very sight of them for their wicked profanesse, and vniust contentions: yea though the hand of God be apparantly vpon them, and they know not how soone the Lord may turne them into hell. Such also are the open and wilfull Sabbath breakers, and many more of all sorts of presumptuous offenders.</p>
                        <p>Againe, if vice masked in virtues colours can so please, and allure men, how much should virtue it selfe rauish vs? If counterfeit humilitie can be so plausible, how should true humilitie winne to the admiration and imitation of it?</p>
                        <p>Lastly, this may warne men to auoide counterfeit gestures, and all preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded insinuating shewes of deuotion, such as are open lifting vp of the eyes to heauen, sighing and all pretended tricks that are vsed onely to pretend what is not. And thus of their hypocrisie, their ignorance followes.</p>

                           <hi>Ignorance</hi> is of diuers kindes. There is a naturall ignorance, and that is of two sorts.

There is great difference betweene our best garments, and our meanest members; the worst member of the body will grow, yet the best raiment though it sit neuer so neere will not, so is not betweene wicked men professing Christ, and the godlie that are members of Christ indeed.</p>

                        <p>In these words is conteined the third branch of the conclusion, and it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced against traditions: here I obserue both the manner of propounding, and the matter. For the first, it is to be obserued, that whereas he condemned the former by way of aduise, he condemnes these by bitter and tart expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>why are ye burthened with traditions,</hi> as if he should say, were there not a singular proannesse of nature to corruption, could they be so blinded, as to suffer false Teachers, to impose traditions vpon them?</p>
                        <p>In the matter consider first what he condemnes, viz. traditions explicated in the kindes, v. 21. 2. The reasons why hee condemnes them and these, are 6. First ye are dead with Christ, and therefore yee ought not to bee sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to traditions, of the force of this reason afterwards. 2. You are dead from the rudiments of the world, that is, from the ceremoniall lawes of <hi>Moses,</hi> which yet were are rudiments or waies of instructing the world in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Kingdome of God, and therfore much more should you now giue ouer traditions? 3. They are burthens, and the greater by how much the lesse sence you haue of them. 4. The matter of them is light, and vaine, and idle, v. 21. 5. They are all corruptible and perish with the vsing. 6. They are after the counts and doctrines of men. ver. 22. <hi>Ob.</hi> But there seemeth to be a depth in these traditions. <hi>Sol.</hi> v. 23. He confesseth that they haue a shew of wisdome, and that in three things. 1. <hi>In voluntary religion</hi>

                              </gap>.</note>, which hee censures two wayes.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. It is but a <hi>shew</hi> or flourish, no true substance, either of worship or sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, 2. It with-hoolds the honour due to the body.</p>
                        <p>Now that the whole may be better vnderstood, we must distinctly consider what he meaneth by tradition, which will appeare if it be considered negatiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with comparison with the two former.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. They are not things required by Scripture any way: For all such were condemned vnder the first kinde, viz. ceremonies, which though now abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, were once required.</item>
                           <item>2. They are not such rites besides Scripture, as are practized with opinion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21380:152"/>
of worship, for they are condemned vnder the second kinde, viz. philosophy.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>So then the traditions heere condemned, are such rites, customes, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations, as men binde their consciences to, to obserue or practize in the ciuill life of man. Besides the instances in the text, such are the obseruation of euill dayes, or houres to be borne in, or to marry in, or to set out on a iourney in; the rules obserued about infants vnbaptized, as that they must not be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, or they must lie in a sieue, or such like about weomen that lye in. Such is the not marrying with kindred at the font, as they call it, such are the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of signes of ill lucke, or of death gathered from the crying of birdes, or the running of beasts; such is praying at the lighting vp of candles, and the burning of candles ouer the dead corps, or the naming of children with names that agree to men and women, to make them liue the longer; such is, not burying in the north side of the Church, and the like silly trash, with which simple people, abound more then is ordinarily obserued.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the generall.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ</hi>] In these words diuers things may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Heere we see the necessity of our vnion with Christ, the Apostle will not a done with it, he remembreth it still.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. When he saith, if <hi>yee be dead,</hi> it implies that men may make a faire shew, and professe long, and liue in true visible Churches, and yet it is a question whether they be in Christor no, <hi>If ye be dead with Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. Note heere the praise of a mortified life, for when he saith, <hi>if yee be dead</hi> in Christ, it imports that to be so, is an excellent condition: to be truly morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Christ, is a rare happinesse; to die with Christ, is better then to liue with the world.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. Penitent sinners haue life and death, ioyes and sorrowes &amp;c. common with Christ.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. In speciall they haue death common with Christ. They die with Christ 1. Because Christs death was theirs: when Christ died they died, because his death was for their sakes, &amp; for their benefit. 2. Because when their bodies die they die in vnion with Christ. 3. Because the vertue of Christs death is deriued to their souls: whence flowes, <hi>death to the law,</hi> that is, a release from the rigour and curse of it. 2. <hi>Death to sinne,</hi> that is, a power to mortifie sin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiued in the ordinances of Christ, and applied by the spirit of Christ. 3. The presence of Christ in all the duties of mortification, though they be done ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so secretly, yet Christ is with them.</p>
                        <p>The vse may be both for triall and comfort. For triall, art thou not dead with Christ in respect of the mortification of thy corruptions? then art thou not in Christ. For comfort to the mortified, thou art in Christ, and hee will neuer <hi>leaue thee nor forsake thee,</hi> till hee hath raised thy body and cured thy soule. Thus of the wordes in themselues; they are also to bee considered as they are heere vsed against traditions, and so they are two wayes.</p>
                        <p>Christ is dead, and in his death ye are freed from all bondage of soule to any thing but the will of God, and therefore t'is a dishonour to Christs death and the freedome purchased in it, to make our selues seruants to traditions.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. You are dead with Christ, that is, you are mortified persons, and these things are too light for any graue and penitent persons, to take vp his thoughts or cares about them; fleshly persons are onely capable of this trash, mortified persons without teaching suspect them.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the first reason.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>From the rudiments of the world</hi>] The second reason stands thus, if by the death of Christ, ye be freed from the ceremonies of <hi>Moses,</hi> which were then rudiments, or as it were the first grounds of instruction, then much more are
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:21380:153"/>
you freed from traditions, which are but beggerly obseruations, that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can tell whence they came, or what good they doe. This should bee of force to preuaile, with vs against the multitudes of idle traditions that raigne amongst the people.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Why as though ye liued in the world are ye burthened &amp;c</hi>]</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quest.</hi> Doe not the faithfull liue in the world, that he saith with such a salt interrogation, <hi>as though ye liued in the world?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ.</hi> They liue in the world corporally, yet not in the world in respect of their profession of spirituall and celestiall life: So Christs kingdome was not of this world. 2. In respect of subiection to all the frame of rites and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations of the world: they liue not as men that are tyed and vowed to the seruice of the world in whatsoeuer obseruations it shall propound.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Burthened</hi>] Traditions are a greiuous burthen to the soule, and the worse, the lesse they are felt, men will not willingly suffer vniust impositions, in their free-holds in the world, nor should men suffer the world to impose burthen vpon their soules.</p>
                        <p>The world also notes the audacious libertie of the imposers, before they pestred the Church with the ceremonies of Moses, then they corrupted Gods worship with philosophicall dreames, such as was the worship of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gels, now they proceede further, they clogge the ciuill life of man and his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate affaires with imperious obseruations.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the third reason.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>As touch not, tast not, handle not</hi>] These words must be vnderstood to bee vttered <hi>mimetic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Some obserue that the hast of the words without copulatiues, notes their eagernesse in pressing these things, and perswading men, to the care of them; sure it is, men of corrupt mindes are more eager about these then about waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier matters.</p>
                        <p>Some learned, render touch not, by eate not, and so note a gradation, First they would not haue them eate, then not so much as tast, and when they had gotten them to that, then not so much as to handle: <hi>Ambrose</hi> runnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the streame of all interpreters, to vnderstand these words, to bee the commandement of the Apostle. Thus of the fourth reason.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Which all perish with the vsing</hi>] These words are two waies interpreted.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. They bring destruction to the vsers, they are a doctrine of diuels, and make men the children of hell. This is true, but not the truth of this place.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. They are of a perishable nature, and therefore men ought not to load their consciences with necessity of obseruing them.</p>
                        <p>This is the nature of all outward things thy perish with the vsing, all is <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of the flesh is <hi>but as the flower of the field</hi>

Earthly things not onely in the abuse, but in the very vse, are either worne out or lesse regarded, or haue lesse vigor, fairenesse, power, &amp;c. but cleane contrary with spirituall things? why should wee not then moderate our loue to these outward things? why should we not striue <hi>to vse this world as if we vsed it not, no</hi> more <hi>trusting in vncertaine ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi> This should also stirre vp to the care of spirituall graces and duties, that neuer perish, that we may attain that <hi>vncorruptible crown of righteousnes,</hi> which God will giue to all <hi>that loue his appearing:</hi> The very daily perishing of food and raiment, are types of thine owne perishing also. Thus of the 5. reason.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And are after the commandements and doctrines of men</hi>] The reason stands
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:21380:153"/>
thus, whatsoeuer hath no better warrant then the commandement and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of men, is to be reiected as a burthensome tradition: But these things are such, therefore why are ye burthened? See the wretched disposition of mens natures, how ready men are to prescribe, and how easie men are to bee lead on in these foolish vanityes. But are the commandements of God so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily obeyed? are the doctrines of Gods word so willingly embraced? Alasse, alasse, mens examples, or counsell will easily passe for lawes, but the Lord is as if he were not worthy to be heard in the practise of the most.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the sixe reasons.</p>
                        <p>Now followes the obiections. Though these things were not commanded in the word, yet they were wisely deuised by our fathers, and therefore are to be obserued. <hi>Sol.</hi> v. 23. The Apostle grants that there were 3. things allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to approoue the discretion of the founders of these things, and instanceth in one kinde, viz. abstinence or fasting, for that he confesseth that had a shew of <hi>voluntary,</hi> nor coacted or forced <hi>religion.</hi> 2. Of <hi>humblenesse of minde.</hi> 3. Of the taming of the body, but when he hath granted this, he doth dash all as it were with thunder and lightning, when he saith. 1. This was but <hi>a shew of wisedome.</hi> 2. This sparing did with hold <hi>the honour due vnto the body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Obserue heere that it is a faire propertie to vse candor and ingenious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after the truth, and willingly to acknowledge what they see in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the aduersaries, we see the Apostle fairly yeeldes the full of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, not mangling them, but setting them out distinctly, and then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confutes them. It were happie if there were this faire dealing in all reasonings publike and priuate, in print or by word of mouth, in all that professe to loue the truth especially.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Shew of wisdome</hi>] There is a wisdome onely in appearance, and in mens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in name onely. Some men haue wisdome, other haue the praise of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But in matters of conscience and religion, it is dangerous for man to lift vp himselfe in his wisdome, or to admit the varnish of carnall reason. The wisest worldly men are not alwaies the holiest, and most religious men, Oh that there were an heart in vs, indeed to acknowledge and to seeke the true wisdome that is from aboue.</p>
                        <p>The colours cast vpon their traditions were three. 1. Voluntary religion. 2. Humblenesse of minde. 3. The taming of the body: All these as base varnish, to smeire ouer mens insolent wickednesse, are hee reiected. Which may confirme vs in the detestation of popery, euen in that wherein it makes the greatest shew, what are their workes of supererrogation, their vowes of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life, their canonicall obedience, their wilfull pouerty, and the like, what can be said or shewed in their praise, which was not pretended for these tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, for or are all of these; three are the chiefe arguments of their defence. The Apostle heere giues warning, let not men be deceiued, these faire preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our Papists, are but the old obiections of the false Apostles, new var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished ouer againe by the Pope, and his vassals; Oh that our seduced multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude would consider this? then would they not be thus led to hell with their faire shewes.</p>
                        <p>The last thing in this verse is the Apostles reason against these colours.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>They haue it not in estimation to satisfie the bodie or flesh</hi>] That is,<note place="margin">The body is to be honored for many reasons.</note> they yeelde not due honor to the body: the body of man is to be honoured; for first the sonne of God (as the fathers say) made it with his owne hands in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the body he assumed. 2. The soule a diuine thing is kept in it, and helped by it in great imploiments. 3. The sonne of God tooke the body of a man into the vnitie of his person. 4. He redeemed the body by his bloud, and feedes it with the sacramentall body. 5. The body is the temple of the holy Ghost. 6. It is consecrate to God in baptisme. 7. It is a part of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21380:154"/>
mysticall body of Christ. Lastly, it shall be gloriously raised at the last day. Then let men know, they must giue account that dishonor their bodies, and if these superstitious persons must reckon for it, that punish their bodies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commandement from God, where shall these beasts appeare that sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their bodies by gluttony, and drunkennesse, and lust and whoredome, and crueltie and murther? Oh the condemnation that abides these impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent men, that glory in their shame, and minde only to fulfill the lusts of the flesh.</p>

                  <head>THE LOGICALL ANALYSIS OF the third CHAPTER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto the Apostle hath intreated of matters of faith: now hee intreateth in these two Chapters of matters of life: prescribing rules for conuersation.</p>
                  <p>These rules are either generall or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The generall are from verse 1. to 18. The particular are from v. 18. of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to v. 2. of the fourth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>The generall rules concerne, first, the meditation of heauenly things, v. 1. to 5. secondly, the mortification of vice, vers. 5. to 10. thirdly, the renouation of life, v. 10. to 18.</p>
                  <p>The exhortation to the care and studie of heauenly things is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 1.</note> v. 1. illustrated, v. 2. confirmed by reasons, v. 3.4.</p>
                  <p>In the proposition of this exhortation to the studie of heauenly things, two things are to be obserued: 1. the dutie required, <hi>seeke those things that are aboue.</hi> 2. the reasons, which are foure. 1. Ye are risen with Christ. 2. These things are aboue. 3. Christ is aboue. 4 Christ is exalted there and sits at Gods right hand.</p>
                  <p>This exhortation is illustrated, v. 2.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 2.</note> First by repitition in these words, <hi>set your affections on things which are aboue.</hi> Secondly, by the contrarie, <hi>and not on things that are on earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The confirmation is set downe by two motiues: the one from the condition of the faithfull in this world: the other from their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>In this world two things should incite them.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 3.</note> 1. Their distresse, <hi>they are dead.</hi> 2. Their hiding of the happinesse they haue, their <hi>life is hid with Christ in God,</hi> v. 3.</p>
                  <p>In the end of the world:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 4.</note> 
                     <hi>they shall appeare in glory when Christ shall appeare,</hi> v. 4. Thus of the meditation of heauenly things.</p>
                  <p>The mortification of euill followes;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 5.6.7.</note> and so he intreats, first of the mortification of vices that concerne our selues most, vers. 5.6.7. Secondly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 8.9.</note> of the mortification of iniuries, v. 8.9.</p>
                  <p>In the first there is both the matter to be mortified, &amp; the reasons.</p>
                  <p>In the first there is two things: 1. the proposition of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:21380:155"/>
                     <hi>Mortifie therefore your members that are on earth.</hi> 2. The catalogue of vices to be mortified, which are either against the seuenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>fornication, vncleannesse, inordinate affection:</hi> or against the tenth Commandement, <hi>euill concupiscence</hi>: or against the first Commandement, <hi>couetousnesse which is Idolatrie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 6.</note>The reasons are taken, first from the euill effect, which is the <hi>wrath of God,</hi> amplified by the persons on whom it falls, <hi>the children of disobedience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 7.</note> v. 6. Secondly, from experience, <hi>in which yee also wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked when yee liued in them,</hi> v. 7.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the mortification of vices.</p>
                  <p>The mortification of iniuries followes: where obserue, 1. the exhortation it selfe. 2. the reasons of it.</p>
                  <p>In the exhortation there is two things: 1. The charge in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, <hi>put away all these things.</hi> 2. The catalogue of iniuries to be put away are either the sinnes of the heart, or the sinnes of the tongue: the sinnes of the heart, are <hi>anger, wrath, malice:</hi> the sinnes of the tongue, are <hi>cursed speaking, filthy speaking, lying.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 9.</note>The reasons are three: First, Ye haue put off the old man and his works, v. 9. Secondly, Ye are renewed: which is explicated by shewing that this new birth is in generall,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 10.</note> 
                     <hi>the putting on of the new man:</hi> in particular, tis the renewing of the <hi>minde with knowledge,</hi> and of the whole man,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 11.</note> with <hi>the image of Christ,</hi> v. 10. Thirdly, God is no accepter of persons, without grace he will respect none, and with it he will disregard none, for with him there is neither <hi>Graecian nor Iew,</hi> circumcision nor vncircumcision, barbarian, scythian, bond, free, Christ is all in all things, v. 11.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the second thing needfull to holy life: viz. the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of vices. The third followes, viz. the exercise of holy graces and duties, from v. 12. to 18. and here the rules concerne either 1. the matter of holinesse, v. 12. to 16. or the meanes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, v. 16. or the end of holinesse, v. 17.</p>
                  <p>For the first he giues in charge nine graces: but first proposeth three motiues. 1. the election of God, <hi>as the elect of God.</hi> 2. their sanctification, <hi>holy.</hi> 3. the loue of God to them, <hi>and beloued.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 12.13.</note>The graces are of three sorts: some of them haue their greatest praise in prosperitie, viz. <hi>mercie, kindnes, meeknesse, humblenes of minde:</hi> some of them concerne the times of aduersitie principally, viz. long-suffering and clemencie in forbearing and forgiuing, v. 12.13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 14.</note>Some of these graces ought to raigne at all times, &amp; these are three.</p>
                  <p>First, Loue, which is set out both by the dignitie of it, <hi>aboue all put on loue:</hi> and by the vse of it, <hi>it is the bond of perfectnesse,</hi> v. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 15.</note>Secondly, Peace, amplified by the author, <hi>of God</hi>: by the power of it, <hi>let it rule:</hi> and by the seat of it, <hi>in your hearts.</hi> to which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts by two reasons: 1. from their vocation, <hi>to which ye are called:</hi> 2. from their mutuall relation, <hi>as members of one bodie,</hi> v. 15.</p>
                  <p>The third is thankfulnes or amiablenesse, v. 15.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the matter of holinesse.</p>
                  <p>The meanes followes, which is the word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:21380:155"/>The exhortation to the vse of the word, 1. concerns the word in generall. 2. the Psalmes in speciall. For the first hee propounds three things: 1. the author of it, <hi>the word of Christ.</hi> 2. the manner of entertaining the word, <hi>let it dwell in you plenteously in all wisdome.</hi> 3. the end or vse it should be put to, <hi>viz.</hi> to teach in what we know not, and to admonish in what we doe not.</p>
                  <p>The second part concernes the Psalmes in particular,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 16.</note> where hee sets downe the sorts, <hi>Psalmes, Hymnes, and spirituall songs:</hi> and the right manner of singing of Psalmes, <hi>singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</hi> Thus of the meanes of holinesse, v. 16.</p>
                  <p>The third thing is the end,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 17.</note> which is considered two waies: First, as the end of intention, that wee ayme at, and so hee exhorts to it in these words, <hi>whatsoeuer yee doe in word or deed, doe all in the name of the Lord Iesus.</hi> 2. as the end of consummation, that finisheth our works, and so they must <hi>giue thanks to God euen the Father by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus of the rules of holy life, that concerne all men as they are Christians.</p>
                  <p>Now follow particular rules fitted for particular callings, and that in the familie. In the familie there are three couples: Wiues and Husbands, Children and Parents, Seruants and Masters: and to these he giueth rules distinctly.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 18.</note> The Wiues dutie is laid downe and inlarged: laid downe in these words, <hi>Wiues be subiect to your Husbands:</hi> inlarged, first by a reason, <hi>it is comely.</hi> 2. a limitation, <hi>in the Lord,</hi> v. 18.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 19.</note> The Husbands dutie is propounded, 1. by exhortation, <hi>Husbands loue your Wiues.</hi> 2. by dehortation, <hi>be not bitter to them,</hi> v. 19.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 20.</note> The dutie of Children, is laid downe, in these words, <hi>Children obey your Parents:</hi> and amplified, 1. by the extent, <hi>in all things.</hi> 2. by reason, <hi>for this is well-pleasing to the Lord,</hi> v. 20.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 21.</note> The dutie of Parents is exprest by dehortation, in these words, <hi>Parents prouoke not your Children to anger:</hi> and confirmed by a reason taken from the ill effect, <hi>lest they be discouraged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Verse</hi> 22.23.24 25.</note> In setting downe the dutie of Seruants, there is first the exhortation, v. 22.23. the reasons, v. 24.25. The exhortation is both briefely laid downe in these words, <hi>Seruants be obedient to them that are your Masters:</hi> and explicated, 1. by prouisoes about their obedience. 2. the manner how they must obey.</p>
                  <p>The prouisoes are two: one restraines Masters, they are their seruants but <hi>according to the flesh:</hi> the other extends the dutie of seruants, they must obey <hi>in all things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The manner how they must obey is set downe, first negatiuely, <hi>not with eye-seruice, not as men-pleasers:</hi> secondly, affirmatiuely, and so they must obey, 1. <hi>with singlenes of heart.</hi> 2. <hi>with feare of God.</hi> 3. <hi>heartily as to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reasons are two: first, from the certaine hope of reward from God, v. 24. Secondly, from the certaine vengeance of God vpon them that doe wrong.</p>

                     </note>Now there are excellent reasons by which I may breifly stir you vp here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; both from the consideration of your present estate in this world, and from the meditation of your future condition in the day of <hi>CHRIST.</hi> In this world two things should much moue you. First, that ye are but dead men; for both you professe the forsaking of the world, and the world ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of you but as dead men: and your afflictions drown and ouerwhelm you many times. Secondly, the spirituall happinesse which you haue, which is the life of your life, is hid, alwaies from wicked men, who haue no iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in or discerning in spirituall things: and sometimes by the violence of tentation, your selues discerne not your owne happines. Yet be not discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it was so with <hi>CHRIST</hi> while he liued;<note place="margin">Verse <hi>4. When CHRIST, who is our life, shall appeare, then shall ye also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare with him in glory.</hi>
                     </note> and though it be hid, yet is it hid with <hi>GOD,</hi> it is in him, it is in his power, and he will preserue it.</p>
                  <p>But especially if you thinke of the comming of <hi>IESVS CHRIST</hi> you should be stirred to the loue and study of heauenly things: for then shall there
<pb facs="tcp:21380:156"/>
be an end of all earthly felicities, then shall men make accounts of all their actions and studies, then will not riches auaile in that day of wrath, then will the incomparable gaine and glory of godlinesse be discouered: Oh the inualuable dignitie of heauenly minded Christians in that day. And thus of the meditation of heauenly things.</p>
                  <p>The second maine part of my exhortation,<note place="margin">Verse <hi>5. Mortifie therefore your members which are on earth, fornication, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse, the inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, and couetousnesse, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is idolatrie.</hi>
                     </note> shall concerne the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both of vices and crimes. First, I would hence obserue those speciall sinnes which are most hatefull to God in your former course of life, and then haue been most prone to. When I say mortifie, I meane that you should vse all the meanes indefinitely that serue to kill the power and practice of those sinnes, neuer giuing ouer confession and godly sorrow till you finde the power of them abated and deaded. And this I would haue you doe not only in outward sinnes, but any sinne, though they were as deare to you as the very members of your bodies yet you must cut them off. Now some of the sinnes that I would haue you studious to auoide or mortifie are these: first, looke to the filthinesse condemned in the seuenth Commandement, not only auoide whoredome, but all kindes of wicked fleshly filthinesse and vncleannes; yea looke to, that internall burning or the flames of lust within, that habituall effeminatenesse; and passions of lust: and more then all this see that you make conscience of euill thoughts, and that contemplatiue wickednesse, which may be in your mindes without consent of the will to practise it: for euen those thoughts are filthy in <hi>GODS</hi> sight. Now the last sinne I will name is couetousnesse, which is a kinde of vile Idolatrie in <hi>GODS</hi> sight.</p>
                  <p>For these and such like sinnes,<note place="margin">Verse <hi>6. For the which things sake the wrath of GOD commeth vpon the children of disobedience.</hi>
                     </note> bring downe the fearefull iudgements of <hi>GOD</hi> vpon the offenders; and they wonderfully vexe <hi>GOD</hi>: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides to liue in these sins and loue them, and continue in them, is a manifest signe, that they are but wicked men, children of disobedience, whatsoeuer they seeme to be, or what shewes or profession soeuer they make.</p>
                  <p>And the rather should you be for euer carefull to keepe your selues from these euils and the like,<note place="margin">Verse <hi>7. In which ye also walked sometime when ye liued in them.</hi>
                     </note> or speedily to subdue them and forsake, seeing you haue felt by experience in your vnregenerate estate what it is to haue sinne like a Monster to liue and raigne in the heart or life.</p>
                  <p>You must also make conscience of iniurious dealing with others,<note place="margin">Verse <hi>8. But now put ye away euen all these things, anger, wrath, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, cursed spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, filthy spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of your mouth.</hi>
                     </note> and that not only of the grosse acts of iniuries, but of doing wrong in your very words, yea in the passions of your heart: yea to approue that now ye walke not in sinne, shew your vprightnesse, by putting away euen euery thing that might tend to the iniurie of others. To expresse my meaning I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in diuers sins, the vnregenerate would make no conscience of. And first in the heart,<note place="margin">
                        <p>Verse <hi>9. Lie not one to another, seeing that yee haue put off the old man with his wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>kes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>10. And haue put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the Image of him that created him</hi>
                        </p>
                     </note> there is inward fretting, and that passion that discouers it selfe by outward signes, and that inueterate anger called malice: these you must make conscience of. Besides in the tongue there are three vices you must also auoide, <hi>viz.</hi> cursed speaking, filthie speaking, and lying.</p>
                  <p>There are three weightie considerations should moue you thereunto. First, when you repent of sin, you professe to put off the old man and his workes, this old man is the old Tempter of your natures, and his workes are such as these sore-mentioned passions, and distempers in the tongue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, you are now in the state of grace, you are new men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:21380:157"/>
must not liue after the old manner: you are renewed in knowledge to discerne these things to be euill, and therefore ought to shew it in your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: and you are renewed after the Image of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> now there was no guile found in his mouth, nor any of these wretched perturbations in his heart, and therefore how sutable soeuer they be to the harmony of the most men, yet for that reason you must keepe your selues farre from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Verse <hi>11. Where is neither</hi> Graecian <hi>nor</hi> Iew, <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision nor vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi> Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, Scythian, <hi>bond, free, but CHRIST is all in all things.</hi>
                     </note>Thirdly, <hi>GOD</hi> is vnpartially righteous and iust; if men will not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of those old corruptions he cares not for them, though they were <hi>Iewes, circumcised, free,</hi> and contrariwise if men striue after that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse they see in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and mortifie these corruptions that abound in the world, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he will accept them, though they were <hi>Graecians, Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> bounden. Thus of the second maine thing needfull to holy life, <hi>viz.</hi> the mortification of vices and iniuries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Verse <hi>12. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the elect of GOD holy &amp; beloued, put on bowels of mercy, kindnesse, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes of minde, meeknesse, long-suffering.</hi>
                     </note>The third thing you must be carefull of is the exercise of holy graces and duties; and here I shall put you in minde of three things: the matter, the meanes, and the end. For the first there are nine graces, should principally be remembred in your practise: and that you may be quickned thereunto, be much in the meditation of three things, <hi>1. GODS</hi> election. <hi>2.</hi> Your owne sanctification. <hi>3.</hi> The loue of <hi>GOD</hi> to you.</p>
                  <p>The graces are, <hi>1.</hi> Tendernesse in all sorts of iniuries. <hi>2.</hi> Curtesie. <hi>3.</hi> True and hearty humility and lowlinesse. <hi>4.</hi> Quietnesse and meeknesse, and tranquillity of heart. <hi>5.</hi> Long suffering in respect of crosses.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <p>Verse <hi>13. Forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one another, and forgiuing one another, if any haue a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell to another, euen as CHRIST forgaue you, euen so do ye.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>14. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all these put on Loue which is the bond of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectnesse.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>15. And let the peace of God rule in your harts to the which also ye are called in one body: and be thankfull.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>16. Let the word of CHRIST dwel in you rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, teaching, and admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, in</hi> Psalmes, <hi>and</hi> Hymmes, <hi>and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi> songs, <hi>sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with grace in your hearts to the LORD.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </note>And sixtly, Clemencie which stands in two things, in forbearing, and forgiuing. Forbearing in respect of wrongs and infirmities, and forgiuing freely one another. And this forgiuing must be extended to euery man, and it must be as Christ forgaue vs, and that is though they be our inferiors, and though they haue done vs great wrong, &amp; so as we forget aswel as forgiue.</p>
                  <p>But seuenthly aboue all other be sure you cloath your selues with loue, for this will knit vs together perfectly, and by this all the Saints and all the graces of the Saints tend vnto perfection.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, Get the peace, that peace I meane that <hi>GOD</hi> only giues, and let it rule and preuaile with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if you cannot be at peace in your life, yet let it be in your hearts still, how vnreasonable soeuer men be, and the rather should you be carefull hereof, both because you are called of <hi>GOD</hi> to it, and besides you are all members of the same body. Lastly, adde vnto all these amiablenes and thankfulnes, one to another. And thus of the matter of holinesse.</p>
                  <p>Now I must also stirre you vp to a due respect of the meanes of holines which is the word. And so both the word in generall and the Psalmes in speciall. For the word in generall, you must remember it is the word of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> both as the subiect and the cause of it: and you should neuer be satisfied till you grow familiar and plentifull in it, through the daily vse of it, both in your hearts and houses also, and that with all iudgement and discretion; not seeking or vsing it, coldly, peruersly, carnally or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreetlie: and this word you must imploy both to teach you and one another, what you know not, and to admonish you and other for what you do not. And in speciall be carefull of the Psalmes, remembring that they also are the word of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and the rather considering the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
<pb facs="tcp:21380:157"/>
variety of sweet matter in them, but in singing obserue these rules, First, exercise the graces of the heart according to the matter of the Psalme. Secondly, do it with attention and vnderstanding. Thirdly, respect <hi>GODS</hi> glory in it and his holie presence.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, be carefull of the end of all your actions,<note place="margin">
                        <p>Verse <hi>17. And whatsoeuer yee shall do in word or deede, doe all in the name of the LORD IESVS: giuing thanks to GOD euen the Father by him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>18. Wiues submit your selues to your Husbands as it is comely, in the LORD.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </note> both that all be done to the glory of <hi>GOD</hi> in <hi>CHRIST</hi> (all I say both in word and deed) beginning with calling on the name of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and ending with the sacrifice of thanksgiuing, which must be offered vnto <hi>GOD</hi> in the mediation of <hi>CHRIST</hi> aswell as your praiers. Thus I haue breifly laide before you the rules that concerne holinesse as you are Christians in the generall.</p>
                  <p>Now I thinke it meete to propound some duties that are more particular: and I will onely instance in the familie: and there I beginne with Wiues, whose word is, be subiect, an epitome of their duty and a thing <hi>GOD</hi> most stands vpon, and which Women most faile in. And great reason, for here lieth the true comelinesse and beauty of a Wife, tis not in her face and garments, but in her subiection to her Husband.<note place="margin">
                        <p>Verse <hi>19. Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands loue your Wiues and be not bitter vnto them.</hi>

                        <p>Verse <hi>20. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, obey your Parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the LORD.</hi>

                        <p>Verse <hi>21. Fathers prouoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.</hi>
                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>23. And whatsoeuer yee do, do it heartily, as to the LORD, &amp; not vnto men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>24. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of the Lord ye shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the reward of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: for ye serue the Lord Christ.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Verse <hi>25. But hee that doth wrong, shall receiue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the wrong that he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </note> And the rather should you be subiect, because <hi>GOD</hi> hath prouided, you shall not be pressed, but in the <hi>LORD,</hi> not in any thing against the word.</p>
                  <p>Now for Husbands their word is loue, as that <hi>GOD</hi> most stends vpon and they most faile in. And in particular I giue them warning to looke to one vice aboue many, and that is, that they be not bitter to their Wiues.</p>
                  <p>And for children their word is obedience, and they must know that <hi>GOD</hi> so inioines it, that he will haue it done throughly, they must obey in all things, and submit their wills and desires to their parents. For this is a thing that will not only keepe and increase their parents loue to them, but it is also wondrous well-pleasing to <hi>GOD</hi> himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Parents also must take heed they sin not against their children, not only, by two much indulgence, but also by prouoking them, and that not only to sin, but to passion, by vniust precepts, or contumelies and disgraces, or hard vsage, or immoderate correction: and that as for other reasons so least they be discouraged either from loue of weldoing, or of obeying them.</p>
                  <p>You that are Seruants must also with great care attend your duties, your word also is obedience: and the rather because your Masters haue authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but only ouer your flesh, not ouer your consciences; but in your obedience see to it, it be in all things that concern the subiection of the outward man. But let not your seruice be onely when your Masters looke on, or fitted only to please men, but obey euen in the singlenesse of your hearts, as in <hi>GODS</hi> presence, where you should feare to displease.</p>
                  <p>Neither let what you do be done out of a slauish feare, but from the heart with all willingnes, as doing therein seruice to <hi>GOD,</hi> and not to men only.</p>
                  <p>Knowing infallibly that if men would not reward you for your paines and faithfulnes, yet <hi>GOD</hi> will, who will not vse you as seruants, but prouide for you as sons and heires to him. For in all this labor <hi>GOD</hi> accounts you as the seruants of Christ, and will reward all as if all had bin done to him.</p>
                  <p>And contrariwise he that doth wrong be he Master or Seruant shall receiue of the <hi>LORD</hi> for the wrong that he hath done: for <hi>GOD</hi>
is no accepter of persons.</p>

The Apostle hath before discoursed of matters of faith: now he intends to intreat of matters of life:<note place="margin">The deuision of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> and to prescribe rules of conuersation. And these rules belong either to our generall calling as we are Christians or to our particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings as we are people of such or such condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or state of life.</p>
                        <p>The generall rules are set downe from the first verse of this Chapter to the eighteenth and the particular rules begin at the eighteenth verse and continue to the second verse of the next Chapter.</p>
                        <p>The rules of the first kind may be referred to three heads,<note place="margin">The subdiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</note> for either they concerne, first the meditation of heauenly things, or secondly the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vice, or thirdly the renouation of life. The meditation of heauenly things is vrged from v. 1. to the fift, the mortification of vice is vrged from v. 5. to the tenth. Renouation of life is generally laid down v. 10.11. and more specially opened v. 12 to the eighteenth.</p>
                        <p>The exhortation to the care and studie of heauenlie things is thus dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted. First it is expounded v. 1. Secondlie it is illustrated v. 2. Thirdly it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by motiues and reason, v. 3.4. And thus for the order of the whole Chapter, and the generall frame of this first part.</p>
                        <p>Before I open the words more particularly there are diuerse things may be noted from the coherence and dependence of these words,<note n="4" place="margin">Doctrine from cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> with the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before, and the matter following in this Chapter.</p>
                        <p>From the coherence with the former Chapter I obserue these things-First, that there can be no holinesse of life without faith: and therefore the Apostle first instructeth them in matters of faith. It is a true rule, <hi>whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne,</hi> and may be extended further then things indifferent, while we are out of Gods fauour,<note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23.</note> and know not our reconciliation and iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Christ, our best actions are but faire sinnes. <hi>For without faith it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to please God</hi> 
                           <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that the terrestriall blessednesse of man is in respect of sinne, two waies principally assaulted First with errors in opinion. Secondly, with corruptions in manners. And against both we should learne from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle in the latter part of the former Chapter and the first part of this, to be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:21380:160"/>
armed and furnished with holy directions, and meditations.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that these men that are so superstitiouslie earnest and so zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louslie forward for ceremonies and the traditions and obseruations of men,<note place="margin">Doctrines fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the coherence in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> whatsoeuer they protest or pretend or seem to be, are indeed void of true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and feruent affection to heauenly things<hi rend="sup">c</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, that he that is by faith made a new creature, must resolue to be at Gods appointment for his whole carriage in his generall and particular calling <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.10.</note>.<note place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>Thus of the coherence with the former Chapters. From the order of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in this Chapter two things may be noted.<note place="margin">2</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, that before a man can be good in his <hi>particular calling,</hi> he must first be good in his <hi>generall:</hi> thou maist be painfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and diligent, but thou canst not be euerie way a faithfull and sound hearted,<note place="margin">3</note> husband, wife, seruant, child, &amp;c. till thou be a good man or good woman, in respect of grace and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And therefore we should <hi>first seeke the righteousnesse of Gods kingdome,</hi> and it may serue for direction, vnto such as choose wiues or seruants, or the like:<note place="margin">4</note> if they be not faithfull to God, how canst thou be assured they will prooue faithfull to thee? moreouer wouldst thou haue thy seruants or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be amended, then bring them to the powerfull preaching of the word, and call vpon them to get into the fellowship of the godly, that they may learne to be good abroad in matters of religion, and then thou maist hope to find them by proofe and daily experience, trustie and faithfull in thy businesse,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Doctr.</hi> 2.</note> finallie this reprooues both the sinfulnesse and follie of many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ents and masters they neuer care so their seruants do their worke, though they altogether neglect <hi>Gods worke.</hi> And many times they restraine their seruants and children, and will not let them heare sermons or come into godly companie, as if that were the way to make them idle and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse: whereas we see the cleane contrary to be true.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that men are neuer likelie to hold out and proue sound in the reformation and new obedience of their liues, till they fall in loue with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenlie things, and grow in some measure wearie of the world and the things thereof.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>
                           </note>Thus of the generall obseruations from the twofold coherence. Now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the particular opening of the words.</p>
                        <p>In the proposition of the exhortation to the study of heauenly things, laied downe in this verse, two things are to bee considered; first what: or the dutie required, viz. seeke those things which are aboue? secondly, why: or the reasons to enforce the dutie, and they are foure. First, ye are risen with Christ in the first resurrection. Secondly, these things are aboue, and not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without seeking or studie. Thirdly, Christ is aboue in his bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. Fourthly, Christ sits at the right hand of God, exalted in the glory of his father, each of these strongly conclude the exhortation, as will further appeare in the particular handling of them.</p>

                           <hi>Traditions</hi> &amp; mans inuentions which the Apostle hath before taxed, may well be called things on earth. 1 Because they spring from the earth and earthly minded men, they were neuer inspired from God, nor deuised by heauenly minded men. 2 Because they hinder them that are deuoted to them, from looking vp, or attaining any insight in things that are aboue.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21380:163"/>
3 Because these by effect make men more earthly and sensuall: but of these in the former chapter.</p>
                        <p>The workes of the flesh, and the corruptions of life to bee auoyded, and not affected, are the third sort of things on earth: but of that also afterwards in the second part of the generall duties; especially in the fifth verse. So that the second sort of things on earth remaineth to be more largely considered, those are profits, honours, pleasures, friends, health, and long life.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The first may be taken from the condition of man on earth. For we are heere but <hi>pilgrims and strangers</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>The second may be taken from the disability of earthly things. For first they cannot so much as fill or satisfie a mans heart. 2 They cannot fence a man against any of the trials of God, when the <hi>houre of tentation comes</hi>

loue of earthly things. For, first <hi>the cares of the world choake the word,</hi> that it can neuer prosper <note n="p" place="margin">

                        <p>The fifth reason may be taken from the basenes of the nature of all these things: for they are not onely <hi>on the earth,</hi> but <hi>of the earth:</hi> and if they bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

                        <p>In the first chapter, among other things, these may be noted. 1 That after a man hath trauailed to get what he can, how small a portion in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of the whole, hath he atchiued? so as he may say to himselfe when he hath done, <hi>What now remaineth to me of all my trauell which I haue suffered vnder the sunne?</hi> 2 If a man could get neuer so much, yet he cannot liue to enioy it long.<note n="a" place="margin">

                              <hi>v.</hi> 4.5.6.</note>. The like may be shewed of the aire and water. 3 <hi>All things are full of labor no man can vtter it</hi>

                              <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note>. And certainly many times earthly things gained, answer not the labor spent about them. 4 Earthly things pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, will not satisfie, <hi>The eye will not be satisfied with seeing, nor the eare with hearing</hi> 
                           <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note>. 5 A man can compasse nothing that is new, for <hi>there is nothing new vnder the sunne</hi> 
                           <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 9.10.</note>. Is there any thing of which one may say behold this is new, and neuer was before? they haue beene already in the old time that was before vs. 6 The Lord in wonderfull wisdome and righteousnes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits in the nature of man, those cares that they may be <hi>trauels to humble and breake the heart of man</hi> 
                           <note n="f" place="margin">

                        <p>In the second chapter we may obserue these reasons. First, let a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vnto himselfe the fullest and fairest vse of all sorts of earthly things: pleasure,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ch.</hi> 2.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.</note> laughter, great houses, gardens, orchards, waters, fruit-trees, woods, seruants, cattell, siluer and gold, treasures and musicke, yet all these will not deliuer a man from s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>tiety, loathing and vexation of spirit. So as he may truely say, <hi>there is no profit in them.</hi> 2 In these things there is <hi>one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to all: it befalleth to the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>se man as it doth to the foole</hi> 
                           <note n="h" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 14.15.</note>. 3 Let a man excell neuer so much, yet within a short time all will be forgotten. <hi>For all that, that now is, in the dayes to come shall all be forgotten</hi> 
                           <note n="i" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 16.</note>. Fourthly, when thou hast gotten all thou canst together, thou knowest not whether he shall be a wise man or a foole, that shall enioy them after thee <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 19.</note>. Fiftly to attaine those things men vsually spend their dayes in sorrow, trauaile and griefe, and their hearts take no rest in the night <note n="l" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 23.</note>.</p>
                        <p>In the third chapter these further reasons may be noted. First, all things are swayed with the swinge of their seasons and times.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ch.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.</note> So as nothing is stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, though be borne, and now plant and build, and laugh and daunce, and embrace and sowe and loue and liue in peace: yet there will bee a time to plucke vp, and breake downe, and weepe, and mourne, and cast away, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:21380:164"/>
hate; and mourne, and die to. Secondly, though the Lord should set the world in a mans heart, yet he might spend all his daies and neuer know the full nature of these things<note n="m" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 11.</note>. Thirdly, all things are subiect to Gods vnauoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble disposing. Let man get what he can, yet God will haue the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it: and <hi>whatsoeuer God shall doe, it shall abide, to it can no man adde, and from it can none diminish. And this God will doe that man may feare him</hi> 
                           <note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 14.</note>. Fourthly, such is the state of the children of men, that they may loose all they haue at the very <hi>place of iudgement</hi> 
                           <note n="o" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 16.</note>. Fiftly, yea the very state of mortified men, in the reason of carnall men, because of these oppressions and vncertainties, seems little better, then the state of beasts<note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 18.</note>.</p>
                        <p>In the fourth Chapter note,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ch.</hi> 4.1.2.3</note> first that when a man hath set his heart vpon these earthly things, if euer he loose them, he is filled almost with vnmedici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable teares and sorrow, so as he would <hi>praise the dead aboue the liuing,</hi> and wish he had neuer been borne. Secondly, they are occasions of a mans enuie<note n="q" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 4.</note>. Thirdly, the eying of these things, infatuats many a mans heart: so as we may see many a man that hath neither sonne nor daughter, nor brother, and yet there is no end of his trauell, and he hath not the iudgement, to say with himselfe, <hi>for whom doe I trauaile, and defraud my selfe of pleasure.</hi>
                           <note n="r" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note> Fourthly, a man may get much with sore trauaile, and liue to see himselfe despised of him for whom he prouideth them: so as they that shall come after him will not reioice in him.<note n="s" place="margin">
                              <hi>v</hi> 15.16.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the fift chapter there are also seauen other reasons. First, these earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie things lead the greatest men into bondage, by dependance. For the <hi>King cannot consist without the tilling of the field.</hi> Secondly, <hi>he that loueth siluer shall not be satssified with siluer,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.8.</note> 
                           <hi>and he that loueth riches shall be without the fruit thereof</hi>
                           <note n="t" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 9.</note>. Thirdly, when goods increase, they are increased also that eate them, and what good commeth to the owners thereof, but the beholding of them with their eies.<note n="u" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 10.</note> Fourthly, many times the seruant sleepeth, when the master can get no sleepe<note n="x" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 11.</note>. Fiftly, there is an euill sicknesse often seene vnder the sunne, that riches are kept for the owners ruine<note n="y" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 12.</note>. Sixtly, or else they will perish while the master looketh on<note n="z" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 13.14.15.</note>. Seuenthly, but certaine it is, he can car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie nothing out of the world when he goeth, but must leaue them where he found them.</p>
                        <p>In the sixt Chapter there are these reasons.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.1. to 7.</note> First, a man may haue all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance and yet not haue a heart to vse them and so be worse then an <hi>vntimely fruit.</hi> Secondly, what needs all this adoe: for <hi>all is but for the mouth</hi>
and nature is content with a little. And therefore to haue a soule so vnsati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably greedy of hauing, is a prodigious madnesse<note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 7.</note>. Thirdly, the hauing of all these things makes not a wise man bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>er then a foole: &amp; what wants a poore man,<note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 8.</note> if he know how to carrie himselfe with the wise. Fourthly, all cannot make thee cease to be mortall. <hi>For it is knowen man cannot striue with him that is stronger than he</hi>
                           <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>v. vlt.</hi>
                           </note>.</p>
                        <p>In the seauenth Chapter there is this reason. A man may spend all his daies before he can come soundly to know (after many trialls) what is the best vse to put these earthly things to.</p>
                        <p>And for honor, in the eighth Chapter three things are worthie noting. First, <hi>a man is not Lord of his owne spirit,</hi> to keepe himselfe aliue in his honor<note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.8.</note>. Secondly, many men rule to their owne ruine<note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 9.</note>. Thirdly, men after death are quickly forgotten. They that come backe from the holy place remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth them not long. Yea a man may be quickly forgotten in <hi>the City where he hath done right</hi>
                           <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 10.</note>.</p>
                        <p>And in the ninth Chapter,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.1.</note> two reasons more are added. First, no man can know the loue or hatred of God by these things. Secondly, they are not gotten alwaies, by helpe of meanes. For the race is not alwaies to the swift,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:21380:165"/>
nor the battell to the strong, nor riches to men of vnderstanding, nor fauor to the wise: which makes the Atheist and Epicure conclude, that time and chance commeth to all things.</p>
                        <p>The summe of all that <hi>Salomon</hi> can say is, vanity of vanities all is vanity. And now that we haue heard <hi>Solomon,</hi> let vs in the next place heare a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Salomon.</p>
                        <p>Our Sauiour Christ in the sixt of <hi>Mathew,</hi> diuides the care of earthlie things into two sorts.<note place="margin">Our Sauiours reasons.</note> For either men are greedily transported with the desire of getting treasures, that is abundance and superfluities: or else they toile their hearts with distrustfull and distracting cares, about necessaries, as what they shall eat, and what they shall put on. From the first kind of care, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades with foure reasons. First, all treasures are subiect either to vanity or violence.<note place="margin">Foure reasons against the care for super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities.</note> Either the moth will eat them, or the theefe will steale them<note n="g" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.19.20</note>. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, these things bewitch and steale away mens hearts <note n="h" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 21.</note>. Thirdly, the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of these things, darkneth the eie of the soule, with greater darknesse then can be exprest<note n="i" place="margin">
                              <hi>v</hi> 22.23.</note>. Fourthly, <hi>a man cannot serue God and riches</hi>
                           <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 24.</note>.</p>
                        <p>From the second kind of care he dehorts with eight reasons. First, the life is more worth then meat, and the body than raiment<note n="l" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 25.</note>. And if the lord haue giuen the greater why should he not be trusted for the lesse?<note place="margin">Eight reasons against distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting cares for necessaries</note> Secondly, God prouideth for the very foules that haue not such meanes as man hath: and will he not prouide for man <note n="m" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 26.</note>? Thirdly, all thy care will not adde one cubit to thy stature<note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 27.</note>, but if thou wouldst swelt thy heart out, tis God only must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease thy strength or health. Fourthly, this care is a signe of little faith<note n="o" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 30.</note>. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, tis for Gentiles that know not God nor the couenant of his grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Christ, to seeke after these things <note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 32.</note>. Tis a grosse shame for any Christian to be so heathenish. Sixtly, doth not your heauenly father know all that you need <note n="q" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 32.</note>. If he be a father, hath he not will? and if he be in heauen, hath he not power to helpe? Seuenthly, you haue a flat promise that if you seeke the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen and the righteousnesse thereof (which should take vp your chiefest care) all these things without such carking, so farre as is needfull shall be cast vpon you <note n="r" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 33.</note>. Lastly, hath not euery day his euill? and is not the griefe of the day great enough? why then dost thou distract thy selfe for to morrow assure thy selfe the time to come,<note n="s" place="margin">

The first is in this verse, the later in the next verse.</p>
                        <p>There are two things in the condition of the faithfull on earth which should make them little to mind earthly things or desire to continue long in the world.</p>
                        <p>First that in respect of distresses, they are as dead men while they liue Secondly, that the happinesse they haue (which is the life of their liues) doth not appeare, but is hid with God in Christ.</p>

                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19.</note>, in respect of iustification: so as now the faithfull doe no longer waite vpon the law for righteousnesse but vpon a second marriage they haue it from him that was raised from the dead for them.</p>
                        <p>They are dead to the world, and that in three respects. First, in respect of their owne voluntary forsaking of the world, and their mortifying of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desires, ioined with a sence of their owne mortality: so was <hi>Paul</hi> as a man crucified to the world<note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14.</note> Secondly, in respect of the worlds account of them. For so soone as men get any true grace and retire themselues from the excesses of the time they are neglected and forgotten as dead men out of mind. Thirdly, in respect of the multitude of afflictions which doe many times ouerwhelme and drowne Christians. It is not vnusuall in scripture to say of men in desperate crosses they are dead men. The Prophet <hi>Esay</hi>
calls the people in captiuity dead men, when he saith, <hi>thy dead m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

his outward glory of his life amongst men, was obscured by the many crosses he sustained for our sins<note n="d" place="margin">

Thirdly, his life was hid in the graue. Fourthly, it was hid in respect of the horrors he felt in his soule, the Lord as it were hiding his louing countenance from him for the time. Fiftly, his glory in Heauen is hid from the world, and the Saints on earth haue but a glimpse of it. All this may comfort vs, seeing nothing can befall vs but what hath befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len our head, and if the world will not acknowledge our glory, and the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the profession of sincerity, it matters not, it could not see the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Christ, when he was on earth.</p>

                        <p>There is noted to be a threefold Iudgement. The <hi>first Iudgement</hi> and that was accomplished on man and Angels at their first fall, then there is <hi>a middle Iudgement:</hi>

Neither is the assurance of the Iudgement to come waranted by the words of Gods seruants, onely but the Lord hath left many works of his owne, as pledges that he will once at length for all iudge the whole world for sin.

                        <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Where shall it bee?</note> if any aske where this iudgement shall be? I answer, that seeing the Lord hath not determined it, it is curious to enquire, and more curious to assigne the very place: as some haue that wrote it, should be in the valley of <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi>: or as others would haue it, on Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> whence he ascended. This we know it shall bee neere the earth,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 4.17.</note> in the clouds of Heauen, where Christs throne shall be set, and further then this we need not enquire.</p>
                        <p>There haue beene also many opinions about the time when it should be.<note place="margin">When shall the day of Iudgement bee?</note> Some thought, that as the world was sixe dayes in creating and then the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth of rest came. So the world should last 6000. yeares (reckoning a 1000. yeares as one day) and then should come the eternall Saboath. Others distribute the times thus, 2000. yeere before the Law, 2000. yeeres vnder
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:21380:168"/>
the law, and 2000. yeers after the law, and then comes the iudgement. Others thought the world would last after Christ, so long as it was to the flood from the creation, and that was as they say, 1656. yeers. Others thought it should be as long to the iudgement after Christ, as it was from <hi>Moses</hi> to Christ, and that should be 1582. yeers. this experience hath proued false. Other say Christ liued 33. yeeres, and the world should continue for 33. Iubilies after Christ. What can be said of all or the most of these opinions and such like, but euen this, that they are the blind fancies of men. For is there not a plaine restraint laid vpon men, in this question, when the Lord Iesus said, <hi>it is not for you to know the times and seasons, which the father hath put in his owne power</hi>
                           <note n="l" place="margin">
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 1.7.</note>. <hi>And of that day and hower knoweth no man no not the Angells of heauen: but my father only</hi>
                           <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.36. <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.32.</note>. And the Euangelist <hi>S. Marke</hi> addeth, <hi>that the sonne of man himselfe knoweth not the day and hower.</hi> Not that simply Christ is ignorant of the time of the last iudgement,<note place="margin">How it is that the sonne is said to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> but he was said not to know, because he kept it from our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Or else he knew it not as he was man, or rather <hi>in his estate of humiliation,</hi> and in his humane nature, he did not precisely know it. But that hinders not but that in his <hi>estate of exaltation,</hi> as he is now in heauen, and hath all <hi>power</hi> and <hi>iudgement committed vnto him,</hi> he may and doth fully vnderstand it.</p>
                        <p>But letting these things passe, the principall things for vs to be informed in is concerning the day of iudgement, and this last appearance of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, are these three.

According to that of the Apostle: <hi>they that haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without the law shall perish without the law: and they that haue sinned vnder the law, shall be iudged by the law</hi>
                           <note n="l" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12.</note>. And our sauiour saith, <hi>He that refuseth me and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth not my words, hath one that iudgeth him: the word that I haue spoken it shall iudge him in the last day</hi>

And the faithfull shall be iudged by the Gospell euen by all those comforts and promises contained in, or belonging to the couenant of grace, applied to them in this life, and must fully then bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and accomplished. For the sentence at the last day shall be but a more manifest declaration of that iudgement the Lord in this life,<note place="margin">Secondly, by what euidence man shall be iudged.</note> most an end by his word hath past vpon man.</p>
                        <p>For the second, the euidence shall be giuen in principally by the opening of three bookes. The one is the <hi>booke of conscience,</hi> and the other <hi>the booke of life</hi>
                           <note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>Reuel.</hi> 20.12.</note>, and the third the <hi>booke of Gods remembrance</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:21380:169"/>
                           <hi>conscience</hi> may at that day giue in fuller euidence, it is certaine that after the resurrection, it shall be almost infinitely extended by the power of God to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse this last testimony both in the good and in the euill. <hi>The booke of life</hi> is Gods sacred and eternall record of all those persons that were foreordained into life, of all ages and nations. <hi>The booke of remembrance</hi> will exactly expresse without all failing or mistaking, all the inclinations, thoughts, affections, words and deeds, with all circumstances, or occasions and whatsoeuer else, may illustrate either the goodnesse of good men, or the transgression of the wicked.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">What the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence will containe.</note>For the third. The sentence will be vpon either the godly or the wicked. The sentence vpon the godly will containe, first, the opening of Gods eternall counsell, and his vnsearchable loue, wherein he hath resolued and begun to declare his will, to blesse euery one of the elect<note n="q" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34.</note>. Secondly, a manifestation of all the righteousnesse, desired, thought vpon, spoken or done, by the godly<note n="r" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.</note> and that with such feruency of affection in Christ, that he will see and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nothing but goodnesse in good men <note n="s" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.34. to 41.</note>. Thirdly, a finall and generall absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and redeeming of them, from the guilt and power of all sinne, from the beginning of the world,<note n="t" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.</note> in <hi>Adam</hi> or themselues. So as there shall neuer be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sinne in them, or accusation of sinne against them. Fourthly, ordination to glory, by appointing euery one of them to inherit the kingdome prepared for them before the foundation of the world. Contrariwise the sentence of the wicked shall containe. First, a declaration of Gods eternall and iust ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of them<note n="u" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41.</note>. Secondly, a full manifestation and ripping vp, before all men and Angells, of all their sinnes both of nature and action, both against God or men, or their owne bodies and soules, secret and open of what kind soeuer<note n="x" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.</note>. Thirdly, a most terrible denunciation of Gods eternall curse and horrible or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination to those eternal torments prepared for them,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.</note> together with the diuell and his Angells.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto of the iudgement it selfe. The consequents of the iudgement fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And they are fiue. First, <hi>the firing of the world:</hi> that is the dissolution of the world by a wonderfull fire that shall inclose all, so as the world shall not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, till it be renewed againe, and come out of that fire as out of a fornace, for as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith. <hi>The heauens being on fire shall passe away and be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued with a noise, and the elements shall melt with heat, and the earth with the works therof shall be burnt vp.</hi> And there shall be then, <hi>new heauens,</hi> and new earth, that is as it were a new refined<note n="x" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.</note>. And the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, the heauens and the earth shall flie away from the face of him that sitteth on the throne<note n="y" place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10.12</note>.</p>
                        <p>The second consequent shall be <hi>the chasing of the wicked to hell</hi>: execution being speedily and fearefully done vpon them, with all horror and hast by the Angells.</p>
                        <p>The third shall be <hi>the libertie of the creatures.</hi> I meane the rest of the creatures besides men and Angells.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19. to 23.</note> But because this is a point somewhat obscure, I will endeauour in a few words to resolue a doubt or two. <hi>Que.</hi> First, how are the creatures now in bondage that they shall need then any liberty.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Que.</hi> 1.</note> 
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> They are in bondage in diuerse respects.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ans.</hi>
                           </note> For first they are fraile and corruptible, and so in bondage to corruption.<note place="margin">The creatures in bondage in seuen respects.</note> Secondly, they are subiect to confusions and inconstancy: as may appeare by the almost infinit mutations, in the aire, earth, seas, fire. Thirdly, they are now forced to serue wicked men. The sunne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> shines vpon the vniust as well as the iust. The heauen makes fruitfull with her <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> shewers and influence, the field of the wicked as well as the iust. The earth is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> driuen to feed and to receiue into hir bosome, the vngodly as well as the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And this is a bondage. Fourthly, the visible creatures are Gods great booke to proclaime the inuisible things of God: now they stand alwaies ready and reading too, and men will not learne by them. And so these good masters lose
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:21380:169"/>
all their labour, and this is a bondage to bee tied to teach such as will not learne. Fiftly, the creature is made not onely the instrument, but many times the subiect of mans punishment for his sinnes. As the earth is made iron, and the heauens brasse for mans sake, and this is a great bondage. Sixtly, the creature intends immortality, which while it failes of in the dying or expiring of the particulars of euery sort, it would supply for the preseruation at least of the kindes, by a perenniall substitution of new particulars in euery kinde: and yet loseth all this labour, because all things must be dissolued, and must be restored by another way knowen to God and not now to nature. But espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the creatures may be sayd to be in bondage, because since the fall, the more illustrious instincts and vigors of the most of the creatures are darkned, decayed,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ob. Sol.</hi>
                           </note> dulled and distempred in them. Oh but might some one say, how can this bondage be ascribed vnto the heauens? <hi>Sol.</hi> The heauens are not so perfect but they may admit enlargement of their excellency. Besides they serue now promiscuously to the vse of bad aswell as good, neither are the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heauens without their feeblenesse, and the manifest effects of fainting old age. And therefore by a <hi>prosopopaeia</hi> they may be sayd to groane together with the rest of the creatures vnder the common burthen and vanity vnto which they are subdued. It is obserued that since the dayes of <hi>Ptolomey</hi> the sunne runnes neerer the earth by 9976. Germane miles, and therefore the heauens haue not kept their first perfection.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ob.</hi> But how can this vanity or bondage bee in any sence ascribed to the Angels.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ob. Sol,</hi>
                           </note> 
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> There is no necessity to include the Angels in the number of the groaning creatures. And yet it will bee easie to shew that they sustaine a kinde of bondage: for they are now made to serue earthly things, men haue their Angels to attend on them. And it is thought they haue a kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency or presidency either ouer nations or in moouing the orbes of Heauen. Besides they are put to inflict punishments on wicked men as on Sodome. Further they performe seruice sometimes not attaining their owne ends. And lastly comparatiuely, at least their felicity in the creation was not so absolute as it shall be in Christ: for if his comming adde not vnto them a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent condition of nature, yet out of all question it addes a fuller measure both of knowledge and ioy.</p>

For when Christ hath finally and fully subdued Sathan, death and wicked men, and hath fully reconciled the elect to God, then will there be no word of any such gouernement in Heauen as was on earth. He shall not neede any longer to rule them, either by ciuill Magistrates, or by his need and discipline, or by any other way, which onely did agree to the times of the Churches warfare and pilgrimage: but he shall neuer cease to liue and triumph with them, in all

Perfections of happy contentment and glory. Thus of the consequents of Iudgement. And thus also of the doctrine of Christs last appearance. The vses follow.</p>

How can it but be terrible? when the holy Ghost giues warning that the Lord Iesus will then shew himselfe from Heauen, with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire to render vengeance on all those that knowe not God and haue not obeyed the Gospell: How can it bee but terrible? when wicked men shall be punished with euerlasting perdition, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power? how can it but be terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? when they shall feele their conscience exquisitly griping them, and gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon them, and when they shall see the diuels to torment them, and hell to deuoure them: when they shall see the world burning about them, and the good Angels forcing them away, and all both men and Angels applauding their Iudgement, and knowing all their sinnes: they must not thinke that the Iudge will deale then as he doth now. Now he iudgeth them secretly euery day, but it is many times insensibly, or with lesser plagues: but then hee will most openly poure vpon them the full vials of his wrath. Heere they are iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged that they may be amended, but there their iudgement shall be that they may be confounded: for there will be no place of repentance. Deceiue not thy selfe, Christ will not come the second time as he came the first: he came then to be iudged, but now to iudge, he shall then be seene with terror that was before looked vpon with contempt: he shewed his patience in his first comming, but now he will shew his power: he appeared then in the form of a seruant, but now he will appeare in the forme of a King, greater then all kings. Then hee professed not to iudge any man, but now hee proclaimeth hee will iudge all men. It was commonly thought if any man saw God he should die: alas, alas, how then shall these wofull wretches doe, that must see him in the vnutterable fiercenesse of his irefull indignation? if the powers of heauen shall be shaken at his pleasure, oh how shall the miserable heart of the guilty sinner be rent into a 1000. peeces, with vnmedicinable sorrowes? if <hi>Foelix</hi> tremble to heare tell of iudgement, what will poore <hi>Foelix</hi> doe, when he must feele iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both in the sentence and execution? if the word of Christ on earth had such power as it had in the garden, to strike stubborne hearted men to the earth, what power (thinke we) will it haue when he speakes as the Lord from Heauen? When <hi>Ezechiel, Daniel,</hi> and the Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi> and others sawe but one Angell, in a lesser manifestation of his glorie, comming as a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of good tydings, they fall downe, and are full of singular feare: if the sight of one Angell bee so terrible, what will the sight of all the thousand thousands of Angels be? especially when they come clothed with all their brightnes of glory? and if good men that had good consciences were so frighted, what shall become of euill men with their euill consciences? and if the messengers of good tydings doe so amaze, how shall the executioners of a most terrible sentence, compasse them about with confusion both of face and heart? if the drowning of the old world, the burning of Sodome, the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the earth to swallow vp <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and such like iudgments, haue so much horrour in them: how then can any tongue expresse or heart now conceiue, the horror of this day when all the millions of wicked men shall be deliuered vp to those eternall and remedilesse torments? if it bee such a shame to doe pennance for one fault, in one congregation, where men will
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:21380:170"/>
pray for the offendour. What a shame will it be when all thy faults, shall be discouered, before all the whole world, without all hope of pitty or helpe?</p>
                        <p>Nor is it possible for them to escape this fearful Iudgement; the Iudge will not be vnconstant, nor will he take reward, he will not be ouerlayd with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of businesses, he will no way be corrupted in iudgement. Not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare is impossible and to appeare is intollerable. heere will be no respect of persons, nor will the Iudge care how it be taken, nor will he be deceiued with colours and circumstances. He hath tarried so long, he cannot be charged with rashnesse, nor can there be a hiding of any particulars from him. Euery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, thought, desire, word and worke shall surely come to Iudgement. And lastly, there can be no impediment to hinder execution.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, vpon the meditation of this last iudgement diuerse lessons for our instruction are inforced.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Vse</hi> 2.</note> First, it should restraine vncharitable iudging and censuring one of another, for lesse matters especially for things indifferent. <hi>Who art thou that iudgest another mans seruant? he standeth or falleth to his owne

master. Christ is the Lord of quicke and dead.</hi> And therfore <hi>why dost thou condemne thy brother? or why dost thou despise thy brother? for we shall all appeare before the iudgement seat of Christ'.</hi> In as much as the Lord Iesus Christ, will iudge the secrets of all hearts, and giue a iust triall to the actions of all men, why should we forestall his iudgement, or in doubtfull matters,<note n="b" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.</note> arrogate to our selues this honor of Christ? if we could consider that we shall <hi>then euery one giue accounts vnto God for himselfe</hi>
                           <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12.13</note>, we should find worke enough to doe to looke to our owne score. <hi>Let vs not therefore brethren iudge one another any more.</hi> Secondly, are there any matters of difference amongst vs? let the saints iudge them and end them <note n="d" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2.</note>: God will be contented to put his cause to them, at the last day (<hi>for we know the Saints shall iudge the world</hi>) and therefore why should we refuse their arbitration? Thirdly, it should order and moderate our sorrowes for our dead friends. <hi>We should not sorrow as people without hope: seeing we beleeue that all that sleepe in Iesus, God will bring with him</hi>
                           <note n="e" place="margin">1 <hi>Thes</hi> 4.13.14.17.18.</note>. We shall meet together againe in that day, and afterwards liue with the Lord together for euer. And therefore we should comfort one another with these words. Fourthly, this summons to iudgement, giues a dreadfull warning and <hi>admonition</hi> to the world, <hi>euen to all men euery where to repent. Inasmuch as God hath appointed a day wherein he will iudge the world in righteousnesse, by the man whom he hath appointed, wherof he hath giuen an assurance in that he raised him from the dead</hi>
                           <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Act.</hi> 17.32.</note>: <hi>Woe will be vnto vs, if that</hi> day come vpon vs vnawares, before we haue made our peace, and humbled our selues before God, and by vnfained repentance turned from all our euill waies. It is an vnsearchable compassion, that God shewes, when he offers vs this mercie, that <hi>if we will iudge our selues we shall not be iudged of the Lord in that day</hi>
                           <note n="g" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.34.</note>: And it will on the other side excessiuely incense his wrath, when hauing such grace offered, we neglect it, and death and iudgement find our sinnes, both vnremitted on Gods part, and vnrepented on ours. Fiftly, <hi>Seeing all these things must be dissolued, how should it</hi> fire vs, and daily quicken our dead and drowsie spirits, to a constant care of all possible <hi>holy conuersation and godlinesse</hi>
                           <note n="h" place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12.</note>, vnles we would discouer our selues either to be Atheists, that mocke at the iudgement to come, or men giuen to a spirit of slumber, that in soule sleepe it out, and will not consider our latter end.</p>
                        <p>Seing we are all Gods stewards, let vs arme our selues as they that must then giue accounts of our stewardship. And since we haue all receiued some of Gods talents, and gifts in our seuerall places, let vs be carefull to approue our selues to be good seruants and faithfull, such as can returne them with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, least the portion of the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that hid his masters talents in the earth, fall vpon vs. Lastly since the day of iudgement is the day of our full and finall redemption, and since he shall come as a thiefe in the night, euen in the hower that we thinke not: let vs therefore watch<note n="i" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.44.</note>, and be ready, alwaies carefull and diligent, sighing and groaning, longing and praying<note n="k" place="margin">

                        <p>Thirdly, this may be a singular comfort to all mortified and penitent chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: they may lift vp their heads, and reioice with ioy vnspeakable and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.<note place="margin">

                              <hi>Sol.</hi>
                           </note> There is no sparke of terror in this doctrine to a godly mind. For what should he feare? if he either consider the fauour of the iudge or the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the iudgement. For the Iudge is he that hath beene all this while their <hi>aduocate</hi>
                           <note n="n" place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.1.</note>, to plead their suits by making intercession for them. And therefore when he comes to sit in iudgement, he cannot goe against his owne pleading. He is their <hi>brother,</hi> and caries a most brotherly affection: and will he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne his owne brethren? he is their <hi>head,</hi> and hath performed all the offices
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21380:171"/>
of a head vnto them, and can he then faile them, when they haue most need of him? nay it is he that hath been iudged for vs on earth, and will he iudge against vs in heauen? what shall I say: he died for vs to shew his vndoubted loue, euen that he might redeeme vs as a peculiar people to God, and will he faile vs in the last act, when he should once for all accomplish his redemption for vs? besides he hath already promised to acquite vs in that day, and it hath been often confirmed both in the word and the sacraments and praier: he hath left many pledges of his loue with vs, and therefore it were shamefull vnbeliefe to doubt his terror. What though he be terrible to wicked men? yet by iudging in seuerity he hath not nor cannot loose the goodnesse of his own mercy: what should we feare him iudging in his power, when we haue felt saluation in his name? besides the manner of the iudgement shalbe in all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and mercy. Thou shalt not be wronged by false witnesses, nor shalt thou be iudged by common fame or outward appearance: the iudge will not be transported with passion or spleen, nor will he condemne thee to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the people: and besides there shall be nothing remembred but what good thou hast sought or done. And not the least goodnesse but it shall be found to honor and praise at that day. And if it were such a fauour to a base subiect if the King should take notice of him to loue him and should in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Parliament before all the Lords and commons make a long speech in the particular praises of such a subiect: what shall it be, when the Lord Iesus, in a greater assembly then euer was since the world stood, shall particularly declare Gods euerlasting loue to them, and recite the praises (with his owne mouth) of all that hath been good, in thy thoughts, affections, words or works throughout all thy life, or in thy death? especially if thou adde the singular glory he will then adiudge thee too, by an irreuocable sentence. And so we come to the second appearance, viz. the appearance of christians in glory.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Then shall ye also appeare with him in glory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The glory that shall then be conferred vpon Christians may be considered either in their bodies or in their soules or both.<note place="margin">The glory of Christians, first in their bodies.</note> The glory of their bodies after the resurrection is threefold. For first they shall be <hi>immortall,</hi> that is in such a condition as they can neuer die againe or returne to dust. For <hi>this mortall then shall put on immortalitie</hi>
                           <note n="o" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53.</note> Secondly, they shall be <hi>incorruptible.</hi> That is not only free from <hi>putrefaction,</hi> but also from all weaknesse, both of <hi>infirmitie</hi> and <hi>defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</hi> For <hi>though it be sowen in weakenesse, yet it shall be raised in power, though it be sowen in dishonor and corruption yet it shall be raised in honor and incorruption</hi>
                           <note n="p" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42 43.</note>. Thirdly, they shall be <hi>spirituall</hi> not that our bodies shall vanish into ghosts or spirits: but because they shall be at that day so admirablie glorified and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that by the mighty working of Gods spirit, they shall be as able to liue without sleep, meat, mariage or the like, as now the Angells in heauen are: and besides they shall be so admirably light and agile, and swift, that they shal be able to go abroad with vnconceiueable speed, in the aire or heauens, as now they can goe surely on the earth<note n="q" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44.</note>. The glory vpon the soule, shall be the wonderfull perfection of Gods image in all the faculties of it. Then shall we know the secrets of heauen and earth. And then shall our memories will and affections be after an vnexpresseable manner, made conformable vnto God. The glory vpon both soule and body, shall be those riuers of ioies and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures for euer more. And thus shall the man be glorified that feareth the Lord.</p>
                        <p>The consideration of this glory, may serue for diuerse vses. First let vs all pray vnto God, vpon the knees of our hearts, from day to day, that as he is <hi>the father of glory,</hi> so he would giue vnto vs <hi>the spirit of reuelation,</hi> that the eies of our vnderstanding might be enlightned, to know in som comfortable measure, and that we might be able with more life &amp; affection, to meditate <hi>of the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

But a christian that hath <hi>so high a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and hopes for such a glorious end, should not alow himselfe in that dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heart: but as he gaineth sence by praier in other gifts of grace, so should he striue with importunity and constancy, wrastling with God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermission, so as no day should passe him, but he would remember this suit vnto God, till he could get some comfortable ability, to meditate of this excelling estate of endlesse glory.

Fiftly, <hi>Doe we looke for the mercy of our Lord Iesus Christ into eternall life</hi>? then we must (as the Apostle <hi>Iude</hi> sheweth) <hi>edifie our selues in our most holy faith, praiyng in the holy Ghost, and keepe our selues in the loue of God,</hi>

                              <hi>Iud.</hi> 20.21.</note> we must be afraid of whatsoeuer may estrange the Lord from vs, or any way darken the sence of his loue. For we may be assured, if we haue his fauour and walke before him in the sence of it, we shall haue glory when we die. Likewise, praying in the holy Ghost, with constancy and frequency doth maruellouslie enrich a Christian, both with the first fruits of glory, euen glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ioy on earth, and with the assurance of fulnesse of glory in heauen. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> seemes to say <hi>if loue be perfect in vs, we shall haue boldnesse in the day of iudgement</hi>
                           <note n="n" place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.17.</note>. As if he would import, that to be inwardly and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately acquainted with Christians on earth, is a notable meanes to procure vs gracious entertainment with Christ in heauen: especially if we perfect our loue, and grow to some Christian ripenesse in the practise of the duties of loue in a profitable fellowship in the Gospell. It is good discretion, to grow as great as we can with Christians, that so we may winne the fauour of Christ. Lastly, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> shewes in the second to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that <hi>they that seek glory and honor and immortality, and euerlasting life,</hi> must be <hi>patient in well doing. For they shall be rewarded according to their works.</hi> And <hi>to euery man that doth good, shall be honor and glory, and power, to the Iew first and also to the Grecian</hi>

We should bring to the particular opening of all the verses, a mind resolued of the generall. And to quicken vs a little the more, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of this doctrine, and to enforce the care of parting with our sinnes, I will briefly touch by the way some few reasons, why we should be willing to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all counsell that might shew vs any course to get rid of sinne. First, our vices are the fruits of our corrupted nature. They arise not from any noble or diuine instinct but are the effects of base flesh in vs. And we should carry the thoughts of it in our minds,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19.</note> when we are inclined or tempted to vice: we should say within our selues, this euill proceeds not from any thing that might declare greatnesse, or true spirit in a man: what is passion or lust or couetousnesse, but the base worke of the filthy degenerated flesh? Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> our vices are the only things that defile vs, and make vs loathsome before God and men. Tis not meane cloathes, or a deformed body, or a poore house, or homely fare, or any such thing that makes a man truly contemptible: no, no, it is only <hi>sinne can defile</hi>

                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.19.</note>: and bring that which is true contempt. Thirdly, the bond and forfeiture of the law or couenant of works lieth vpon the backe of euery man that liues in sinne without repentance. For the <hi>law is giuen to the lawlesse and disobedient</hi> (as the Apostle shewes) <hi>to vngodly and sinners, to whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, and liers,</hi> and to all that liue in any sinne <hi>contrary to wholesome doctrine</hi>

If it be referred to our rising with Christ, v. 1. then it notes that we can neuer haue our part in Christs resurrection, till we feele the vertue of his death killing sinne in vs. If it be referred to the meditation of heauenly things, then it notes that we can neuer set our affections on things that are aboue, till we haue mortified our members that are on earth. The corruption of our natures and liues are the cause of such disability to contemplate of or affect heauenly things. And as any are more sinfull they are more vnable thereunto. If the word be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the appearance of Christ in the former verse, then it imports that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is of great necessity vnto our preparation to the last iudgement, and will be of great request in the day of Christ.</p>

                           </hi>] To mortifie is to kill, or to apply that which will make dead.

                        <p>But the manifest doctrine from this word is this, that true repentance hath
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:21380:173"/>
in it the mortification of sinne. And so it implies diuerse things. First, that we must not let sinne alone till it die it selfe,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Note</hi>
                           </note> but we must kill sinne while it might yet liue. It is no repentance to leaue sinne when it leaueth vs: or to giue it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer when we can commit it no longer. Secondly, that true repentance makes a great alteration in a man. Thirdly, that it hath in it, paine and sorrow. men vse not to die ordinarily without much paine, and sure it is sinne, hath a strong heart,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Note.</hi>
                           </note> it is not soon killed: it is one thing to sleep, another thing to die: many men with lesse adoe get sinne asleepe, that it doth not so stirre in them, but alas, there must be more ado to get it dead, by true mortification. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, true repentance extinguisheth the power of sinne and the vigour of it. It makes it like a dead corps, that neither it stirs it selfe, nor will be stirred, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, perswasions commandements or st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>oaks. It is a wonderfull testimony of sound mortification when we haue gotten our old corruption to this passe: and constancy in prayer and hearing and daily confession and sorrow for sin will bring it to be thus with vs: especially if we striue with God and be earnest with spirituall importunity, watching the way of our owne hearts, to wound sinne so soone as we see it beginne to stirre. Yet I would not be mistaken as if I meant that a Christian could attaine such a victory ouer sinne, that it should not bee in him at all, nor that hee should euer bee stirred with the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or entisements or occasions of euill. But my meaning is, that in some measure and in the most sinnes a Christian doth finde it so, and in euery sinne his desire and endeauour is daily to haue it so. And his desire is not without some happy successe, so as sinne dieth or lieth a dying euery day.</p>

Secondly, it were expedient thou shouldest still seeke to humble thy soule, till thou couldest get as much tendernesse in bewailing thy sinnes, as thou wert wont to haue in grieuing for crosses, till thou couldst mourne as freshly for <hi>peircing Gods sonne as for losing thine owne sonne</hi>

Thirdly, thou must sorrow till thou finde the power of the most beloued and rooted sinnes to bee in some measure weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and abated. Fourthly, thou doest not well to giue thy sorrowes ouer, till thou finde the <hi>testimony of Iesus</hi> in thy hart, that is till God answer thy mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full requests of pardon, with some ioyes in the holy Ghost, and the dewes of heauenly refreshings.<note place="margin">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:21380:174"/>
but pray. But he would haue them to keepe a set course of praying euery day and besides to watch to all the extraordinary occasions or opportunities of prayer, which being done a Christian may be truely sayd to pray continually: though otherwise he follow his calling diligently. The like I say of sorrowing alwayes. But that I may expresse my meaning distinctly. I thinke, till thou canst attaine the former things thou must obserue these rules.<note place="margin">What it is to sorrow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually?</note> First, thou must lay aside thy recreations and carnall reioicings, for this the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports when he sayth, <hi>Let your laughter be turned into heauinesse, and your ioy into mourning</hi> 
                           <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.9.</note>. Secondly, thou must begge sorrow at Gods hand euery day constantly in the times set apart for prayer, till the Lord giue thee rest to thy soule by granting the things before mentioned. Thirdly, thou must not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the times of speciall fasting and humiliation, if the Lord call thereunto <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Esa.</hi> 22.12.</note>. Lastly thou must vse speciall sobrietie in the restraint of thy liberty in earthly things, and be watchfull to make vse of all opportunities of softning thy hart. These things being obserued thou mayst seeme vnto men not to sorrow, and mayst follow thy calling seriously, and yet be truely sayd to sorrow alwayes. Thus of the second reason why the Apostle exhorts still to mortification.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, the dearest and humblest seruants of God, may be called vpon to mortifie their members that are on earth, though they haue truly and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repented of sinne before, by reason of the euils of euery day, with daily and a fresh euen after calling breake out in their hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s and liues: and for which they must still renew their repentance. For their first repentance onely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers them from sinnes past: they must renew their mortification, as their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions are renewed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Why sinnes are called members?</note>
                           <hi>Members</hi>] It is certaine by members on earth, the Apostle meanes sinne, and that fitlie. For first, actuall sinnes in relation to originall sinne, are as so many members that grow from it. Secondly, by a <hi>Metonimie</hi> of the subiect, sinne may be called our members, because it is brought into action by the helpe and seruice of our members. Thirdly, if the Apostle had spoken to wicked men, hee might well haue called sin their members, because they loue sinne as they loue their members: and therefore to take away their sinne, is to pull out their eies, or to cut of their hand or feete, as our Sauiour shewes <note n="g" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note>. Fourthly, sinnes in the Colossians and so in all the faithfull, may bee heere called members comparatiuely, with the bodie of sinne mentioned <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. as if the Apostle should say, the body of sinne is already cast off and destroyed in you by your former repentance, but yet there remaines some limmes of sinne, some members of it, these resist: and in this sence we may heere note a liuely difference betweene sinne in wicked men and sinne in godly men.<note place="margin">Difference betweene sin in the godly and in the wicked.</note> For in wicked men there is the whole body of sinnes, that is all their sinne, vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and vnrepented. But in godly men, the body of sinne, euen the greater number of their sinnes they haue abandoned: onely some few members of their sins remaine, which euery day molest them. But before I passe from these words, two things are further to be noted. First, that he saith, <hi>your</hi> members. Secondly, he addeth <hi>which are on earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Your</hi>] the Apostle sayth well your members: for indeed properlie our sins are our owne, and nothing else.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Which are on earth</hi>] they are also well sayd to be on earth: because they are signes of the earthly man, and because they tend onely to earthly pleasures and contentments, and because men with these vnrepented of, are not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Heauen.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the generall proposition. Now followes the catalogue of sinnes to be mortified: before I enter vpon the particular consideration of them, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may be learned from the Apostles order, First, he teacheth men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their owne personall vices &amp; then orders them for mortifications of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21380:174"/>
to other men:<note place="margin">Vicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons will be iniurious persons.</note> sure it is, that euery filthy person, will bee an iniurious person: and till men repent of their lusts and other such like personall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they will neuer cease to be iniurious to other men. And ordinarily, men that are notable for malice, or blasphemy that is cursed speaking, and such like sinnes as the Apostle after names, they are exceeding vitious persons other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes. Instance but in such as reproach Gods seruants:<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Note.</hi>
                           </note> marke it both in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and country, who are they that raise and vent all slanders and strange reports, concerning such as preach or professe the Gospell of Iesus Christ in the truth and sincerity of it: I say marke them particularly: for my owne part, in my little obseruation, I haue found them alwayes, either to bee papists or superstitious persons, or drunkards, or notable whore-masters and filthy persons, or people guilty of other notable crimes, indeed sometimes their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominations are not so commonly and publikely discoursed of, because ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are men of greater place, or else their vices are more couered ouer and gilded with cunning pretences: yet seldome fals it out, but their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is commonly knowen: and many times Gods children that are vniustly touched, could vpon sufficient grounds detect strange abhominations in their aduersaries, and this was vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> vsually a strong argument of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that his aduersaries were men whom he knew to be workers of iniquity. And thus much from the order of these catalogues.</p>
                        <p>The sinnes heere reckoned vp, are sinnes either against the seuenth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Viz. fornication, vncleanenesse, inordinate affections,</hi> or against the tenth commandement, <hi>euill concupiscence</hi>: or against the first commandement couetousnesse which is idolatry.</p>
                        <p>First of the sinnes against the seuenth commandement: I might heere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, in that they are placed in the first place, that God would haue Christians to be especially carefull to preserue their chastitie. For this is one thing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall <hi>in the will of God concerning our sanctification, that we should abstaine from fornications</hi>
                           <note n="h" place="margin">1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.34.</note>, and <hi>that euery one should</hi> know how to possesse his vessell in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and honour. And to this end hath the Lord giuen vs so many precious <hi>promises, that we might resolue to cleanse our selues from all filthinesse both of flesh and spirit</hi>
                           <note n="i" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.</note>, now in the handling of these sinnes against the seuenth commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment heere mentioned I will keep this order. First, I will particularly entreat of the nature and effects of each of these three sinnes, and generally make vse of all together, and therein shew the remedies against all sins of vncleanenes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fornication</hi>] There is fornication in title onely, as when victualers were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of Harlots. Secondly, there is a metaphoricall kinde of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, or allegoricall. So wicked men are sayd to bee <hi>bastards</hi> 
                           <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</note>, and the Iewes were <hi>borne of fornication</hi> 
                           <note n="l" place="margin">
                              <hi>Hos.</hi> 1.</note>, Thirdly, there is spirituall fornication: and so idolatry is fornication, and so vsually tearmed, both by the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> and the Apostle in the Reuelation. Lastly, there is corporall fornication: and that sometimes notes whoredome in the generall, and somtimes it notes that filthinesse that is committed actually by vnmarried persons: and this later kinde of filthinesse was exceeding common among the Gentiles, in all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, especially where it was committed, with such as professed to be whores. And so it was an effect of that horrible blindnesse into which the nations fell, vpon their idolatry: But I suppose it may be heere taken for all Adulterie and whoredome. And then I come to the reasons which may be collected against this sinne,<note place="margin">Reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> out of seuerall Scriptures: and generally it is woorthy the noting, that euer the more the world lessens the hatefulnesse of this sinne, the more the holy Ghost aggrauates it it: as heere it is set in the forefront that the first and greatest blowes of confession and prayer might light vpon it. But I come to the particular reasons against fornication.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. It <hi>defiles a man</hi>
                           <note n="m" place="margin">

                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:21380:175"/>2. It makes a man or woman, vnmeet and vnworthy all Christian society. as the Apostle shewes, if any that is called a brother be a fornicator, with such a one eat not <note n="n" place="margin">

                        <p n="5">5.

                        <p>Lastly the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in the first Epistle to the Corinthians and the sixth chapter, hath diuerse reasons against this sinne <note n="h" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</note>. First, the <hi>body was</hi> made <hi>for the Lord</hi> aswell as the soule <note n="i" place="margin">

                              <hi>v.</hi> 14.</note>. Thirdly, <hi>our bodies are the members of Christ</hi> 
                           <note n="l" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 15.</note>. Fourthly, <hi>he that coupleth himselfe with an Harlot, is one body</hi> with an Harlot<note n="m" place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 16.</note>. Fiftly, <hi>this is a sin</hi> in a speciall sence <hi>against our owne bodies</hi>

                        <p>These reasons should effectually perswade with Christian mindes, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre and auoyd this wretched sinne: and those that are guiltie of it, should make haste by sound repentance to seeke forgiuenesse, hauing their soules washed in the bloud of Christ: for howsouer for the present they liue securely through the <hi>methods</hi> of Sathan, and the <hi>deceitfulnesse</hi> of sinne, yet may they be <hi>brought into the midst almost of all euils</hi> before they be aware <note n="p" place="margin">

                           <note place="margin">Remedies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cleannesse. The first sort of remedies.</note>The remedies are of two sorts. First, for such as haue beene guilty of any of the former vncleanesses. Secondly, for such as would preserue themselues against them, that they might not be defiled with them. There are two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall remedies for the vncleane person. The first is marriage or the right vse of it, if it be in single persons, they must remember the Apostles words, <hi>it is better to marrie then to burne</hi> 
                           <note n="i" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9.</note>, and if they be married, they must know, that the loue of their husbands or wiues, is the speciall helpe to driue away these impure pollutions: for such is the counsell of the holy Ghost in the fifth of the Prouerbes to them that are infected with these vicious and predominant inclinations <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>Prou.</hi> 5.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21.</note>, and if they finde (as it is certaine euery vncleane person doth finde) want of loue to their owne husbands or wiues, then must they begge affection of God by daily and earnest prayer. But in the second place vnclean persons must know that marriage alone will not serue turne, but they must adde repentance: for lamentable experience shewes, that marriage without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance abates not the power of lust. And therefore such as would deliuer their soules from the vengeance to come due vnto them, for vncleannesse whether inward or outward, must seeke to God and with many prayers and teares begge pardon: they must bee washed from filthinesse by the bloud of Christ, and the teares of true repentance. Neither let men deceiue themselues a little sorrow will not serue turne for these pollutions, and therfore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle vseth the word <hi>washed</hi> 
                           <note n="l" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9.11.</note>, to note the repentance of the Corinthians from these and such like sinnes. Now there can be no washing without water, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will a drop or two serue turne.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">The second sort of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note>Secondly, that those that are not guilty may be preserued against vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, these things are of great vse and profit. First, the word of God and the sound knowledge of it, for sayth the Lord in the second of Prouerbs: If thou wilt receiue my words, and hide my commandements within thee: if thou callest after <hi>knowledge and criest for vnderstanding if thou seekest her as</hi> siluer, and <hi>searchest for her as for treasures, then shall counsell &amp; vnderstanding preserue thee, &amp; deliuer thee from the euill way and from the strange woman,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Prou.</hi> 2.1.3.4.11.12.16.17.</note> 
                           <hi>which flattereth with her words, and forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the couenant of her God.</hi> and heereunto agreeth <hi>Dauid</hi>: for propounding this question, <hi>by what meanes a young man might cleanse his heart,</hi> hee answereth, <hi>by taking heed to the word</hi>

                           <note n="n" place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.14.</note>.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, meditation is another great preseruatiue: wouldst thou remoue wickednesse from thy flesh, euen all the vanities of youth? then thou must <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy creator in the dayes of thy youth</hi> 
                           <note n="o" place="margin">
                              <hi>Eccl.</hi> 11. <hi>vlt.</hi> with 12.1.</note>. Thou must much and often think of the Lord God, that made thee, not that thou shouldest wallow in the mire of these swinish pollutions. Besides it is profitable to force thy hart to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten meditation of thine owne mortallity: that the thoughts of thy death, may be a kind of death to thy lusts: this the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> implies, when he sayth, <hi>as strangers and pilgrims abstaine from fleshly lusts</hi>: manifestly importing, that if we did seriously thinke that we are heere but strangers and pilgrims, it would tame the violence of these hatefull lusts. Also we should much ponder vpon the examples of such as haue sinned, and the Lord hath fearfully visited them both for and in their sinne, for all those things came vnto them for <hi>ensamples and were written to admonish vs vpon whom the ends of the world are come</hi> 
                           <note n="p" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6.8.11.</note>.</p>
                        <p>The third preseruatiue, is daily, earnest and constant prayer vnto God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. And if we feele the beginning to rise in vs, we should labour for speciall sorrowes, euen, with griefe of heart to racke and crucifie them. Lust
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:21380:176"/>
will not vsually out of the soule if it get any footing, till it be fired out with confession and godly sorrow. And therefore the Apostle vseth the phrase of <hi>crucifying the lusts of the flesh</hi> 
                           <note n="q" place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24.</note>. And that praier is a remedy the Apostles ownly practise shewes, for when <hi>sathan buffeted him, he praied vnto God,</hi> and that <hi>thrice,</hi> that he might get the temptation <hi>to depart from him</hi> 
                           <note n="r" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.9.</note>.</p>
                        <p>The fourth preseruatiue, <hi>is to walke in loue.</hi> I meane christian loue to Gods children: and such a loue, as hath both affection and society, and spirituall imploiment in the furtherance of the Gospell. When the Apostle would charge the Ephesians to auoid fornication and all vncleannesse, he doth first aduise them, and that seriously, to walke in loue? as knowing that the exercise of true christian loue,<note n="s" place="margin">
                              <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2.3.</note> breeds such contentment, and desire of holinesse, that it mightily fenceth the heart against all base lusts whatsoeuer. For they cannot stand together: and vsually such as are withdrawne by concupiscence are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise withdrawen from all profitable fellowship with Gods children.</p>
                        <p>The fift preseruatiue is, <hi>watchfulnesse,</hi> in the daily obseruing of the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of lust, and in carefulnesse in directing the heart into Gods presence, deuoting in our couenants and desires our thoughts and affections to God. Thus <hi>Salomon,</hi> when he would giue direction against the whorish woman, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiseth <hi>My sonne giue me thy heart and let thine eies delight in my waies</hi>
                           <note n="t" place="margin">
                              <hi>Prou.</hi> 23.26.27.</note>.</p>
                        <p>The last preseruatiue is,<note place="margin">The causes and occasions of lust.</note> to auoide the causes and occasions of lust and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse. The first is <hi>idlenesse.</hi> This was one of the causes of the detested vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse of <hi>Sodom,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> shewes<note n="u" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ezech.</hi> 46.49</note>. And contrariwise dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in our callings is a notable helpe to keep out inordinate desires, and vain thoughts, and commonly persons ouertaken with vncleannesse abound with idlenesse. The second is, <hi>fulnesse of bread,</hi> that is, by a synechdoche, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in meats and drinkes, either for the measure or daintinesse of them. And contrariwise, <hi>to beate downe downe our bodies</hi>
                           <note n="x" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.</note>, either by abstinence, or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety in the vse of the creatures, is a notable meanes to quench and abate those flames if they be risen, and to keep them also from that speciall aptnesse to rise. The third is, the high estimation of earthly things, and the too great liking of them: for this loue secretly brings in lust. Thus the Apostle to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> saies, <hi>that the loue of mony</hi> and riches, <hi>breeds noisome lusts,</hi> which in short time <hi>drowne man in perdition.</hi>
                           <note n="y" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9.</note> The like may be said of the estimation and too much viewing of apparell, beauty, &amp;c. The fourth is ignorance and hardnes of hart. For thus it was in those the Apostle mentions in the fourth to the <hi>Ephesians</hi>
                           <note n="z" place="margin">
                              <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.17.18.</note>. That <hi>greedinesse</hi> to defile themselues with all sorts of <hi>vncleannesse</hi> arose and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased in them by reason of the <hi>insensiblenesse</hi> of the heart, and the <hi>blindnesse</hi> and emptinesse of their minds. And on the other side lust cannot get such a head, so long as any sound measure of knowledge is stirring in the mind, or tendernesse remaines in the heart, lust desires both a darke house and a darke mind. The fift is <hi>euill company.</hi> And therefore the holy Ghost giues this rule to those that would not be ensnared with the strange woman, <hi>walke thou in the way of good men and keepe the way of the righteous.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Prou.</hi> 1.20.</note> The last is <hi>care for the flesh.</hi> It is the liberty men take not only to feed themselues in contemplatiue wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse, but also to plod and cast about how to satisfie &amp; fulfil their lusts, that doth so much confirme them in the custome of vncleannesse. And therefore the Apostles counsell is,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14.</note> 
                           <hi>take not care to fulfill the lusts of the flesh.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus farre of the sinnes of the seuenth commandement. The sinne against the tenth commandement followes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Euill concupiscence</hi>] This vice containes all sorts of euill thoughts and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and desires,<note place="margin">How euill concupisce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce differs from inordinate affection.</note> after any kind of pleasure, profit, honor, but especially lustfull inclinations or thoughts. And it differs from inordinate affection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause inordinate affection hath in it principally the burning of lust and a kind of effeminatenesse, the soule being ouercome and inthralled with the power
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21380:177"/>
of lust. Now I thinke this concupiscence notes, lust as it is in inclination or euil motion, before it come to that high degree of flaming, or consent: and it is well called <hi>euill concupiscence</hi> for there is a good concupiscence, both naturall and ciuill and spirituall.<note place="margin">There is a threefold good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence.</note> Naturall, after meate, sleepe, procreation, &amp;c. ciuill, which is an ordinate desire after lawfull profits and pleasures. Spirituall, and that is a lust for and after heauenly things. And so the spirit lusts against the flesh.</p>
                        <p>Now that we may know the Apostle hath great reason, to counsell men to mortifie euill thoughts though they neuer come to consent: these reasons may shew. First, concupiscence in the very inclination and first thoughts is a breeder, it is the mother of all sorts of wickednesse, if it be not betimes killed in the conception.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.14 15.</note> The Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> shewes, that concupiscence will be quickly <hi>enticed,</hi> yea it will <hi>entice</hi> and <hi>draw away</hi> a man, though from without it be allured with no obiect. And when it hath drawne a man aside, it will <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,</hi> and breed with very <hi>contemplatiue pleasures,</hi> and when it hath conceiued, and lien in the wombe of the minde, and laine there nourished from time to time, vnlesse God shew the greater mercy, it <hi>will bring forth</hi> bring forth I say a birth of some notable externall euill action, and when it hath gone so far, like an impudent beldame, it will egge on still vnto the finiishing of sinne, by custome in the practise, and so indeed (of it selfe) it will neuer leaue, till it hath brought foorth (as a second birth) death, and that both spirituall and eternall death, and somtimes a temporll death too. Secondly, if these lusts goe no further then the inward man, yet sinne may raigne euen in these. There may be a world of wickednesse in a man, though he neuer speake filthy words, or commit filthy action. There is a <hi>conuersing with the very inward lusts of the flesh</hi>

                        <p>Couetousnesse is a spirituall disease in the heart of man, flowing from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, corrupted,<note place="margin">What coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse is.</note> and insnared by sathan, and the world, inclining the soule to an immoderate and confident (yet vaine) care after earthly things, for our owne priuate good, to the singular detriment of the soule. Couetousnesse I call a <hi>disease:</hi> for it is such a priuation of good, as hath not only want of vertue and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21380:177"/>
happinesse, but a position of euill in it, to be shunned more then any disease for as the text saith, it is an euill sicknesse. And this disease is <hi>spirituall</hi>; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is hard to be cured. No medicine can helpe it, but the blood of Christ. It is not felt by the most, but hated only in the name of it. The subiect where this disease is, <hi>is the heart of man.</hi> For there is the seat or pallace of this vice. And therefore S. <hi>Mark</hi>
                           <note n="h" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.22.</note> addes couetousnesse to those vices Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> had said did defile a man. The internall efficient mouing cause of this euill, <hi>is nature corrupted.</hi> Tis a sinne euery man had need to looke too: for mans nature is stirred with it.<note n="i" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 4.7.</note> It is an vniuersall <hi>quaere, who will shew vs any good?</hi> and yet I say <hi>corrupted</hi> nature, for nature of it selfe is content with a little: it is corruption that hath bred this disease. The externall efficient causes, are the diuell snaring and the world tempting. The forme of this euill is, an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the immoderate and confident care of earthly things. I say <hi>inclining the soule,</hi> to take in the lowest degree of couetousnesse. For some haue their hearts exercised in it, and wholly taken vp with it: their eies and their hearts, and their tongues, are full of it. Now others are only secretly drawne away with it, and daily infected with the inclinations to it. I adde, <hi>moderate and confident care</hi> because honest labour or some desire after earthly things are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Only two things constitute this vice. First, want of moderation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the matter, when nothing will be enough to satisfie their hauing, or in the measure of the care, when it is a distracting, vexing continuall care, that engrosseth in a manner all the thoughts and desires of a man. Secondly, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall confidence, when man placeth his felicity and chiefest stay and trust in the things he either possesseth or hopeth for. I adde, <hi>yet vaine,</hi> because let the couetous person, bestow neuer so much care, or attaine to neuer so much successe of his cares, yet as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>He that loueth siluer shall not be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with siluer, and he that loueth riches, shall be without the fruit thereof</hi>
                           <note n="k" place="margin">
                              <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5.9.</note>. And after all his trauaile, his riches may perish whiles he looks on, or if they were more sure to continue, yet he shall not continue with them himselfe. <hi>For as he came foorth of his mothers belly he shall returne naked, to goe as he came, and shall beare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing away of his labour, which he hath caused to passe by his hand. In all points as he came so shall he goe, and then what profit hath he that he hath trauailed for the wind.</hi>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> The obiect of this care and desire, is <hi>earthly things.</hi> For if it were a couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> or desire of the best things, or spirituall gifts, that were both commended and commanded<note n="l" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1. The effects of couetousnesse.</note>. These words <hi>for his owne priuate good,</hi> note the end of the couetous mans care. For if all this care for earthly things, were for Gods glory or the good of the Church, it might be allowed. And I say for his good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that he propounds to himselfe, though many times, when he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten much together, the Lord will not let him haue the vse of it. Note the best thing in the description, is the effect of couetousnesse, and that <hi>is the singular detriment of the soule,</hi> which may appeare diuersly. For first couetousnesse doth infatuate and besot the mind of man, that it cannot vnderstand. The Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith of those <hi>dumb and greedy dogs, that they could not vnderstand:</hi> and he giueth the reason. <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>they all looke to their owne way, euery one for his aduantage and for his owne purpose and profit</hi>
                           <note n="m" place="margin">
                              <hi>Esay</hi> 56.11.12.</note>. And <hi>Salomon</hi> seems to say that if couetousnesse be in the heart of a Prince, it will make him destitute of vnderstanding<note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>Prou.</hi> 28.16.</note>. And it is certaine (marke it) worldly minded persons are the most dull, and incapable persons in spirituall things, almost of all other sorts of men. For though they would get a little vnderstanding while they are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, yet the cares of life presently choakes all. Secondly, couetousnesse <hi>pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the soule through with many a sorrow</hi>
                           <note n="o" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10</note>. The couetous person is seldom or neuer free, from one notable vexation or other. His heart is troubled, and he will trouble his house also. As <hi>Salomon</hi> saith <hi>he that is greedy of gaine troubleth his owne house</hi>
                           <note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>Prou.</hi> 15.27.</note>. All is continually in a tumult, of hast and hurry, what with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:21380:178"/>
and what with passion and contention, the couetous man and his house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold neuer liue at hearts ease and rest. Thirdly, couetousnesse <hi>and the desire to be rich</hi> bring into the soule, a wonderful number <hi>of temptations and noisome lusts,</hi> enough to <hi>damne him,</hi> if he had no other sinnes<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9.</note>. Fourthly, it is here added that couetousnesse is idolatry: it makes a man an idolater. Mammon is the idoll, and the worldling is the Priest that sacrificeth to mammon. Now the couetous man serues his mammon, with a twofold worship. For with inward worship, he loues, desires, delights in, and trusts in his wealth. And for his outward ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, he spends all his time vpon his idoll, either in gathering or keeping, or increasing, or honoring it. Lastly what should I number particulars? <hi>couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?</hi> why the Apostle saith, <hi>it is the root of all euills.</hi> For there is almost no kind of sinne but the sap of couetousnes will nourish it. If the Lord had but the rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp of the heart and life of a couetous person, and would describe his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before vs, oh what swarme of all sorts of euills could the Lord find out? well, let vs be assured of this generall, that howsoeuer couetous persons may colour matters yet indeed they are wonderfull vicious persons. Neither are their sinnes the fewer or lesser, because they discerne them not: for the dust of earthly profits, hath put out their eies, they cannot see nor discerne, as was before shewed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Qu.</hi> But who is couetous? for all men while they cry out against the sinne, deny that they are couetous.<note place="margin">The signes of a couetous man.</note> Tis rare to find any couetous person, that will confesse that he is couetous. And therefore for answer hereunto, it will not be amisse out of the word of God to shew the signes of a couetous man.</p>
                        <p>The first signe of a couetous man, is the desire to haue the sabboth ouer, that he might be at his worldly affaires. A couetous man thinks all the time set apart for Gods seruice exceeding tedious and long. And he hath a great inward boiling of desire to haue such times and imploiments past. The sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is wonderfull burthensome to a worldly mind, especially if he be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from worldly imploiments. The Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> bringeth in the couetous man of his time, saying thus in the discontentment of their hearts, <hi>when will the new Moone be gone that we may sell corne, and the sabbath that we may set foorth wheat?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Prou.</hi> 28.16. 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.6.</note>The second signe of couetousnesse, is oppression and fraud. When men to compasse gaine, care not how they vex and racke the poore or such as liue vnder them: or in buying or selling (out of greedinesse of gaine) circumuent and pill, and defraud others, by customary lying, or false waights, measures, or ballances, or any other fraudulent course: This is an euill couetousnesse. Vsury also, that is a desire to increase riches by interest, is a palpable signe of coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, especially in these times, when the sinne of vsury is so vniuersally condemned: for if men were not besotted with the loue of riches, they would not dare to liue in such a damned sinne, but I thinke all men easily know that vsurers are couetous and therefore I need not proue it.</p>
                        <p>The third signe of couetousnesse, is greedy, and distracting care. I meane such a care as deuoures a mans thoughts, that euery day will keepe possession in a mans soule and runne in his mind continually, both sleeping and waking. Plodding and carking cares, and this may be discerned by comparing these cares with our care for eternall things. When we haue more care for this world then for heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we need go no further, but resolue vpon it, couetousnesse hath deceiued vs. Neither doe I meane that they only are couetous, that immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately disquiet themselues with continuall cares for getting of treasures and the superfluities of abundance. For it is sure that couetousnesse may be in vs in a high degree, though our cares be but about things that are necessarie, as about the things we must eat or put on. As the comparing of the 15, verse of Luk. 12. with v. 21.22. wil shew.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Luke</hi> 12.15.21.22.</note> Now the care for necessaries, is not simply for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:21380:178"/>
because we are bound to vse the meanes with diligence and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: but the care that is a signe of couetousnesse, may be discerned by the very tearmes the Euangelist Saint <hi>Luke</hi> vseth to describe it by. For in the 22 verse,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 22.</note> our sauiour saith, <hi>take no thought for your life, &amp;c.</hi> and by taking thought he notes a perplexed inward sorrowfull and fearefull care about life and the things thereof.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 26.</note> And verse 26. he saith, <hi>why take ye thought for the raiment</hi>? as if he would haue vs note that it is a property of couetous cares, to be deepely drowned in perplexity, euen about trifles, and small matters: and surely we may obserue worldly minded people, and one would wonder to see how they vexe and disquiet themselues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about euery meane occasion, especiall if there be the least colour of any profit or losse towards. Againe, our Sauiour vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth those that are caried with those cares,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 28.</note> that they haue but <hi>a little faith:</hi> whereby he shewes that then our cares are faulty and arise from the infection of couetousnesse, when they are raised by vnbeliefe and mistrustfulnesse of Gods prouidence, or promise. Lastly in the 29. verse, our Sauiour saith thus, <hi>Therefore aske not what ye shall eate or what ye shall drinke,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>v.</hi> 29. <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>.</note> 
                           <hi>neither stand in doubt,</hi> or as you may see it rendred in the margent, <hi>neither make discourses in the aire:</hi> and by these last words he notes another property of a couetous person, and that is when he hath his head tossed with cares or feares, either about the compassing of his profits or preuenting of losses, &amp;c. he is so full of words and manie questions, what he shall doe, and how he shall auoide such and such a losse, that he hath neuer done either moning himselfe, or consulting to no purpose, in things that either cannot be done, or not otherwise, &amp;c. Or it may note this endlesse framing of proiects for the compassing of his desires. Thus of the signes. Yet notwithstanding these signes, I must needs confesse that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse it not easily discerned, both because it is an inward distrust in the spirit of a man, and also because their comes to this vice vsually <hi>fained words</hi>
                           <note n="r" place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3.</note>, to hide it from the view of others, or subtile thoughts and euasions to blindfold the conscience within, and besides it is the nature of this sinne quickly to dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the discerning of the mind, and therefore I thinke couetousnesse in the most, may be well called <hi>coloured couetousnesse</hi> 
                           <note n="s" place="margin">1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.5.</note> it is so on both sides masked.</p>
                        <p>The vse of all should be to teach vs, as the author to the Hebrewes saith, <hi>to haue our conuersation without couetousnesse, and to be content with the things we haue,</hi> resting stedfastly vpon the promise of God, <hi>I will not faile thee nor forsake thee</hi>
                           <note n="t" place="margin">

                              </gap> Not without mony but without the loue of it.</note>. And to this end we should pray as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, that God would incline our hearts to his testimonies and not to couetousnesse<note n="u" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.</note>. Preseruatiue or remedies against cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Qu.</hi> But what are the best remedies or preseruatiues against couetousnesse. <hi>Ans.</hi> There are these things among the rest that are of great vse to preserue vs from couetousnesse, or to weaken the power of it.</p>
                        <p>The first is that which I mentioned before, viz. praier to God daily that he would incline our hearts to his testimonies, that so we might haue our minds drawne away from the cares of couetousnesse.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second is meditation. And there are diuerse things which being seriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thought of, may preuaile against the perplexed cares of couetousnesse. As first example, and that either of godly men, and the holiest wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies of the Lord, that in all ages, haue <hi>willingly confessed themselues to bee strangers and pilgrims, looking for a city in another country, hauing a foundation whose builder and maker is God</hi>
                           <note n="x" place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.9.10</note>, or else of wicked men. For it is so base a vice that it should be found in none but Gentiles<note n="y" place="margin">
                              <hi>Math.</hi> 6.</note>, that know neither Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise nor prouidence: and sure it is found in none but vngodly men, <hi>that are strangers from the couenants of promise.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Terra a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendo.</hi>
                           </note> Secondly, <hi>the nature of man.</hi> For consider, the soule of man is a celestiall thing and diuine, and hath nothing from the earth. And the body of man is erected, with a face towards heauen and the whole earth is vnder mans feet, and hath its name from treading vpon it; to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21380:179"/>
note that man should <hi>walke</hi> on it with his <hi>feet,</hi> not <hi>dote</hi> on it with his <hi>heart.</hi> Thirdly the nature of couetousnesse: it will neuer be satisfied, and how should it? for the desire of the couetous is not naturall, but against nature. Naturall desires are finite, but vnnaturall desires find no end. And therefore cannot be filled with the finite things of the world.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Non plus satia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur cor homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis auro quam corpus aura.</hi>
                           </note> Besides earthly things are vaine and empty. Now the vessell that is only full of wind is empty still for all that. So is the mind of the couetous. His heart will be no more filled or satisfied with gold then his body with wind. Hereupon it is that a couetous man is alwaies poore, and hath not what he hath. But hath his wealth as the prisoner hath his fetters, viz. to inthrall him. Fourthly, the nature promise and prouidence of God. He is a <hi>heauenly father</hi>

                        <p>The third preseruatiue is the daily practise of piety. If we would seeke the kingdome of God first, both in the first part of our life, and in the first part of euery day of our life, as well in our houses as in Gods house, these religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties constantly performed, would be a great and continuall helpe against worldly cares: they would cleanse our hearts of them, and daily prepare our hearts against them. But how can it be otherwise with a man then it is? they must neeeds liue and die the drudges of the world, seeing they haue no more care of holy duties at home or abroad, they liue like swine without all care of any thing, but rooting in the earth.</p>
                        <p>The fourth preseruatiue, is the due preparation for Christs second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. For when our sauiour Christ had dehorted men from the cares of this life, he adioines this exhortation: <hi>let your loines be girded about: and your lights burning, and ye your selues like vnto them that waite for their master, when he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from the wedding, that when he commeth and knocketh they may open vnto him immediately: blessed are those seruants whom the Lord when he commeth shall find waking, &amp;c.</hi> One great reason why couetous men doe so securely continue in the immoderate cares for this world, is because they do so little think of death and iudgement. Whereas on the other side Christians doe with some ease withdraw their hearts from the world, when they haue inured themselues to die daily by the constant remembrance of their latter end, and by holding fast the euidence of faith and hope, waiting when Christ will call for them.</p>
                        <p>The fift preseruatiue, is to shunne the meanes and occasions of couetousnes And to this end it is good not to conuerse much with couetous persons, or to get our selues liberty to conceiue the hope of any long prosperity, and rest in the world: and generally we should labour to obserue our owne hearts and other mens liues and what we find to be a meanes to kindle or inflame coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous desires, that we should auoide and betimes set against it, or mortifie it.

                        <p>These words containe two reasons to enforce the exhortation in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verse. Thone is taken from the euill effects of the former sinnes. ver. 6. The other is taken from their owne experience, while they liued in the estate of corruption ver. 7. in laying downe the reason from the effect, two things are to be noted. First, what sinne brings, viz. <hi>the wrath of God.</hi> Secondly, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom, <hi>viz.</hi> vpon the children of disobedience. Before I come to intreat of the wrath of God a part, I consider of it as it stands in coherence with the former reason. For in these words we are assured that man liuing and continuing in filthinesse, and couetousnesse shall not escape Gods wrath. For they incurre both his hatred and his plagues, both which are signified by the word wrath.<note place="margin">Gods wrath vpon vnclean persons.</note> And if any aske what plagues filthy persons and couetous persons shall feele? I answer briefly and distinctly, that neither of them shall scape Gods wrath, as the Scriptures plentifully shew. The filthy person brings vpon himselfe Gods curse <hi>temporall, corporall, spirituall</hi> and <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: temporall,</hi> for whoredome and any kinde of vncleanenesse, brings vpon men many temporall plagues in their estate, the fire of Gods iudgements con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming many times their whole increase as hath beene shewed before. <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> for God many times meetes with the sinnes of the bodie, by iudgements vpon the body: so that many filthie persons <hi>after they haue consumed their flesh and their body,</hi> by loathsome diseases which follow this sinne, in the end, say with the foolish young man, <hi>Oh how haue I hated instruction, and despised corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>

                        <p>For the first. The fearefulnesse and greatnesse of Gods wrath or anger for sinne, may appeare three wayes. First, by Scripture. Secondly, by similitude.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:21380:180"/>
Thirdly, by example. That Gods anger for sinne is exceeding terrible and fearefull, I will shew by one place of Scripture onely, and that is the first of <hi>Nahum</hi> the Prophet:<note place="margin">First by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>Nahum.</hi> 1.2.3.4.5.6.</note> for he sayth, <hi>God is iealous, and the Lord reuengeth, the Lord reuengeth</hi>: where the repetition shewes the certainty of it, that God will be as sure to reuenge as euer the sinner was to sinne: but this is more confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when he sayth, <hi>he is the Lord of anger:</hi> as if he would impart that his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is his essence, as if he were all made of anger: and that he is the authour of all the iust anger that is in the world: and if the drops of anger in great men haue such terror in it, what is the maine Ocean of anger which is in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? and to assure vs yet further of the terrour of his wrath, he addeth, <hi>the Lord will take vengeance on his aduersaries,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">

                           </note> which signifieth that the Lord will account of impenitent sinners, as a man accounts of his worst enemies, and therefore the Lord will shew his displeasure to the vttermost of their deserts and his Iustice. And therefore if any doe obiect, that they see it otherwise for the plagues of wicked men are not so many nor so great as their sinnes, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth that and sayth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Lord, <hi>reserueth wrath for his enemies:</hi> he hath not inflicted vpon them all they shall haue: there is the greatest part behinde: the full vials of his fury are not yet poured out.<note place="margin">

                           </note> And if any should reply, that they haue obserued, that wicked men haue prospered long and scaped for a great while, without any punishments to speake of, The Prophet answereth that, and sayth that <hi>the Lord is slow to anger,</hi> that is hee is many times long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he manifests his great displeasure, but <hi>he is great in power,</hi> that is hee is of singular fiercenes and vnresistablenes, when he doth enter into Iudgement, he will not faile, nor be hindered, and if any would hope that God would change his minde, that also is preuented, the Prophet auouching it confidently, that <hi>he will not surely cleere the wicked.</hi>

For by outward things we cannot know Gods loue or hatred to particular persons, onely Gods pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like anger to publike states may be knowen: and so may his priuate anger to our selues in speciall.</p>

And he will make good their righteous threatnings. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>The signes in Heauen or earth or sea:</hi> prodigious sights, or signes in the sunne or moone or commets, or strange birthes, or the extraordinary ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the seas and such like. Thirdly, <hi>publike plagues</hi> are both signes of wrath present, and withall they giue warning of greater wrath to come if we doe not repent. Such are famine, warre, pestilence, and other raging diseases, the death of great Princes, and the sudden and common death of the best men, these all foretell euill to come, as wee may know fire, so may wee know Gods anger: we know fire, either by the report of men worthy to bee credited, or by the smoake, or by the flame beginning to breake out. And so may discerne Gods wrath: either by the relation of his Ambassadours that are faithfull men, or by the smoake of prodigies or wonders in Heauen and earth. or else by the flame of Iudgements already begunne, and thus of the signes of Gods publike anger.</p>

                              <hi>Num.</hi> 25.1.</note>. Thirdly, by the generall repentance of the people, and thus Gods anger towards Nineuie was pacified <note n="n" place="margin">

                        <p>Concerning the pacifying of Gods anger to particular persons, I will first consider what will not pacifie it, and then what will pacifie it. For the first, <hi>no multitude of gifts can deliuer thee</hi>

To be a child to sinne, that is to be ruled and mastred and led by it, to be as it were at the command of lust and corruption, that is not in a child of God standing in vprightnesse.<note place="margin">

                              </gap>.</note> Secondly, the word here rendred disobedience, imports vnteachablenesse: such a disobedience as is wilfull: when a man sinnes and will sinne, and will not be <hi>perswaded</hi> either by Gods words or Gods spirit, or Gods people, that would aduise or admonish him.

                        <p>Further if we marke the coherence, in the second Chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians, v. 2. compared with the first, we may easily discerne, that a child of disobedience <hi>is dead in trespasses and sinnes.</hi> His soule can he at rest, though he be guilty of neuer so many sinnes.

Especially when men are at that passe that the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> complained of, <hi>that though God strike them yet they are not grieued: yea though the Lord consume them, they refuse to receiue correction, and make their faces harder then a rocke, refusing to returne</hi>

                           <hi>Ans.</hi> God may be angry with his owne people. For when the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>his anger endureth but a moment</hi>

                              <hi>Reu.</hi> 2.</note>, but generally euery grosse sinne angers God, by whomsoeuer it be committed. But yet there is great difference between Gods anger towards his owne children, and that wrath that commeth vpon the children of disobedience, and that principally in three things. First, wrath comming vpon the faithfull is not eternall, but temporary and in this life only. For they are <hi>deliuered from the wrath to come</hi>
                           <note n="q" place="margin">1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. <hi>vlt.</hi>
                           </note>, for there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready past from death to life. But so are not wicked men. For God is so angry with them in this life, that his anger may continue for euer, and not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished in their very death. And not only so, but Gods anger with his own children euen in this life is not for all their daies, but only a very short time of their life. For as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>his anger endureth but a moment: weeping may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure

for a night, but ioy commeth in the morning</hi>

                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.9.</note>. And the Lord wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth by the Prophet <hi>Esay, that he forsaketh but for a small moment, he hideth his face in a little wrath, but he hath mercy with euerlasting kindnesse</hi>
                           <note n="t" place="margin">

                           <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is not so with the vngodly. Secondly, as Gods wrath differs in the continuance, so it differs in the measure: it is milder towards his children, then it is towards the children of disobedience. Which appeares to be so two waies. For first Gods anger as it is manifested in outward iudgements vpon his owne people, is euer proportioned to their strength: he doth not consider what their sinne deserues, but what their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are able to sustaine. <hi>He will not suffer them to be tempted aboue that which they are able, but will giue issue with the temptation that they may be able to beare it</hi> 
                           <note n="x" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.</note>. And the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> sheweth that the Lord hath great care least by conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ouer long with his people, <hi>the spirit should faile, and the soule which he hath made</hi>

                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 103.10.14.</note>. But now with the wicked it is much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, For the Lord neuer askes what strength they haue to heare it, or how they will take it, but what sinne they haue committed, and how they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued it. Besides the affections of Gods children are sweetned with many mercies: for though the Lord be angry for their sinne, yet if they will seeke God, and work righteousnesse, they may hold out to beare the crosse, for the Lord will meet them in the vse of the meanes, to the great ease and ioy of their hearts.<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Esay</hi> 64.5.</note> Excellently speaketh the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> vnto the Lord acknowledging this point, when he said, <hi>Thou answerest them O Lord, our God thou wast a God that forgauest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inuentions</hi>
                           <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 99.8.</note>. And the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> seemeth to say, that while Gods people <hi>sit in darknesse yet the Lord can be a light vnto them</hi>

                              <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.7.8.</note>. <hi>For their God will heare them.</hi> And herein also the Lord reserueth his mercies from the wicked. So as when they fall, they haue no assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of rising, nor is the Lord carefull to lighten their darknesse: I meane they haue no promise for it. For if the Lord shew them fauour, if they repent not, it will make them more vnexcusable, and their iudgement the heauier. Thirdly it differs in the end. For the end of Gods wrath on his owne seruants, is their good and saluation. <hi>They are iudged that they might not perish with the world</hi>

When he hath plowed vp the fallow ground of their hearts, he will not still goe ouer them, to breake the clods that remaine: but hauing once made himselfe a furrow, he will sow and not plow. And for the second, the Prophet seriously expostulateth with such as should any way incline to think, that the wicked and the godly were smitten alike. <hi>Hath he smitten him</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>as he smote those that smote him</hi>

For in that he puts them in mind of it, it shewes that they should mind it by themselues much more. For not only it will shew that these sinnes did then abound, but the very thought of such a wofull estate will beate downe &amp; kill by degrees the vitious inclinations of nature vnto such sinnes. Secondly, in that the Colossians can beare it to be told of their sinnes past, it giues vs ocasion to take notice of this for a truth: that where a man hath soundly repented of any sinne, he can easily beare it, to be touched with the remembrance of it, and with lowlinesse doth endure the needfull discourse concerning i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And it will make a child of God industrious in Gods work, seeing he hath spent so much time in the seruice of the diuell, the world and the flesh And further it helpes a man to some measure of patience and meeknesse and compassion, in dealing with the sinnes of other men, considering that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe hath been <hi>vnwise, disobedient, seruing the lusts and diuerse pleasures, &amp;c.</hi> And lastly (as was before noted) it serues to kill the daily lusts that may bud and sprout out after calling.<note place="margin">How farre priuate men may meddle with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sinnes of others.</note>

Priuate men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member others of their estate past, if it may stir them vp to thankfulnesse, or if it may further them in humiliation for new offences, or they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort one another, least any be deceiued by sinne, and so for preuention of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions vnto which they are by nature prone: or in some special cases to cleare Gods iustice against hard hearted sinners otherwise it is a vile and sinful course to be raking into the liues of others: but especially to be grating vpon the faults past of penitent sinners. Where God hath pardoned, what hath man to doe to impute? And thus of the coherence and generall consideration of the words.</p>
                        <p>This verse containes two specialties of their misery by nature. First, their continuance in sinne, in that he saith <hi>ye walked.</hi> Secondly, their delight in sinne, in that he saith ye liued in them, that is it was the life of your life.</p>

                           <hi>In which</hi>] That is in which sinnes: and so it teacheth vs, that we should be more troubled for sinne then for crosses. For he doth not say, in which mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or iudgements but in which sinnes and corruptions. As any are more spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, sinne is their greatest sorrow: and as any are more carnall they are more troubled with crosses.</p>

                           <hi>Ye</hi>] A man can neuer be soundly and profitably humbled, till he mind his owne sinnes. The knowledge of sinne that is <hi>transient</hi> is dangerous, as we may see in the Pharisie. The more he knowes by the Publican, the prouder he is in himselfe, but the knowledge that is <hi>reflexed</hi> is profitable. And therefore the publican that troubled himselfe about his owne sinne, <hi>went home more iustified than the other.</hi> And therefore the Apostle here tells not of the misery of other men, but expresly guides them to the consideration of their owne misery. This should teach vs without shifting or delay to search and trie our owne waies, and to grow skilfull in recounting the euills of our owne liues. The true knowledge of our selues, is a great step in a holy life. Tis that the most of vs neuer attaine to. And yet it is of singular vse; it would make vs humble in our selues, compassionate towards others, easie to be admonished, tender hearted in Gods worship, more apt to godly sorrow, and of great ripenesse and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of knowledge in cases of conscience.</p>

                           <hi>Also</hi>] Sinne is a poison that ouerflowes all sorts of men. This also takes in rich men and great men, and learned men, and old men, and the ciuiller sort of men. There is no estate calling or condition of men, nor sexe, or nation, but they haue been infected with this plague. It hath runne ouer the whole earth. And therefore it should humble rich men, and learned men, and all sorts of men. Looke not at thy wealth, or thy wit, or thy learning, or thy nobility, or thy fame amongst men, looke at thy filthy nature: thou hast now, or thou hast had the plague vpon thy soule: and as wise and learned and rich and ciuill and noble, as thou, haue died of this sicknesse, and are in hell</p>

And this is the wretched condition and thraldome of euery one by nature, thus hard is it to giue ouer sinne, and were it not for the great mercy of God, thus would all men continue.</p>

Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially it may comfort vs against our infirmities: that howsoeuer we faile by occasion, yet by Gods mercy we do not walke in sinne. We proceed not from degree to degree, and from sinne to sinne: it is a happy time with a Christian, when he getteth victory ouer his sinnes, so as at least by degrees he gets downe the power of them. And on the other side they are in a wofull estate, that haue their corruptions growing vpon them both for power and number and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance. O woe will be vnto them when the master shall come and find them so doing. And thus of the first specialty.</p>

The first life <hi>Adam</hi> liued before his fall. The last, the blessed liue in heauen. The third the godly liue after their conuersion on earth, and the second, is the life of all the vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Sin is aliue. It hath a liuing being in the vnconuerted sinner. It is a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster ingendred in the heart of man, by coniunction with sathan; seating his seuerall limbs in the seuerall faculties of the soule. Now it will not be amisse to consider how we may know when this monster is aliue and when he is dead. Sinne may be knowen to be aliue,<note place="margin">How we may know when sinne is aliue,</note> first by the flaming desires of the heart and thoughts of the mind, inordinately bent vpon things forbidden. Secondly, by the command and authority it holds ouer all the faculties and powers of the soule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and body, vsing them as seruants and executioners of the lusts of the flesh. Thirdly, by the contentment men place in knowen euills. Fourthly, by customary practise. And lastly, if this monster by the deceitfull working of Sathan should liue still for a time, (as many times it doth euen in the worst men) yet there is a way to trie whether it be a liue or no. For bring it to the law, and it will presently reuiue. If it be pricked and pearced with the terrors and reproofes of a sound application, it will shew it selfe, by vnquietnesse, and vnruly distempers.<note place="margin">and when it is dead.</note> And on the other side it is certaine sinne is dead, if thy fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming desires to euill, be quenched. Secondly, if the command ouer the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the soule, be ceased. Thirdly, if a man seeke and place his chiefe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in spirituall things. Fourthly, if the customarie practise of euill be broken of and dissolued, and lastly if the hart will abide the searching and sound application of the law.</p>

All these are wofull circumstances of euill, and doe maruellously decipher out a soule that feeles not the life of Iesus Christ in him, and they impart also a further misery. It is easie to commit sinne, but it is not easie to be rid of sinne, a man may also quickly forget his sinne, but he shall not so quickely forgoe his sinne, for howsoeuer by Gods singular pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he liues, for all his sinne, yet by the singular wretchednesse of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all his sinnes, will liue with him, they are not transient, but so long as he liues, his sinne will liue with him, yea it will goe with him too when hee dies, if it be not preuented with speedy repentance.</p>
                        <p>The vse also of all this may be to teach conuerted Christians, that are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from this wofull misery, <hi>to walke as children of the light: hauing their fruit in all goodnesse and righteousnesse and truth: hauing no further fellowship with the vnfruitfull workes of darkenesse,</hi> seeing all is now <hi>made manifest by the light:</hi>

Grace enioines vs to take leaue of our old affections and our owne peruerse courses.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21380:185"/>
put away two wayes. First, by Iustification, and so God puts away our sinnes for when God pardoneth iniquity, he casteth it away and neuer sees it or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members it more <note n="o" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mich.</hi> 7.18.19</note>. Secondly, by sanctification, and so we must put away our sinnes. We must put away or pull downe sinne as the rebell puts downe his weapons, when he seekes the seruice of his Prince, or we must deale with our sinnes as God deales with the mighty, that is we must put them downe <hi>from their seats</hi>: if we cannot destroy them from liuing, yet we may disturbe them sitting, or raigning, or resting in vs, or we must put them away as the wronged husband doth his filthy wife. We must diuorce our sinnes that by couenant they should neuer be ours more. We will neuer loue them, and let them sleep in our bosome, and dwell with vs, and be familiar with our natures, as they haue beene. Now we put away sinne three wayes; First by confessing them to God. Secondly, by godly sorrow, washing the stain and filth of them from off our hearts. Thirdly, by renouncing and forsaking the practise of them, all are here intended, but the last principally, and this we must know will not be done with ease, if it be truely and soundly done. The Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> meanes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing when he sayth of the Lord, he <hi>will subdue our iniquities</hi>; and then after sayth, he <hi>will cast them away into the depthes of the sea</hi>

And so it notes that euery man that will truely repent, must resolue to part with all sins aswell as one: hee must desire and endeauour to hate and put away euery sinne, aswell the sinnes haue been named as the sinnes are to be named.

If the Lord should leaue one sinne vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, it might be enough to condemne vs, and so if wee leaue but one sinne, that we haue no desire nor will to repent of, that one sinne would plead against vs, that we had not truly repented of the rest. If we marke the true catalogue of sinnes, which heere followeth, it shewes that wee must forsake all sorts of sinnes aswell as one. For we must forsake and put away inward sinnes aswell as outward, for he sayth put away <hi>anger and wrath:</hi> wee must put away lesser sinnes aswell as greater, for he saith put away filthie speaking, aswell as before he had sayd mortifie fornication and vncleannesse.<note place="margin">Motiues.</note> Now that we may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to this sincerity in forsaking all sinne aswell as one, wee may consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diuerse motiues. First, Christ suffered, for all sinnes aswell as one: and therefore <hi>we should arme our selues with the same minde, in suffering in our flesh to cease from sinne</hi> 
                           <note n="u" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1.</note>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> He may, and I will shew you how by a distribution. 1. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing defects, as belonging to originall sinnes are pardoned the first moment of conuersion. 2. Sinnes of ignorance are remoued by generall repentance, and by the daily sacrifice. 3. Sinnes not loued, nor rooted are done away, by an absolute forsaking of them. He that will continue any longer in sinnes that bring him no profit nor pleasure, and such euils as he hath power to leaue if he will, if these be not giuen absolutely ouer it is to no purpose for a man to talke of repentance. 4. Particular sinnes that a man hath greatly loued, they are put away by serious and distinct labour in praier, and sencible sorrow and griefe of heart for them. For lesse then this will not suffice for particular beloued sinnes. Now lastly there will remaine certaine remnants of some sins, that haue rootes in our corrupted dispositions, euen after the first repentance. Now these are said in Gods acceptation to be put away, when a man prayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them and mournes ouer them, and daily iudgeth himselfe for them: and so they may be in his nature and yet be truly, though not perfitly put away. And thus of the generall charge. The catalogue followes. And the sinnes are either sinnes of the heart or sinnes of the tongue. The sinnes of the heart are <hi>anger wrath, malice.</hi> The sinnes of the tongue are, blaspheming or cursed speaking, filthy speaking and lying. First of the sinnes of the heart.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anger wrath</hi>] I suppose these words expresse one and the same sinne: it may be the two words import two degrees of anger.

I say, it is a godly passion. For there are two sorts of naturall passions. Some are so euill they can neuer be good, as enuie. Some are so naturall, as they may be either good or euill as they agree or disagree with the law of God, and such is anger. I say <hi>iust zeale,</hi> for I know that euerie zeale hath not alwaies either good cause or good effect. I adde <hi>against sinne,</hi> because it must not be our indignation at the person. And wee may bee angrie and vexed at our owne sinnes as <hi>Paul</hi> was <note n="g" place="margin">

                              <hi>Pro:</hi> 19.19.</note>. Hence it is, that our Sauiour Christ, denounceth iudgment both temporall and eternall against vnaduised anger in the fifth of Mathew <note n="x" place="margin">
                              <hi>Math.</hi> 5.22.</note>. And this of the reasons.</p>
                        <p>The remedies against anger are of two sorts. I. there are remedies for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in our selues. II. there are remedies for anger in others.</p>
                        <p>There are diuers things are good to represse and subdue, and mortifie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in our selues. 1. from the coherence of these words with the former verse, it appeares, that the serious and frequent meditation of our miserie, is a good meanes to cut downe the power and vnrulinesse of our passions. 2. Sauing knowledge will make a man <hi>peaceable, gentle, easie to be intreated</hi>
                           <note n="y" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iam:</hi> 3.17.</note>, and the true reason why there is so much passion many times in the heart, is, because their is so little knowledge in the head. for passion and folly are twins.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, to preuent anger, or to restraine it, it is good to take heed <hi>of med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the strife that belongs not to vs.</hi> But carefully to mind and meddle with our owne businesse<note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Prou.</hi> 26.7.</note>, especially we should take heed of medling with foolish and indiscreet persons, <hi>for he that contendeth with the foolish, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest</hi>
                           <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Pro:</hi> 29 9.</note>. Fourthly, we must not <hi>giue place to wrathc</hi>, nor let it haue a vent by sudden, and vnaduised words, or by suffering our affections to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in swelling and desire of reuenge: we should silence our passions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue to suspect and restraine our words. Anger smothered will languish, but let out will flame vnto further mischiefe. Fiftly, we should diuert the course of our anger, and spend the heate of our affections vpon our owne sinnes, and it were good to get into our heads a catalogue of some of our chiefest corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that if we be suddainly tempted to anger, we might presently thinke of those sinnes, and spend our zeale vpon them. Sixtly, we should consider him that prouokes vs to anger. That he is the instrument of God to trie our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and that if he doe it wilfully it is a brand of his folly. Lastly, the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the passion of Christ is an excellent remedy to kill anger and to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie it And thus of anger in ourselues.</p>
                        <p>Now the remedies for anger in others are such as these. First, silence. Vnto many natures, <hi>to answer againe</hi> is to put fewell to the fire. For anger is fire, and words are fuell. Secondly, if thy silence will be interpreted to be sullennesse, or contempt (for some thinke they are despised, if they be not answered) then the next remedy is a soft answer <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Prou:</hi> 15.1.</note>. And thirdly, it seems that a gift in secret, is good to pacifie anger. For so <hi>Salomon</hi> thinkes Prou. 21.14. But fourthly, if this will not serue, then it is good to <hi>giue place to it</hi>

                              <hi>Rom:</hi> 12.19.</note>, I meane to goe away from the angry person, till his anger be ouer. But especially take heed that thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke not anger, <hi>for the forcing of wrath bringeth out strife</hi> as the churning of

                        <p>Againe, malice is varied by the persons in whom it is. There is publike malice and priuat malice: publike malice is in publike estates, and is shewed by factions and diuisions: priuate malice is varied by the obiects, for there is a malice in wicked men against Gods seruants. Thus <hi>they haue hated them that rebuke in the gate</hi>

                        <p>There is also domesticall malice between husband and wife, brethren and sisters, seruants and masters, &amp;c.

                        <p>There is also malice abroad, between man and man in controuersing: and that kinde of malice is principally heere mentioned: now this kinde of malice is not alwaies open and professed, for <hi>he that hateth,</hi> as the Wiseman saith, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times <hi>dissembleth with his lips and layeth vp deceit within him.</hi> there may be <hi>seauen abominations</hi> in his heart, though he speake faire <note n="d" place="margin">

                        <p>And the first reason may be taken from the vile nature of it. It is a vice so transcendent, that it passeth other vices; it hath been vsually said, that to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry is humane, but to perseuere in anger (which is this malice) is deuilish: and therefore it is reckoned in the first of the Romanes, amongst the monstrous sinnes, which the monstrous Gentiles fell into: besides, to <hi>hate and be hatefull,</hi> is a dangerous signe of vnregeneracie <note n="f" place="margin">

                           <note n="g" place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.9.</note>. Thirdly, it is worthy to be repented of and carefully shunned, euen for the ill effects of it, for it is like leauen <note n="h" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.8.</note>, it will sowre and spoyle whatsoeuer

praise-worthy qualities were in a man before: and it is a great lett both to the word and prayer; and thence it is that the Apostle Peter exhorts, that if wee would grow by the word in affection and practise, wee must then <hi>lay aside all malice and enuy</hi> 
                           <note n="i" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1.2.</note>: and the Apostle Iames shewes in his 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> chapter <note n="k" place="margin">

                              <hi>Pro:</hi> 25.8.</note>. Further, Salomon obserues that men that thinke to hide their grudge and hatred, haue their wickednesse, many times, shewed before the whole congregation <note n="n" place="margin">

                           <note place="margin">The remedies against malice in our selues.</note>The remedies against malice follow: and they are of two sorts. For malice is to be medicined in our owne hearts, or auoyded, or it is to be compounded, or preuented in others. Now to take order that malice might not infect vs, these rules are to be obserued. First, we must take heed of the causes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and they are either within vs or without vs; within vs there is pride <note n="s" place="margin">
                              <hi>Pro:</hi> 13.10.</note>, and impatience, and enuy, and in some nature a very lust to contend, a kinde of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulancie, and a very spirit of contradiction; now vnlesse we keepe out or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due these, it cannot be, but grudge and malicious discords will transport vs. Againe, without vs, there is the tale-bearer and scorner, and the froward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the busie-body, called the <hi>man of imaginations,</hi> all these must be shun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                           <note n="t" place="margin">
                              <hi>Pro:</hi> 26.20.</note>. and the like may be said of contentious and froward persons, for <hi>as coles are to burning coles, so is a contentious man to kindle strife</hi> 
                           <note n="u" place="margin">
                              <hi>Pro:</hi> 26.21.</note>. If a man finde himselfe apt to grudge or strife, it is his best way, to keep out of the way of froward persons, that may soone fire him. The like counsell must bee giuen concerning the scorner, for, saith the Wiseman, <hi>cast out the scorner and contention shall goe out</hi> 
                           <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Pro:</hi> 22.10.</note>: and it is sure, that he that would not be infected with hatred, his best way will bee to hate the busie-body. Now if this direction will not serue the turne, then in the second place, thou must mortifie thy rising malice, and confesse it with griefe vnto God, till by praier thou get some victory ouer it. Thirdly, much malice and grudge would be auoyded, if we did but obserue that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, Leuit. 19.17. namely, that when wee did conceiue dislike of any thing in our brother, for which we did feare we should hate him, we should go to him, and reprooue him, <hi>rebuking him plainly for his sinne:</hi> many times a seasonable reproofe drawes out the poyson of beginning grudge and malice. Fourthly, it is good to meditate vpon the passion of Christ, and of his readinesse to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21380:188"/>
euen vpon the crosse great wrongs, and worser enimies: wee should lay a necessitie vpon our selues, to bee aduised before we would admit contention, or the resolution to contend, for as Salomon saith, <hi>by pride commeth contention, but with the well-aduised is wisdome</hi> 
                           <note n="x" place="margin">
                              <hi>Pro:</hi> 13.10.</note>, euen this wisdome to forbeare contention. Finally, in the fourth to the Ephesians the Apostle before he saith, <hi>Let all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse, and wrath, and malice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>bee put away,</hi> had said in the verse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>grieue not the holy spirit of God, whereby yee are sealed to the day of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

                              <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30.31</note>: as if he would import, that a man might bee induced to put away ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and the rest of the vices there named, with great ease and readinesse, if he would obey the motions of the Spirit, and busie himselfe seriously about the assurance of his full and finall Redemption, daily thinking of the time when hee shall be rid of all wants, and sinnes, and wrongs too: if wee could oftner thinke of Gods iudgments, and the great day of reuenge and recompence, it would cause vs to haue lesse stomach, to bee our owne iudges and reuengers. And if the spirit of God might rule vs, our flesh would haue little heart to busie it selfe about the works of malice.</p>
                        <p>Now for malice in others,<note place="margin">Remedie for malice in others.</note> it must be considered either as it is to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, or as it is to bee auoided; and for the compounding of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> obserue these rule<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> First, if thou wilt not <hi>doe good for euill,</hi> (which yet is required <note n="a" place="margin">

                              <hi>Rom:</hi> 12.17.</note>. Secondly, <hi>if thy brother haue ought against thee,</hi> so as thou bee priuy to thy selfe that thou hast done him any wrong, or giuen him any cause so to conceiue, then goe thou and seeke recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, tender it and aske it of him. Thirdly, if the contention be yet se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, follow Salomons counsell, say nothing of it to others, but <hi>debate thy cause with thy neighbour himselfe, and discouer not thy secret to another</hi> 
                           <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Pro:</hi> 25.4.</note>: peace might soone be made with many men, if the discord were not made so publike. Now for auoiding of contention and malitious discords, there are diuers rules of great vse. I. <hi>Meddle not with the strife that belongs not to thee</hi>

                              <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.11.</note>. Lastly, pray for a couering loue, for <hi>hatred stirreth vp strife, but loue couereth all sinne</hi>

                        <p>The vse of all this, may be both for reproofe &amp; for instruction. For reproofe of many men, that are fearefully soured with this leauen, they doe not onely let <hi>the Sunne goe downe vpon their wrath,</hi> but they let the Sunne goe his whole course, and can finde no time from the one end of the yeere vnto the other, to compound and lay aside their discords. Nay so hath malice seated it selfe in some dogged and spightfull natures, that it seemeth to proclaime, it will neuer loose possession, till the deuill the father of malice hath full possession both of soule and body. But let euery godly minde be perswaded to auoyd this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous sinne, yea let vs striue to auoide the very beginning of it, or if nature haue such corruption, that for the present we cannot get our hearts rid of all secret poyson of dislike, let vs be sure we be but <hi>children in malitiousnesse:</hi> it is a monstrous wickednesse to haue a head that is exercised to strife, and a heart that hath a kinde of sinfull dexteritie, in framing and plodding for malitious courses.

And therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Apostle in the fifth to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> also, aswell as here puts it into the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of euils he would most seriously diswade them from: and out of that Chapter, we may gather diuers reasons against it. 1. Wee are deare vnto God and therefore should follow him as deare children. Now of all thinges we neuer saw any colour of this in God. Angrie speaking indeede is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for our capacitie giuen to God: but neuer filthie speaking, or any the least glimpse of it. 2. Our loue should bee as Christs was. Now his was to profit not to infect, and it was pleasing to God, not as hatred, as this filth of wordes must needes be. 3. It is a shame, and vncomelinesse, and dishonor to a Christian. 4. If any would obiect it is but a small matter, the Apostle would soone answere, men ought not to be deceiued with vaine words for it is sure that because of this and such like things <hi>commeth the wrath of God vpon the children of disobedience.</hi> 5. This is a froth of filthinesse that should onely be found in vnregenerate men that lie in darkenes, and it is a worke of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to speake filthily aswell as to do filthily. 6. If wee be children of the light we should shew it by our fearefulnesse to speake or do any thing that were vnpleasing to God. And we should shew it by reproouing such filthinesse in others: for such filth if it be not reproued is not regarded, but a Christian reproofe will make manifest in some measure that it is not good nor agreeing to truth and righteousnes, and goodnesse. 7. Men are in some degree of a lethargie that vse this sinne. 8. A Christian ought to walke exactly, strictly, precisely or circumspectly, it is no more then he is bound to do, to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the least filthy word aswell as of filthy actions, and therein to take notice of Gods will. And this of the second vice of the tongue.</p>

                           <hi>Lie not one to another</hi>] This is the last vice in the Catalogue, lying is giuen oftentimes to the dumbe creatures: and so Images lie, and teach lies, and so the wonders of Antichrist are lying wonders <note n="a" place="margin">2 <hi>Thes:</hi> 2:11.</note>. But it is most vsually and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ascribed to man, and so he lies either in nature, or in worke, or in worde. <hi>In nature,</hi> and so the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith <hi>men of high degree are a lie</hi> 
                           <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psalm:</hi> 62:9</note>. <hi>In worke,</hi> and so men lie either through hipocrisie, or deceite. Hipocrisie is lying, whether it be in worship to God <note n="c" place="margin">

                              <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.9.</note>. Deceit is lying, and therefore the bread of deceit is called <hi>bread of lying, Prouerb.</hi> 20.17. But most properly a lie is in word, and so there is a lie in doctrine when men teach falshood, or applie truthes to wrong persons or for wrong ends. The Diuell is a lying spirit in the mouth of many Teachers. Men lie also in false witnesse bearing, so do they in slaundering and flattering. But most strictly, lying is in the report of thinges vntrue in conuersing with men whether at home or abroade.</p>
                        <p>There are many reasons why a Christian should take heede of lying.<note place="margin">Reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst lying.</note> First if we consider the cause of lying it is the Diuell, he is the father of lies <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ioh</hi> 8.44.</note>. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly if we consider the nature of a lie, it is most shamefull and hatefull: and therefore the liar denies his lie, because he is a shamed to be taken with it.</p>
                        <p>And our Swaggerers hold the lie so disgraceful that they will reuenge it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times with blood. Riches cannot adde so much grace to a man as lying will bring him disgrace, and therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> saith: <hi>A poore man walking in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, is better then a rich man which is a liar<hi rend="sup">f</hi>.

                              <hi>Reu.</hi> 21.8.22.15.</note> and in other places of Scripture. Thirdly on the contrarie to <hi>speake the truth is to shew righteousnesse</hi>

                              <hi>Zeph</hi> 3 13.</note>. Fourthly in the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> the Apostle reasons thus, <hi>Put away lying; speake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man truth to his neighbour for we are members one of an other</hi>

                              <hi>Eph</hi> 4 25.</note>. It were most vnnaturall for the head to lie to the hand, or one member to be false to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so vnnaturall is it for Christians to lie one to an other. For they are (or professe to be) members one of an other.

And now par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, if we would know what he doth, and how he is imployed, we must vnderstand, that he giues lawes to the members against the law of God and the minde; that he frames obiections and lets against all holy duties; that he striues to br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Outwardly, he works all sorts of disorders, impieties, vnrighteousnesse, and intemperance. A catalogue of his outward works are set downe, in the Epistle to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal:</hi> 5.22.23</note>. he is heere in the coherence, described to be couetous, filthy, wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, cursed and lying: and all these are well called his works, because he rests not in euill dispositions, but will burst out into action: besides, it is his trade <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Thus of the matter to bee reformed, the manner followes. <hi>Put off</hi>] The faithfull are said to put of the old man six waies. 1 <hi>In signification,</hi> or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, and so in baptisme. 2 <hi>In profession,</hi> or outward acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and so we professe to leaue off the practise of sin. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
                           <hi>by Iustification,</hi> and so the guilt of sinne is put off. 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> 
                           <hi>by relation,</hi> and so in our head Christ Iesus he is euery way already perfitly put off. 5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>

                           <hi>by Sanctification,</hi> and so he is put off but in part, and inchoatiuely: the last way is heere principally ment.</p>
                        <p>Now in respect of Sanctification, the old man and his works are put away, first, in the word, for so Christians are said to <hi>be cleane by the word</hi>

                              <hi>Rom:</hi> 6.6.</note>: for to crucifie him, is to lift him vp on the crosse of Christ, and to naile him with the application of Gods threatnings, which causeth the paines of godly sorrow.</p>

Now then, (as I conceiue of it) sin is crucified, when wee make our natures smart for it, so repenting of our sinne, as we allow no sinne: for to crucifie a man, is to leaue no member free: prouided that we be sure, that the ould man be so pierced, that he will dye of it, though he be not presently dead.</p>
                        <p>

Thirdly, how can the most of vs escape, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes of God, must needs fall vpon vs, for euery man lookes to the mending of his house, and his lands, and his apparell, &amp;c. but who lookes to the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his nature? euery man hath courage to put away an euill seruant, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then faling from God by sinne, he recouers the renewing of the Image of God, by grace and effectuall calling in Iesus Christ, that this may be more fully vnderstood, we must know that man is the Image of God, either consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more strictly as a superiour, or more generally as man. As a Superiour man is said to be Gods Image in Scripture two waies chiefly, 1. As a husband and so in the familie the Apostle calles him, the Image <hi>and glorie of God</hi> 
                           <note n="s" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7.</note>. 2. As a Magistrate, and so Princes and Rulers are called gods <note n="t" place="margin">

                        <p>Howsoeuer the perfit vnderstanding of Gods Image, belongs to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and to the vision of heauen, yet in some measure we may conceiue of it, as it is reuealed in the word, and imprinted in the nature and obedience of man. Two things I principally propound to bee heere considered more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, 1. Wherein man is the Image of God. 2. The differences of the Image of God in man, either from that which is in Christ, and the Angels, or as it is to be considered in the seuerall estates of man, and then I come to the vse of all.</p>
                        <p>For the first, man is said to beare the similitude of God, or to haue in or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:21380:193"/>

For whatsoeuer we thinke of, there ariseth in the minde some likenesse of it, now if wee conceiue of God amisse, then we commit horrible Idolatrie, and whatsoeuer seruice is done to the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse we so conceiue off is done to an Idoll. But now when Christians taught out of the word conceiue of God according to the descriptions of the word, that is not after the likenesse of any creature, but in a way of apprehending of God in the humane nature of Christ, or otherwise according to his nature or properties, in some true measure, this Idaea or forme of God, as I may so call it, in the minde of the faithfull is a kinde of the Image of God. For to conceiue a likenesse of God is not vnlawfull, but to conceiue him to be like any creature in heauen and earth that is prohibited and vnlawfull. Secondly Man is after the Image of God in his substance, and therefore we are well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough said to be <hi>Gods ofspring</hi>

                              <hi>Act.</hi> 17.28.</note>. Now man is Gods Image both in his soule and in his body. The soule is the Image of God, as it is spirituall and simple, and as it is inuisible, and as it is immortall, and as it is an vnderstanding essence hauing power to know all sort of things, and to will freely. And some thinke it is Gods Image as there is in it a purtraiture as it were of the Trinity, for as there is in God distinct persons and yet euery person hath the whole essence, so there is in the soule distinct faculties, and yet euery faculty hath in it the whole soule, yea is the whole soule. Now that the body also is Gods Image these reasons may prooue. 1. Man is said to be made after Gods Image in the first creation. Man I say, not the soule of Man onely. 2. Gods Image was in Christs body: for he saith, <hi>he that seeth mee seeth the father.</hi> Hee saith not he that seeth my soule, nor indeed could the soule be seene. 3. When the Lord prohibiteth the shedding of mans blood, he yeeldeth this reason, for in the Image of God made he man, now it is manifest the soule cannot be killed, therefore mans body is after Gods Image. Now that God hath any body, but in three respects. 1. As mans body is a little world, and so the example of the world which was in God from all eternitie, is as it were breifly and summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily exprest by God in mans body. 2. There is none of our members almost, but they are attributed to God in Scripture, and so there is a double vse of our members, the one that they might serue the offices of the soule, and the other that they might be as it were certaine types or resemblances of some of the perfections of God. 3. Because the gifts of the minde do cause the body to shine as the candle doth the horne in the lanthorne.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly man is after Gods Image in the qualities of the soule: such as are wisedome, loue zeale, patience, meekenesse, and the rest: for in these he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembleth in some manner those glorious and blessed attributes of God. 4. Man is after Gods Image, in respect of sanctity of actions, in that he is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as he is holy, and in that he resembleth God in his workes, as in louing and hating where God loues and hates, and in knowing and approuing of things as God approues or knowes of them, it is plaine man resembles God in louing and shewing kindnesse to his enemies <note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</note> but generally by holinesse of cariage man doth resemble God, I meane in the creation did so, &amp; by grace the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beginne to do so. Lastly man beares the Image of God in his soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of dominion, and that both ouer himselfe and as he is Gods vicegerent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the liuing creatures and the earth, and thus of the first point.</p>
                        <p>Now for the differences of Gods Image, first that Image of God in man and the Image of God in Christ differs in two things. 1. Christ was the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall Image of the father, as hee was God, and we are his Image but by si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude. 2. Christ as man by reason of the personall vnion is filled with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most infinite perfections aboue measure which are in no man else besides.</p>
                        <p>Againe it differs from the Image of God in Angels in three respects. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21380:194"/>
they excell in nature, for they are wholy spirituall, and in action, they performe Gods will with greater glory and power. 2. They are free from all humane necessities euer since their creation. 3. They enioy the vision of glory in the presence of glory in heauen, in a manner peculiar to their place and natures.</p>
                        <p>Now for the differences of the image of God in man according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent estates of man, we must know the image of God according to the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold estate of man, is likewise threefold. 1. there is the <hi>image of nature,</hi> which Adam had. 2. the <hi>Image of grace,</hi> which the Saints now haue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thirdly, the <hi>Image of glory,</hi> which the blessed haue in heauen.</p>
                        <p>The Image of God in Adam had distinct specialties, Adam was a perfect Diuine, and a perfect Philosopher, euen in an instant, he knew the nature of all things in the instant of his creation, which now is attained vnto with extreame labour, and singular weaknesse. 2. he had an immortall nature, free from infirmities, diseases, death. 3. he should haue propagated an immortall seed, after the image of God, whereas now grace will not be propagated. 4. his obedience was charged with the obseruation of the tree of life and of good and euill.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Vses.</hi>
                           </note>The image of grace hath these specialties; 1. faith. 2. godly sorrow. 3. the cohabitation of the flesh. 4. a feeblenesse and defect in the measure of grace. 5. a peculiar kinde of inhabitation of the spirit of Christ.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the image of glory hath these differences; a freedom like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels from all terrene necessities. 2. an vtter abolishing of the sinfull flesh, and of the very naturall disposition to dye. 3. a full perfection of all graces. 4. a losse of faith and sorrow, and all the works of repentance. 5. a speciall vnutterable communion with God and good Angels in glory.</p>
                        <p>The consideration of this doctrine of gods image, should serue, to teach vs to loue and admire all that feare god, since the Lord hath graced them with this honor to be like god: tis a greater fauour, then if they had resembled the noblest Princes that euer were on earth, no all the carnall men on earth in all their glory, cannot reach to that absolutenesse of excellencie, that is in one of the poorest of gods seruants. 2. since the seat of this glorious resemblance of god is in the heart, it should teach vs especially to looke to our hearts, and <hi>keep them with all diligence</hi> 
                           <note n="x" place="margin">

If it should be our glory to be fashioned after the image of god, then it condemnes the abhominable securitie of the most men, that are so mindlesse of the repaire of the losse of this diuine gift, and in stead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with so much care <hi>fashion themselues after this world</hi>

                        <p>But before I passe from these words, there is further to be considered, first, the forme of speech, in that he saith not, his Image, but <hi>after his Image.</hi> 2. the efficient cause, noted in those words, <hi>of him that created him.</hi> For the first, we must vnderstand, that to say, <hi>man is the Image of God,</hi> and man <hi>is after the Image of God,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Imago ad Imaginem.</note> is not all one: for man is said to be the <hi>Image of God,</hi> because hee is <hi>truely so:</hi> and he is said to be <hi>after his Image,</hi> because he is not perfectly so; Christ onely resembles God in full perfection.</p>
                        <p>Now for the efficient cause of Gods Image, he is described heere by a Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrasis, <hi>he that created him.</hi> Man was two wayes created; first in respect of <hi>being,</hi> and so <hi>God</hi> created him. 2. in respect of <hi>new being,</hi> and so <hi>Christ</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

                        <p>This Verse may containe another reason to perswade to mortification and holy life. And the reason may be taken from the great respect God hath of true grace in Christ, and the little loue or care he hath for any thing else, a Barbarian, a Scythian, a bond-man, if he haue grace shall be accepted: wheras a Graecian, a Iew, a free-man, without grace, is without respect with God, Christ is all. It may be the Apostle heere meets with the false Apostles, that so much vrged the obseruation of Iewish rites, &amp; stand so much vpon it to diuert the people from the sound care of reformation of life, by filling their heads with questions and vaine wranglings about the law, whereas the Apostle shewes men may be absolute and compleat in these outward obseruances, and yet their circumcision auailes them nothing before God.

This may greatly reprooue the wonderfull stupiditie of men, that are so taken vp with admiration of these outward priuiledges, when as we see how all is vaine without Christ, what shall it profit a man if hee had all honour and riches, and countenance of friends, and the pleasures of life, if when he came into Gods sight hee might haue no acceptance for his soule?<note place="margin">Excellent con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>solation in Christ.</note> If Christ bee all things, then without Christ, all things else are nothing, but especially this doctrine serues for singular comfort to Gods children in all their distresses, and that will better appeare if wee consider the particulars.

                        <p>There are three things requisite to holy life. First, the meditation of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly things.<note place="margin">The diuision of this part of the text.</note> Secondly, the mortification of vice. Thirdly, the exercise of holy graces and duties. Of the first the Apostle hath intreated from verse 1. to verse 5. Of the second from verse the 5. hitherto. Now in these words, and those that follow to the 18. verse he intreats of the third, for he giues rules for the obedience of the new man, and those rules are more speciall, or more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. The more speciall rules are from the 11. verse to the sixteenth. The more generall are in the 16. and 17. verses: the one concerning the meanes of holy life, vers. 16. and the other concerning the ende of holy life, ver. 17.</p>
                        <p>The speciall rules giue in charge the exercise of nine graces, and in the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe of these rules I obserue. 1. The Motiues to perswade to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of them, and they are three; the one taken from their election, the other from their sanctification, the third from the loue of God to them. And these are briefly thrust together in a parenthesis in the beginning of the twelfth verse. 2. The manner how they be charged with these graces, and that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Metaphor <hi>put on.</hi> 3. The graces themselues, and they are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nine. Some of them haue their greatest praise in prosperity principally, as <hi>mercy, kindnesse, meekenesse, humblenesse of mind,</hi> some of them concerne the times of aduersity principally, as <hi>long suffering and clemency in forbearing and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing.</hi> Some indifferently belong to all times, as <hi>loue, peace, thankefulnesse, or amiablenesse. ver.</hi> 14.15.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Obseruation from cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note>Now from the coherence imported in the worde (<hi>therefore</hi>) diuers things may be noted.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 In that he prescribes the mortification of vices, before the exercise of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it shewes that till vice be mortified, grace will not grow nor prosper, the true reason why many men thriue no better in the gift of Gods spirit, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are so little and so sleighty in confessing and bewailing of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of heart and life.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 In that he rests not in the reformation of vices, but prescribes also rules of new obedience, it shewes that it is not enough to leaue sinne, but we must bee exercised in doing good. It will not serue turne for the husbandman, that his fruit trees beare no euill fruit, but hee will cut them downe if they bring not forth good fruit, barrennes is cause great enough of hewing downe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Men that are truly renewed after the Image of Christ are willing to be appointed and prescribed, for the attaining and exercise of euery holy neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full grace and duty, he that hath true experience of the beginning of any true grace, hath a true desire, and a willing indeauour, and a iust estimation of all grace. For as he that repents of one sinne loues no sin, so he that trauels in the birth of any grace desires all grace, so farre as in conscience he knowes them to be required, of God, and in some degree, except it be in the time of violent temptations, or that the losse of the meanes occasion any deadnesse or faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in the desires of the heart, or that there be a relapse into some presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous sinne after calling.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 If this therefore carry vs to the former verse, then we are informed, that our indeauour after mercy, meeknesse, patience, loue, peace or the rest, will neuer want acceptation with God. And withall wee may take comfort if wee
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:21380:196"/>
would seriously set about the practise of these, though wee found many lets, and doubts, and difficulties, yet Christ will be all in all to help vs, and giue good successe.</p>

Spirituall mercies are not all of a sort, for wee may shew mercy sometimes in things wherein no man can help, as by praying vnto God for helpe: now in things wherein man can helpe, the mercy to be shewed respects eyther the ignorance or other distresses of other men. The mercy to the ignorant is eyther <hi>instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the things they should know, or <hi>councell</hi> in the things they should doe. Now his other distresses arise either from his actions, or from his passions: his actions are eyther against thee, and so thy mercie is to <hi>forgiue,</hi> or against o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and so thy mercy is to <hi>admonish</hi> or <hi>correct.</hi> Thy mercie towards him, in respect of his passions or sufferings, is either in words and so it is <hi>consolation,</hi> or in deeds, and so it is <hi>confirmation.</hi> What shall I say? there is the mercy of the Minister, and the mercy of the Magistrate, and also the mercy of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man.</p>

                        <p>Of Long-suffering before. 1. Of Clemencie in this verse, where two things may be noted: 1. the duty required: 2. the reason rendred for the vrging of the duty. The duty is propounded in the two principall parts of it, <hi>viz.</hi> to forbeare, and to forgiue; and amplified by the supposition of a case, <hi>If any man haue a quarrell to another.</hi> The reason is from the example of Christ forgiuing vs</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Forbearing</hi>] The originall word is rendred, sometimes to maintaine, <note n="a" place="margin">

                        <p>Now if wee would distinctly know what it is to forbeare one another, as it here imports a maine part of Christian clemency; we must vnderstand, that it is not an omission of holy duties to others, nor a refusing to satisfie others in their griefs or offences, nor a shunning of their company, nor yet a swallowing downe of all sorts of iniuries committed with an high hand, without acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement or satisfaction. But out of clemency to forbeare others, hath in it such things as these. 1. A freedome from the thirst of reuenge. 2 A bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the infirmities of others, which may be performed two waies; First, by couering them, and not blazing them abroad, if they bee secret. And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by silence, in not reprouing them when they faile meerely in frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thirdly, it hath in it not onely a bearing with them, but a bearing of them, <note n="f" place="margin">
                              <hi>Gal</hi> 6.2</note> and that I thinke may be two waies also. First, in not stirring or prouoking their infirmities. Secondly, by pleasing our neighbours humor in that which is good to edification <note n="g" place="margin">

Fourthly, there is a forbearance in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of wrong to vs, and thus to forbeare, is not to prosecute euery wrong, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by answers or by suits. And this forbearance is to be practised, when we are able to reuenge, else it is no thankes to vs to forbeare, when we want either power or oportunity to to doe it, 2. tis forbearance not to meete wrong with wrong.</p>
                        <p>Or thus, there is a threefold forbearance: First, in iudgement, when in doubtfull cases wee suspend our opinions or censures. Secondly, in words which consists either in not answering, or in giuing soft answers. Thirdly, in deedes when we render not euill for euill.</p>
                        <p>Againe, forbearance is varied from the consideration of time, for in some things we must forbeare euer, neuer taking notice of the infirmities or wrongs

Besides this distempered peeuishnesse, and froward misconceiuing and censuring, it is bred of ill causes, for it comes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of malice or ignorance. Of malice, for loue couereth a multitude of sinnes, especially it suspendeth doubtfull actions. Of ignorance, for it is certaine a wise man will keepe in till afterwards, or holde it his glory to be able to passe by an offence. Further, this sinne may be aggrauated by the relations that are mutually betweene Christians. Are they not fellow-members, coheires, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens, partakers of the same afflictions, are they not brethren, &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides is not this also a constant iustice, that they that iudge, are iudged; they that censure, are censured; and doth not this enuying, and iangling, giue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of reioicing to aduersaries? Doth it not many times so transforme Christians, that it makes them very like wicked men, when they grow so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered that they reuile their owne mothers sonnes <note n="h" place="margin">

Besides inasmuch as Christians haue trouble enough otherwaies, it doth not become their brethren to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them: and we should be so farre from troubling our brethren, as we should rather serue them by loue, and if men will needes bite one another, let them take heede lest they be deuoured one of another.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he applies it. 3. Because the Christian in his name sues out the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his sinnes, and by him procures forgiuenesse. Certainly it may bee a singular comfort to all distressed soules if they consider, that hee that is their brother, head, Sauiour, euen he that shed his bloud for them, is hee that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth of all pardons,<note place="margin">What actions in Christ are Imitable.</note> and applies remission of sinnes; sure it is no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to get a pardon from him, that is so ingaged in his loue to vs.</p>
                        <p>Heere also we see that the action of Christ is the instruction of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:21380:201"/>
Christ forgaue, so must hee; wee must remember the distinctions of Christs actions, some were miraculous, as fasting 40. daies, raising the dead, &amp;c. These are not to bee imitated, because they cannot; some are peculiar actions belonging to his office, as to redeeme, or make intercession, &amp;c. these also are proper to him onely: Now some are mortall, these last are only imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. Orthus, some actions of Christ he did as God, some as Mediator, some as man. The last onely binde vs to follow.</p>
                        <p>Againe,<note place="margin">To forgiue as Christ for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue hath 5. things in it.</note> in that we are bound to forgiue, as he forgaue, it not onely teach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth, that we must doe it as well as he. But for the manner of it as he did. And how was that? First, Christ forgaue his inferiours. Secondly, Christ forgaue great faults aswell as lesse, yea all sorts of faults, yea though they were often fallen into. Thirdly, nothing was to deare to Christ to merit or confirme his forgiuenesse, therefore he shed his owne bloud, hee stood not vpon his profit or his ease. Fourthly, Christ vses all meanes to preuent offending. Fifthly, Where Christ forgiue: he forgets. Sixthly, Christ forgiues 2. waies. First, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Crosse before men did repent. Secondly, by the Gospell, publishing his pardon vpon mans repentance, he did not carrie them grudge till they repented and all these waies should we imitate Christ.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, obserue heere the certainty of assurance; For if a man did not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, and infallibly know, that Christ did forgiue him, how could that be made a reason, if he did not know it to be.</p>
                        <p>And thus of clemency, and so of the two first sorts of graces.</p>

                           <hi>Loue</hi>] Loue is of diuers kinds, there is naturall ciuill, morall and religious loue; it is naturall loue for a man to loue himselfe, his parents, kindred, &amp;c. This ciuill loue that is framed in vs by the Lawes of men, by authority from God, whereby we are brought not to violate the rules of Iustice, or society. In morall loue, that loue of friends is of eminent respect, but it is religious or Christian loue is meant heere.</p>
                        <p>Christian loue is carried both towards God and towards men, and both may be heere meant; For the very loue of God may be required as needfull in our conuersing with men, because we can neuer loue men aright, till wee first loue God, and besides we are bound in our carriage, to shew our loue to God, by zeale for his glory, and auoyding sinne in our callings, for the loue wee beare to him.</p>
                        <p>Sure it is that the true loue of God is exceeding needfull to be put on, as a most royall robe, I say the true loue of God, and therefore I aduise all sorts of men as to labour for it, so to try themselues whether this loue of God be right in them, if we loue God, wee receiue them that come in his name, <note n="b" place="margin">

                        <p>The loue to men is loue of enemies, or brotherly loue of Gods children, Christians are bound to loue their very enemies, and this kind of loue must be put on as well as the other, onely let vs aduisedly consider what the loue of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies hath in it. When God requires vs to loue our enemies, hee doth not require vs to loue their vices, or to hold needlesse society with their persons, or to further them in such kindnesses as might make them more wicked, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish the defence of our iust cause, but to loue is not to returne euill for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, <note n="g" place="margin">

                           <hi>The bond of perfection</hi>] Loue is said to be the bond of perfection 3. waies. 1. Because it is a most perfect bond, and so it is an <hi>Hebraisme</hi>; for all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are not as it were collected in loue, all other vertues will soone be vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:21380:202"/>
vnlesse they be fastned in loue, neither doth it onely tye vertues together, but it giues them their perfection, moouing them, and perfecting them, and making them accepted. And it is most perfect because it is most principall among vertues, nothing is in this life well composed that is not directed hither.</p>
                        <p>But let none mistake, he doth not shew heere how wee be made perfect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but how wee might conuerse perfectly amongst men. And so the summe of this sense is, that all should be well with vs, in liuing one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if loue flourish amongst vs, perfection consisteth in loue by way of bond.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it is a bond of perfection, because it is the bond that ties toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church which is the beauty and perfection of the whole world.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, it is a bond of perfection as it leades vs to God who is perfection it selfe, yea by loue God is ioyned to man, and dwells in him.</p>
                        <p>The vse of all is,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Vse.</hi>
                           </note> seeing loue is of this nature, vse dignity and perfection, therefore we should labour to be rooted in loue, euen euery way firmely set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in it. And to this end we should labour more to mortifie our owne selfe-loue, and the care for our owne ease, profit, credit, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And this may wonderfully also shame vs for those defects are found in vs. It may greatly reprooue in vs that coldnesse of affection, that is euen in the better sort, and those frequent ianglings and discords, and that fearefull neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of fellowship in the Gospell in many places, and all those euill fruits that arise from the want of the exercise of this grace, such as are suspitions, blind censures, &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>Thus of internall peace, externall peace followes; And it is eyther dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall or Ecclesiasticall, or polliticall. Peace should rule our houses, and shew it selfe by freedome from bitternesse, and chiding, and brawling, and absurd peeuish passions.</p>
                        <p>And for Church peace (to write a word or two of that) it is not onely a rest from persecution, but also from discords within, this is a maruellous blessing. This peace hath not in it a confusion of al sorts of men, ioyned together in one vniuersall amity, though they be neuer so wicked. For <hi>Christ came not to send such peace,</hi> and the word is a fanne that will make a diuision. The world will hate, and darknesse will not mixe with light, the children of the prophets will be <hi>as signes and wonders euen in Israell.</hi> But this peace is a holy amity and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly concord, in the true members of the mysticall body, both in consent and doctrine. This peace in the Church is of singular worth and occasions vnspeakeable ioy and growth in the Church: this is to bee sought and praied for of euery Christian, but especially it should be the care of Church-gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. And certainely there would bee more peace if they would more and more loue goodnesse, and honour good men; and more carefully preuent and seuerely purge out the leauen of corrupt doctrine, and wicked life, and so tithe <hi>mint</hi> and <hi>cummin,</hi> as not neglect the waightier things of the law, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they would more disgrace flatterers and slanderers, that imploy their whole might to make the breach worse.</p>
                        <p>Politicall peace either priuate, and so it is a rest from suites and quarrels. Or publike, and so it is a rest from warres, and rebellions, and tumults.</p>
                        <p>But I thinke by externall peace heere is meant in generall concord, and a quiet, harmelesse, peaceable course of conuersing with men in all our carriage. Now God is said to be the author of it, in that it is his gift, and speciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to worke it amongst men, and it is said to rule when wee can preferre publike peace before our priuate respects. And when we can seeke it, and not stay till it be sought of vs, and when wee can forbeare and forgiue, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any inequality, Now this peace may bee said to rule in the heart, though it be externall, because if corrupt passions be killed in thee, (as enuy, rage, malice, desire of reuenge, &amp;c.) men would easily agree in life, bind the heart to the good abearing, and the hands will bind themselues.</p>
                        <p>The vse may be both for reproofe of the peruerse dispositions of the most men that will not liue in peace, but with all falshood and sinne, nourish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and vaine contentions, as also it may informe and inflame men to desire peace, to seeke it, yea to follow after it, <note n="d" place="margin">

                           <hi>To the which ye are called</hi>] Wee are called to peace not onely by men, who by their lawes require peace, but chiefly by God, and that two waies. First in the generall precepts of the wordes which are set downe in diuers places. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly in speciall manner, in the word of reconciliation, that word that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts vs and reconciles vs doth at the very first shew vs the very necessity and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21380:204"/>
worth of peace, as the sense of our neede of Gods mercy, makes vs mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to men; so the sense of our neede of Peace with God, makes vs peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with men.</p>
                        <p>This confutes their folly that say forwardnesse in religion makes men tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent, most wretchedly doe prophane men sinne against Gods people in that aspersion. For they are called to peace, and are the most peaceable people in the world. But let all that feare God, euen shew the fruit of their holy calling, by approuing themselues to belouers of peace.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In one body</hi>] The second reason is taken from their mutuall relation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselues, they are members of one body, and as it is vnnaturall and vnseemely to see a man teare his owne flesh, so is it most vnnaturall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely for Christians to bite and deuoure one another, by iarring, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, and wrangling one with another: and wee should hence learne to speake all one thing, and haue all one faith, and one heart, and so liue in peace that the God of loue and peace may be with vs. But of this mysticall vnion in the former Chapter.</p>
                        <p>Thus of Peace. Thankefulnesse followes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And be yee thankefull</hi>] Thankefulnesse is either to God or men. T'is the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here is meant; Thankfulnesse to men must be considered in it selfe, and in the amiable performance of it, for the word is by some rendred amiable. And it may bee it notes but the right manner of affecting in giuing or receiuing thankes.</p>
                        <p>This thankefulnes hath in it principally gratitude, that is, thanks in words yet it may containe also gratuities, that is, tokens of good will, whereby wee indeauour indeed to recompence good for good.</p>
                        <p>Thankefulnesse is sometimes in desire, sometimes in deed, it is true thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse vnfainedly to desire opportunitie to shew it.</p>
                        <p>Thankefulnesse may be due, not onely to godly men, but also to wicked men, yea such as turne to be our enemies, we should watch to the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of doing them good, though they be euill.</p>
                        <p>Now the Amiablenesse required, is either in him that must performe thankefulnesse, or in him that must receiue it.</p>

                           <hi>In all wisedome</hi>] wisedome is sometimes taken for vertue as folly is for sinne, but heere I take it for knowledge, and that not as the gaining of heauenly wisedom is the end of the entertainment of the word,<note place="margin">Of the wise vse and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the word.</note> but as it notes the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how we should entertaine the word, this wise manner of entertaining the word, I consider both negatiuely and affirmatiuely: Negatiuely to handle the word wisely is not to handle or vse it: First; coldly, fruitlesly, or vnaptly: Secondly; peruesly in wresting the word to ill ends, to nourish curiosity, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition or sinne. Thirdly, carnally as the Capernaites, that know no flesh of Christ, but the flesh of his body, nor any eating but carnall. Fourthly; not indiscreetly when we come abroad into company, we should so professe and vse the word, as that we dishonour it not by Indiscretion, by not heeding pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, times, occasions, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Affirmatiuely to vse the word wisely, is in the generall, especially to teach our selues. And to this end: First, to vnderstand it. Secondly, to seeke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable things, not curious &amp; pleasing things only. Thirdly, so to try all things as to keepe that which is good. Good I say particularly and for our owne vse, there be some things in hearing, reading, &amp;c. that doe exceedingly; not onely affect vs, but are in speciall manner fitting vs: now it is a speciall wisedome to keepe these things whatsoeuer else we lose. Fourthly, to wait vpon all the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of getting profit by the word, to know our seasons <note n="q" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.7.</note>. Fifthly, in carriage abroad, not to be so indiscreetly open in the discouery of our minds and knowledge, and opinions, as to be catched by the fraud of any, and to this end, not to trust all that faine themselues to be iust men <note n="r" place="margin">

                        <p>Thus of the explication.</p>
                        <p>The vses follow,<note place="margin">The vses ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall.</note> and those are eyther generall from all their words, or spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall from each of them.

                        <p n="1">1 For reproofe, if it must be thus of all intertained, how great a sinne is it, to neglect or contemne the word, and in as much as this is a great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sinne, it is required, and requited by God with foure singular curses. The first Iudgement vpon the contemners of the word is, that all the comforts
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21380:207"/>
of the word, are vnto them as a <hi>sealed booke:</hi> so as that worde which is to the faithful a well-head of all true and sound ioy,<note n="4" place="margin">Iudgements vpon contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the word.</note> vnto them is of no tast nor pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they can find some sauour in any profits and sports; &amp;c. but none in the word. The second iudgement is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that when they doe for fashion or for feare, and other ill ends come to heare the preaching of the worde,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Esay</hi> 29.11.</note> they are many times <hi>slaine by the words of Gods mouth,</hi> and the Prophets euen mow downe scores, hundreds, and thousands of them, so as they are pierced and galled, smitten and buffeted, with the terrors of the word, (which is onely open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke them) and they see that threatning many times comprehends vnder it multitudes of men.</p>

                           <hi>Ans.</hi> This was the obiection in the Prophet <hi>Micha</hi> his time, and vttered by such as bare the name of <hi>Iacob</hi>: to whom all the promises did belong, and they were answered by the Prophet, that for resoluing of their doubt, they should ask 2. questions of their own consciences. The first was, whether they thought their workes were like the works of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the rest of the ancient Saints, to whom such comforts did belong, or whether such vile prophanenes and wickednesse were found in <hi>Iacob,</hi> as was apparantly found in them. The second question was, whether they did not see that the words of God were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies good to such as walke vprightly. In all which he showes that it is not the vncharitable seuerity of Gods seruants (for the doctrine is good to good men) but the vile prophanenes and contempt of the word in the people that made them liable to such terrors in the word.<note place="margin">

                        </p>
                        <p>The third iudgement is, that all ciuill praises in men that contemne the wisedome of God in the word, are singularly vile in Gods sight, <hi>Ier.</hi> 8.8.9. and he instructed in wisedome.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, <hi>saluation is farre from the wicked,</hi> because they seeke not Gods sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, the euidence of the hope of a better life is remooued from them,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Ps.</hi> 119.155.</note> so as speaking from their owne sence, they auouch it that no man can be sure of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life to himselfe, and if in the generall, the prophane neglect of the word be thus sought out and iudged of God: then surely those persons must needs be in great danger, that neuer opened their dores to the word, neuer taught their children and seruants, scarce euer had a bible in their houses: but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally such as shunne the word, as a true rocke of offence. Yea many of Gods Children may be iustly rebuked in this, that they are so farre from shewing that the word hath dwelt plenteously in them, that whereas for time and the plenty and power of the meanes, they might <hi>haue beene teachers, they haue need againe to be taught the very principles.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>The second generall vse is for information. See the admirable largenesse of the word and the perfectnes aboue all other things vnder the sunne, it is good for worship in the temple,<note place="margin">

                        <p>The third generall vse is for instruction. The meditation of the intertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the worde in all these words required, should teach vs to open our Churches, open our houses, yea our hearts and all for the word.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:21380:207"/>
as well as a good heart, and no man hath it naturally, wicked men may haue large memories, but not sanctified to containe holy things: and therefore if men would seeke to God in vprightnesse of desire: whatsoeuer they lost, yet the iudgement or answer of God in the word preached, or by reading or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, (which resolueth their doubts, pointeth at the meanes to redresse their corruptions, &amp;c.) should not be wholly forgotten. The <hi>iudgements of his righteousnesse endure for euer,</hi> that part of knowledge that particularly answers their desires, or the experience of their want in themselues, this shall be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imprinted in them by God, so as the vertue thereof shall neuer be lost. To conclude seeing the holy Ghost requires all carefull intertainement of the word, we should do that vnto it that we would do for the entertaining of some great man into our houses. 1. make cleane the roome of our hearts: purge our hypocrisie, malice, &amp;c. 2. When the word is come in molest it not, take heed of strange affections, passions and lusts. 3. Receiue it with ioy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse all the signes of ioy.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Dwell</hi>] First, if the word must dwell with vs it should teach vs to practise what we are here exhorted, get the word into our houses, let it so dwell with vs that nothing sound more in a Christian house then the word: that is to liue comfortably. This is to liue in the <hi>shadow of the almighty,</hi>

What can better preserue <hi>Iacob</hi> from confusion, or his face from being pale, then if he might see his children the worke of Gods hand, framed and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the word in regeneration, and the duties of new obedience, this would make religious parents to sanctifie Gods name, euen to sanctifie the holy one, and with singular incouragement from the God of Israell, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.22.23.</p>

First, in not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it, this hath very ill effects such as these, not admonishing breedes <hi>dwelling suspitions,</hi> suspitions breed a very habit of <hi>misinterpretation:</hi> misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation begets a loathnes to come vnto the light to shew the reasons of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, this loathnesse begets a very separation in heart: seperation begets a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Loue</hi> to the meanes; decay of respect to the meanes, begets a <hi>decay of zeale and gifts,</hi> and from hence there is a high way to internall or externall <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacie,</hi> or some great iudgements of God.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, in not performing it aright, as when men make their <hi>wrath to

                        <p>Thirdly, in not receiuing admonition: and thus men faile diuersly, when men shift, excuse, denie, extenuate, &amp;c. and yet in heart bee conuinced, or when men fall into passion, or grudging, or traducing afterwards; or when men would faine make the admonisher to <hi>sinne in the word, and lay snares for him that rebukes</hi>

                        <p>The speciall exhortation concernes one part of the word, and that is the <hi>Psalmes.</hi> Which are heere to be considered.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1 In respect of matter, <hi>Psalmes, Hymnes, and Spirituall songs.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2 In respect of the manner, <hi>singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</hi>
                           </item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The matter is heere three waies to be considered:<note place="margin">What meant by Psalmes, Hymnes, and Spirituall songs.</note> First, in the ground, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, or authoritie of the Psalmes we vse, <hi>viz.</hi> they must bee the word of Christ, that is contained in the Scriptures. Secondly in the kindes of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> there are many sort of Psalmes in Scripture. The Psalmes of <hi>Moses, Dauid, Salomon,</hi> and other Prophets: but all are heere referred to three heades; they are either <hi>Psalmes,</hi> specially so called, or <hi>Hymnes,</hi> or <hi>Songs,</hi> great adoe there is among Interpreters, to find a difference in these; some would haue Psalmes to be the songs of men, and Hymnes of Angels: some thinke they differ, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, in the manner of Musicke. Some are sung by voice, some plaid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on instruments; but the plausiblest opinion is not to distinguish them, by the persons that vse them, or by the kinde of musicke, but by the matter, and so they say Psalmes containe exhortation to manners or holy life. Hymnes containe praises to God in the commemoration of his benefits. Songs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine doctrine of the chiefe good, or mans eternall felicitie. But I thinke there needs not any curious distinction: it may suffice vs that there is varietie of Psalmes in Scripture and God allowes vs the vse of euery kinde. Thirdly, the property of the Psalmes, they are <hi>Spirituall,</hi> both because they are indited by the spirit, and because they make vs more spirituall in the due vse of them.</p>
                        <p>From hence then we may learne these things.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1 That singing of Psalmes is Gods ordinance, binding all sorts of men: <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Psalm.</hi> 66.1.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 92.1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 135.3. a part of our goodnesse, and a most comely thing.</item>
                           <item>2 That a Christian should chiefely recreate himselfe in singing of Psalmes, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.13. God doth not allow vs other recreations to shoulder out this, as the most doe.</item>
                           <item>3 That we should sing Psalmes in our houses aswell as our Churches both for daily exercise, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 101.1.2. and when Christians meet together: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.19.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The manner followes;<note place="margin">Rules in sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Psalms.</note> there are foure things required of vs in singing of Psalmes: First, we should <hi>teach and admonish</hi> in the vse of them, and that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:21380:210"/>
our selues, by considering the matter, or others, as the Ministers in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of Psalmes for the Congregation, or the Master of the Family, or when Christians meet, there should be choise of such Psalmes, as may instruct or comfort, or rebuke according to the occasion: there is edifying euen in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of Psalmes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. Secondly, we must <hi>sing with grace,</hi> this is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersely interpreted; some vnderstand it of the dexterity that should be vsed in singing, to affect our selues or others: some take it to be that inward come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, right order, reuerence, or delight of the heart in singing: some would haue it signifie thankesgiuing. But I thinke, to sing with grace is to exercise the graces of the heart in singing: wee must sing with holy ioie <note n="s" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 9.2.</note>, with trust in Gods mercies <note n="t" place="margin">

                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 47.6</note>, yea with the praier and desires of our hearts, that our wordes in singing may bee acceptable<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psalm</hi> 104.33 34</note>. Thirdly, we must <hi>sing with our hearts:</hi> not with our tongues on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie outwardly for ostentation; to <hi>sing with our hearts</hi> is to sing with vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note n="x" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 47.7 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.14</note>, with sense and feeling. Hence we are said to prepare our hearts before we sing <note n="y" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 57.7</note>, and it is to bee obserued that <hi>Dauid</hi> bids his <hi>tongue awake</hi> 
                           <note n="z" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psal.</hi> 57.8</note>, noting that he obserued in men a lethargie, not a hoarsnesse of voice, but a slumber in heart when they vsed the voice. Fourthly we must sing to the Lord <note n="a" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.19</note>, that is both to Gods glorie, and in sense of Gods presence, and vpon a holy remembrance of Gods blessings. This is to sing to his name.</p>
                        <p>The vse is first for instruction when we are merry, to sing <hi>Psalmes</hi> 
                           <note n="b" place="margin">
                              <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.13</note>, yea to account this as heauenly melody <note n="c" place="margin">
                              <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.19</note>; a precious perfume for our Chambers, a holy homage to God, the <hi>calues of our lipes</hi>; yea we should resolue against all the prophane contempt of the world, to praise God thus while we liue <note n="d" place="margin">
                              <hi>Palm.</hi> 156.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 104.33</note>, and to this ende wee should striue against the obiections and backwardnesse of our owne natures: for the flesh will obiect against singing of Psalmes, aswell as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst praying reading, &amp;c. Secondly, for reproofe of such as set their delight in fleshly lusts and sports, in dancing, gaming, etc. in singing of carolles, bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads, filthy rimes, &amp;c. all which delights are so farre from being spirituall, that they make our hearts farre more fleshly and carnall, yea it reproues the best of vs, for want of the right manner in the vse of singing, in all the foure things beefore, which wee should bee humbled for, as for any other our sinnes.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the 16. Verse.</p>

                        <p>This Verse containes the 2. generall rule to be obserued in our conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it is an exhortation to the minding of the right end in all our actions, in the former verse he tooke order for the meanes of holy life, heere hee takes order for the end of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>d:</hi> In generall: vnto the goodnesse of the action, a good end is essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required,<note place="margin">Vnto good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the action, the goodnesse of the end is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</note> for though a good intention make not the action good, yet without a good intention, the action cannot bee accepted as good in Gods sight. It is a good thing to heare and follow Christ, but not good in the Capernaits that follow for the loaues; Or in the Pharisees, that heare to carpe, or carrie tales, and informe against him. It is a good action to vse our knowledge, but ceaseth to be good in vs, when it puffeth vp, and is done for vaine ostentation. It is good to receiue the Sacraments, but yet Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision was not good, either as the sonnes of <hi>Iacob</hi> required it, nor as the King and his Sonnes receiued it. Workes of holy and religious seruices are good,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:21380:210"/>
but when men come to Church on the Sabbaths, to make amends for their sinnes on the weeke daies, it ceaseth to be good to them. It is good to honour Gods Ministers, but where men honor them either to keepe their own credit with the people, as <hi>Saul</hi> honoured <hi>Samuel,</hi> or that they may excuse them, as in the Parable <note n="e" place="margin">
                              <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.19</note>, such honour is not good. Works of mercie are good, but being done for praise of men, or to merit by them, they come vnder a negatiue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>giue not your Almes.</hi> It is good to forbeare on another, but not good in such men as forbeare onely for want of power or oportunity to reuenge,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.</note> and therefore we should informe our selues better, and as we would haue God to accept or blesse vs, to get Gods ende to our actions.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the generall.</p>
                        <p>In this verse, the end of well-doing is two waies considered: First, as it is the <hi>end of intention,</hi> that is, that we should propound and aime at, as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and marke of our indeauours, and that is ordered and required in these wordes, <hi>Whatsoeuer yee doe in word or deed, doe all in the name of the Lord Iesus.</hi> Secondly, as it is the end of consummation, 1. that by which wee finish our workes, and that is required in these words, <hi>giuing thankes to God, euen the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by him:</hi> In short, the ende of intention is the glory of God in Christ, the ende of consummation, is the giuing of thankes when wee haue done our indeauours.</p>
                        <p>In the first part I consider:
<list>
                              <item>1 What should bee the maine end of our actions: <hi>Doe all in the name of Christ.</hi>

                              <item>2 How we are tyed to it: First, for persons: <hi>Yee.</hi> Secondly, for kinds of imploiment, <hi>in word and deed.</hi> Thirdly, for extent, <hi>whatsoeuer yee doe: Doe all.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>

                        </p>
                        <p>First, that all be done in the assurance of the loue of Christ, that we be sure that we know Christ, as we know a man by his name; that when wee goe to to doe Gods worke, we bee first sure of Christs reward: this is to bee shodde with the preparation of the Gospell of peace.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that all be done in the name: that is, by the authority of Christ, and his warrant in his word: not in the name of <hi>Moses</hi> for Ceremonie, or in the name of Angels, or Saints, for intercession, nay, in all wee doe, our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science should be tied onely properly by the command of Christ, not because such great men would haue it so, or I did it to please my parents or kindred, &amp;c for then thou dost it in the name of men and not of Christ.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that all be done with inuocation or calling vpon God in the name of Christ, all should be consecrate and begunne with praier.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, and principally, that all bee done to the glorie of God in Christ, this should be the scope of all our actions <note n="a" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31.</note> all should breath and sauour of Christ.</p>

                              <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.6.</note> that boulster men vp in presumption against repentance and faith in Christ, of passionate and bitter words, <note n="d" place="margin">

Because God hath bestowed vpon them more blessings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he giues more wages, requires more worke. 3. Because they are more obserued then any other.

Because their hearts are made pure by the bloud of Christ: and fine white linnen is sooner and deeper stained then course ragges. 5. They are trusted with more glorious riches.

                           <hi>To God euen the Father</hi>:] These words are to be vnderstood, not diuidedly, but conioynedly, and so declare who is our God, euen hee that hath proued himselfe a Father in Christ, louing vs in him, and accepting of vs, and heaping many blessings vpon vs, two sweet words. He is a God, there is his maiesty: he is a Father, there is his loue, and therefore great incouragement to go to him with all suites and praises. With all suites, he is God, and therfore able to help; and Father, and therefore willing to helpe. With all praises, hee is God, and therefore meet to be worshipped, he is a Father, and therefore will accept the calues of our lippes, not according to what we bring, but according to what we desire to bring, and all this should make vs both to hate it, to praise men or Angells, or sacrifice to our nettes, and also to honour him with the affection of children, and with the feare of creatures.</p>

To singing of Psalmes in the former verse, and so they note that all ioy is vaine without Christ, yea these spirituall and better sorts of delight are vaine vnlesse Christ be ours.

                        <p>
                           <hi>d</hi>: It is plaine that men are to be taught how to gouerne themselues in their houses, aswell as in the duties of their generall calling: this is meete to be noted, because some mens either ignorance, or wilfulnesse and prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is such, that they thinke Ministers should not meddle to tell them how to liue at home, or how to carrie themselues in their shops.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>d:</hi> 2. From coherence, that we may liue comfortably, and blessedly in our Families, and particular callings, wee must labour in the daily and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant vse of the meanes to be sincere in the generall. The study of the word to frame men, to be good men and women in Gods sight, would make men good husbands, seruants, children, wiues, &amp;c. First, get to bee a good man and then thou wilt the easier proue a good husband, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vse.</hi> First, for reproofe of such as cannot abide to see their children, or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to heare Sermons, studie the Scriptures, labour for grace, &amp;c. whereas nothing would more fit them to all pleasing in their carriage at home. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for triall, if religion and the profession of it, make thee not a better wife, husband, or seruant. Suspect thy selfe that all is not right, but that thou art an hypocrite, repent and amend. Thirdly, for instruction, if men finde such stubburnesse in their wiues, or children, or seruants, the best way is to giue them more libertie to the meanes, and to driue them into Gods house to heare the word, to call vpon them to reade the Scriptures, and to vse such like holy exercises, for if this will not mende them nothing in the world will. 3 Before I consider of the particular members of a Familie,<note place="margin">Of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of a Familie.</note> I must entreat ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of the whole: and concerning the gouernment of a Family by the rules of Gods word: I consider 4. things.</p>

Secondly, a holy liuing together. Thirdly, a speciall fitnesse in the head of the Familie. For the first, it is greatly materiall to the perpetuall well being of a Familie, that all heedefulnesse bee obserued in the first erecting of it: for as many order the matter, they so prouoke God by the first entring vpon the Familie, that the Familie trauels euer after vnder the burden of Gods anger, or great inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and cannot prosper, and thus men fault.</p>

                        <p>First, more wiues then one are brought in. Secondly, there is not sufficient distance in bloud, but the marriage is incestuous. Thirdly, another mans wife is brought in, either the betrothed wife, or the vniustly diuorced wife of another man. Fourthly, there is not consent of parties, but the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is forced. Fifthly, there is not consent of parents. Sixthly, an infamous or scandalous person is chosen to be a yoake-fellow. Seuenthly, there is not equality, either for religion (but a beleeuer is matched with an vnbeleeuer) or age, or estate, or disposition.</p>
                        <p>And a like dangerous disorder there is in taking into the Familie of disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered seruants, such as are swearers, filthy and scandalous persons, against which sinnes there lyeth knowne threatnings of God: and so with their sins they bring in Gods curse.</p>

                           <note place="margin">What things may be taught in the familie.</note>
                           <hi>Answ:</hi> First, the common grounds of Gods seruice and worship, this is to teach them to feare God. Secondly, the meaning of the Sacraments <note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.25.26. <hi>&amp;</hi>

                              </gap>3.14.</note>. Thirdly, the Law <note n="o" place="margin">
                              <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6.</note>, that is the common grounds of honesty, and vice, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to loue such and such vertues, and hate such and such vices. Fourthly, the vse and consideration of Gods great iudgements: therefore God will tell <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> of the destruction of <hi>Sodome,</hi> because he will make vse of it in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie. Fifthly, the report of Gods great workes of old <note n="p" place="margin">
                              <hi>Psa.</hi> 78.23.</note>. Sixthly, to hope in God, acquainting them with their naturall miseries, and training them vp, by warning them to take heed of the common presumptions of the wicked, and by distilling into them the grounds of practise and promise, concerning Gods
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:21380:213"/>
mercie to their soules; and their last saluation. Seuenthly, we should acquaint our housholds with the generall course of the Scriptures: thus <hi>Timothy</hi> knew the Scriptures of a childe <note n="q" place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.</note>: for an exact knowledge of all Scriptures was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for a child to attaine. Lastly, the things receiued by publike doctrine should be inforced and kept a foot in the family, if any passe these bonds they intrude vpon the Ministers office, and ought to feare <hi>Vzzahs</hi> curse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as men should instruct, and so auoid the common prophanenesse of the world in neglecting Gods ordinance, so they should bee wise to sobriety, and keepe themselues in all feare and humilitie within their owne line and measure.</p>
                        <p>Thus of Pietie.</p>
                        <p>The second thing required is a holy order of imploiment in all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the family, in their mutuall labours for the good of the outward estate of it <note n="r" place="margin">
                              <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.20.</note>, vnto the orderly performance of the Labours of a Family, the fiue things are required.<note n="5" place="margin">Things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the labours of a Family.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>First, diligence. Secondly, peace, else all sacrifice is in vaine, <hi>Prou.</hi> 17.1. Thirdly, prouidence, it is not the hand of the diligent, but his thoughts that bring abundance: care is required, not the care for successe (for that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.) but the care for the duty, <hi>Prou.</hi> 21.5. Fourthly, retyred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. They must keepe at home. Seruants must not be stealing out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie without leaue: nor Masters leaue their standings. Keepe thy foot from thy neighbours house, <hi>Prou.</hi> 25.17. If a man cannot be found in the place of his labour, he is <hi>like a bird that wandreth from his nest. Prou.</hi> 27.19. Fifthly, frugalitie, in liuing within their compasse, and not spending aboue their meanes, they must make their <hi>Lambes serue for cloathing, and the Goates for rent or hire of the field, and the milke of the goates must bee sufficient for them, and families, and for the sustenance of the maides, Prou.</hi> 27. <hi>vlt.</hi> It is not a good rule to make reason iudge of their needes, or to propound vnto themselues, I will spend no more but what I neede, but they must looke to their meanes to spend according to that, for ordinarilie their is not so little comming in, but God can make it suffice, or will himselfe send them supplie.</p>
                        <p>The third thing required is domesticall discipline: Thus <hi>Iacob</hi> searcheth his house, purgeth it of all Idols, and superstitious monuments, admonisheth his people of the feare of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.2.3. Thus <hi>Iob</hi> sacrificeth for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Iob</hi> 1.5. Thus <hi>Dauid</hi> will ridde his house of slanderers, liars, apostates, &amp;c. And so should we see to the reformation of abuses, by admonition, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes, correction, or complaints to the Magistrate, or Elders of the Church, the Father in his house is the keeper of both Tables.</p>
                        <p>The fourth thing is the right order of hospitality, and respect of strangers, and it stands in two things: First, in seeking by all meanes to bring Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters or seruants into one house <note n="s" place="margin">
                              <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 18.</note>, that they might helpe vs, and as as it were, blesse and perfume our houses, by their praiers, counsell, comforts, admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.11. Secondly, in prouiding that no strangers be admitted, or permitted that will hinder Gods worship, or any way the good of the family, they must not be within our gates, that will not ioine with vs to sanctifie the Sabbath in our dwellings, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. Yea, if they bee disordered persons wee should vse them as the false Prophet; That they may say, thus was I woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the house of my friend, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Vse is</hi>: First, against the Papists and that principally two waies: First, in that they forbid marriage, and so hinder the erecting of families to God. Secondly, in that they forbid knowledge to Lay people, and so hinder the good gouernement of the Familie.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, against, great abuses euen amongst vs. There is that open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse in the most houses, that if they searched with lights, there would
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:21380:214"/>
no praier, reading of Scripture, holy conference, singing of Psalmes, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction be found there, but without light men may finde their houses, full of swearing, deceit, lying, false measures, and waights, and all kind of filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to the singular detriment of the familie: for hence it is that many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, doe in vaine rise earely, and goe to bed late, and eate the bread of painefulnesse and sorrow, for God for these sinnes will not build the house. Sometimes this is plagued by open iudgements, somtimes Gods curse secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly like a moath cats downe the prosperity of the house. But alwaies all such families are very hatefull to God, euen like the dens or cages of wilde beasts. Secondly, It may humble the best of vs, if we search into our neglects, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and omissions, of the many duties we should performe in our houses.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, for instruction to teach vs by praier to seeke a way of God for vs, and our houses, and to beseech God to build vs an house, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.7.11.25. 27.29. and by all meanes to labour to liue godly at home in the practise of pietie, this is to bring saluation to our houses. Thus our families would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as little Churches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. Yea, wonderfull hath beene the successe of this holy order in some families. Thus the house of <hi>Dauid</hi> hath become as the house of God, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.8. Yea, if we were thus carefull, God would hedge vs and our families round about, and all that we haue, that Satan could not touch vs, hee cannot breake Gods fence, without Gods leaue, <hi>Iob</hi> 1.10. Our Tabernacles would then flourish and stand long: <hi>Prou.</hi> 12.7. and 14.11.</p>
                        <div type="part">
                           <head>Thus in generall of houshold gouernment or the order generally belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the good estate of all the members.</head>
                           <p>Now, I come to consider each member in the Family, and the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides them into three couples: The wife and the husband, the childe and parents, the seruant and master.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Doctr:</hi> There are two reasons why the husbands and wiues are charged in the first place, <hi>viz.</hi> First, because that in this order they were thus institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, he first made man and wife, and in the order of nature these first found the Familie, and so the Apostle keepes the order of nature, and the first institution. Secondly, because the good behauiour of the inferiours in the Families, lieth much in the good example of the husband and wife: if they be filthy, wastefull, or blasphemers, vsually their children and seruants are so, and many times it holdes in the contrarie, for their good example, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maks the family in imitation grow like them, or at least it restraines much euill.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Qu:</hi> But why is the wife first appointed to her dutie, before the husband.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Answ:</hi> Because in the order of the Family she must first mend before the husband (howsoeuer before Gods iudgement seat they shall be tried equally) in domesticall behauiour, if shee would haue her husband reformed of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, or ill dealing, she must first mend her selfe</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thus of the generall consideration.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Wiues be subiect to your husbands as is comely in the Lord.</hi>]</p>
                           <p>In these words the Wiues dutie, is first laid downe, <hi>Wiues submit to your hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</hi> Secondly, It is is enlarged or confirmed: First, by a reason: <hi>It is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Secondly, by a limitation <hi>in the Lord.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In laying down the duty I consider: First, who are charged, <hi>Wiues.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with what, <hi>be subiect.</hi> Thirdly, to whom, <hi>to your Husbands.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Wiues] Doctrine.</hi> All wiues generally and indefinitly are tied to a holy order of subiection to their husbands without distinction of yeares, the elder women and the yonger, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.8. and without distinction of estate, poore mens wiues must be subiect aswell as Citizens wiues, or Gentiles, a great fault in the baser sort: Their houses in respect of rudenesse, are as void of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:21380:214"/>
as they are of riches. Great mens wiues also must be subiect, <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter and <hi>Vashti</hi> the Empresse; yea though there be inequality of meanes as if the wife were a Lady, and the Husband but a meaner man, yet shee must be subiect, and he not waite vpon her.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Vse</hi> 1. For comfort of wiues, nothing is required of one, but what is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all. 2. Of Husbands, in respect no meanes of estate, or alteration in their condition can loose them their honour in the subiection of their wiues. And thirdly, euery woman should learne to doe her dutie, seeing all are bound to it.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Be subiect:</hi>] Heere I consider. 1. What is required viz. <hi>be subiect.</hi> 2. In what manner it is required, that is in the indefinite propounding of it without exception of time or place, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>In the first I consider: first, that it is: secondly, I answer a question: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what it is.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That subiection in women is required without dispensation by God as his ordinance is plaine by these Scriptures, <hi>Genes.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Titus.</hi> 3.5. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 The Question is why the Apostle onely propounds heere the wiues sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection,<note place="margin">Why subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is onely named in the wiues duty.</note> without mentioning any other duty?</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ans.</hi> I might say it is the wisedome of God to scatter directions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, that wee may not finde them all in one place, to stirre vs vp to the more diligence in study of the Scriptures, and with great good successe many times, for while they are seeking to learn to be good wiues, they meet also with those directions that make them good women too. God many times when we seek one blessing causeth vs to find many.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. I may say that it is the wisedome of God to Epitomize and draw things into a short summe, that we may be more familiarly acquainted with his will, Thus when he would propound his eternall rules of all righteousnesse in the Law, hee chooseth to giue them in ten words, that men might grow to bee as familiarly acquainted with them, as with any ordinary matter, that they might alwaies haue them before their eyes, and bind them to the fringe of their garments: so God giues women their duties in one word, that it might be engrauen in their hearts, and sowed downe before their eies in capitall letters vpon their cushions, <hi>be subiect</hi> should neuer be out of their minds.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Because of the necessity of it, if God may not haue this duty, he will not accept of the rest, though they be faire, rich, wise, prouident, diligent &amp;c. yet if they be not subiect, they are not regarded of God.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. Because women most faile in this, the speciall duety of the husband is loue, and of the wife subiection, the man most failes in loue, and the woman in subiection.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 I consider what this subiection is, and heere: first, what it is: secondly, what it is not: thirdly, the meanes that women are to vse that they may bee subiect.</p>
                           <p>For the first in the right discharge of their subiection, wiues are tied to fiue things:<note n="5" place="margin">Things in the wiues subiection.</note> first, honour: secondly, faithfulnesse: thirdly, feare: fourthly, labor: fifthly, submission.</p>
                           <p>To be subiect, is first to honour them; to be faithfull, to feare them, to bee diligent in labour for them and the family, and to submit to them.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 They must honour their husbands as their superiour,<note place="margin">Wiues must honour their husbands sixe waies.</note> and heads, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. and this they must do; first, by giuing reuerent titles to them, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 By striuing to resemble the very properties and praise worthy qualities of the husband, she should be his image, or his glory. And thus also in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence shee should resemble his authority ouer the family, women should choose such husbands, as they would not onely liue with and loue, but such as
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:21380:215"/>
they would liue by, euen such as they would set before them as patternes of their natures and liues.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 By liuing without suspition, making the best interpretation of their doubtfull actions. <hi>Micholl</hi> is made a president of contempt and suspition, when she so sinfully taunts and misinterprets <hi>Dauids</hi> dancing before the arke, in presence of the maides of Israell.</p>
                           <p n="4">4 By leauing to him the secrets of his publike imployment, and keeping her to her owne measure in caring for domesticall matters, shee may not be of an inquisitiue humor, to lay a necessitie vpon the husband to reueale to her all occurrents, especially when the husband is either Magistrate or minister.</p>

In the secrets of the familie, not disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them to strangers, but so taking notice of them, as not to discouer them without the consent of the husband, as the faults of Sion must not bee told at Gath. 5.

                           <p>The fifth thing is, Submission, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.22. and she must submit her selfe;</p>
                           <p n="1">1 To her husbands directions, &amp; liue by the Laws prescribed her by her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. as the Church doth teach and liue by the word of Christ, else no true Church. Thus the woman asketh leaue to goe to the Prophet, 2. Kin. 4.22. And the wife is charged not to feast without consent, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4. And thus also she must receiue directions for the affaires of the familie.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 To his restraints, so as she be contented to be restrained of her ease, will, desires, delights, &amp;c. <hi>Thy desires shall be subiect to thy husband.

Thus must the wife cast about how <hi>to please her husband,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.34.</p>
                           <p>Thus of what it is.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 I consider what it is not,<note place="margin">What wiues are not bound to.</note> or what the wife is not bound to, though shee must be subiect. In generall their subiection doth not lead them into bondage and make them slaues and vassalls to them, they remaine still their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and yoake-fellowes.</p>
                           <p>In particular there are some things spirituall, some things domesticall, some things in her ciuill carriage, from which shee is not restrained by her subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                           <p>In matters of religion she cannot bee forced to neglect the meanes to saue her soule, the vnbeleeuing husband cannot compell the wife to forsake her faith and religion, and the meanes thereof, to please him. Againe, though her sexe barre her from instruction in the Church, and her husbands authority barre her from sole instruction in the family, yet notwithstanding vnder her husband she may instruct her children, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.20. and familie, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.26. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides though her husband were neuer so great, wise, Lordly, &amp;c. yet she may admonish him, and he ought to be crossed of his owne course and will by her, as <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Sarah:</hi> at Gods appointment, who charged <hi>him to heare her in what she said, to doe it. Gen.</hi> 21.12.</p>
                           <p>In domesticall matters, she is not subiected to his tyranny and blowes, nor is she bound to beare with or consent to, or conceale his whoredomes, shee is not bound to imitate his example, or obey his will, to doe that that is ill. And lastly her subiection doth not bind her to deliuer her body when shee is apart for her disease, <hi>Leuit.</hi> 18.19. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 8.6.</p>
                           <p>In ciuill matters I instance in one; She is not vtterly barred out from works of mercy, for though she may not take of his substance to spend it, no not in workes of piety and mercy, yet of her owne labours shee may take to giue to the poore, or for pious vses, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.20.</p>
                           <p>Thus of what not.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 That women may performe this subiection. 1. They must keep home. 2. They must seeke this ability of God, for hee giues the graces of the wife; Nature makes her a woman, election a wife, but to be prudent and subiect is of the Lord, <hi>Prou.</hi> 19.14. and there shee must seeke it of God. 3. They must preserue and keepe warme in their hearts the loue of their husbands, for all disobedience ariseth of want of loue. Lastly, they must consider the reasons
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21380:216"/>
and incouragements to subiection.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 He is thy head and therefore be subiect, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. 2. If the shame of men will not mooue thee to bee subiect, yet haue power on thine head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Angells, 1. Corinth. 11.10. but especially consider the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements.</p>
                           <p>It should waigh much with them that God hath imposed such a free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous subiection. It is not boundlesse, when they may be still companions. 2. That God that requires them to be subiect, chargeth husbands to vse them well, and kindly to accept their obedience. 3. God hath valued the price of a good wife, and set the rate to be aboue pearles, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31, 10. Finally their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the Lord shall not bee lost, for they are much <hi>set by of God.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. he will blesse them with the fruit of their wombe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 113.9. and 127.3 yea the saluation of their soules may be furthered by the right performance of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily duties.</p>
                           <p>Thus of the things required, viz: <hi>be subiect.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The manner how it is required followes) <hi>Bee subiect</hi> indefinitely, and so sheweth that they must be subiect. 1. Not outwardly; but in spirit. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.15. 2. Not abroad onely, but at home. 3. Not sometimes but constantly alwaies. 4. Not in some things, but in euery thing. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.24. 5. Not for feare or shame, but for conscience sake, and voluntarily. Heere I may take in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction; subiection is two-fold. 1. by Gods institution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so wiues are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, in that they are commaunded to bee so, and God hath taken prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from them. 2. By will, or the conscience cheerefully yeelding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods will, and thus onely good wiues are subiect.</p>
                           <p>Thus of the duty charged vpon them.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 The persons to whom it is due followes.</p>

                              <hi>To your husbands</hi>:] These words may be considered exclusiuely and inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siuely, they exclude all others, she is not to be subiect to her seruants or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or the strange woman brought in by the husband, and so also they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all husbands, they must be subiect to their husbands, not the wise only but the foolish, not the curteous onely, but the froward, not the rich onely, but the poore also.</p>
                           <p>Thus of the laying downe of the duty.</p>
                           <p>It is amplified, first by a reason, <hi>it is comely</hi>: secondly by a limitation, <hi>in the Lord.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>

                           <p n="3">

                           <p>The wiues comelinesse is not in beautie, <hi>Prou.</hi> 11.22. and 31.30. nor in the gorgeousnesse of apparell, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. But a wiues comelinesse is especially.</p>
                           <p n="1">1 In her wisedome, <hi>Prou.</hi> 14.1. and that to be shewed in two things: first, in her skill to please her husband, neither offending him with chiding words, nor sullennesse, puling or crying, which is found to vexe some men more then words. Secondlie, in her skill to manage the businesses of the house, both sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonablie, discreetlie, and with prouidence.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 In her meekenes it is exceeding comelie, where <hi>the hid man of the heart is incorrupt with a meek and quiet spirit,</hi> this is better then al apparel. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3.4.</p>

                              <pb n="115" facs="tcp:21380:216"/>Thirdly, Heere it is in her subiection; for as it is an vncomely thing to see the body aboue the head, so is it to see a wife that will rule and not be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to her husband.</p>
                           <p>And if the wife labour to adorne her selfe thus, shee shall appeare comely to God: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. to men in the gate, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31.23.31. to her husband and children, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31.28 Yea, shee is an ornament to sincerity and holines it selfe. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.3.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>In the Lord:</hi>] 1. These words are expounded diuersly.</p>
                           <p>First, in the Lord, that is, in the feare of God, as vnto the Lord in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his ordinance, for Gods sake, because God requires this at your hands.</p>
                           <p>In this sense it may serue for two vses: First, for terror to wicked wiues, they must answer it before God, he will auenge their not subiecting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, he will certainly account with them, if they be whorish, contentious, idle, carelesse, or wastefull, &amp;c.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. It is a great comfort vnto a godly woman, her subiection is in the Lord, it is in Gods account, euen as a sacrifice to him, hee takes it as done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, God honours her obedience in the Family, as if it were pietie in the Temple: and this may the more support them, if their husbands bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, in the Lord, that is, so farre as they command in the Lord; they must so loue their husbands as they cease not to loue God, and so be subiect to them, as they leaue not their subiection to God. Their couenant with their husband no way inferres the breach of this couenant with God, and thus it is principally heere meant.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Thus of the Wiues dutie.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Husbands dutie followes in the 19. verse.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Husbands loue your Wiues and be not bitter vnto them.</hi>]</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Doctr:</hi> In generall; Husbands must be told their duties aswell as Wiues, as they would haue them mend, so they must mend themselues, and as they would haue comfort by liuing with them, so they must make conscience to practise their duty to them: it is not the hauing of wiues or husbands, that breedes contentment, but the holy performance of duties mutually.</p>
                           <p>The duty of the Husband is propounded heere: First, by exhortation, <hi>Husbands loue your Wiues.</hi> Secondly, by dehortation, <hi>Be not bitter vnto them.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the exhortation, there is the persons exhorted (<hi>Husbands</hi>) the duty (<hi>loue</hi>) the persons to whom they owe it (<hi>your Wiues.</hi>)</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Husbands</hi>] This indefinite propounding of it shewes, that all sorts of Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands are bound to shew this dutie, poore and rich, learned and vnlearned, yongue and old.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Loue</hi>] Concerning the husbands dutie as it is heere expressed; I consider sixe things. First, that it is indispensably required. Secondly, why this dutie onely is named. Thirdly, how he must shew his loue. Fourthly, Reasons why. Fifthly, I answer certaine obiections. Sixthly, the lets of performance of loue.</p>
                           <p>First, it is required: <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.2.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the Apostle names this dutie in this one word, either because the Lord of purpose, would haue them study the whole Scriptures, that while they seeke for directions to make them good husbands, they may finde also counsell to make them good men.</p>
                           <p>Or else in this word is comprehended their dutie, that so this being their word, they might write it in their hearts, and haue it euer in their eies to doe it; or else it is because this is most necessarie, and as women faile in subiection, so doe men in loue.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="116" facs="tcp:21380:217"/>For the third, <hi>viz.</hi> how he must shew his loue, we must vnderstand, that the husband owes the wife: First, naturall or ciuill loue as a married man. Se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>condly, spirituall loue, as a Christian married man.</p>

                           <p>First, by suffering himselfe to be admonished by her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.12.</p>

                           <p>Fourthly, by not disgracing her before others, but choosing a fit time in secret to finde fault with her.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, by not speaking when shee is in passion, but forcing both her and himselfe in all matters of difference to speake when they are both out of passion.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, by yeelding a free and iust testimony of her praises, <hi>Prou.</hi> 31.28.</p>

                           <p>First, by prouiding her maintenance according to his abilitie, and that in labouring so in his calling, as he may prouide for her while he liues, and leaue her some meanes when he dies.</p>
                           <p>And for manner, doing it cheerefully, not stay till it be wrung from him, as from churlish <hi>Naball.</hi> Thus doe not they that spend at Alehouse, vpon Whores, or sports, Beare baites, plaies, gaming or apparell, that should serue for maintenance of wiues and children at home.</p>

                           <p>Thirdly, by delighting in her loue; yea, not erring or wandring in his loue continually, <hi>Prou.</hi> 5.19.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, he owes her spirituall loue aswell as naturall, so Christ loued his Church, not onely to inrich it but to sanctifie it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.25.26.

For the Church sinneth after calling, and yet Christ loues her, and shewes it by his intercession for her in heauen, and by labouring to clense her by his spirit and word in earth.</p>
                           <p>

                              <hi>Answ:</hi> In respect of the affection and practise of the things essentially necessary to coniugall duties, he is, but not in opinion of his praises, for that is the commendation of the good wife, not of euery wife. <hi>Prou.</hi> 31.30.</p>

                           <p>Sixthly, the lets follow: How comes it to passe that men do not performe this duty. <hi>Answ.</hi> It is in some by reason of their sinfull comming together, as in sudden marriages,<note place="margin">The causes why men loue not their wiues.</note> when they are done before there be a calling or affection in the heart. So when men haue ill ends, as those men that marry their wiues not for grace or fauour, but for wealth, when they are possessed of both, they will loue their wealth, and hate their wiues.</p>
                           <p n="2">2 Corruption of nature is the cause of want of loue, they are wicked men, therefore wicked husbands.</p>
                           <p n="3">3 It comes to passe, because men doe not by praier seeke loue of God, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of praier and mortification is the cause.</p>

                           <p n="5">5 It comes to passe by the vntowardnesse of the wife, for though that bee no iust reason to the husband (because he should loue her, because God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him) yet it is a iust iudgement of God vpon her.</p>

                        </list>
                        <p>First, it is in the Lord, that is, their obedience is both commanded by God, and it is for God, and besides it is no further vrged then as may stand with faith and pietie to the Lord.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, this is right, it is children iustice.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, this commandement that requires this, is the first commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with promise, for this had a promise in the verie first promulgation of it in the Tables, written by the finger of God, whereas all the rest had their promises annexed afterwards by the ministrie of <hi>Moses.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obiect</hi>: But the second Commandement had promise in the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of the Law.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ:</hi> Some answer the words of the second Commandement are a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, not a promise, but this answer satisfieth not. Some say the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises mentioned in that commandement, belong to the whole Law, and not to that Commandement alone; but I thinke the plainest answere is: the fift Commandement is the first Commandement with promise, <hi>viz</hi>: in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table. A fourth reason is, children must obey, for so it shall goe well with them; they shall get good and contentment, and Gods grace and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by so doing. Fifthly, they shall liue long on earth to enioy the blessing of God.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obiect:</hi> Wicked children liue long.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ:</hi> Their life is a death, and it is not well with them: <hi>Esay</hi> 65.20.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Obiect:</hi> Gods children doe not liue long.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answ:</hi> For the most part they doe. 2 I say, if God performe not this promise absolutely in the letter, yet he performes this blessing by commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a better, as when he giues them eternall life for long life.</p>
                        <p>But the reason why children should obey is heere mentioned in the Text.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It is well pleasing to the Lord:</hi>] Some leaue out (<hi>to the Lord</hi>) and so the argument is more generall, for obedience is exceeding pleasing to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <hi>Prou.</hi> 10.1. and 15.20. and 19.13. and 13.16. and besides it is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God, but I see no reason to leaue out the words.</p>
                        <p>Some render (<gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>) <hi>in the Lord,</hi> and so heere is; First, a limitation, they must obey, but in the Lord. Secondly, they must obey, not because nature
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:21380:220"/>
and ciuilitie requires it, but for conscience sake, as Gods institution.</p>
                        <p>But I take it as it is heere rendered, <hi>to the Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Well-pleasing to the Lord</hi>] From the consideration of these words, I obserue foure things.</p>
                        <p>First, that it is not enough to serue God, but we must so serue as wee please him. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28.</p>
                        <p>Secondly that there is a way how to please God euen in Family duties, and these externall and ordinarie things at home, and this serues; First, to shew Gods great loue to man, in that hee frames himselfe to mens condition, and likes what may like them, will be pleased himselfe with what pleaseth them: obedience and seruice to men he accounts a seruice to himselfe. Secondly, it is a great incouragement to diligence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conscience in these Familie duties, in as much as they will not onely please man, but God. Thirdly, it reproues hypocrites, that care to be good no where but in Gods house, but God will haue obedience and not sacrifice, yea, heere he will be serued with obedience to men.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that euen children are bound to make conscience of their waies, and to learne to please God in their youth. First, God requires it, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 148.12. There is Scripture for babes and yong men as well as old men. Secondly, there are worthy examples to excite them recorded in Scripture, as the examples of <hi>Ioseph, Samuel, Dauid, Iosiah, Ieremie, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,</hi> yea, this was a great praise in <hi>Ierobohams</hi> yong and dying sonne, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.3. Thirdly, a conscionable care in children to please God is much prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in Scripture, they are blessed that beare the yoke in their youth, and the workemanship of grace and obedience in the hearts and liues of children, is like the grauing of a Kings Pallace, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 144.12. A happy thing when the yong men see visions, as well as old men dreame dreames, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. Then doth the Church flourish when the Sonne marrieth the mother, <hi>Isai.</hi> 62.5.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vse</hi> 1 This should teach parents to beginne betimes to teach their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the trade of their way, <hi>Prou.</hi> 22.6. and to bring them vp in the instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and admonition of the Lord, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.4.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Parents should learne also to be content that their children serue and please God as well as them; some Parents are so bad that they neither will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct their children themselues, nor abide it, that they should heare Sermons, reade the Scriptures, seeke the company of such as feare God, or Sanctifie Gods Sabbaths.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 This should teach all to repent euen for the sinnes of their youth, <hi>Psa.</hi>
25. For they were then tied to please God aswell as afterwards.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 That God will be pleased and will accept the indeauours and conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable cares and obedience, euen of children, this is a comfort to children that though they cannot please wayward parents, yet they shall please God; and againe, it reproues froward parents; Is God pleased and art thou displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed? Doth God loue and like the desires and endeauours of this childe and doest thou dislike?</p>
                        <p>Thus of childrens duty, the Parents duty followes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Fathers prouoke not your children to anger, least they be discouraged.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Doctrine</hi> From the coherence; Parents must performe their dutie to their children, it is not an easie thing to be a Father and Mother in performance of fatherly and motherly duties.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Prouoke not] D.</hi> Men are in general here to learne, that it is not enough to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine from sin, but they must abstaine from al prouocations to sin; It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to abstaine from whoredome, but men must abstaine from wanton at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, from suspected places, from filthy speaches, from cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bering &amp; wantonnes, not enough to abstaine from murther, but men must abstaine from bitter and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoking
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:21380:220"/>
words. It is not enough to absteine from Idolatry, but men must ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steine from all the monuments and occasions of Idolatrie, and therefore men must absteine from all marriage with Papists, and from making of images of the trinity, &amp;c. If men would auoid periurie, they must take heed of common swearing. So ministers must not onely call for peace and vnity, but they must take heed of prouocations to discord, when all is at peace.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the generall.</p>
                        <p>The words of this verse are a dehortation, and therein is: First, the duty of parents: Secondly, the reason of it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Parents</hi>] All Parents are tied to performe their dueties to their children,<note place="margin">By Fathers he meanes both parents.</note>
none are too good to doe it. Vse for reproofe of such women as thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues too good to nurse their owne children, and of such Fathers as turne the Care of their children wholly to others.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Prouoke to wrath</hi>] Heere I note the manner of setting downe their duty and the matter.</p>
                        <p>The dutie of parents is negatiuely set downe, to teach that parents must not thinke onely of their sinnes against God and abroad to others; but they may be guilty of much sinne in trespassing against their owne children, if pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were otherwise neuer so honest or religious, yet the carelesse discharge of their duty to their children may much prouoke God, and will certainely be found on their score if they repent not.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quest.</hi> But why is the dutie of parents in this place so sparingly set downe but in one branch of it and that negatiuely?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> It is not to allow Parents to be lesse carefull, but it may bee the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle spares them heere, because in respect of other relations they are charged before and after as husbands and maisters. Againe, it may bee the Apostle would haue children to know they haue not that liberty to inquire into their parents faults, or to reckon it as a part of their skill to find them out: parents shall account to God but not to their children. Thus of the manner of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their duty downe, the matter followes.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Prouoke not</hi>] Parents fault two waies, either by too much seuerity, or by too much indulgence, the former is heere restrained. Againe, the prouocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is two-fold, either to sinne or to passion, it is a most cursed thing for pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to prouoke their children to sinne by counselling them to euill waies, or incouraging them to lewd courses. This the Apostle holds too horrible vile, for any professing religion, or the feare of God, and therefore mentions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation to anger.</p>
                        <p>Concerning this prouocation to anger I consider three things. First, how parents prouoke their children. Secondly, what they must doe that they bee not prouoked. Thirdly, what is not forbidden in these words.</p>
                        <p>Parents prouoke their children; first, by word; secondly, by deed.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. By word three waies. First, by burthening them with vniust and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete precepts.<note place="margin">How parents prouoke their children both by words and deeds.</note> Secondly, by pursuing them with contumelious words, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially when they be alwaies chiding and rating of them. Thirdly, by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing of them to others before their face, or behind their backes.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 By deedes fiue waies.</p>
                        <p>First, by carelesse education, for though children find not fault with this at first, yet when they come to be of yeares, and finde their owne vnfitnesse for calling or society, &amp;c then they fret against their parents neglect.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, by discourtesies and vnkind vsage of them when they be growne to be of yeares.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, by vniust dealing about their marriage, when either they restraine them of marriage, when they haue a calling to it, and a liking of meete per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and thus they prouoke them to incontinency, or when they compell
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:21380:221"/>
them to marry when they haue no calling nor liking, and thus they prouoke them to discontent.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, by indiscreet and immoderate passion and seuerity in correcting them.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, by vniust restraints eyther of present necessaries of food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.9.10. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Prou.</hi> 13.22. or in not laying vp for them, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that parents may not prouoke their children. 1. they must be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gin betimes to teach them their duties, for ignorance is waiward. 2. they must sow the seedes of piety and godlinesse in their hearts, as they draw out reason by degrees, so there is a conscience euen in child<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>en as well as reason if it were informed, and conscience would make them not onely religious to God, but dutifull to parents. 3. they must not giue their children too much liberty at the first, for if they doe, then will iust restraint afterwards bee prouocation. 4. they must pray for them to God, many pray for children, and so for their being, that afterwards neuer pray to God to guide their harts, and so for their well being. 5 They must in generall striue to teach or guide them by incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements and allurements, correction is not as diet, but as Phisicke, and thus recreation is not to be denied them. <hi>Zach.</hi> 85. 6. If nothing else will restraine passion in children, they must impose silence vpon them, he that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth silence on a foole mittigateth anger, <hi>Prou. v.</hi> 26.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 This dehortation hindreth not but that parents may:

                        <p>There are many reasons why parents should bee carefull by all meanes to keepe anger out of their Children.<note place="margin">7.

                        <p>But to omit the reasons, heere parents must not prouoke their children lest they be discouraged.</p>

discourage their teachers, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.17. those that are in authoritie must not discourage such as are faithfull and desirous to approue their feare of God, and to discharge their duties. Gouernours in the familie must not discourage ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants or children in their good beginnings &amp; desires after good things,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.14.</note> againe this is a Christian mercy and compassion, to comfort and incourage the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and lastly Gods fainting children should bee admonished to bee of good comfort, and to strengthen their weary knees. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Esay.</hi> 36.3.4.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the discouragement of children, christian parents should bee carefull: for they may be discouraged.</p>

                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is the order of the words.</p>
                        <p>From the generall consideration of all the words I obserue 6. things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That seruants are to be instructed out of the word,<note place="margin">Sixe things generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.</note> which reprooues ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters that restraine seruants from hearing the word in Gods house, and open not the booke of God to them in their owne houses.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 A question may heere be moued, why should the duety of seruants bee thus largely in so many words set downe.</p>
                        <p>Answ. 1 Because vsually men shew lesse compassion to seruants: therfore God takes the more care of them, many men will haue some care of their children, to see them taught in some manner, but their seruants they wholly neglect. Therefore God who is a Father to seruants as well as children, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uides large instruction and comforts for seruants, if they will come to his booke to be taught.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The carefull Apostle saw that in the first conuersion of men from Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisme to Christianity, there was greatest danger of disorder and scandall in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:21380:222"/>
partly out of wearinesse of their bondage and seruile condition, partly because men would lesse spare to tell of their faults, therefore the Apostle as most fearefull of them spends many words in the teaching and incouraging of them.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 We may note here the candor of the Apostle, he doth freely deliuer his mind in the behalfe of seruants with a full vent of words, with great care with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out holding back anything that belongs vnto them. He was not of the mind of most Preachers now adaies, that hold the discourse of family duties, especially of seruants, too base a subiect for their wits and learning to be imployed in, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the Apostle of the humour of Lawyers, that seldome speake much but for great men, or when they may haue great gifts, the Apostle speakes as much for a seruant that could do nothing for him as for the Masters.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 In laying downe his speech to seruants, hee both teacheth and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them, but for order hee first teacheth them, and as any is more ignorant, this course is more needfull to be held, the common people should bee in this manner dealt withall, they must first bee rebuked, conuinced, exhorted, taught, and then meet comforts to be applied, and not before.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, the scope and drift of the Apostle in all these words to keepe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants in order, and that first to hold seruants in obedience, that none vnder colour of liberty in Christ should breake vp their subiection to their Master, he was no Anabaptist. Secondly, to meet with the faulty obedience of such seruants as were resolued to stay in seruice. Hee meeteth heere with fiue faults in seruants.</p>

                           <item>3 The third fault is prophanenes, most seruants neuer respect piety and Gods feare, but onely to please their Masters, this hee mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with when he saith, not as men pleasers, but fearing God.</item>
                           <item>4 The fourth fault is hypocriticall seruice, this he meeteth when he addeth in singlenesse of heart.</item>

                           <hi>Seruants</hi>] The Seruants in the Apostles time were for the most part bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaues, bought and sold as beasts, and their Masters were infidels and cruell to them; and yet many of these Seruants were conuerted to the faith of Christ. Where we may learne, that mens slaues may be Gods seruants, hee hath his elect among these; the deare children of God in this world may bee abased to most vile miserie, and a most seruile condition.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The Vses are:</hi> First, to shew that felicitie is not in outward things, for Gods seruants that had attained the chiefe good, yet were in most base condition, in respect of the things of this life.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, to teach vs patience in lesser crosses, whatsoeuer thou art, yet thou art not a bondslaue, therefore bee patient; such as haue beene deare in Gods sight haue beene worse vsed then thou art.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, to teach vs compassion to the baser sort of men, for Gods elect may be among these.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, this is a great comfort to the abiect.</p>
                        <p>But howsoeuer bought seruants were most vsuall in the Apostles time, yet hired seruants were vsed then too, and are heere meant, aswell as the other, yea, all seruants though they were nobles seruing in Princes Courts, are tied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>And as any seruants haue more knowledge and doe professe sinceritie in

                           <item>1 That they must obey, they must approue themselues to their Masters not by wearing their cloth, or cognisance, or by words and complements, but by painfull and carefull obedience.</item>

                        </list>
                        <p>First, with reuerence, with all honour, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. both internall, with high account and estimation of their Masters, and externall, with reuerent words and behauiour.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, with all feare, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.5. and this they should shew, first, by auoiding what might offend. Secondly, by not answering againe. Thirdly, by a holy endeauour to please them. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, with subiection, to rebukes, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. 2. to correction, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 19.20. 3. to their restraints: first, in respect of diet, they must not bee their owne caruers. Secondly, in respect of place, they must keepe the bounds of the Family, and not at their pleasure bee gadding out either by night or day vpon any pretence without leaue. Thirdly, in respect of company, they must bring none into the Family, that are lewd persons, or of what sort soeuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the liking of the Master, nor may they keepe company abroad to the iust offence of their Masters. Fourthly, in respect of apparell, though they haue neuer so good meanes, yet they must bee attired as becommeth Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</p>
                        <p>And this subiection also they should shew in a ready acknowledgement of their fault when they vnderstand it.

                           <item>1 In diligence of labour, he is not a faithfull seruant that eats the bread of Idlenesse, as many seruing men do, that can tell of no calling but attendance.</item>
                           <item>2 In trustinesse, and in this seruants must bee faithfull two waies: first in their care to see their Masters directions executed in the familie, as if they had beene present: secondly, in their speedie dispatch of busines abroad, a sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full messenger is an exceeding prouocation to them that send him, and it is a wretched fault in seruants, when they are sent forth of the family about busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse they cannot find the way in againe in anie due time.</item>
                        </list>

                        <p>To them that are your Masters] They must be subiect and obedient to all Masters, indefinitely without difference of Sexe (and so to the wife or wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Prou.</hi> 31.) or of condition they must bee obedient to the poorest as well as the rich.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the laying downe of the exhortation. The explication followes, and first of the premises. <hi>According to the flesh.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="130" facs="tcp:21380:223"/>These words may bee referred to masters, and then the sense is this, that seruants must be obedient euen to such masters as are fleshly, and carnall men, they must obey though their masters be Ethnikes or prophane persons; it is a great praise for a seruant to men, to bee Gods seruant also, but it is a greater praise to be a religious seruant of an irreligious master, to feare God in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane house.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 To seruants, and so they are a limitation, they are subiect onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their flesh and bodies, and so heere is two things to be obserued.</p>
                        <p>The one exprest: the bodies of seruants are in the power, and at the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the masters, and therefore seruants must learne to subiect their flesh to their masters, both commands, restraints, and corrections.</p>
                        <p>The other implied: the soules of seruants are not in the power and at the disposing of Masters, their spirits are free, nor Master nor King can command the conscience.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Vse</hi> is, first, for reprofe of such seruants as giue more to their masters then is due, thou oughtest to be of the same calling, trade, labour, &amp;c. that thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is of, but thou art not bound to bee of the same religion, or humor with thy Master. It is a great fault not to giue the bodie to thy Master, but a great fault also, to giue both body and soule to bee at his disposing, both are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, should seruants feare their masters because they haue power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the flesh? how much more should we feare God, that hath power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy both soule and flesh in hell, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, this may be a great comfort to a seruant, thy soule is as free as the soule of him that sits on a throne, thy seruice in the flesh derogates nothing from the libertie of Christ in thy heart. Thy best part is free.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In all things</hi>] Seruants must obey in all things, euen in things that bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their credit, profit, liking, ease, &amp;c. There is a great sturdinesse in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny seruants, either they will not doe some things required, or not at the time when they are bidden, or not in the manner, but as they list, these courses are vile, and heere condemned.</p>

                        <p>Thirdly, when it is apparant to be impious and sinnefull that is required, yet thou must looke to the manner of disobedience, thou must yeelde thy selfe to obey by suffering; yea, it is a wretched fault in seruants or inferiours, that are vrged to vnlawfull things, to refuse with sturdie, and insolent, and prouoking words, or behauiour, God frees thee from obedience in act, but he frees thee not from reuerence, and from an holy estimation and humble demeanour.</p>

First, so to please men, as neuer to care for pleasing God; so to attend a corporall seruice as not to care for the sauing health of their soules, this is prophanesse. Secondly, such seruants are heere taxed, as seeke by all meanes to please their masters, but not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them, such are they that are flattering soothing persons, that serue their Masters onely with faire words, but else are emptie persons; such (or rather worse) are they that apply themselues to their Masters humors, to feede them with tales, or praising their ill courses and counsels, or executing their sinfull mindes: these seruants are many times the firebrands of contention, alienate parents from their children, friend from friend, and keepe malice on perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall foote: these are heere rebuked. But let vs consider further, is this such a fault in poore seruants (that can pretend many things) to be men-pleasers, how foule a vice is it in freemen that are in no wants or restraint, how hurtfull is it to be a man-pleaser in the Courts of Princes, and in the houses of Nobles? how detested a vice is it in such as are Magistrates and publike states?

                        <p>Secondly, he will serue God at all times as well as at one time: it is a note of an hypocrite that he will not pray at all times, hee will serue God when hee is sicke, but not when he is well, <hi>Iob.</hi> 27.7.8.9. So it is vile hypocrisie to come to Church in Lent to heare Sermons, but neuer come there, or but seldome all the yeare after.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, he minds inward secret domesticall holinesse and piety, as well as outward open and Church holinesse, he is an hypocrite that kneeles downe when he comes into the Church and neuer prayeth in his family at home. It is vile hypocrisie and palpable, in such men as haue knees of prayer when they first come vp into the pulpit, and no words of prayer when they are risen vp to speake for or to Gods people.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. As it is opposed to fleshly wisedome, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. There is a three-fold wisedome of the flesh that batters and keepes out singlenesse and sincerity of heart.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The first is a reaching after priuate ends in publike imployments, as preaching for gaine, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 The second is a cunningnesse in committing or hiding sinne. It is since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be wise to doe good, and simple concerning euill to bee a bungler in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting it, and to haue nothing to say in defence of it when it is done, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.19.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 The third is fraud, shifting, subtilty, and guilefull and deceitfull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in mens course for the things of this life. Thus <hi>Esau</hi> is a wild and cunning man, able by reason of his craft and subtilty to liue in a wildernesse, but <hi>Iakob</hi> is a plaine man, a single hearted man, he can make no shift to helpe himselfe in earthly things by fraud or craft, but is open and plaine in all his dealings for the world; but a man of great reach for matters of his soule. This is a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of true singlenesse, simplicitie and sincerity: 3. as it is opposed to a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, opposed I say to a hart and a hart, and a double heart is eyther a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering heart, or a diuided heart: men haue a double hart that wauer and are tossed with vncertainties, such as are now for God and godlinesse, and shortly after for sinne and the flesh; now are resolued to leaue such a fault, as perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it is a fault, and by and by they will to it againe, as perswaded it is not a fault: heere is no singlenesse of heart. And thus the heart is double in respect of times, it is double also, as diuided in respect of obiects; I instance in two things: first in matter of worship, the people that came to inhabite Samaria had a diuided heart, for they feared the God of the Country, because of the Lions and they feared the Gods of the nations also, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 17.33. Such are they that feare Gods threatnings in his word, and feare the signes of heauen too. Secondly, our Sauiour instances in matters of the world. The minde which is the eye of the soule cannot be said to be single, when it is distracted, men cannot serue God and Mammon. <hi>Math.</hi> 6.21.22.23.24.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 As it is opposed to spirituall pride, a single heart is an humble heart as <hi>Iob</hi> sheweth, <hi>Iob.</hi> 9.15.16. and sheweth it selfe in two things: First, that if God send crosses, it will not answer or iustifie it selfe, but make supplication, and so acknowledge Gods loue, as withall it will confesse that God doth iudge them for their corruptions. Secondly, if the sincere hearted man pray to God and the Lord be pleased to answer him by vnutterable feelings, euen by the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the spirit of adoption, yet hee will be so farre from spirituall pride and conceitednesse, that fearing before Gods mercies, he will be as if he beleeued not that God had heard his voice.</p>

He is a bungler in sinne, he knowes not the method of Sathan. 6. Hee dotes not vpon the world, he can vse it as though he vsed it not, hee is not tossed with distracting cares. 7. He cannot abide mixtures in the worship of his God, he is neyther Idolatrous, nor superstitious, nor humorous. 8. Good successe in grace and innocency, makes him more humble and fit to grieue for sinne, and feele the waight of it, he struggles as much against spirituall pride as against other sins. 9.

                        <p>In this verse Seruants are perswaded to obedience, by a reason taken from the retribution or reward of their seruice; and the matter of the verse is comprehended in this Syllogisme. What faithfull men soeuer serue Christ, and doe their dutie to him faithfully and cheerfully, shall receiue of Christ the reward of inheritance: but you Christian seruants, when you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme your obsequious obedience to your Masters, serue the Lord Christ, <hi>ergo,</hi> you shall haue the reward of the inheritance.</p>

                           <hi>Knowing] Doctr:</hi> Seruants may and ought to know, and bee assured of their owne saluation.</p>
                        <p>Vse is for confutation of Papists, and vnsound men, that denie certaintie of saluation; for if seruants that haue not the greatest wits or knowledge, that are imploied about small businesses, that haue not so much liberty, nor
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:21380:226"/>
learning as other men, &amp;c. yet may be assured not by coniecture, or hope, but by certaine knowledge, by most vndoubted faith: then what colour of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, can there be, why other Christians, the Lords people, should bee denied this knowledge? and therefore in the second place it should teach vs to make our calling and election sure.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reward] Doctr:</hi> The workes euen of seruants shall be rewarded.</p>
                        <p>Vse is for the comfort of seruants, and for reproofe of the vnbeliefe, that is many times in Gods children, doubting of Gods acceptation of their praier and holy indeauours; shall the base and secular workes of mens seruants be rewarded, and the great workes of Piety in Gods seruice not be regarded?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Of the Lord</hi>] God will be pay-master vnto seruants, and in that they are turned ouer to God for payment, it implies that the most masters are careles and vnmercifull; and this they are not onely in withholding conuenient food and raiment, but in sending their seruants after long time of wearie labour out of their Families empty, and without meanes to liue in the world.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reward of inheritance.</hi>]</p>
                        <p>Two things are heere affirmed of heauen: first, it is a reward, and so free. Secondly, it is an inheritance, and so sure.</p>
                        <p>There are foure vses may be made of this Doctrine. 1. We should much loue, esteeme, and desire heauen, it is the reward of God. Princes giue great gifts, but Gods least gift must needs be glorious. 2. We should learne to be liberall as God is liberall, giue freely, giue largely. 3. Heere is a plaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the merit of heauen, for heauen is an inheritance; now the Sonne doth not inherit the Fathers Lands, he hath not his Lands in measure accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his deserts, for most an end, the Land is purchased before the Sonne be borne; much lesse can we merit heauen, and the rather because we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alledge so much as this, we came out of the loines of the Father, seeing we are children but by adoption.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>For yee serue the Lord Christ] Doctr</hi>: Christ is the chiefe Lord, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore masters should be well aduised how they vse their seruants, for they are Christs seruants; and seruants should be carefull how they obey their masters, for they must account to this Steward.</p>

                        <p>Some vnderstand the verse as a threatning to seruants, if they doe any way wrong their masters.</p>
                        <p>But the commonest interpretation is meetest, <hi>viz:</hi> to vnderstand it as a reason taken from the certaine vengeance of God against all Masters that wrong their seruants, and so is the second maine reason to vrge their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

                     <note place="margin">VERSE 1. <hi>YE masters do that which is iust and equall vnto your seruants, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ye haue also a Master in heauen.</hi>

Knowing that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are Seruants vnto <hi>GOD</hi> who is in heauen, and will call them to accounts.</p>

                     </note>To conclude I returne againe to all sorts of Christians and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them to three things principally: the first is about praier, the second is about their carriage, the third about their speeches. For their praiers there are three things exceeding necessarie: perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and christian watchfulnes, and thanksgiuing for the graces and blessings they do receiue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 3. <hi>Praying also for vs, that GOD may open vnto vs the doore of vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to speake the misterie of CHRIST: wherefore I am also in bonds.</hi>
                     </note>Remembring vs also in their praiers, that <hi>GOD</hi> would open vnto vs a doore of vtterance with libertie, courage, power and good successe to breake open the mysterie of the Gospell of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> for which I am now in prison.</p>
                  <p>That I may so speake of those dreadfull secrets, that I no way derogate from the maiestie of them,<note place="margin">Verse 4. <hi>That I may vtter it as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth me to speake.</hi>

                  <p>And for your communication, let it be of good and holy things, not offensiue or slanderous or filthy: and powdred with the salt of discretion and mortification, and thus let it be alwaies and in all companies, that ye may speake fitlie vnto euery man and to his place and the occasion.</p>
                  <p>I haue sent ouer <hi>Tychicus</hi> to declare vnto you my whole estate, who is both a godly man well respected and a painefull Minister, that ioynes with vs in <hi>GODS</hi> workes.</p>
                  <p>And withall I send him to know how you doe, and to comfort you by all meanes, with heartie consolations.</p>
                  <p>And with him I haue sent <hi>Onesimus,</hi> who is now a godlie man truly sincere and well respected, euen he that was borne or brought vp amongst you. These two will relate all things to you.</p>
                  <p>I haue also diuers commendations to deliuer to you, some from some <hi>Iewes,</hi> others from <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Of the first sort are <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starchus,</hi> and <hi>Marcus,</hi> and <hi>Iesus.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Iesus</hi> by his good carriage hath gotten himselfe the surname of <hi>Iust.</hi> These three are <hi>Iewes.</hi> And indeed the only men that constantly hold out to help forward the kingdome of <hi>GOD</hi>: they are men in whom I am much comforted.</p>
                  <p>Those of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that desire to be remembred to you, are <hi>Epaphras, Luke,</hi> and <hi>Demas. Epaphras</hi> is a worthy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and the dearer ought he to be to you, because he is one of you: he striueth mightily for you in all sorts of praiers being importunate with God, that you might hold out without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, and be more and more compleat and full in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and practise of the whole will of <hi>GOD.</hi>

For if it be a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice to bring in an infectious seruant, that hath the plague vpon his bodie, and to appoint him to worke among the rest of his seruants that are free from the disease, then it is much more vniust to bring in leud seruants, that haue the plague sore of sinne running vpon them: for the presence, and counsell, and example of leud sinners, is of more power to infect a sound soule, than is a plaguie man to poison the sound bodie of others. 2. More particularly, masters must doe that which is iust, 1. to the soules. 2. to the bodies of their seruants. They must deale iustly with their soules, by helping them to grace if it be possible, but at least by bringing them to the publike meanes of grace, and by priuate training of them vp in Gods feare, by praier and instruction. The iustice they owe vnto their body may be referred vnto three heads: For either it concernes their maintenance, and so they must giue them their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <note n="b" place="margin">

                           <item>1 That there is no master, but he is a seruant; and therefore as hee would require his worke to be done by his seruant, so hee should be carefull himselfe to doe Gods worke, to whom he is a seruant.</item>
                           <item>2 That Gods maiestie and mans authoritie may well stand together: Christ and <hi>Caesar</hi> can well agree: Mans gouernment in a familie, and Gods gouernment in the world, are not opposite one to the other.</item>
                           <item>3 Ignorance of God, and the accounts must be made to God, is the cause of that securitie, insolencie, and crueltie that is in men.</item>

Secondly,<note place="margin">Of such as fall away from the affection and practice of praier.</note> for reproofe of such as make apostacie from the affections and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of praier: and this is a fault in carnall men that fall from temporarie faith; or in Gods children, that by the deceitfulnesse of sinne and Sathan, giue ouer their affections and carefull diligence in praier. For the first sort, we must know, that when such men lose their ioy and delight in the word, they lose also their care in praier: but they must know they doe it not without singular danger; for now that hearing and praier are laid aside, seuen deuils worse than that one cast out by acknowledgement, may enter in: yea that they may fall from these affections into a reprobate sense; yea, which is worst, they are in danger of the sinne against the holy Ghost, and the more if they grow to hate praier and despight Gods grace in his children: and therefore they should be aduised with all speed to repent with sound sorrow, and beseech God to forgiue them, if it be possible, the thoughts of their hearts. And as for such of Gods children as are decaied and fallen away from the power and practise of praier, they should be wakened and remember themselues, both by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the hurt they bring vpon themselues, and the remedies for their recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie The hurts befallen them by this apostacie are such as these.<note place="margin">The hurts that follow the apostacie from the power and practice of praier.</note> 1. The losse of the comforts of the sweet presence of God. 2. They put on a kinde of image of the old <hi>Adam</hi> againe, they looke as if they were no better than car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall people, they returne in many things to the filthinesse they had forsaken, they forme themselues to the courses of carnall wisdome, and too much like the world and the sinfull profits and pleasures of it. 3. Faith and loue are more and more enfeebled, lesse sense of Gods presence, and lesse loue to Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. 4. They bring vpon themselues a tedious dislike of the meanes of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, besides the danger of many temporall iudgements.</p>
                        <p>For remedie of this great inconuenience, they must doe three things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 They must purge by godly sorrow and fasting. 2. They must labour to reduce themselues vnto an holy order of liuing, both by a daily course of examination by the Law, and also by the consecration of themselues to the constant and orderly practise of all Christian duties. 3. They must by daily importunitie beseech God to giue them againe the words and affection of praier: and all this they should doe the more speedily, because if by long dwelling in apostacie they prouoke God, though by repentance they reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer themselues againe, yet the ioies of Gods spirit, or the great measure of them, may be lost, so as they shall neuer recouer the ioy of their saluation all their daies.</p>

                           <hi>Vse.</hi> Is first for ministers and then for the people; Ministers may see heere what it is that specially makes a happy Pastor, not liuing countenance of great men &amp;c. but libertie, courage, power &amp;c. And it greatly taxeth foure sorts of Ministers. 1. Dumbe Ministers, that vtter nothing. 2. Fantasticall Ministers that vtter the falshood of their owne braines, that speake their owne dreames, and from the vanity of their owne hearts, and seeke out for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple only pleasing things, dawbing with vntempered morter. 3.

Cold Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters that seeke not the power of preaching, striue not to approue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the sight of God and to the conscience of men.</p>
                        <p>The people also should make conscience of their dutie, they may learne from hence, what to pray for, and should daily with importunity, beseech God to giue this wide doore of vtterance to their Teachers.</p>
                        <p>Before I passe from the matter he praies for, I must note a doctrine lies secretly lodged within the same, we may finde in the end of this verse, that the Apostle was in prison, and yet he doth not desire to haue the doore of the

prison open, but the doore of his heart open to vtter the mysterie of Christ, Noting that it is a greater want, to want the liberty of his ministry, in respect of vtterance, then it is to want the liberty of his body in respect of the prison. We should take notice of this for diuers vses: 1. For thankfulnesse, if there be a doore of vtterance opened in Gods house. 2. For preuention of all things (as much as lieth in vs) that might stop the mouthes of Gods faithfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. There are fiue things that stop the mouthes of ministers in generall:<note place="margin">Fiue things stop the mouthes of Gods mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</note> 1 Ignorance and presumptuous sinnes in the ministers themselues; for pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lips are no lips of vtterance: the lips of the minister should be touched with the coales of knowledge, zeale, and mortification. 2. The sinnes of the people many times put the Teachers to silence: the rebellion of the house of <hi>Israel</hi> made <hi>Ezechiel</hi> dumbe, that he could not preach, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3.26.24.27. 3. The violence of persecutors preuailes often to shut the wide and effectuall doores of powerfull preaching, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.9. and therefore we should pray that God would deliuer his faithfull ministers from vnreasonable and absurd men, 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 3.2. 4.

His restraint in prison it may import al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, and so his desire is they should not pray onely for ministers that were at large, and enioied peace, but also euen for him and such others as were in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; for a godly Preacher will not be idle, no not if he come into prison: and thus also it notes, that the wisest men of themselues are not able to teach with power and profit the simplest and meanest men; an Apostle cannot teach a prisoner, without Gods speciall aid and blessing. These words may note also the difficultie of vtterance, as if he should say, you had need to pray not only for ordinarie, but extraordinarie ministers.</p>

                           <hi>Redeeme the time.</hi>] To redeeme signifies either to recouer what is lost, or to buy what is wanting. It is vsually a metaphor borrowed from Merchants buying and selling of commodities. <hi>Time</hi> signifies either space of time, or the opportunitie of time: both may be heere retained.</p>
                        <p>In generall, as time is taken for space of time, there are diuers things may be obserued.<note place="margin">Six things obserued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the redeeming of time.</note> 1.

                        <p n="4">4 We must aduantage our selues by spirituall opportunities, though it be with our losse and paines. We should not thinke much to be at some losse for Gods wares, as well as mens; and wee must be content to trauell as well to the market of our soules, as of our bodies.</p>
                        <p>In particular, concerning redeeming of time, consider 1. what time is lost, 2. how time is to be redeemed, 3. how it must be vsed when it is redeemed, 4. the vses.</p>
                        <p>For the first,<note place="margin">What time is lost.</note> all time is lost, that is spent idly, or in the superfluous feeding of nature, either by food, or sleepe, or in ill companie, or in the seruice of sinne, and the lusts of the flesh, or in the seruice of the world, or superfluous cares about profits, or icies about pleasures; yea the time is lost that is spent in Gods worship, where it is done idolatrously, superstitiously, ignorantly, carelesly, hypocritically, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>For the second, wee must distinguish of times, and the persons that haue time to sell, and the kindes of redeeming. There is time past: this cannot be brought backe againe by any price; but yet wee may contract with time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, for some allowance towards the losse of time past. There is also time to come.<note place="margin">How time may bee bought againe.</note> And heere is first a time of glory to come, and a great bargaine to be made: and for the buying of this, heauen must suffer violence, and we should throng and crowde into the market to procure it, by praier, hearing, faith, almesdeeds, &amp;c. For though it be onely Christs merits that deserues it, yet these things we must doe for the assurance of it. Besides, there is a time of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes to come: as sure as we haue had our daies of sinne, wee shall haue daies of sorrow and torment. This time is to be bought out with repentance, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, fasting, praying, strong cries, by all meanes endeuouring to make our peace, and flie from the anger to come.</p>
                        <p>But time present is the commoditie we are with all carefulnesse to redeeme. The deuill and the world haue time, our callings haue time, and God is a great Lord of time. Time out of the deuils hands and the worlds must be redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, by violent ablation: time from our callings wee must redeeme by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, only making an exchange, and allowing time for godlinesse. In the first and chiefe place, time of God we must buy, both the space of time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in, and the opportunitie of time, both for the giuing, and the efficacie of the meanes: and for this we must both offer and tender the sacrifice of Christ, to pacifie for time lost, and procure acceptation; and also wee must offer vp our selues, soules and bodies, vpon the seruice of opportunities, humbling our soules to walke with our God.</p>

And as for time for worldly businesses, we should obserue the Apostles rule: <hi>They that haue wiues should be as they that haue none, and they that weepe as though they wept not, and they that reioice as though they reioiced not, and they that buy as though they possessed not, and they that vse the world as though they vsed it not, for the fashion of the world goeth away,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29.30.</p>
                        <p>The vse of all is for reproofe of the most of vs: for some of vs sinne against the seasons and opportunities of Gods grace, some against the very space of time. Men transgresse against opportunitie two waies; first, by ignorance of the signes of the seasons, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.3. secondly, by a wilfull neglect of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie of grace when we haue them. There are many things might mooue vs to redeeme the time in this respect.<note place="margin">Motiues to redeeme time.</note> 1. We haue our times appointed, and the bounds of our habitation assigned, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.26. 2. The times will not bee alwaies faire; there are perillous times, times of sorrow, anguish, sicknesse, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, want, losse, feare, perplexitie, yea wee may purpose, promise, expect time of healing and curing, when we shall be deceiued, and finde a time of trouble, <hi>Ier.</hi> 14.19. Besides, Christ in the opportunities of grace is but a little while with men. There is a prime of a mans life, yea a prime of euery mans ministerie, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.33. Further, the Kingdome of God in the mercies of it may be wholly taken away, if we bring not fruit in time of fruit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.34.41. Lastly, this is a very prouoking sinne: for if God giue a space to repent, and men will not know the day of their visitation, most an end God casts such into a bed of affliction, after they haue stretched themselues vpon the bed of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, <hi>Reuel.</hi> 2.21.22. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.43.44. Yea many of Gods children are greatly to blame, in neglecting the opportunities of assurance of grace: and therefore because they are so carelesse in making their calling and election sure, this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking of the promise of God is scourged afterwards with comfortlesse sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, arising from such a sense of their corruptions, as makes them for a long time seeme to be depriued of all grace and mercy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1.</p>
                        <p>Againe, many men sinne egregiously against the very space of time, in that they haue much leisure and time, and fill it vp with little or no good imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Their estate, that haue meanes to liue without labour, is vsually accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an estate of great ease and happinesse. But indeed it is an estate of much danger: for the men that abound in time without imploiment, are liable to many temptations and lusts; besides, they are subiect to almost continuall hardnesse of heart and deadnesse of spirit: for it is the labouring seruant that enters into his masters ioy. Adde, that men that abound with leisure, are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily drawne by the inticements of ill company, and much intangled with the sports and pleasures of the world. Sometimes such persons grow into great habit of suspitiousnesse, waiwardnesse, filled with worldly passions and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments: sometimes they prooue great medlers in other folkes businesse.</p>
                        <p>The remedie for these persons, whether men or women, is to exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in some kinde of profitable imploiment, and to labour so as some way to see the fruit of it, to eat their owne bread; but especially they should bee abundant in the worke of the Lord, they should double their imploiment in reading, hearing, conference, mortification, mercie, &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:21380:240"/>
conclusion. Before he hath handled the common doctrine both of faith and life, now he lets loose his affection to expresse in particular his loue to speciall Christians, in all the words there is to be obserued, first a narration as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. Secondly the salutations themselues.</p>
                        <p>The narration is in these three verses and the summe of it is that <hi>Paul</hi> being Prisoner at Rome to expresse his care for and loue to the Church and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to the Colossians, sends <hi>Timothie</hi> and <hi>Onesimus</hi> the one a Minister the other a priuate man, both faithfull to shew them of <hi>Paules</hi> affaires, and to visit the Churches and comfort them.</p>
                        <p>Before I come to the particulars, from the generall consideration of all the verses to the end of the Chapter, these foure things may be obserued.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That religion extends it selfe to the behauiour of men, euen in these more ordinary matters, of life, so as men may sinne or obey euen in them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That the loue euen of the best Christians needs (for the preseruing and continuing of it) euen these lighter helpes and obseruances.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That pietie is no enemie to curtesie, it doth not remoue but rectifie it, pietie doth prescribe to curtesie foure waies, 1 By forbidding and restraining the art of dissimulation and the politicke seruing of mens humors, and all the base courses of flatterie. 2 By moderating the excesse of complements. 3 By preseruing the puritie of them, that they be not made the instruments of prophanenesse, and pollution and wantonnesse. 4 By adding to them the seedes of grace and religion, <hi>Paul</hi> will salute aswell as the Gentiles but yet his matter shall tend vnto grace and some good of the soule, as <hi>Col.</hi> 1.2. and in the rest of the Epistles.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Amongst Christians there may be a preheminencie of affection, some may be loued more then others, the Apostle is desirous his doctrine may be a testimonie of his loue, to all, but yet he cannot forbeare, the mention of his speciall respect of some.</p>
                        <p>The first thing in this part of the conclusion is the narration, and out of the whole narration these things may be noted.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 The generall care Ministers should haue of the Churches, <hi>Paul</hi> cares for the Churches farre remoued, yea when himselfe is in great trouble, and so it might be thought, he had cause enough of care for himselfe.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That the affections betweene faithfull Ministers and the people should not only be conceiued but exprest.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That Church Gouernours should be carefull whom they imploy in the businesses of the Church, <hi>Paul</hi> will not send a letter but makes choise of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and faithfull men, much lesse would he haue imploied about the worship of God or the censures of the Church, suspitious persons men of ill fame drunkards or of scandalous behauiour, how can it be otherwise but that the graue censures, of the Church should be loathed, and scorned when such numbers of disordered and prophane persons are admitted to the denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, pleading and executing of them.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Men should be carefull how and whom they commend by word or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to commend euill men is to beare false witnesse, many times to the great hurt both of the Church and common wealth.</p>
                        <p>The first particular thing in the narration concerning <hi>Tichi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<list>
                              <item>1 Who commends him, viz: <hi>Paul.</hi> And this shewes that ministers should be carefull to preserue and inlarge the credits of their brethren. Especially this is a care should be in such as excell others in place or gifts. They are farre from this, that detract from the iust praises of their brethren, hold them downe with all disgrace, labour to destroy what they build vp, and plucke away the affections of the people from them; and when they haue occasion
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:21380:240"/>
to speake to them, vse them contemptibly, and rate them as if they were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their scullions then their brethren. And the sinne is the worse, when the same persons can countenance idle, euill, and scandalous persons.</item>
                              <item>2 To what end, viz: That his embassage might be so much the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected: for the credit of the person winnes much respect to the doctrine it selfe.</item>
                              <item>3 In what manner. And heere obserue two things: 1. That he giues him his full praise; for a man may slander by speaking sparingly in the praises of the well-deseruing. 2. That hee praiseth him without any <hi>(but)</hi> to teach vs that we should not be easie in word or letter in discouering the infirmities of faithfull ministers.</item>
                              <item>4 The particulars of his praises. And they may be diuided thus: Either they are common to all true Christians, <hi>(beloued brother)</hi> or proper to Church officers,<note place="margin">

                              </item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>There are foure things ought to be in euery good minister.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1 He must be a good man, a brother.</item>
                           <item>2 He should be beloued of his people, <hi>beloued brother.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>3 He must be faithfull. And his faithfulnesse stands in two things: 1. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in labour: 2. Sinceritie in giuing euery one their portion of rebukes, comforts, directions, &amp;c. in due season.</item>
                           <item>4 He must be a fellow-seruant, one that will draw in the yoke with his brethren.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>This may smite the conscience of many sorts of ministers.</p>
                        <p>Some because they are of wicked and scandalous life.</p>
                        <p>Some because they haue made themselues hatefull to their people by their indiscretion, couetousnesse, contention, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Some because they are not faithfull: Either not true to the bed of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to which they consecrated themselues: or not sincere in the vse of their gifts, being idle loiterers, indiscreet feeders, men-pleasers, or the like.</p>
                        <p>Some because they are proud, humorous, selfe-conceited, singular, and loue to goe alone.</p>
                        <p>Thus of his praises. The ends of his mission followes, and they are three.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That he might declare vnto them <hi>Pauls</hi> estate. 2. That hee might know their estate. 3. That he might comfort their hearts.</p>
                        <p>For the first: If you aske what he should declare, I may answer, such things as these, the successe of the Gospell in <hi>Rome,</hi> the order of <hi>Pauls</hi> life, and his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</p>
                        <p>If you aske to what end: I answer, 1. For approbation; the greatest men need the approbation of other ministers, yea of other Christians. 2. For thankesgiuing, that so many praises might be giuen to God. 3. For praier for what was wanting, or hurtfull to him or the Church. 4. For consolation to them, who questionlesse would reioice to heare from <hi>Paul.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Againe it is to be noted that he saith his whole estate: for a godly man car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth himselfe so as he cares not though all men see into all his courses.</p>

                           <hi>Doct.</hi> The state of the people ought to be knowne to the minister: not their worldly estate, but the estate of their soules and consciences, and the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the meanes vpon them, not onely for the satisfaction of the ministers affection, but for the guiding of his priuate preparations and praiers, and for his publike doctrine.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:21380:241"/>
in respect of preaching: neither can he be a good Preacher, that is not a carefull Watchman.</p>
                        <p>Againe, it is a great defect in the people, when the minister wants intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. For though it be a base humour of any to bring false reports, and a weake part in any minister to make the Pulpit a place to vent their priuate and personall businesses, yet in the generall he cannot be a good Physitian to the state of any congregation, that is not acquainted with their diseases.</p>

Not but there is enough said many times to make despaire, but that there is this prouidence of God, that it comes not vpon men by this meanes; but either of the melancholie of the body, or the speciall curse that God priuately poured vpon them, or by the speciall working of Satan by Gods iust permission. And yet I allow not indiscreet rashnesse, or rude indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion in applying threatnings.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Tichicus</hi> did comfort their hearts, 1. by his presence, 2. by bringing letters to the Church from <hi>Paul,</hi> 3. by his words, not of report onely, relating <hi>Pauls</hi> estate to them, but of doctrine, perswading them to patience vnder their cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, remembring them of the ioies to come, strengthning them against the gaine-sayings of aduersaries, the temptations of Satan, the rebellion of their owne flesh, and the inconuenience of <hi>Pauls</hi> imprisonment, and lastly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them how to goe on in holy life.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the first part of the narration.</p>
                        <p>In the narration concerning <hi>Onesimus</hi> I obserue two things: his praises, and the end of his mission. His praises are as they stand in relation to all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or in particular to them; to all, he is a <hi>brother, faithfull,</hi> beloued to them, and so he is <hi>one of them:</hi> the end of his mission is in the end of the verse.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Onesimus.</hi>] This <hi>Onesimus</hi> was the theeuish and fugitiue seruant of <hi>Philemon,</hi> who comming to <hi>Rome,</hi> was conuerted by <hi>Paul</hi> in prison, and is now for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours sake sent with <hi>Tichicus.</hi> From hence diuers things may be noted.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That hatefull and vnfaithfull persons may be conuerted, and made worthy, faithfull, and beloued.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That religion and the word doth not marre, but make good seruants. The word will doe that which rating and stripes will not doe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 That no mans sinnes, of which they haue repented before God and the Church, ought to be charged vpon them as any disparagement in subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent times. Where God forgiues, men should not impute.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 It is a good worke, to grace and credit such as by repentance returne from their former euill waies.</p>

                        <p>Now in the particular praise of <hi>Onesimus</hi> I obserue: First, that Christian loue respects not persons; <hi>Paul</hi> is not ashamed of a poore seruant, and hee would haue the Church loue whom God loues. Secondly, that there is faithfulnesse required of priuate men as well as ministers, and that faithfulnesse stands in three things, soundnesse in religion without errour or hypocrisie, diligence in the particular calling, and fidelitie in promises and couenants. Thirdly, that naturall and ciuill relations are not broken or disabled by religion; they must not only loue <hi>Onesimus</hi> as a Christian, but also as <hi>one of them,</hi> for he was a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of <hi>Colosse</hi>: there is loue should be in men as they are fellow Citizens, and of the same trade or profession, or the like.</p>

Fiftly the King doth quiet himselfe in the loue of euery subiect and doth reioice ouer them with ioy, it is a great benefit to liue vnder a good King though the subiect be not knowne vnto him: but a great fauour that the King should take notice of the subiect by name; but exceeding great comfort it is if the King loue some subiect with a speciall loue: thus doth Christ to all his subiects, which no King can do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his heart is finite.

Lastly the properties of the kingdome shew the felicitie of the subiect for this kingdome.</p>
                        <p>First; Is in power not in word 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.20. Secondly; Is not of this world but as farre more excellent as it differs in nature from the kingdome of the world, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.36. Thirdly, It is without end, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28.</p>

                        <p>The vses follow.</p>
                        <p>First for instruction, if the estate of Christians conuerted by the powerfull preaching of the Gospell vnder the regiment of Christ, be so excellent an estate, and so happie and a king-like condition; it should teach, first all that are not yet conuerted to settle their hearts about this point,<note place="margin">How men may get into the Kingdome of God.</note> and that they may get into the kingdome of God, they must get an holy estimation of the happines of that estate, a kingdome should moue them much, Sathan knew if any thing would preuaile with Christ it must be the glory of kingdomes; behold heere God offers thee a kingdome. Secondly, pray daily and earnestly that Gods kingdome may come vpon thee, <hi>Math.</hi> 6. Thirdly, practise what thou praiest, and by practise seeke the kingdome of God first <hi>Math.</hi> 6.33. and to this end obserue 4 rules.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Remoue what might hinder, that is by repentance cast off thy sinnes, no vncleane thing must enter heere, and it is plaine it is required <hi>Math.</hi> 3.2.

Fourthly, take heed thou giue not ouer when thou come neere to the kingdome of God, <hi>Mark.</hi> 12.34. for the children of the kingdome may be cast out.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 Take heed of despising poore Christians, for God hath chosen them to make them heires of the kingdome, they must not be accounted of according to their outward estate in the world.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 Those that haue attained this excellent estate must be exhorted to three things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 By godly conuersation to walke worthy of the kingdome of God 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.12. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. Secondly to reioice in their King, and speake of the praises of the great renowne of the sacred Kingdome that thus commeth in the name of the Lord <hi>Psal.</hi> 145.10.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 149.2. <hi>Math.</hi> 11.10. for many Prophets and great Kings haue desired to see such daies, and haue not seene them, in that cleerenesse we now see them. Thirdly, willingly to suffer for righteousnesse, 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.5.</p>
                        <p>Lastly Ministers should heere be informed and prouoked by all meanes possible, in season and out of season to exhort perswade, beseech men, and turne themselues into all formes to preuaile, for it is about a kingdome they labour.</p>
                        <p>Thus for instruction.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 It serues for reproofe First of such as can be so easily content either to want or loose the meanes, the kingdome of God is taken from them <hi>Math.</hi> 21.43. Secondly, of the waiwardnesse of caueling hearers that can neuer be set downe but are still obiecting, against this word of doctrine or the estate of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:21380:244"/>
Christians, these are condemned <hi>Math.</hi> 11.16. &amp;c. Thirdly, it is a great error to rich men in speciall, who are threatned with impossibilitie to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Kingdome, if they do not aboue all other men looke to themselues, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.23.24. Fourthly, of the discontentments of Gods seruants vnder crosses, is there no king in Sion? or is it no priuiledge that the first Dominion is come vnto them, <hi>Micah.</hi> 4 9. Fiftly, it specially reprooues those wicked persons that professe by their workes they will not haue Christ to raign ouer them by his word <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.14.27. <hi>Zacha.</hi> 14.17. woe is vnto them, and woe to such as shut vp the kingdome of God before men <hi>Math.</hi> 23.13.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 For comfort to all Gods seruants. Did so great Kings and Prophets de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to see these things we see? what is it to enioy such a Kingdome? was it a great offer in <hi>Herod</hi> to offer halfe his kingdome, what is it in God to giue a whole Kingdome, better then any Kingdome on earth? yea this comfort is the greater, in that such christians whose grace is but like the graine of mustard seede, may be possessed of this Kingdome.</p>
                        <p>

                           <hi>Doctr.</hi> The labours of Gods seruants are a great comfort vnto good men, it is a comfort to see Gods worke prosper, and besides ioy in the holy Ghost is wrought in their hearts by the power of the word preached.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Quest.</hi>

                        <p>To passe from this point we may here obserue, 1 An immutable praise in the

Apostle, he enuies not the labours of his brethren, he is so farre from it that he reioyceth in it. 2 we may see that the wisest and greatest men haue neede to be comforted of meaner men. 3 Heere is a reproofe of such workemen as by their labour grieue Gods people, and are as thornes and goades in their sides but comfort them they do not.</p>
                        <p>Thus of the salutations of the Iewes.</p>
                        <p>The salutation of the three Gentiles follow, the first is <hi>Epaphras</hi> who (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the report of his salutation) is described 1 by his office the seruant of Christ. 2 By his relation to them, who is one of you. 3 By his loue to them shewed by striuing in praier for them. 4 By his zeale not onely for them but for the two neighbour Churches, <hi>vers.</hi> 13.</p>
                        <p>This <hi>Epaphras</hi> was the Cities preacher among the <hi>Collossians</hi> he is kept back at <hi>Rome</hi> for a time that so <hi>Tichicus</hi> might confirme the doctrine before taught by <hi>Epaphras.</hi>

                           <hi>Quest.</hi> But why is the Apostle so long in speaking of him being so short in the mention of the rest? <hi>Answ.</hi> It is the Apostles discretion to honor him before his owne people.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>A seruant of Christ</hi>] He was a seruant of Christ first as a man and so by the necessitie of creation he must serue Christ whether he would or not. 2 As a Christian man and so he serues him willingly and in religious workes. 3 As a Preacher of the Gospell, and so he serues Christ in a speciall function in the Church.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1 Ministers are Christs seruants, whence followes two thinges, first they must do his workes. Secondly, they must not be seruants of men.</p>

                           <hi>Doctr.</hi> 2 The estate of the Ministers of God is an estate of seruing not of raigning, they are not Lords ouer Gods heritage, nor must they thinke to be like the Princes of the Nations.</p>

                           <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. It is a great honour to be Christs seruant; for all his seruants are freemen, and their wages is euerlasting: and therefore wee should loue to be his seruants, neither should it euer seeme euill vnto vs to doe his worke. Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sides, it is a great comfort to poore Christians, though they cannot be Kings and Apostles, yet they may be Christs seruants, which Kings and Apostles haue accounted their greatest honour. Thirdly, men must take heed of de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>spising or abusing Ministers, seeing they are Christs seruants, yea it is not safe to abuse any Christian for that very reason. Lastly, seeing it is so great a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to serue Christ, both Ministers and people must be carefull to performe Christs seruice, with obseruation of what Christ requires, for the manner or rules of his seruice.</p>
                        <p>Ministers must not seeke their owne things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. they must not be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to wine, not to filthy lucre, not fighters, not couetous, not profane in their families, not young schollers, not scandalous, 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <p>Christians in their seruice of Christ must remember to lay aside all immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate cares for the profits and pleasures of this world: ye <hi>cannot serue Christ and mammon.</hi> 2. That Christ will not be serued but in newnesse of spirit: the old heart can doe Christ no worke Christ will accept, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.6.</p>

                           <hi>Answ.</hi> If you speake of ministers, it is answered negatiuely, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10.

If you aske of Christians in generall, it is answered <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.16 His seruants you are to whom ye obey. If ye conscionably endeuour to obey the word of Christ, you are the seruants of Christ; otherwise yee serue sinne vnto death.</p>

Enuie at the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie or trade of others. 3. Faction or banding into sides in matters of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 4.

                           <note place="margin">Sorts of praiers.</note>] There be diuers kinde of praiers: for they are varied first by the place, for there is publike praier, and there is priuate praier, either with our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, or alone by our selues. Secondly, by the manner, and that either for forme, or affection: for forme, there are not only ordinary set praiers, but eiaculations, short requests or desires, cast out vpon sudden opportunities; these be praiers, and accepted of God, though the words be few or abrupt. For
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:21380:246"/>
affection in praier, there is praier vnto which is required the vsuall deuotion of the heart, and there is supplication which is with speciall instance and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.7. Thirdly, by the instrument, there is the praier of the mouth, and the praier of the heart. Fourthly, by the matter, for there is deprecations for turning away of iudgements, and confessions with acknowledgement of sinne, and petition in matters of request, and thankesgiuing for benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>

                           <hi>Striueth.</hi>] But why must we striue in praier? Because of the greatnesse of our owne wants &amp; necessities, and because it is a great losse to lose our praiers.</p>

It imports earnestnesse as it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to coldnesse, when we draw neere to God with our lips, but our hearts are farre from him: or to spirituall fainting in praier, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.1. Secondly, tendernesse of affection, both sorrowing and reioicing in praier, according to our occasions, and the matter of praier. Thirdly, a resolution to take no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall. Fourthly, difficultie, for fighting imports opposition.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Vse.</hi> For reproofe of such as neuer complaine of any impediments in praier, nor care how they speed: their condition is as farre from happinesse, as their practise is from dutie. And they are to be blamed, that complaine of their lets and discomforts in praier, but yet they striue not. But wee should learne to harnesse our selues,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Note</hi>
                           </note> and conscionably striue against all that might hinder vs; and to this end set our selues in Gods presence, and beseech God to heale our infirmities, and helpe vs against all the lets of praier, and stirre vp in our hearts the promises made to praier, obseruing fit times, and watching to all opportunities, to be importunate when any doore is opened.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, would one be feruent in spirit? They must then looke to 4 things. First, they must serue the Lord; for a profane person can neuer be feruent. Secondly, they must labour to reioice their soules with the hope of a better life; for such comfortable meditations inflame the spirit. Thirdly, wee must get patience vnder worldly crosses and tribulations, else the cares and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world will choake all true feruencie. Fourthly, wee must continue in praier; for vse and experience breeds feruencie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Alwaies.</hi>] We must be constant in praier, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.36. To pray alwaies, is to keepe a constant order in the daily performance of this dutie, and besides to pray vpon all occasions and opportunities. The profit comes by this constancie in praier, appeares by the proofes, to bee 1. much ioy, 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.16. 2. they that pray continually, shall escape the last terrible things, and be able to stand in the day of Christ, <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.36.</p>
                        <p>Heere wee may see the difference betweene a godly minde and a carnall heart. The godly minde is alwaies praying, but the carnall heart is seldome without a sense of tediousnesse, with a desire to be rid of the burthen of it.</p>
                        <p>The reason why Gods children be so willingly imploied in much and often praier, is partly because God commands them to pray alwaies, partly because they finde vnutterable benefit and refreshing in praier, and partly they daily get heereby what they desire, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.24.</p>
                        <p>If any take vnto them the words of those wretched Iewes, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. and say what profit is it to keepe Gods Commandements, or to walke humbly, and that they could neuer finde any good by it, I can soone answere that in their praiers and obedience there was no profit, for indeede they did not

walke humbly, nor in the power of godlinesse did they keepe Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ob.</hi> But haue not the best of them all, their sinnes, distractions and wants, as well as others? how then can they be so bold and frequent in praier?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> The children of God haue priuiledges, others haue not; for their wants are couered by Christs intercession, and their suits are followed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Christs aduocation, 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.1. and framed in earth by the spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ob.</hi> But how can they finde matter for so much praier?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> If men had by the law gathered the catalogues of their sinnes, and learned to see and feare the iudgements sinne might bring, if they had obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the daily straits of a mortall condition, if they had considered the almost infinite occasions of praier for themselues and others, they would not thus obiect.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ob.</hi> But there are some that doe pray, and that alwaies too, against their corruptions, and yet cannot speed, nor get strength against them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Sol.</hi> If they haue constantly praied (which yet I doubt) then the reason is either they watch not in practise to cut off the occasions of euill, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.36. or they striue not with importunitie to preuaile with God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. or else they cannot be truly affected towards Gods grace in others: for if enuie at the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and estimation of others raigne in thee, it is iust with God to denie to giue thee that grace thou enuiest in others.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, if any man hitherto carelesse of this dutie, be now desirous to be instructed how to pray as he ought, with words, affection, and successe, let such a man put on a minde to obserue the rules following.</p>

Yet in all this take heed of securitie, rest not in beginnings: God will take that at the first, which he will not still be content with. Learne to pray better.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That in the visible Church there may be such as will not stand: and this is true both in true members, and in seeming members. The true members may fall either by infirmitie, and so the righteous falleth seuen times, and riseth againe, or by presumption, falling to the practise of grosse euils, out of which they cannot recouer, but with extreme sorrowes. The onely seeming members, not only may, but certainly will fall, and that most an end finally, without recouerie. So <hi>Demas, Iudas, Ioash,</hi> and many moe. This should teach vs, not to thinke it strange if wee see apostacie in men that haue roomes in the Church, and haue acknowledged the truth according to godlinesse.</p>

For Satan will re-enter, and gaine a stronger possession then euer he had, yea their dispositions vnto euill may seuen times more be enflamed then euer before; seuen deuils worse then the former may enter.

                        <list>
                           <item>1 That the care of faithfull teachers, and their desire to do good extends to other Churches, also hence they are compared fitly to starres that giue light not only to the orbe in which they are, but to places further of, and this good Ministers may do by praier, example of faithfulnesse and diligence, or by counsell or writing, or confirmation of doctrine, by preaching as there is occasion. And this shewes the worth of painfull and sincere Teachers: they are a great benefit, to the whole countrie, where they liue, and therefore they should be protected, and incouraged, by all them that would be accounted louers of their countrie.</item>
                           <item>2 That Ministers owe a speciall loue and care to the neighbour Churches, for as neerenesse of habitation, increaseth the strength of ciuill bonds, so

should it much more in spirituall.</item>
                           <item>3 That the care of other Churches should not cause men to neglect the stocke that depends vpon them, it is not sufficient that men preach somewhere God calls for an account of their stewardship in their owne charge, they must tend their owne heards, he were a strange Husbandman that would plow his neighbours field, and let his owne lie vntilled, it is vile corruption, to be intent when we labour for others, and remisse when we labour for our owne people.</item>

                        <p n="1">1 That the Church of God hath alwaies consisted of men of diuers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: so as no lawfull calling is excluded, nor yet any only taken.</p>
                        <p n="2">2 That Phisicke hath beene of ancient honor and vse in the Church, wee see it here in the Apostles time, and it was long before also for there were Phisitions in <hi>Iosephs</hi> time <note n="n" place="margin">
                              <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.2.</note>.</p>
                        <p n="4">4 Sorts of men may be reproued concerning Phisicke, or Phisitions.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Such as totallie neglect them, though they haue neede to vse them,<note place="margin">4 Sorts of men reproued about Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke.</note> yet our Sauiour Christ saith the <hi>sicke neede a Phisition</hi> 
                           <hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 2 Such as are wayward and will not be cured, that is such as through impatiencie will not be ordered by this meanes, in the manner they should be. 3 Such as put their whole trust in Phisicke, as <hi>Asa</hi> did, neglecting to seeke vnto God for helpe: yea it is to be noted in <hi>Asa,</hi> that his disease being but ordinarie yet to neglect the Lord in it was a great sinne, for though God hath allowed Phisicke as an helpe, yet it was neuer his meaning to robbe himselfe of his owne glory. 4 Such as will out of pride and nicenesse, be tampering with their bodies in phisicke, when there is no need, contrarie to that of our Sauiour Christ, the <hi>whole neede not the Phisitian.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now in as much as many times it is manifest, phisicke doth no good to the diseased we are to vnderstand three things, first that this may be the fault of carelesse and ignorant Phisitians. 2 That as we grow monsters in the world by sinning, ouerpassing the deedes of the wicked so the Lord sometimes by bringing in strong and new diseases doth ouerpasse the skill of the Phisitians.</p>
                        <p n="3">3 God for sinnes or triall may restraine the blessing vpon the meanes, which else would be auaileable.</p>
                        <p>The third thing I note, is that the holy Ghost giues this praise to a godly Phisitian, importing that a Phisitian should be a man sound in religion, and zealous for the truth, and knowne and beloued in the Church, for as it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, godly and religious Phisitians may do much good, in the dangers of their patients, so miserable experience shewes that popish and superstitious Phisitians, do exceeding much hurt, by working vpon those opportunities to seduce and peruert men.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And Demas</hi>] This is that <hi>Demas</hi> that afterward forsooke <hi>Paul,</hi> and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this present world, from the consideration of whose estate wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue three things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That the vices of men by the profession of the truth may be restrained when they are not cured. This mans loue of the world was in him, when he was at the best, but it was curbed and held downe, and so it is with many hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and therefore men should be warned and looke to themselues, that they be not deceiued, by taking the restraint of the outward practice of some euill, for the true mortification of them.</p>
                        <p>It is many times a great hand of God vpon vnsound hearted men, that at their best they are seene into, and not greatly esteemed, it seemes it was so with this man, for if we marke it the Apostle not only reckons him in the last place, but he names him also without any manner of praise, as if he would import
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21380:251"/>
that hee durst not commend him to the Churches. We should here learne what to doe towards such from the example of the Apostle.</p>
                        <p>Now if any would know more fully what is to bee done, and how they should carry themselues towards such as they iustly doubt and feare not to be right, though they make profession: there are three rules to be obserued.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 Pitty them, pray for them, and admonish them. 2 Commit not thy selfe vnto them,<note place="margin">3 Rules for our practise concerning such as we suspect in their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note> but bee well aduised before thou converse inwardly with them. It is true that the practise of this rule is strangely censured, when those kinde of people, perceiue themselues, not to be regarded so much as they would bee, for vsually if in discretion, men prooue before they trust, they are taxed of pride and haughtinesse: yet considering the vile hypocrisie that is in many, it is better to be so censured without cause, then to be beguiled by men that make their religion but a cloake to their owne ends.</p>
                        <p>The third rule is that while they stand and fall not into open sinne, thou maiest not traduce them, but conceale thy dislikes, till God lay them open, vnlesse greater danger might ensue by the concealment, for the Lord may make him sound, and giue him repentance, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not dispraise <hi>Demas</hi> here, as he doth not commend him.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, we may in this man note the propertie of many hypocrites, they will not be discountenanced, they are vsually impudent, this man thrusts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into the Apostles company, and will be commended to the Churches: he will haue a place though it be the last place.</p>

                        <p>By the Church hee meanes those in the houshold that feare God, whether they were women or children, or seruants.</p>
                        <p>Now here first I consider of these persons, and then of the title the Apostle giues them in calling them a Church.</p>
                        <p>In that the Apostle thus with honour remembers the houshold of <hi>Nymphas,</hi> it shewes his singular vprightnesse, in that he can respect grace in whomsoeuer hee finde it, hee loues a good seruant as well as a good Master, and can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend good order in an houshold as well as in a congregation. This should teach vs not to haue the grace of Christ in respect of persons, and hereby also we may try our loue to Gods children, by examining our selues, whether we can loue such as can neither profit or pleasure vs, nor grace vs in the world. And this may be a great incouragement to the yoong and meaner sort, in that they may perceiue from hence, that if they get true grace, they shall be respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted both of God and good men.</p>
                        <p>Now in that the Apostle calls this houshold a Church,<note place="margin">A religious Familie, is a little Church. The vses of it.</note> we may note, that a religious and well ordred familie is as it were a little Church. Here, in one familie is prescribed what all families should be, this familie is called a church, because his people were godly, and the word of God was read there, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers made to God, and Psalmes sung, and the yonger sort were catechized and instructed.</p>
                        <p>Now doe we learne from hence, that our houses are Churches? then these things will follow.</p>
                        <list>

                           <item>2 All must be done there in order, and quietnesse, and silence, for so it is or should be in the Church.</item>

                           <item>4 The Husband or Master of the familie must dwell there as a man of knowledge, and wiues, children and seruants must obey as the Church doth Christ.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Againe, are our families Churches? why then religious families are in a happy case, for then God himselfe will dwell there. So as a stranger comming to such places, may say as Iacob did of <hi>Bethel,</hi> surely God is in this place.</p>
                        <p>Lastly, should our families be Churches? Oh then woe vnto the world of profane housholds, should a Church be without sacrifice? and can their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies escape Gods wrath, seeing there is neither prayer nor pietie in them, but in stead of Gods seruice, there is cursing, and swearing, and lying, and chiding, and filching, and whoring, and rayling, and fighting, and what not? The most families are very cages of vncleane spirits: where not God or good men, but very deuills dwell, they are very styes of vncleanesse and vnholinesse.</p>

                        <p n="3">3 Men bring not an humble and meeke spirit, whereas vnto the fruitfull meditation of the word, a heart quiet and patient, and a minde free from pride and passion is requisite, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.9.</p>

                        <p n="6">6 One great cause of not profiting, is the not seeking of the law at the

how the word did offer comfort when they need it, they could not but finde many excellent experiences of Gods prouidence and power in the word, they could not liue in any sinne, but either reading or hearing would discouer it, nor could they goe long without some word of comfort, when they needed it, yea they might obserue, how God in the word they read did counsell them too, when they were in distresse, therefore let him that readeth marke, and read for himselfe.</p>

                              <p>Doth <hi>Archippus</hi> need to be told? the Lord be mercifull to the land and Church; There be many Archippasses in the Church of England, had need to be wakened with a loud trumpet of rebuke, and to be told of their faults, euen of their ignorance, silence, sloth, pride, couetousnesse, simonie, dissolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, ambition, contempt of their brethren, and soule murther of many kinds.</p>

                           <item>5 Ministers must bee told of their faults by their people, with great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and heedfulnesse, and wisdome, according to that direction, <hi>Rebuke not an Elder, but exhort him as a Father</hi>; here they must say to <hi>Archippus</hi> not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly reprooue him.</item>
                           <item>6 They must say it to him, not say it of him, Ministers ought not to be traduced behind their backs.</item>

                        <list>
                           <item>1 Consideration, a weying and meditation of the greatnesse of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of the dignitie of it, and the dutie also, with the accounts he must make to God and his high calling and the great price of soules, &amp;c.</item>
                           <item>2 It notes diuers of the worthy qualities of a Minister, as care, attendance, watchfulnesse, aptnesse to teach, and diuide the word aright, discretion, to giue euery one his portion, diligence, gentlenesse, in not marring the doctrine with passion, patience to indure the worke and labour of his ministry, &amp;c.</item>
                           <item>
                              <pb n="201" facs="tcp:21380:253"/>3 It notes caution, and so Ministers must take heed both of what is within them, and what is without them, they must take heed of their owne diuinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they must take heed of sloth and idlenesse, they must take heed of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections of their owne flesh, and the tentations of the Diuell, without them they must take heed of the new errors, that will daily rise, they must take heed of the sinnes of the people, with all the methods of Sathan in deuising, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, or defending of sinne, they must take heede of mens fancies: and for persons they must take heed of hypocrites, and open aduersaries, dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall vipers, and forraine foes, false brethren and profest Idolaters.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>The Vse may be for great reproofe of our sleeping watchmen, and blinde guides, that take no heed to their ministeries; Oh the woes that will fall vpon them, who can recount the miseries that the bloud of soules, will bring vpon them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Which thou hast receiued in the Lord</hi>] A Minister is said to receiue his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie in the Lord in diuers respects. First Because it is Gods free grace, that he is chosen to be a Minister <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. Secondly because, he is inwardly called and qualified by God. Thirdly because, he receiued his outward au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, though from men, yet by the direction and warrant of Gods word. Fourthly because, he receiues it for the Lord, that is to Gods glory, and the furtherance of his kingdome, ouer the misticall body of Christ.</p>
                        <p>The Vse is threefold, First the people should therefore learne to seeke their ministers, of God. Secondly Ministers should hence learne, neither to bee proud nor idle, not proud for they receiued their ministerie of God, it was his gift not their deserts, not idle for they are to doe Gods worke. Thirdly Ministers may hence gather, their owne safety notwithstanding the oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world, that God that called them will perfect them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>To fulfill it</hi>] Ministers are said to fulfill their ministeries two waies. 1 By constancie, holding out in it to the end, to fulfill it is to go on, and not looke backe, when they are at plow. 2 By faithfull performance of it with a due respect of all the charge they haue receiued of God, thus to fulfill it is to shew the people all the counsell of God, it is to rebuke all sorts of sinnes and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it is faithfully to do euery kinde of worke, that belongs to their ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie whether publike or priuate.</p>
