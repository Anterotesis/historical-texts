            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Foundation of this Pretence ſeems to be the great miſtake of ſome men concerning the matter whereof the Church of Chriſt is to be compoſed, which they will have to be, only real Saints and perſons endowed with inherent and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial holineſs; Accordingly finding in the Communion of our Church many corrupt Members, who lived not anſwerably to their Holy Vocation, they, for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, amongſt ſome others alledg'd by them, cry her down as no true Church, or, which is all one, deal by her as if ſhe was ſo, totally ſeparating from her Communion and ſetting up Churches of their own, conſiſting wholly of perſons, in their judgment, far more pure, that is, really holy and ſanctified. Into this moſt falſe and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94681:3"/>
dangerous conceit concerning the matter of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, I cannot tell what it is that ſhould miſlead them, unleſs it be,</p>
            <p>The not rightly underſtanding the notion of that holineſs that ſo often in Scripture is applied to the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of God. There is a twofold holineſs in Scripture, <hi>Inherent</hi> and <hi>Relative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inherent holineſs,</hi> and that can be in none properly but God, Angels and Men; <hi>In God</hi> eſſentially and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally, as he is the moſt perfect Being, in whom all excellencies do poſſeſs infinite perfection; As it's applied to God, it does not only ſignifie a perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in him from all thoſe ſinful impurities, wherewith the ſons of men are tainted, but all the excellencies of the divine nature, as wiſdom, goodneſs, and power, and a <hi>ſuper</hi>-eminent and incommunicable greatneſs in them all; hence he is call'd <note place="margin">Pſalm 89. 18.</note>
               <hi>the holy One of</hi> Iſrael, <note place="margin">Amos 8. 7.</note>
               <hi>the excellency of</hi> Jacob, <note place="margin">Pſalm 89. 35.</note>ſaid <hi>to ſwear by his holineſs,</hi> that is, by himſelf, and <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 2.</note>
               <hi>there is none holy as the Lord,</hi> ſaid <hi>Hannah,</hi> for <hi>there is none beſides thee, none</hi> holy <hi>beſides thee,</hi> as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> renders it, none comparable to thee in the heighth and greatneſs of all thy excellencies. <hi>In Angels and men</hi> by way of participation and as far as their natures are capable, hence there are holy Angels and holy men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Relative holineſs,</hi> which when it's applied to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, may be more properly call'd <hi>foederal,</hi> and this is founded in the relation perſons and things have to God, and the nature of it conſiſts in a ſeparation of them from common uſes, and in appropriating of them to the peculiar uſe and ſervice of God: hence the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is call'd an holy Day, <hi>Judea</hi> an holy Land, <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> an holy City, and the Church and People of God an holy Church, that is, a Body or Society of men call'd and ſeparated from the reſt of the World to God,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94681:3"/>
to worſhip him in a way diſtinguiſh'd from the reſt of the World, having Laws and Promiſes and Rites of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip peculiar and appropriate to themſelves; This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count God himſelf gives of it, <hi>I have ſeparated you,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Levit. 20. 24.</note>ſays he to the <hi>Iſraelites, from other people, that you ſhould be mine, and ye ſhall be an holy people unto me.</hi> For the ſame reaſon do we find the whole Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> even then when its members had generally <note place="margin">Deut. 9. 12. Deut. 9. 7. Deut. 32. 5.</note>very <hi>much corrupted themſelves,</hi> were <hi>a rebellious people, a crooked generation,</hi> yet upon the account of their being ſeparated to God and in covenant with him, ſtil'd by <hi>Moſes</hi> and other inſpir'd men, <note place="margin">Deut. 7. 6. Pſal. 135. 4.</note>
               <hi>his ſaints, his holy people, his peculiar treaſure.</hi> For the ſame reaſon alſo did the Apoſtles dignifie thoſe Churches to whom they wrote, with thoſe great and glorious titles, <note place="margin">

               <hi>of ſaints, the ſanctified, the call'd and choſen in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> becauſe they, as of old the <hi>Jews,</hi> had entertain'd the profeſſion of a Religion, diſtinct from others of the World, whereby they might be excited to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of thoſe excellencies, which in the object of their Worſhip they did admire and adore; and thoſe Names being of as large a meaning as that of Chriſtian, ſhew rather what they ought to have been, than aſſure us what they really were; for amongſt thoſe Saints were found ſtrange immoralities altogether contradictory to the ſacredneſs of their Vocation.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25.</note> 
               <hi>But does not the Apoſtle ſay,</hi> Chriſt loved the Church and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it by the waſhing of water by the Word, that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy and without blemiſh?</p>
            <p>I anſwer; Holineſs in this place muſt be confeſt to be meant a real and inward holineſs; but then by Church is not to be underſtood the whole complex
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94681:4"/>
Body of the univerſal Church in this World, but either that part of it that in this World is really, tho' imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, holy, and is every day preſſing forwards to higher degrees of it, or elſe that Church which ſhall be in the future ſtate, when all the corrupt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Members ſhall be by death and the final deciſion of God, for ever excommunicated out of it, and all the Members that remain in it, only ſuch as were in ſome acceptable degrees holy here, and ſhall then be perfected in holineſs. Neither is this to make two Churches of Chriſt, as the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> objected, one, in which good and bad are mingled together, and another, in which there are good alone; but only to aſſign two different ſtates of the ſame Church, the one in this World, compos'd of good and bad, externally holy in reſpect of all by vocation, and internally holy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſome in it by ſanctification; the other in the next World, where there ſhall be a ſeparation made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Sheep and the Goats, and all remaining in the Church, ſuch, as ſhall at once be perfectly holy and compleatly happy: This is that Church which Chriſt ſhall preſent to himſelf, glorious, not having ſpot or wrinkle or any ſuch thing, but holy and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemiſh.</p>
            <p>This being ſuppos'd, all that will be needful to ſay in anſwer to this Queſtion may be comprehended under theſe three Propoſitions:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That an external Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith is enough to qualifie a perſon to be admitted a Member of Chriſt's Church.</item>
               <item>2. That every ſuch Member has a right to all the external Priviledges of the Church, till by his continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in ſome notorious and ſcandalous ſins he has forfeited that right, and by the juſt cenſures of the Church he be
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94681:4"/>
for ſuch behaviour actually excluded from thoſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges.</item>
               <item>3. That ſome corrupt and ſcandalous Members re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Communion, through the want of the due exerciſe of diſcipline in it, or the negligence and conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Governours and Paſtors of it, gives no juſt cauſe to any to Separate from her.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I begin with the firſt; That an external Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This Profeſſion in grown and adult perſons is to be made by themſelves; Thus it was at the firſt erection of the Chriſtian Church, when Perſons by the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Miracles of the Apoſtles were converted from the <hi>Pagan</hi> Superſtition and <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith; they were to believe, and with the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi> to declare their belief, <note place="margin">Acts 8. 27.</note>
               <hi>I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Infants and Children not grown up to years of diſcretion, by their Parents and thoſe who at the requeſt of their Parents do together with them undertake for them. So great an intereſt and propriety have Parents in their Children, ſo intire an affection and concern for their good and happineſs, ſo unqueſtionable an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over them, ſo binding and obligatory are all their reaſonable commands upon them, that we have good grounds to believe, that they that are born of Chriſtian Parents will be brought up in the Chriſtian Religion, and at years of underſtanding take upon themſelves what their Parents and Sureties promis'd for them; and upon this account that profeſſion of Faith made by others at their Baptiſm in their behalf may in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable ſenſe be reckon'd as made by themſelves; ſo God accounted it in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Parents being in covenant with God,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94681:5"/>
were the Children of the <hi>Jews</hi> eſteem'd an holy Seed, and at eight days old admitted by Circumciſion into the ſame Church and Covenant with them; And the ſame reaſon holds for admitting Children born of Chriſtian Parents into the Chriſtian Church by the Rite of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which is the Sign and Seal of the Covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, as Circumciſion was of that under the Law. Now that this external profeſſion without any farther ſigns of ſaving grace is ground ſufficient for thoſe with whom God hath entruſted the Keys and Government of his Church to admit perſons into it, will appear from theſe particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is the qualification preſcrib'd by our Lord: he is the Head and Founder of his Church, to him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does it appertain to appoint the terms and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of admiſſion into it, and what theſe are, we may learn from that commiſſion he gave his Apoſtles when he ſent them out to gather a Church under him, <hi>viz.</hi> the becoming his Diſciples; <hi>Go ye therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt. <note place="margin">Matth. 28. 19.</note>Teach all</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Diſciple all <hi>Nations;</hi> Now a Diſciple is properly one, not that has already attain'd to the full knowledge and ſaving effects of the Goſpel, but only underſtands ſo much of it as to be willing to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Chriſtian Church, in order to his being far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught the one, and to have the other more through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought in him. Whether men are ſincere in their profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith and in their deſires to be admitted Members of Chriſt's Church, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this great Priviledge and Bleſſing of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberſhip will be effectual to produce in them that regeneration and new creature for which it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, the Paſtors and Governours of the Church
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94681:5"/>
cannot know; This their bare profeſſion and deſire is enough to give them a title to it and qualification for it. By this rule the Apoſtles of Chriſt walkt as to this particular, even when they liv'd with him here on earth and were under his immediate direction: <note place="margin">John 4. 2.</note>
               <hi>The Phariſees heard that Jeſus made and baptiz'd more Diſciples than</hi> John, <hi>tho' Jeſus himſelf did not baptize, but his Diſciples.</hi> Now if, as it was fam'd abroad, and is not in the Text contradicted, Jeſus's Diſciples bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd more than <hi>John,</hi> it follows that he baptiz'd more than were ſincere, when we read that ſo few, not above an hundred and twenty continued with him to the laſt.<note place="margin">Acts 1. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It appears from the Apoſtles practice afterwards in admitting perſons into the Church. Nothing but a profeſs'd willingneſs to receive the Goſpel, tho' they receiv'd it not from the heart, was requir'd by them, in order to it: The Text tells us, <note place="margin">Acts 2. 41.</note>
               <hi>that they that gladly receiv'd St.</hi> Peter<hi>'s words were baptiz'd, and the ſame day were added to the Cburch about</hi> 3000 <hi>ſouls;</hi> It's true, St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorted them all to repent in order to it, but whether they did ſo or no, he ſtay'd not for proof, from their bringing forth fruits worthy of repentance, but preſently upon their profeſt willing reception of the Word they were baptiz'd and added to the Church. One might have been apt to ſuſpect, that amongſt ſo great a number, all would not prove ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere converts, and ſo it fell out; <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 4. 34. Acts 5. 1, 2, 3.</note>were two of the number, in whom ye know, that glad reception of the Goſpel was found to be but groſs hypocriſie. By the ſame rule St. <hi>Philip</hi> proceeded in planting the Church at <hi>Samaria; </hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 8. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
               <hi>when the people ſeeing the miracles he did, gave heed to the doctrine he taught, concerning the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Name of Jeſus,</hi> and declar'd their belief of it, without
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94681:6"/>
any farther examination <hi>they were baptiz'd both men and women:</hi> And amongſt them was <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> whoſe former notorious Crimes of Sorcery, Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft and Blaſphemy, might have given juſt grounds of fear to the holy Deacon, that his Faith was but <note place="margin">Acts 8. 20.</note>hypocritical and his Heart not right in the ſight of God, as appear'd afterwards, yet upon his believing, <note place="margin">ver. 13.</note>he was baptiz'd; ſuch other Members of Chriſt's Church were <hi>Demas, Hymeneus,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> they had nothing, it ſeems, but a bare outward profeſſion of the Faith, to entitle them to that Priviledge, ſince afterwards, as we read, the one embrac'd this preſent World, and the other two made ſhipwrack of Faith and a good Conſcience.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 10. 1 Tim. 1. 19.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This appears from the repreſentation Chriſt hath made of his Church in the Goſpel, fore-inſtructing his Diſciples by many Parables, that it ſhould conſiſt of a mixture of good and bad. It is a field wherein wheat <note place="margin">Mat. 13, 24, 25.</note>and tares grow up together; A net wherein are fiſhes <note place="margin">ver. 47.</note>of all ſorts; A floor in which is laid up ſolid corn and <note place="margin">Matth. 3. 12.</note>light chaff; A vine on which are fruitful and barren <note place="margin">John 15. 1.</note>branches; A great houſe wherein are veſſels of gold <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 20.</note>and ſilver, and veſſels of leſſer value, wood and earth; A marriage feaſt, where are wiſe and fooliſh virgins, <note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note>ſome with wedding garments and ſome without, ſome had oyl and ſome but empty lamps; St. <hi>Hierome</hi>
               <note place="margin">St. Hier. dial. con. Lucifer. Arca Noae Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae typus.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it to <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, wherein were preſerv'd beaſts clean and unclean; when the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>They are not all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that are of</hi> Iſrael, his meaning was, that in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church many more were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd in the fleſh, than what were circumcis'd in heart; and when our Saviour ſaid, <note place="margin">Rom. 9, 6.</note>
               <hi>many are call'd, but few choſen,</hi> he declar'd the ſame thing, that in his Church many more were call'd and admitted
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94681:6"/>
into it by Baptiſm than what were ſanctified by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or ſhould be admitted into his Heaven.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The many corrupt and vicious Members in the Churches, which the Apoſtles themſelves had planted, is another proof of this; The number whereof, in all likelihood, could not have been ſo great, had they been ſo cautious and ſcrupulous as to admit none into them, but whom in their judgments they thought to be really holy. In the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 34. ver. 12. 2 Cor. 12. 20, 21. 1 Cor. 7.</note> there were many, that had not the knowledge of God, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the Reſurrection of the Dead, that came drunk to the Lord's Table, that were Fornicators, unclean and contentious Perſons. In the Church of <hi>Galatia</hi> there were many that nauſeated the Bread of Life, and made it their choice to pick and eat the rubbiſh of the partition wall, which Chriſt had demoliſht; The Rites of the Law which expired at the death of Chriſt, they attempted to pull out of their graves, and to give a reſurrection to them; They were ſo much gone off from the Doctrine of Chriſtianity, to weak and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly Rudiments, obſerving days and months, and <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 7, 10, 11.</note>times and years, that by reaſon of this their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſignifi'd his fears of quite loſing them, and that his labour was beſtowed upon them in vain.</p>
            <p>Amongſt all the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia</hi> there was not one but what had receiv'd ſuch Members into it, that were either very cold and lukewarm in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or by their vicious lives proved a reproach and ſcandal to it; The Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> ſo ſwarm'd with theſe, that St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that there were but <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 1, 4.</note>
               <hi>a few names in</hi> Sardis <hi>that had not defil'd their garments.</hi> Now if the Apoſtles of our Lord, who had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary aſſiſtances of the Holy Ghoſt, for the diſcerning of Spirits at that time, and were thereby
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94681:7"/>
enabl'd far beyond what any of their Succeſſors can pretend to, to diſtinguiſh betwixt the good and the bad, did notwithſtanding admit many meer formal Profeſſors into the Church of Chriſt, we may conclude that they apprehended that 'twas the will of Chriſt it ſhould be ſo.</p>
            <p n="5">5. No other rule in admitting perſons into the Church is practicable. Whether Perſons are really holy and truly regenerate or no, the Officers of Chriſt who know not the hearts of men, cannot make a certain judgment of, they may through want of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be deceiv'd, through the ſubtilty of hypocrites be impos'd upon, through humane frailty, paſſion or prejudice be miſguided, and by this means many times the door may be open'd to the bad, and ſhut againſt the good; Now that cannot be ſuppos'd to be a rule of Chriſt's appointment, which is either impoſſible to be obſerv'd, or in obſerving which the Governours of his Church cannot be ſecur'd from acting wrongfully and injuriouſly to men.</p>
            <p>In ſum, Chriſt hath entruſted the power of the Keys into the hands of an Order of Men whom he hath ſet over his Church, and who, under him, are to manage the Affairs of it, but theſe being but <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 7.</note>
               <hi>earthen veſſels,</hi> of ſhort and fallible underſtandings, he has not left the execution of their Office to be manag'd ſolely by their own prudence and diſcretion, but hath given them a certain publick Rule to go by, both in admitting perſons into his Church, and in excluding them out of it; for the one, the Rule is, open and ſolemn profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith; for the other, open and ſcandalous Offences, prov'd by witneſſes.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:94681:7"/>
               <hi>2. The ſecond Propoſition is,</hi> That every ſuch Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber has a right to all the external Priviledges of the Church, till by his continuance in ſome notorious and ſcandalous ſins he forfeits that right, and by the juſt cenſures of the Church for ſuch behaviour he be actually excluded from thoſe Priviledges.</p>
            <p>For the explanation and proof of this Propoſition, theſe three particulars are to be done: (1.) What's meant by external Priviledges? (2.) What kind of Offenders thoſe are that forfeit their right to them, and ought by the Cenſures of the Church to be excluded from them? (3.) Upon what the right of thoſe Members that have not ſo offended, is grounded?</p>
            <p n="1">1. What's meant by external Priviledges? As there are two ſorts of Members in Chriſt's viſible Church, ſo there are two ſorts of Priviledges that belong to them; each ſort having thoſe that are proper and peculiar to it, according to the nature of that relation they bear to the Head and their fellow Members.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are Members only by <hi>foederal</hi> or covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſs, ſuch as are only <hi>born of water,</hi> when by Baptiſm they were united to Chriſt and the Church, and took upon them the Profeſſion and Practice of the Chriſtian Religion; Now the Priviledges that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to theſe are of the ſame make with their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberſhip, external, and conſiſting only in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and publick Communion with the Church in the Word and Ordinances.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are Members by real and inherent holineſs, ſuch as are not <hi>only born of Water, but of the Spirit</hi> alſo, when by the inward operations of the Holy Ghoſt their Souls are renew'd after the Image of God, and made partakers of a Divine Nature; And the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94681:8"/>
Priviledges that belong to theſe, are not only the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned ones, but together with them, others that are ſutable to their more ſpiritual relation, inward, and ſuch as conſiſt in the eſpecial and particular care and protection of God, the pardon and remiſſion of their ſins by the Blood of Chriſt, and the gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and comforts of the Holy Ghoſt; All com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in that Prayer of the Apoſtle for his <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 13. 14.</note>
               <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghoſt be with you all. Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now 'tis of the firſt ſort of Members, and that ſort of Priviledges that belong to them, that the Propoſition is to be underſtood.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What kind of Offenders thoſe are that have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their right to, and ought by the Cenſures of the Church to be excluded from thoſe Priviledges? This the Apoſtle hath plainly told us, and our own Church in its Exhortation to the Sacrament fairly intimates: <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 11.</note>
               <hi>I have wrote unto you,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, not to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, if any man that is call'd a Brother, be a Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, or an Extortioner, no, not to eat;</hi> Not only, as <note place="margin">ver. 10.</note>much as can be, to have no familiar converſation with him in civil matters (tho' ſome muſt be had whilſt we are in this World) but alſo, and more eſpecially to avoid communion with him in religious exerciſes; and how that is to be done, the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>viz.</hi> not by forſaking the Church our ſelves, but by doing our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt endeavours to have him caſt out of it: So it follows, <note place="margin">ver. 13.</note>
               <hi>Therefore put away from among your ſelves that wicked perſon.</hi> And, <hi>In the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">ver. 4, 5.</note>
               <hi>when ye are gathered together, and my ſpirit, with the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to deliver ſuch an one unto Satan for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:94681:8"/>
               <hi>may be ſav'd in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Agreeable hereunto are the words of the Exhortation, <hi>If any of you be a blaſphemer of God, a hinderer and ſlanderer of his Word, an Adulterer, or be in malice or envy, or in any other grievous crime, repent you of your ſins, or come not to that holy Table.</hi> Such ſinners as theſe have in a manner undone and made void what was done in their behalf in Baptiſm; They, by not performing what was then promis'd for them, but living directly contrary to it, do virtually renounce that Covenant they then entred into with God in Chriſt, and fall back again into the ſtate of <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Infidels;</hi> Their Sureties engag'd for them, that they ſhould believe the Chriſtian Faith, keep God's Commandments, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the World, the Fleſh and the Devil; But ſuch habitual notorious Offenders as theſe ſay by their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, what had they to do to undertake ſuch things for us, we will ſtand to no ſuch engagements, but we will be at large, to believe what we pleaſe, and to practice what we fancy, and to worſhip whom we think fit; And thus as it were breaking off from being in Covenant with God, and virtually renouncing their Church-memberſhip, they at the ſame time loſe all right and title to thoſe Bleſſings and Priviledges that were due to them upon the account thereof; and in this ſad ſtate and condition did the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians reckon all, that had highly and notoriouſly ſinn'd, amongſt whom eſpecially were the lapſed that had offer'd Sacrifice; they ſtaid not for a formal Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to be pronounc'd againſt them by the Church, but lookt upon them as <hi>ipſo facto</hi> excommunicate; and tho' till that was paſt they could not actually be ſhut out, yet they began before to avoid their company, and to forbear all religious commerce towards them. But ſo long as men keep in covenant with God, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:94681:9"/>
abide in his Church, which may be done by holding that profeſſion of Faith that they made at their firſt entrance into it, their right to the external franchiſes of it remains inviolable, and their title without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. As may appear from theſe particulars,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the Tenour of that Covenant they in their Baptiſm enter'd into with God; which conſiſts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes on God's part, as well as Conditions on mans. The Promiſes on God's part, are expreſt in theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral words,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 61.</note> 
               <hi>I will be their God;</hi> The Conditions on mans, in thoſe, <hi>and they ſhall be my People:</hi> Now ſo far as men perform the Conditions, ſo far will God make good his Promiſes; In what ſenſe they are People to God, in the ſame he'll be a God unto them. If a bare <hi>faederal</hi> holineſs can give men a relation to God, and God upon that account owns them to be a people unto him, the ſame gives them ſome kind of intereſt in God, and a claim to the bleſſings that belong to that relation; Not, that ſuch Members as theſe are to expect thoſe ſpecial and particular favours that are the portion of thoſe that are more nearly and by a kind of ſpiritual conſanguinity allied to God in Chriſt, but yet being of God's houſhold, are to be allowed the liberty to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of thoſe external bleſſings which he in common beſtows upon the whole family.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the nature of Church-memberſhip. Church-memberſhip neceſſarily implies Church-Communion, or elſe it ſignifies nothing; for to be admitted a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Church, and not to have a right in common with the reſt to Church-Priviledges, is to be taken in with one hand, and to be thrown out with the other, 'tis to be put back into the ſtate of thoſe that are no Members, and virtually to be cut off from the Body, by being denied all communications with it; Should a man be admitted a Member of any City or Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94681:9"/>
and yet at the ſame time be denied the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his freedom, and not be permitted to ſet up a Trade, to give a Vote, or to act in any other caſe, as other Members do, what would be the difference betwixt him and a Foreigner? unleſs it be, that his condition is the worſe, by being mock'd, and abus'd, and cheated with the Name, whilſt he has nothing of the Priviledges of a Freeman.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have the Practice of the Church of God in the Old Teſtament for this; The whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> were not only permittted, but commanded by God, except in caſes of legal uncleanneſs and thoſe notorious crimes for which they were to be caſt out of the Congregation, to obſerve his Ordinances and to joyn in the celebration of his publick Worſhip, <hi>and we know they were not all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that were of</hi> Iſrael; Three times a year were <note place="margin">Exod. 23. 14, 17.</note>
               <hi>all their males to appear before the Lord, to keep three ſolemn appointed feaſts unto him;</hi> many of which, it is to be fear'd, had no other quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, than what they were beholden to their birth and the loſs of their fore-skin for; Again, All the <note place="margin">Exod. 12. 44.</note>
               <hi>congregation of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were to keep the paſſover,</hi> none were denied it <hi>but foreigners and hired ſervants,</hi> and they too no longer but till they were circumcis'd, and thereby admitted into covenant with God, which ſhews that meer circumciſion was enough to put a man into a capacity of communicating with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in its moſt ſolemn and ſacred Myſteries.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This was alſo the Practice of the Chriſtian Church in the Apoſtolick Age; as is plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated unto us from many Scriptures; St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13.</note>
               <hi>by one ſpirit we are all baptiz'd into one body, whether</hi> Jews <hi>or</hi> Gentiles, <hi>bond or free, and have been all made to drink into one ſpirit. To drink into one ſpirit,</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly relates to the Cup in the Lord's Supper, and by a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94681:10"/>
figure of the part for the whole, it's put to ſignifie the whole Communion; but the thing here eſpecially to be taken notice of, is, that the Apoſtle makes the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe that receiv'd the Lord's Supper to be as comprehenſive and univerſal, as that of thoſe that were receiv'd into the Church by Baptiſm; <hi>As by one ſpirit</hi> all <hi>were baptiz'd into one body, ſo</hi> all <hi>were made to drink into one ſpirit.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks the ſame thing again in another place, alluding to the other part of the Sacrament, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10, 17.</note>
               <hi>We being many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are one bread and one body, for we are all partakers of one bread;</hi> all the members that conſpired to make up the one body, did partake of the one bread; But if any thing yet can be clearer, 'tis that account St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives us of the practice of the firſt Chriſtian Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where it's ſaid of the three thouſand that gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s words, and were by Baptiſm added to the Church, <hi>they,</hi> all the three thouſand, <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> being of the number, <hi>continued in the Apoſtles doctrine, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. From the end of Church-memberſhip; which is not only for the more ſolemn Worſhip of God, and the publick profeſſion of Religion, but alſo for the more effectual edification and ſalvation of mens ſouls; By Baptiſm we were admitted into the Church, incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into that Divine Society, and entitled to all the Priviledges of the Goſpel, to the end, <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 13.</note>
               <hi>that in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God, we might come to a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt;</hi> But how this is to be attain'd without being admitted to all the Acts and Offices of Communion with the Church, to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Prayers and Sacraments and the Word, and all other Priviledges and Duties, is not eaſily to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94681:10"/>
be underſtood; hence, we may obſerve, that edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scripture is uſually applied to the Church, and tho' the edification of the Church conſiſts in the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the particular Members of it, yet becauſe that is not to be had but in the Unity and Communion of the Church, 'tis uſually ſtiled, the <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 12.</note>
               <hi>edifying of the Church,</hi> and <hi>the edifying the body of Chriſt;</hi> hence Faith is ſaid <hi>to come by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God;</hi> Hence we are ſaid <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17. 1 Pet. 1. 23.</note>
               <hi>to be born again, not of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever;</hi> The ſame is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in thoſe words of our Saviour's Prayer for his Diſciples, <note place="margin">John 17. 17.</note>
               <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth, thy Word is truth.</hi> God's Church is his Family, which he eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially takes care of and provides for, he that is of it is under the <hi>Schechina,</hi> the wing of the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and his ſpecial grace and providence; It cannot but be of mighty advantage towards our growth and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in all Chriſtian graces and virtues, to have therein diſpens't to us the lively Oracles of God, and proviſion made for a conſtant ſucceſſion of diſpenſers of the Bread of Life, to fit it to all needs and all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities; Not to be left to the deceits and whiſpers of a private ſpirit, to perſonal conjectures or ſecret inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations, but to have the publick Doctrine of the Church, to be our Guide and Leader; to have our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions mingled with the concurrent Prayers of all God's people, and ſo by their joynt forces, after an <note place="margin">Coimus in cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum &amp; ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um quaſi manu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fact a precatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus ambia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus orantes, <hi>Tertul.</hi>
               </note>humble, but powerful manner, to beſiege and beleaguer Heaven; to have before our eyes all the great Examples in God's Church, to have our Faith ſtrengthen'd, our Repentance heighten'd, our Love inflam'd, our Hopes and our Comforts rais'd by the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; Will not the flame of others kindle our zeal and affections? and will it not put us into a tranſport
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94681:11"/>
of devotion, to ſee therein Chriſt crucified before our eyes, pouring out his Blood for us, bowing his Head as it were to kiſs, and ſtretching out his Arms as it were to embrace all that are penitent and return to him? Theſe are ſome of the great Bleſſings and Advantages that cannot be had but in Church-Communion; To which, if we ſhall add<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that our improvement in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and virtue is more to be aſcrib'd to the internal operations of God's ſpirit, than any virtue or efficacy there can be in thoſe external adminiſtrations, that God is pleas'd to promiſe his ſpirit to believers only as they are Members of his Church, and no otherwiſe than by the uſe and miniſtry of his Word and Sacraments, we ſhall farther ſee the neceſſity of mens holding actual Communion with the Church in order to their ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>We are not now diſcourſing what God can or will do in ſome extraordinary caſes, when Communion with a true viſible Church cannot be had, as in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Apoſtacy of the Church, or Perſecution for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or unjuſt Excommunication; but what is God's ordinary method and means of bringing men to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that he himſelf tells us is by adding them to the Church; <note place="margin">Acts 2. 47.</note>
               <hi>and the Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved;</hi> To this purpoſe we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not only in general, that whatever Chriſt did and ſuffered for Mankind, 'twas for them as incorporated into a Church; <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Do not all the Members of Chriſt's Church that come to the bleſſed Sacrament, having not the power of Godlineſs, as well as the Form, come unworthily and to their own great ſin and danger, no leſs than <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 27, 29.</note>
               <hi>being</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:94681:12"/>
               <hi>guilty of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and eating and drinking their own damnation?</hi> And can they have a right to that they are ſo unworthy of? In doing which they ſin ſo hainouſly? and for doing which they ſhall be puniſhed ſo ſeverely?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer theſe two things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. All, even the beſt men, in a ſtrict, legal ſenſe, are unworthy, and that even of common mercies from God, much more of this prime Duty and Priviledge of Chriſtianity. <note place="margin">Pſal. 39. 5.</note>
               <hi>Every man in his beſt eſtate is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thervanity: </hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 39. 5.</note>
               <hi>We are all an unclean thing, and our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is as filthy rags:</hi> The meaning is, all men are ſinners, and their beſt ſervices imperfect and impure; But then, the right they have to this Priviledge does not depend on their own merit and worth, but, as was ſaid before, on the promiſe of God, when they enter'd at firſt into covenant with him, whereby he was pleas'd to oblige himſelf to be their God ſo far, and ſo long, as they continued to be his people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe Members that we have aſſerted to have a right to the external Priviledges of Chriſt's Church are not guilty of that unworthineſs St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, the ſin and danger whereof is ſo great; and this will appear by the deſcription he gives of thoſe unworthy Communicants:</p>

They diſcern'd not the Lord's body; <hi>he that eats this bread, and drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily, is guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt;</hi> how? <hi>not diſcerning the Lord's body.</hi> It may be, they did eat it ſtill, as a part of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Paſſover, they underſtood not the nature of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what it did repreſent, or for what end it was inſtituted, being ignorant of the infinite value and merit of Chriſt's blood, not at all affected with the greatneſs of his love, nor wrought upon by the infiniteneſs of his mercy, and altogether as void of any ſincere affection and gratitude

to Chriſt for that mighty redemption he wrought for mankind, as the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Pagan,</hi> that neither know nor believe in him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They were open and ſcandalous ſinners; The Apoſtle charges them with Schiſms and Diviſions, <note place="margin">18, 21, 22, ver.</note>pride and contempt of their brethren, ſenſuality and drunkenneſs; In thoſe early days of Chriſtianity, the Lord's Supper was uſually uſher'd in with a Love-feaſt that was eaten juſt before it, but ſo unchriſtian were theſe <hi>Corinthians, that every one took before other his own Supper,</hi> they run into parties, and tho' they had not yet left the place, they refus'd to communicate at the ſame time with their brethren, The rich deſpis'd and excluded the poor, that came not ſo well provided as they, from their feaſt, and that which was yet an higher aggravation of their ſin, the poor were hungry, whilſt the rich fed and pamper'd their bodies to exceſs and luxury: <hi>When ye come together,</hi> ſays he, <hi>this is not to eat the Lord's Supper,</hi> this is no fit preparation for it, <hi>for in eating every one takes before other his own ſupper, and one is hungry, and another is drunken:</hi> ſuch Swine as theſe ought not indeed to come to the Holy Table of our Lord, and ſuch as theſe, as I ſaid, in the beginning of my Diſcourſe on this Propoſition, have forfeited their right to it, and ought by the Cenſures of the Church, to be excluded; This indeed is to be unworthy with a witneſs, <hi>to be guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt,</hi> or as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſometimes words it in the caſe of Apoſtacy and other hainous ſins, <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 6.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94681:13"/>
what could ſuch perſons expect, but that God would vindicate the honour of his own Son and the infinitely wiſe contrivance of the redemption of the World by his great undertaking in ſome remarkable way upon them, either in this World, by Temporal Judgments, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 30.</note>
               <hi>for this cauſe many are weak and ſickly amongſt you, and many ſleep;</hi> or in the next, without repentance, by their Eternal Damnation?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Members of Chriſt's Body that come to this bleſſed Sacrament and are deſtitute of ſaving grace, tho' they make a fair profeſſion and are free from ſcandalous ſins, are yet in an unconverted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this Sacrament is not a converting, but a confirming Ordinance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Converſion may be taken in a two-fold ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For turning men from a ſtate of open infidelity to the profeſſion of the Chriſtian Faith, and indeed till men are in this ſenſe converted, they are not to be admitted to the Sacrament; neither <hi>Jews</hi> nor <hi>Turks,</hi> nor any others in a ſtate of <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> till by Baptiſm they are receiv'd into Chriſt's Church and make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his Name, can come to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Taking converſion, for the turning of thoſe who are already baptiz'd and do profeſs Chriſt's Religion, from the evil of their ways to a ſerious and hearty practice of holineſs and virtue, and ſo this Sacrament is a converting Ordinance. And indeed I do not know any more forceable Arguments to an holy life than what are therein repreſented to us: What can more work upon ingenuous ſpirits, than the diſcovery of ſuch undeſerv'd love and kindneſs? Is it not enough to melt the moſt frozen heart into floods of tears and joy, to behold therein the bleſſed Jeſus ſhedding his blood to reconcile ſinners unto God? What can more powerfully
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94681:13"/>
captivate the moſt rebellious ſpirits into obedience, than the aſſurance of a pardon of their paſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by that full propitiatory Sacrifice of the Son of God? What can more effectually fright men from ſin and folly, than the infinite diſpleaſure of God declared therein againſt all iniquity? How accurſed a thing is ſin, will the conſidering Communicant ſay, that the bleſſed Jeſus, who did but take ſin upon him, was made a Curſe for it! What a mighty evil muſt ſin needs be, when nothing could be ſufficient to expiate it, but the Blood of God! What an unſpeakable malignity muſt ſin have in it, when it laid on the ſhoulders of Omnipotency ſuch a load of wrath, as made him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and ſweat and grone and die! Again, Here we repeat our baptiſmal Vow to God, ſolemnly engage our ſelves afreſh to be his faithful ſervants, and bind our ſelves by a new Oath, to be true to the Covenant we have made with him, and certainly that man muſt have a mighty love for Sin and Death, that can break through all theſe Bonds and Obligations to come at it.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3. The third Propoſition;</hi> That ſome corrupt and ſcandalous Members remaining in the Communion of the Church, through the want of the due exerciſe of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in it, or the negligence and connivance of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Governours of it, gives no juſt Cauſe for any to ſeparate from her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gives no juſt Cauſe;</hi> That which is chiefly pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is, That the viciouſneſs of thoſe Members do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive a ſtain and defilement on the whole Aſſembly, and pollute the Worſhip of God to others, as well as to themſelves. Here therefore I ſhall ſhew what is to be done by us that we be no way acceſſary to others
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94681:14"/>
ſins, and then, upon that condition, that we cannot be polluted by their ſinful company. Now many things are to be done by good men who are to joyn in mixt Aſſemblies that the Communion receive no prejudice by the corruption of ſome of its Members.</p>
            <p>They are frequently to exhort and adviſe them; for this end are we plac'd in the communion of Saints, and tho' to inſtruct the Flock God hath appointed a whole Order of Men on purpoſe, yet is it alſo the Duty of every private Chriſtian in his place and calling, <note place="margin">Heb. 3. 13. Heb. 10. 24.</note>
               <hi>to exhort one another daily, whilſt it is call'd to day; to conſider one another, to provoke unto love and to good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are prudently and with much affection to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh and reprove them; we muſt not be ſo rudely civil as to ſuffer ſin to lie upon them without diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance;ſo runs the Precept,<note place="margin">Lev. 19. 17.</note>
               <hi> Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thy heart, but thou ſhalt rebuke thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not ſuffer ſin to be upon him: and if any man be overtaken in a fault, </hi>ſays the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note>
               <hi> ye that are ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch an one in the ſpirit of meekneſs, conſidering that thou alſo may'ſt be tempted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are to bewail their ſins, and to pray for their reformation; this is the true ſpirit and temper of a good man, he cannot ſee God diſhonour'd, his Laws trampled upon, his Brother wilfully undoing himſelf, but he muſt be deeply touch'd and affected with it; <hi>Rivers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter run down my eyes,</hi> ſays the Pſalmiſt, <hi>becauſe men keep not thy law;</hi> And when in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s time the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, both Prieſts and People, were very much corrupted, the Holy Ghoſt gives it as the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mark of <hi>the faithful</hi> and upright, not that they ſeparated,  <note place="margin">Ezek. 9. 4.</note>
               <hi>but ſighed and cryed for all the abominations that were done in her.</hi> Of the ſame holy frame and diſpoſition of mind was St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he could not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

thoſe in the Church at <hi>Philippi,</hi> who, whilſt they profeſt Chriſtianity, ſhew'd themſelves by their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality and earthly-mindedneſs to be enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, without ſorrow and tears; <hi>Of whom,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 18.</note> 
               <hi>I have told you often, and now tell you weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they are enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, whoſe God is their belly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>They are to avoid, as much as they can, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, eſpecially all familiarity with them; and tho' in order to their conviction and reformation, and in ſuch caſes where neceſſary buſineſs requires it, and the publick Worſhip of God can't be perform'd but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with ſuch perſons, I may be in their company without blame; yet in all other caſes, I am to ſhew my diſlike and abhorrence of their ſins, by ſhunning their ſociety. <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3. 14.</note>
               <hi>If any man obey not our Word by this Epiſtle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be aſham'd.</hi> Again ſays the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>I wrote to you in an Epiſtle, not to keep company, if any man be a fornicator, or an idolater—or, &amp;c. with ſuch an one, no, not to eat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If private and often repeated Admonitions by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or before one or two more, will not do, they are then to tell the Church of them, that by its more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reproofs the ſcandalous Member may be reclaim'd, or by its juſt Cenſures be cut off from the Communion. <note place="margin">Matth. 18. 17.</note>
               <hi>If he ſhall neglect to hear them, tell it to the Church.</hi> Our Church hath given every Miniſter of a Pariſh <note place="margin">Rubr. before the Commun.</note>power to refuſe all ſcandalous and notorious ſinners from the Lord's Supper, and as ſlack and as much diſus'd as Diſcipline is amongſt us, were ſuch perſons more generally inform'd againſt and complain'd of, they would not find it ſo eaſie a matter to continue in their offences and the Church together.</p>

You ſee by what means the Church may either be clear'd in ſome meaſure of ſuch publick Offenders, or the Members of it, together with the Ordinances of God ſecur'd from infection by their fellowſhip. By this did the Primitive Chriſtians ſhew their Zeal for their Religion, as well as by ſuffering for it; They were infinitely careful to keep the honour of their Religion unſpotted, and the Communion of the Church as much out of danger, as they could, from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant influence of bad examples; for this reaſon they watch'd over one another, told them privately of their faults, and when that would not do, brought them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the cognizance of the Church; And tho' lapſing into Idolatry in times of perſecution was the common ſin that for ſome Ages chiefly exerciz'd the Diſcipline of the Church, yet all Offences againſt the Chriſtian Law, all Vices and Immoralities that were either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in themſelves, or made known and prov'd to the Church, came alſo under the Eccleſiaſtical Rod, and were put to open ſhame and pennance; this was that Diſcipline that preſerv'd their Manners ſo uncorrupt, and made their Religion ſo renown'd and triumphant <note place="margin">Preface to the Comminat.</note>in the World; and how happy would it be for us in this looſe and degenerate Age, (as our own Church expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes her wiſhes and deſires) were it again in its due force and vigour reſtored and reſettled amongſt us.</p>
            <p>But, if after all imaginable care and endeavour by private Chriſtians, ſome ſcandalous Members, through the defects of Power in the Diſcipline, or of Care and Watchfulneſs in Governours, ſhould remain in the Church, whatever pollution thoſe whoſe Office it is <note place="margin">Tit. 3. laſt.</note>
               <hi>to rebuke with all Authority,</hi> may draw on themſelves by ſuffering it, private Members, that are no way, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by conſent, nor councel, nor excuſe, acceſſary to

Or <hi>Elkanah</hi> and <hi>Hannah</hi> from <hi>Eli</hi>'s debauch'd Sons when at <hi>Shilo</hi> they worſhipt together? The good and bad indeed communicate together, but in what? not in ſin, but in their common duty; and tho' to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with ſin is ſin, yet to communicate with a ſinner in that which is not ſin can be none; Communion is a common union, many partaking of one thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they do agree, now the common union of the good and bad in the Church is not in evil, but in hearing of the Word, in receiving of the Sacrament and in other holy Ordinances and Exerciſes; when therefore ſome do evil, the communion in ſpiritual things is not polluted, becauſe evil is no part of the union in common one with another, but the error of man by himſelf, out of the Communion, which he himſelf, and they only that have been partakers with him in it, ſhall anſwer for.</p>

Thoſe legal pollutions did not defile the whole communion, but only thoſe particular perſons whom the unclean perſon touch'd, for (1.) there was no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice appointed for any ſuch pollution as came upon all for the ſin of ſome few. (2.) Tho' the Prophets many times reproved the Prieſts for not ſeparating <note place="margin">Jer. 15. 10. Ezek. 22. 26.</note>
               <hi>the clean from the unclean, the precious from the vile, the holy from the prophane,</hi> yet did they never teach, that becauſe the unclean came into the Congregation through the neglect of their duty, the whole Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was polluted by it; but as many as touch'd the unclean perſon were unclean, ſo as many as have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with the wicked in their ſins are polluted by it; to partake with men in their ſins in a moral ſenſe anſwers to the legal touching an unclean thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When it's ſaid that the unclean perſon, that did not purifie himſelf, <hi>defil'd the Tabernacle and polluted the Sanctuary,</hi> the meaning is, that he did ſo to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but not to others; ſo does a wicked man, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God, in reſpect of himſelf, but not of others: The Prayers of the wicked, tho' join'd with thoſe of the Church, are an abomination unto God, whilſt at the ſame time the Prayers of good men go up as a ſweet ſmelling ſavour and are accepted by him; The perſon that comes unworthily to the Sacrament of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94681:17"/>
Lord's Supper, eats and drinks judgment to himſelf, but that hinders not but that thoſe who at the ſame time come better prepared may do it to their own eternal comfort and ſalvation: <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 15.</note>
               <hi>To the pure all things are pure, but to them that are defil'd and unbelieving is nothing pure, but even their mind and conſcience is defil'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The weakneſs of this ſuggeſtion, that the whole Communion and the Ordinances of God are polluted by the wicked mans company at and among them, being laid open; The truth of the Propoſition may be ſarther evinc'd from theſe particulars:</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the example of God's People in the Church of the <hi>Jews;</hi> We do not find that the ſins either of the Prieſts or the People became at any time an occaſion of ſeparation to them; What ſins could be greater than thoſe of <hi>Eli</hi>'<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s Sons? What higher aggravations could there be of ſin? Whether we conſider the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the perſons that ſinn'd, being the High-Prieſts Sons, or the publick ſcandal and impudence of the ſin, <hi>Lying with the women before the door of the Tabernacle;</hi> yet did not the People of God, not <hi>Elkanah</hi> and <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> by name, refrain to come up to <hi>Shilo</hi> and to joyn with them in the publick Worſhip: nay, they are ſaid to <hi>tranſgreſs</hi> who refus'd to come, tho' they refus'd out of abhorrence and deteſtation to the wickedneſs of thoſe men; <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 17, 24.</note>
               <hi>They abhorr'd the ſacrifices of the Lord; ye make the Lord's people to tranſgreſs:</hi> In <hi>Ahab</hi>'s time, when almoſt all <hi>Iſrael</hi> were Idolaters and <hi>halted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and</hi> Baal, yet then did the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> ſummon all <hi>Iſrael</hi> to appear on Mount <hi>Carmel,</hi> and held a religious communion with them in Preaching and Praying and offering a miraculous Sacrifice; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the ſeven thouſand that had kept themſelves
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94681:17"/>
upright and not bowed their knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> abſent themſelves becauſe of the Idolatry of the reſt, but they all came and join'd in that publick Worſhip per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the Prophet: <note place="margin">1 King. 18. 39.</note>
               <hi>All the people fell on their faces, ſaying, the Lord he is God, the Lord he is God.</hi> All along the Old Teſtament, when both Prince and Prieſts and People were very much deprav'd and debauch'd in their manners, we do not find that the Prophets at any time exhorted the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſincere to ſeparate, or that they themſelves ſet up any ſeparate meetings, but continued in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church, preaching to them and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to repentance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the example of God's People in the New Teſtament; In the Apoſtolick Churches of <hi>Corinth, Galatia,</hi> and the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> many of the Members were grown very bad and ſcandalous, yet do we not read of the example of any good man ſeparating from the Church, or any ſuch Precept from the Apoſtles ſo to do; They do not tell them that the whole body was polluted by thoſe filthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and that, if they would be ſafe themſelves, they muſt withdraw from their communion, but exhort them to uſe all means to reclaim them, and if neither private nor publick Admonitions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs would do, then to ſuſpend them from the Communion of the Church, till by repentance and amendment they render'd themſelves capable of being reſtored to peace and pardon; The Spirit of God in the Second of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſends his Inſtructions to the Angels, that is, to the Biſhops of thoſe ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> (whoſe Office it was) to Preach repentance to them, and by their authority, to reform
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94681:18"/>
abuſes, but gives them no command to ceaſe the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Adminiſtrations, or to adviſe the unpolluted part to ſeparate from the reſt; nay, altho' thoſe Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks were very foul, yet was our Lord pleas'd ſtill to bear with them, and <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 1.</note>
               <hi>to walk in the midſt of them;</hi> and certainly ſo long as Chriſt affords his preſence in a Church, none of its Members ought to withdraw theirs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From our Saviour's own example, who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> in his time was a moſt corrupt Church, and the Members of it very leud and vicious, yet kept in communion with it, and commanded his Diſciples ſo to do: We read that the Scribes and Phariſees, who rul'd the Eccleſiaſtical Chair at that time, <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 6, 7, 8.</note>
               <hi>had perverted the law, corrupted the worſhip of God, were blind guides, devoured widows houſes, were hypocrites and ſuch as only had a form of godlineſs,</hi> yet did not our Saviour ſeparate from their Communion; but was made under the Law, freely ſubjected himſelf to all the Rites and Ceremonies of it, he was circumcis'd on the eighth <note place="margin">Luke 2. 22.</note>day, redeem'd by a certain price, being a Son and a Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, obſerv'd their Paſsover and other Feaſts enjoin'd <note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note>by their Law, yea, and that of the dedication too, tho' but of humane inſtitution, was baptiz'd amongſt them, <note place="margin">John 17. 37.</note>preach'd in their Temples and Synagogues, reaſon'd with them about Religion, exhorted his Diſciples to <note place="margin">John 10. 24. Mat. 10. 6, 7.</note>hear their Doctrine, tho' not to follow their Practice; What greater cauſe on the account of corruption in manners could be given to ſeparate from a Church, than was here? yet how careful was our Saviour both by his Example and Precept, to forbid and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance it; <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 7.</note>

4. From the Apoſtle's expreſs command to hold communion with the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the many and great immoralities that were amongſt the Members of it; <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 12, 13. 1 Cor. 3. 3. 1 Cor. 5. 1.</note>
               <hi>There were Schiſms and contentions amongſt them, ſtrifes and envyings, fornication and inceſt, eating at the Idols table, and coming not ſo ſoberly as became them to the table of our Lord;</hi> yet does the Apoſtle not only not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to ſeparate, but approves their meeting together, and exhorts them to continue it, <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 4. 1 Cor. 11. 18.</note>
               <hi>
                  <hi>But let</hi> a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup;</hi> In which words the Apoſtle plainly ſolves the Caſe I am diſcourſing on, and ſhews what private Chriſtians, in whoſe power it is not judicially to correct Vice, are to do, when they ſee ſo many vicious Members intruding to the bleſſed Sacrament; <hi>viz.</hi> not to abſtain from it, but by preparation and examination of themſelves to take care that they be not of their number; If to ſeparate, had been the way, the Apoſtle would then have manag'd his Diſcourſe after this manner, There are many Schiſms and Strifes in the Church, there is an inceſtuous perſon not caſt out, many proud contemners of their Brethren, men of ſtrange opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, of untam'd appetites, and unbridled paſſions, and therefore I adviſe you not to come amongſt them, nor to partake of the holy Sacrament with them, leſt you be infected with their Sores, and partake of their Judgments; But adviſing men to examine themſelves, and then to come, he plainly intimates, that 'twas their duty to continue in the Communion of the Church notwithſtanding theſe; as if he had ſaid, I do not mention the foul Enormities
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:94681:19"/>
of ſome that come to this holy Table, to diſcourage you from coming, leſt ye ſhould be polluted by their ſins, but to excite you to a due care and examination of your ſelves, that you be not polluted by any ſinful acts and compliances of your own, and then there's no danger of being defil'd by theirs.</p>
            <p>But as clear and ſatisfactory as this Propoſition ſeems to be, it yet ſuffers very much from the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſome weak underſtandings, who meeting often in Scripture with ſuch Commands and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as theſe, <hi>to ſeparate, to come out, not to touch, to have no fellowſhip with,</hi> and the like, preſently, without ſtaying to examine the ſenſe of the Texts, conclude, that it is the duty and character of good men to be always ſeparating; and tho' wherever thoſe places of Scripture are found, they are for the moſt part to be underſtood with relation to Idolaters and Idolatrous Practices, either amongſt <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> yet will they have them extended to every thing and perſon that either really is, or they think fit to call, a corruption or a corrupt Member in the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Many Texts of Scripture are miſunderſtood and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appli'd by them to this purpoſe; I ſhall inſtance only in two as the chief, and hope in reſcuing them from the falſe gloſſes they labour under, to give a deliverance to all the reſt. The firſt is,</p>
            <p> 
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. Thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 17.</note>
               <hi>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:94681:19"/>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This being the main place to which they fly upon all occaſions as their ſtrongeſt hold, I ſhall give it a more particular conſideration, and that by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe three things; (1.) The occaſion of this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical admonition. (2.) What were the perſons the converted <hi>Corinthians</hi> were to ſeparate from. (3.) What was the unclean thing they were not to touch.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What was the occaſion of this Apoſtolical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. To this purpoſe you muſt know that the converted <hi>Corinthians</hi> liv'd in civil Society amongſt the unbelieving <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by whom many of them being their kinsfolk and friends after the fleſh, were often <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 27.</note>invited to their Idol-feaſts, to which ſome of them did not ſcruple to go and eat of the things ſacrific'd to <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 10.</note>Idols, even in the Idol's Temple, thinking it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to do ſo, ſo long as they knew that an Idol was nothing, and did not intentionally go and eat in any honour to the Idol. Now from this Practice the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 4.</note>Apoſtle diſſuades them by theſe two Arguments; (1.) Upon the account of ſcandal to their weak bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, telling them that tho' they that were ſtrong, knew that an Idol was nothing in the World, and that there was but one God, and ſo could not be ſuppos'd to worſhip the Idol when they eat of the Idol's ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; yet ſome other weak Chriſtians and new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts might not know ſo much, and conſequently by their practice might be drawn into ſin, not only to go to thoſe Feaſts, but to do it in honour to the Idol. (2.) As <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 7.</note>harmleſs an action as they eſteem'd it, that 'twas plain Idolatry; <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 14.</note>
               <hi>Be not ye Idolaters, as were ſome of them, as it is written, they ſate down to eat and to</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:94681:20"/>
               <hi>drink, and roſe up to play;</hi> that is, they eat of thoſe <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 6.</note>Sacrifices that had been offer'd up to the golden Calf; and that this Action was idolatrous, he proves by an Analogy it bears to a Rite of the ſame nature, both amongſt <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> for as the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they feaſted on the Sacrifices, did it in honour <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 18.</note>to God, to whom the Sacrifices were offer'd, and as the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> when they partake of the Lord's <note place="margin">ver. 16.</note>Supper, do it in honour to Chriſt, whoſe Death and Paſſion is therein commemorated, ſo when they did eat of the Idols Sacrifices, they muſt have been thought to do it in honour to the Idol, becauſe to <note place="margin">ver. 20.</note>the Idol was the Sacrifice offer'd. But, bleſſed be God, we have not the like occaſion for ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, we live not in a civil ſociety with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, but under a Chriſtian Prince, and with a People profeſſing the Chriſtian Religion; Here are no publick Idols ſet up, nor any Feaſts kept in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of them; Had the Caſe been thus with us, we had been as much concern'd in the Text as the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were, but being far otherwiſe, not the leaſt aid can be fetcht from hence, to defend Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from our Publick Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Who were the perſons the Chriſtian <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> were requir'd to ſeparate from: They were no better than <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers,</hi> than <hi>Infidels,</hi> than <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 14. ver. 15. ver. 16.</note>
               <hi>What fellowſhip hath righteouſneſs with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs? And what communion hath light with darkneſs? And what concord hath Chriſt with</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial? <hi>Or what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel? And what agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols?</hi> And then it follows, <note place="margin">ver. 17.</note>
               <hi>wherefore come out from amongſt them,</hi> &amp;c. But now becauſe Chriſtians,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94681:20"/>
by the Apoſtles command were to ſeparate from the Aſſemblies of <hi>Heathen</hi> Idolaters, does it therefore follow that they muſt ſeparate from the Aſſemblies of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe ſome, who while they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt, do not live like <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> afford their preſence at them? Is there no difference betwixt a <hi>Pagan</hi> and an Infidel, that denies Chriſt and worſhips Devils, and an immoral <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who yet outwardly owns Chriſt and worſhips the true God? Betwixt a Church wholly made up of <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and a Church made up of a mixture of good and bad <hi>Chriſtians</hi> together?</p>
            <p n="3">3. What is the unclean thing they are not to touch; <hi>viz.</hi> the unclean and abominable Practices that were us'd by the Heathens in the Worſhip of their Gods. It's call'd by the Apoſtle in another place, <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11.</note>
               <hi>the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful works of darkneſs;</hi> and again, thus deſcrib'd by him, <hi>it's a ſhame to ſpeak of thoſe things that are done of them in ſecret;</hi> Theſe they were not to touch, to have no followſhip with them in, but rather to reprove them, that is, in judgment to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, by words to reprove them, in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to avoid them. But now becauſe Chriſtians are not to communicate with Heathens in their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy myſteries, nor to partake with any ſort of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men in any action that's immoral, does it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, that they muſt not do their duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſometimes it cannot be done but in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? Muſt they abſtain from the Publick Worſhip of God and their Lord's Table, to which they are commanded, becauſe evil men, who, till they repent, have nothing to do there, rudely intrude themſelves? May they not joyn with bad men in ſome caſes,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:94681:21"/>
where it cannot be well avoided, in doing a good action? becauſe they muſt in no caſe and on no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count joyn with them in doing a ſinful one? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have omitted their duty, muſt I neglect mine? Becauſe they ſin in coming unpreparedly, muſt I ſin in not coming at all? Will their ſin be any plea or excuſe for mine? If I communicate with them, will their unworthineſs be laid at my door? If I ſeparate becauſe of that, ſhall they anſwer for my contempt, as well as for their own prophanation of it? No ſurely, every man ſhall bear his own <note place="margin">Ezek. 18. 20.</note>burden. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall die.</hi> The ſecond is, that Text,</p>

               <hi>Novatians</hi> and the <hi>Donatiſts?</hi> Might I ſtay to run the parallel, both thoſe Schiſms, and this amongſt us, would be found to begin on the ſame Principles, ſlackneſs of Diſcipline in the Church, and corruption in Manners; To be carried on by the ſame pretences, zeal for purity, and fear of pollution; to ſpring from the ſame bitter fountain, pride and arrogance; But I ſpeak not this to excuſe our ſelves, or to recriminate them; My hearty Prayer to God is, <hi>that all</hi> Iſrael <hi>may be ſaved;</hi> that they, who diſſent from us, would now, at laſt, lay aſide all paſſion and prejudice, all groundleſs ſcruples and pretences, and come in and joyn their forces with our Church againſt the common Adverſary; And that we, who profeſs our ſelves Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> would be extremely careful, for the honour of our Religion, for the preſervation of our Church, for the recovery of our ſtraying Brethren, (for whoſe ſakes, in ſome caſes, we are bound to lay down our lives) to lay down our ſins, and, inſtead of blocking up the way againſt any, by ſcandalous living, invite and allure them all in, by exemplary Holineſs and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and this I am ſure, how ſhort ſoever my Diſcourſe comes of it, would be a full Anſwer to, and a perfect Confutation of this Objection.</p>
