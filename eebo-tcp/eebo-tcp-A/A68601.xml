         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>RINITY Terme was now ended; For by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the time it could bee no other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the yeare.

And your Countrey Attorneys would no longer by any
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15399:4"/>
meanes endure the vnwholſome ayre of an Eight penny Ordinarie. Every one that had wherewith to diſcharge his Horſe out of the ſtable, ſtrove who ſhould firſt be gone. And amongſt the reſt, my ſelfe made ſhift for ſo much money as wherewith to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the fury of Miſtriſſe <hi>Overcount</hi> mine hoſteſſe, and ſo I departed likewiſe.</p>
            <p>At the top of <hi>Highgate</hi> hill I overtooke a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> riding homeward, whom I well knew; Him I ſaluted cheerefully, and he received me lovingly. But in travayling toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (Me thought) he was not (Maſter of that mirth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſpoſition which he was wont to carry along with him to ſhorten the way betwixt his houſe and <hi>London,</hi> I gave him to vnderſtand, how ſtrange, and notable this alteration appeared in him; And withall deſired to know ſo much of the occaſion thereof as might be impartible to a friend of ſo ſmall growth. To which he anſwered thus; Sir, I come from <hi>London,</hi> (It is true) from the Terme (It is certaine true) from <hi>London</hi> and Terme. True and certaine in nothing but expences in all things, yet I would have you know, that it is neither the Thunderclap of diſſolving an <hi>Iniunction,</hi> nor the Doomeſday of a <hi>Decree,</hi> nor Counſaylors <hi>Fees,</hi> nor Attornies <hi>Bylls</hi> in a language able to fright a man out of his wits, can proſcribe me my wonted mirth. It is ſomething nearer and dearer (my deare friend) that robs me of that cheere which uſed to lift me vp into the very Spheare, where <hi>loue</hi> himſelfe ſits to bid all his gueſts welcome right heartily:</p>
            <p>I remember mee of Children, ſixe Soones, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15399:4"/>
three daughters, of whom I am the vnhappy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In that, beſides the ſcars which my vnthrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines hath dinted vpon their fortunes, the wounds of vnequall times, and a tempeſtuous age approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching are like to take away from them all hope of outliuing the low water ebbe of the evill day all meanes of thriving by honeſt paynes, ſtudy or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry are bereft them. The common vpon which induſtry ſhould depaſture is overlayd Numerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes spoiles all, And poverty ſells all at an vnder value.</p>
            <p>In this caſe (Sir) what can be aduiſd Wherevnto I thus replyed.</p>
            <p>Sir, I haue heedfully atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded you in the delivery of your perplexed thoughts, concerning the care which you have of your children, taking the true, and even levell of the declention of arts, the diſtent of trades, &amp; trading, the poverty of all profeſſions, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, not of ours only, but of all Chriſtian cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates at this preſent, tending rather to a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion in the generall ayre, then a calmer tempara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (for ought that yet appeareth) as for the ſtormyneſſe of the ſea of ſtate forraigne or dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, let vs leave the greater, and leſſer veſſels that be expoſed to it, vnto the proper Pylates, Maſters, and Marryners, who have the charge to attend the line, or plye at the tackle, we are but poore paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and may aſſure our ſelues to partake in their boone voyage, if they ſuceed well, as they may be certaine to ſuffer in the ſame Shipwracke with vs, if wee miſcarry. I addreſſe me to give you the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, I can touching the preferment of every of your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15399:5"/>
ſix ſonnes and three daughters, in manner following</p>
            <p>It is true in moſt Gentlemen, and very likely in you, as in others, living onely vpon the revenew of lands. That the height of their Husbandry amounts to no more than to cleere the laſt halfe yeeres boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and borrowing at the rent day. That their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit may hold vp and keepe reputation till the next enſuing that againe.</p>
            <p>When you dye, the eldeſt Sonne claimes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of what you leave, thanke God, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it, your ſelfe leaſt of all, and your fatherly providence never a whit.</p>
            <p>If you take ſome courſe in your life time to make the reſt of your Children ſome ſmall portions or eſtates out of the whole of your lands. It is tenne to one but you deſtroy both him, and them by that meanes.</p>
            <p>For the heire commonly ſtriving to vphold the reputation of his Anceſtors. He abates nothing of his fathers accuſtomed expences towards the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of thoſe portions or eſtates ſo deducted. And they on the other ſide, preſume ſo much vpon the hope thereof, that no profeſſion will fit them. To bee a <hi>Miniſter</hi> (with them) is to be but a <hi>Pedant.</hi> A <hi>Lawyer,</hi> a <hi>mercenarie</hi> fellow. A Shop-keeper, a man moſt ſubject to the moſt wonderfull Cracke, and a creature whoſe welfare depends much vpon his Wives well bearing, and faire carriage. What is then to be done.</p>
            <p>Surely, it would be wiſhed, ſeeing God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath provided for the eldeſt, your younger ſonnes, and your daughters; eſpecially, being worſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15399:5"/>
to ſhift, ſhould bee by you provided for in the firſt place, while your Land is of virgin reputation, while it is chaſt, and vndiſhoneſted by committing of ſingle fornication with Countrie Creditors, that trade without ſheets (that is) by <hi>Pole deed,</hi> only for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of coſts; or at leaſt, before it have defiled the bed of its reputation by proſtituting to the adulterous imbracings of a Citie Scrivener: But eſpecially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it grow ſo impudent, as to lie downe in the Market place, and to ſuffer everie pettie Clarke to bring its good name vpon Record, and charge it that it was taken in the very fact betweene other mens ſheets.

               <head>Now ſuppoſe your ſonne is brought to the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie by Election or as Penſioner.</head>
               <p>THe firſt thing you muſt take to your care is. In caſe he come not by election, but as a Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, to live for the preſent upon your owne charge, how to procure him a Schollerſhip in the Colledge where you beſtow him.</p>
               <p>Or in caſe he come elected into one, how to procure a farther addition of maintenance to him.</p>
               <p>To bring him into a Schollerſhip, place him with a Senior fellow of the houſe (as Tutor) though you allow to ſome Iunior fellow ſomewhat yearely for reading unto him.</p>
               <p>This Senior fellow if the number of places voide will beare it may nominate your ſonne for one in his owne right, if it will not beare it, he may call to his ayd ſome and ſo many ſuffrages of the reſt as with the ſpeaking merit of your ſonne may worke your deſire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:15399:8"/>
Then how to procure a penſion for addytament of meanes.</p>
               <p>The chiefe skill is to finde it out, being eyther in the gift of ſome body Incorporate. Or of ſome private perſon. Wherein the diſcovery is to bee made (as aforeſaid.)</p>
               <p>If you ſue to a Company conſiſting of many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Tradeſmen, you muſt enquire who bee the moſt potent Patritians, and beſt reputed Veſtrie wits amongſt them, ſuch as carry their gloves in their hands, not on their hands.</p>
               <p>Amongſt an <hi>Aſsiſtance</hi> of many, onely two or three ſtrike the ſtroke, and hold the reſt in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull admiration of their extraordinary endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And how to ſpeake ſenſibly to theſe two or three is no Myſterie. You know they are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fiduciaries in the election. And therefore, you muſt not preſume to offer any thing by any meanes. Onely you may deſire them to accept this poore peece of plate, with your name and Armes upon it, and binde you unto their love, in keeping the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of you hereafter. Doe but try them in this kinde, and attend the ſucceſſe. I tell you, this with a Bucke at the Renter Wardens feaſt, may come ſomewhat neere to the matter.</p>
               <p>But for the penſion to be obtained of a private perſon, the way is not the ſame. It proceedeth of the givers meere charity, and muſt be taken by the hand of a deſertfull receiver. Though withall it may ſometimes fall out, that merit is made by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, eſpecially of ſome ſuch reverend Divine, as he doth moſt reſpect and frequent. For other, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15399:9"/>
can little prevaile with ſuch perſons.</p>
               <p>The beſt note to diſcover a man inclinable to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch a penſion, is to examine how wealth and charitie are equally and temporately mingled in him. And be ſure withall that he be a man of ſome reaſonable underſtanding in what he doth in this kinde. For a Fooles penſion is like a new faſhion eagerly purſued at the beginning, but as ſcurvily left off in the proceeding.</p>
               <p>Your next care is, in his due time to put on a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, when he ſhall put off his Schollerſhip, ſeeing the Schollerſhip keepes him company no farther than to the degree of Maſter of Arts, and a quarter of a yeare after, in thoſe Colledges, where Schollerſhips are longeſt lived. And in ſome not ſo long.</p>
               <p>In ſome Colledges, The Fellowſhip followes the Schollerſhip of courſe, and as the one leaveth him, the other entertaines him. But in the moſt it is not ſo, but comes by Election. Which Election paſſeth by the Maſter and Senior Fellowes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of every one doth name one, if the number to be Elected will beare it: or if not, then they paſſe by moſt voyces.</p>
               <p>Where note, that the Maſter hath a double voyce, and in ſome places hee hath the nomination of one, if there be two places voyd, yea if there be but one at ſometimes.</p>
               <p>In Colledges the letters of great perſons, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Lords grace of <hi>Canterburie,</hi> and the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie Chancellor have beene of great prevailance. But it is not ſo now in theſe dayes.</p>

There bee beneficiall gradations of preferment likewiſe, for Fellowes in their Colledges; as <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturer, Deane, Bowſer, Vice-maſter,</hi> and <hi>Maſter.</hi> But for my part, I better like and commend thoſe who when they find themſelves fit to put forth into the world, take the firſt preferment that is offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, rather than ſuch who live cloyſtered like Votaries: who have Sacraments to fill up their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be it but to keepe out others, ſuch as uſe no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, but wiping the duſt off their bookes, and have an excellent activity in handling the fox tayle, ſuch as hold no honour like to <hi>Supplicat reverentijs veſtris.</hi> And to be head <hi>Bowſier</hi> of the Colledge, as good as to be Chiefe Butler of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe preferments of the Colledge all but that of the Maſter comes of courſe by order, and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. Therefore no meanes but patient abiding needs for the acquiring of them in their due time.</p>
               <p>I haſten to ſend your ſonne out of the Cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter into the Common-wealth, and to ſhew you how many wayes of Advancement are open unto him abroad, with the meanes to diſcover, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>

               <p>THe firſt queſtion is, to what Trade you will put your Son, and which is moſt worthy of choice. For the Merchant it requireth great ſtocke, great experience in Forraine eſtates. And great hazard, and adventure at the beſt.</p>
               <p>And this is not all. For it depends upon the Peace of our State with forraine Princes, eſpecially thoſe with whom we hold mutuall traffique. Or, who lye in our way to intercept, or impediment our Trade abroad. Beſides that, in time of Warre they can hold no certainty of dealing, or ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Factorie in parts beyond the Seas. Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping is ſubject ever at the let goe, to bee ſtayed. Marriners to be preſt, and many other inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences attend them in ſuch times. Beſides the burthen of Cuſtome and Impoſition which all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:15399:19"/>
States impoſe more or leſſe. So that unleſſe wee have peace with ſuch Neighbours, there is little hope in that profeſſion in the ordinarie and lawfull way of trading.</p>
               <p>Happily you will alledge that ſome Merchants thrive well enough, when the warres moſt rage, and when the ſtreame of State is moſt troubled. Some then hold it to be the beſt fiſhing; they that gaine then (Sir) if they gaine juſtifiably: gaine not as Merchants, but as men of Warre, which occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man may learne without ſerving ſeaven yeares Apprentiſhip unto it.</p>
               <p>And if they gaine juſtifiably as Merchants, it muſt be in ſome generall ſtocke of a Society incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who have purſe to paſſe to and fro with ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent power, in the moſt dangerous times. And if ſuch Societies are tollerable at any time, it is at ſuch times. How they be otherwiſe allowable. I leave to conſideration.</p>
               <p>For the Shopkeeper, his welfare for the moſt part, depends upon the proſperity of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant. For if the Merchant ſit ſtill, the moſt of them may ſhut up their Shop windowes. Little Skill, Art, or Myſtery, ſhall a man learne in Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping. A man ſhall never in forraigne parts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put to his ſhifts out of his owne Meridian, live by the skill of weighing and meaſuring. The moſt uſe of advantage, he can make of it, is to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit betweene the Mart and the Market, than which nothing is more uncertaine, ſeeing there is no true judiciall of the falling, and riſing of commodities, And the caſualties that they are ſubject vnto, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially)

               <p>To my knowledge, a great <hi>Earle</hi> lately of this Land, did thinke it no ſcorne to indeavour the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the Craft, and trade of a Farrior, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he grew excellent.</p>

               <p>I admit the Merchant Royall, that comes to his Profeſſion by travaile and Factory, full fraught, and free adventure to be a profeſſion worthy the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. But not the hedge-creeper, that goes to ſeeke cuſtome from ſhop to ſhop, with a Cryll under his arme, That leapes from his Shop-boord to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and after he is fame-falne and credit crackt, in two or three other profeſſions, ſhall wrigle into this and that, when he comes upon the Exchange, in ſtead of enquiring after ſuch a good ſhip, ſpends the whole houre in diſputing, whether is the more profitable houſe-keeping, either with powder Beefe &amp; brewes, or with freſh Beefe and Porridge: though (God wot) the blacke Pot at home be guilty of ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>The Shopkeeper is a cleanly Trade; eſpecially, your Linnen-Draper, which company hath the greateſt Commonalty, and the largeſt priviledges of all other; and yet they maintaine nothing by Charter, for (indeed) they have none.</p>
               <p>But a manufacture for my money; eſpecially, if he ſell to the wearer immediately.</p>
               <p>Now for the better incouragement of men of Trade. Know that in moſt Companies of Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men incorporate (eſpecially in <hi>London)</hi> there is proviſion made by divers benefactors of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties deceaſed, for the enabling and ſetting up of young beginners, by ſtockes of money remaining in the hands of ſome few of the chiefe of their Company, (how faithfully diſpoſed I leave to their owne conſideration.) But ſurely the poorer ſort complaine much of the miſimployment of it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally.</p>
               <p>There is but one little Crevis to peepe in at their dealings. And that is betweene their Maſters conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp; the Clarks connivence, which is ſo narrow, that you may ſooner diſcern the South Pole through the maine Center, than diſcover their myſterie.</p>
               <p>Indeed in times paſt, the Clearkſhip of the Company hath beene beſtowed upon ſome ancient decayed member of the Company, for his lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.

               <p>ANd the queſtion is firſt.</p>
               <p>Whether the better way of thriving, is to be a Sea Soldier, or a Land Soldier.</p>
               <p>Queſtionleſſe the better way of thriving is to be a Sea Soldier. In this Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> being an Iſland, for that he is more vſefull to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. More learning is required to be a Sea Soldier than to be a Land Soldier. A Sea Soldier is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of victuals, and wages; where the Land Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers pay will hardly find him ſuſtenance. A Sea Soldier may now and than chaunce to haue a ſnapp at a bootie or a price which may in an inſtant make him a fortune for ever; where the Land Soldier may in an age come to the ranſacking of a poore fiſher Towne at the moſt.</p>
               <p>More valour is required in a Sea Soldier than in a Land Soldier; becauſe the extremitie of the place requires it. The Sea Captaine is expoſed to as much danger during the whole fight as the pooreſt man in the Ship; where the land Captaine vſeth but to offer his men to the face of the enemy, and than retreateth.</p>
               <p>The way to riſe to preferment at Sea, is by the <hi>Admiralls</hi> Countenance, and the <hi>Vice Admiralls</hi> in the Kings ſeruice, or in other ſervice by the favour of great traded Merchants, and eſpecially of your
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:15399:24"/>
bodies incorporate: and their chiefe Officers; and more eſpecially their Preſident, and Treaſurer for the time being.</p>
               <p>His breeding is a matter of more moment than his age regardeth.</p>
               <p>If he be true bred, he ſhould be firſt made a perfect Nauigator able to direct the Sterage of their courſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know the tackle, and appoint every Sayler to his charge. He ſhould know what number of Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, what Ordinance, and what munition ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for a Ship of ſuch a burden.</p>
               <p>He ſhould be a skilfull <hi>Caneere,</hi> and able to direct the <hi>Gunner,</hi> to ſay what quantity of powder a <hi>Peece</hi> of ſuch bore ond depth requireth, and of what weight the bullet ſhould be where ſuch a quantity of powder is vſed, whether the <hi>Peece</hi> be ſound or hony-combed. He ſhould be able to know and direct what quantity of victuall ſhould be required for ſo many men, for ſuch a voyage. And what quantity of powder and ſhot.</p>
               <p>Alſo, to ouerſee and direct the <hi>Purſer</hi> and <hi>Steward</hi> in the expence of their victuall without profuſeneſſe, or too much percemonie.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe skilfull in all manner of Fire-workes and fitting Engines for ſea fight.</p>
               <p>Briefly, he ſhould be ſo compleat, as that none ſhould be able to teach him in his place, and he skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to controle every other in their places. He ſhould be courteous and louing to his men. Aboue all things he ſhould be zealous of the honour of God. See that the divine ſervice be duely read on board E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening and Morning, and that ſwearing be ſeverely puniſhed. A Sea Captaine, is not a place for a young
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:15399:25"/>
man to leape into inſtantly, and imediately out of a Ladies Vſherſhip; a Great mans bed chamber, or a <hi>Littletons</hi> diſcipleſhip.</p>
               <p>It is not your feathered Gallant of the Court, nor your Tauerne Roarer of the Citie, becomes this place I aſſure you.</p>
               <p>I find not any <hi>Meſon de dieu</hi> for relieving of mayned Marriners only, but that erected at <hi>Chattam</hi> by Sir <hi>Iohn Hawkins</hi> Knight, Treaſurer of the Navie of the late Q. <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> wherein it was provided, that there ſhould be a deduction of Sixpence by the Moneth, out of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man and boy their wages in every voyage towards the ſame.

               <p>IF the Land-Souldier thinke to thrive and riſe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſervice, from a Common Souldier to a Captaine in this age, (alas) hee is much deceived.</p>
               <p>That cuſtome is obſolete, and growne out of uſe. Doe what he can doe in Land-ſervice, hee ſhall hardly riſe by his ſingle merit.</p>
               <p>His happineſſe ſhall be but to fill his hungry belly, and Satiate himſelfe upon a Pay day.</p>
               <p>But if hee be of Kinne, or a favourite to ſome great Officer, hee may carry the Colours the firſt day, bee a <hi>Lieutenant</hi> the ſecond, and a Captaine before he knowes how many dayes goe to the weeke in their Regiment.</p>
               <p>The Land-ſervice where a man may learne moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of Warre diſcipline, is in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:15399:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by reaſon of the long exerciſe of Warres and variety of Stratagems there.</p>
               <p>Beyond that Northward, the ſervice is both more unprofitable and more dangerous, and leſſe experience is to be there learned.</p>
               <p>The more your Sonne turnes his face to the South the more profitable the Land-ſervice is.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if hee have no friend or kindred to raiſe him in the Land-ſervice, I aſſure you that there is no Law againſt buying and ſelling of Offices in the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> for ought that I have read.

               <p>After the Souldier returnes home, it makes no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what number of wounds hee can reckon about him.</p>
               <p>All the wayes of reliefe for him that I can number are theſe:</p>

                  <item>A Penſioner of the County; If the <hi>lustices</hi> find him worthy. And that hee was preſt forth of the ſame County. Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> in <hi>Southwarke,</hi> and St. <hi>Bartholmews, Smithfield;</hi> onely till their wounds or diſeaſes be cured and no longer. And that if the Maſters of the ſayd Hoſpitals pleaſe to receive them.</item>

               <p>There is a pretty way of breeding young Maides an Exchange ſhop, or St. <hi>Martins le grand.</hi> But many of them get ſuch a fooliſh Crick with carrying the Bandbox under their Apron to Gentlemens Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that in the end it is hard to diſtinguiſh whether it be their belly or their bandbox makes ſuch a goodly ſhow.</p>
               <p>And in a trade where a woman is ſole Chapman, ſhe claimes ſuch a preheminence over her husband, that ſhe will not be held to give him an account of her dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, eyther in retaile, or whole ſaile at any rate.</p>
               <p>The Merchants Factor, and Citizens ſervant of the better ſort, cannot diſparage your Daughters with their Societie.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Iudges, Lawyers,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtices</hi> followers, are not ordinary Servingmen, but men of good breed, and their education for the moſt part <hi>Clarkely,</hi> whoſe ſervice promiſeth their farther and future advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Your Daughter at home will make a good wife for ſome good Yeomans eldeſt Sonne, whoſe father will be glad to crowne his ſweating frugality, with alliance to ſuch a houſe of Gentry.</p>
               <p>The youngmans fingers will itch to be handling of Taffata, and to be placed at the Table, and to be carved unto by <hi>Miſtris Dorothie,</hi> it will make him and the good plaine old <hi>Ione</hi> his Mother, to paſſe over all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Portion or Patrimony.</p>
               <p>For your Daughter at the Merchants, and her ſiſter if they can carry it wittily, the City affords them va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie.</p>

The young Factor being fancy-caught in his days of Innocency, &amp; before he travaile ſo farre into experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as into forreigne Countries, may lay ſuch a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of firſt love in her boſome, as no alteration of Climate can alter.</p>
