            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The exception, if it be an exception, and not rather a pure negation, extendeth it selfe only to the divorce, not at all to the second marriage: he that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>utteth away his wife without the cause of fornication, maketh her commit adultery: but if he put her away for fornication, she is the culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cause of her own adultery, not he that puts her away justly: but having put her away, whether he may lawfully marry again without sinne, saint <hi>Mathew</hi> saith nothing, but saint <hi>Marke</hi> and saint <hi>Luke</hi> speak expresly that he cannot: yet even this place of saint <hi>Mathew</hi> (howsoever understood) speaks directly against your second mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, for you do not so much as pretend that your wife hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore by the undoubted consent of the three Evangelists you cannot marry again.</p>
               <p>To this of the three Evangelists, adde likewise the testimony of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.2, 3. <hi>The woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth, but if the husba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So then if while her husband liveth she be marryed to another, she shall be called an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresse.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew no way to dissolve marriage but by death: the same he saith, 1 <hi>Cor</hi>: 7:39. <hi>The wife is bound by the Law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be marryed to whom she will.</hi> and if we weigh the force of St <hi>Pauls</hi> argument exactly, we shall find it to be this, That as the bond of the Law could no way be dissolved whiles the Law lived, that is, was not abrogated, notwithstanding any prevarication inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding; so the bond of marriage is indissolvable so long as life lasteth, notwithstanding any interceding fornication. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point, he that marrieth her that is divorced or put away either justly for fornication, or unjustly without fornication,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41073:5"/>
committeth adultery: for if it was justly for fornication; then she was the nocent person, and could not marry aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n; and if it was unjustly without fornication, then the divorce was void, and she still continued wife to her former husband: howsoever it was, whether justly or unjustly, it can be no adultery, except the bond of the former marriage were d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Another place we have to the same purpose, 1 <hi>Cor</hi>: 7.10, 21. <hi>Unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, let not the wife depart from her husband; but if she depart, let her remain unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, or be reconciled to her husband; and let not the husband put away his wife.</hi> Either St <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of such a woman who had no just cause of separation, or of one who had: but he cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to speak of one who had no just cause of separation, for then he would not, he could not have said, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled at her choice, but let her be reconsiled and returne to her husband.

It hath been long observed as a Nationall sinne of this people, to have been over easy dissolvers of true marriages, upon slaunderous, or pretended Prae-contracts wanting all ground but lust and perjury: and therefore I do give you the same Counsaile which I take God to witnes I would take

my selfe if I were in the same condition. Seeke once more to be reconciled to your wife, and forget not to pray God to change her heart: if you cannot prevail, then follow St <hi>Paul's</hi> command or rather God's command by St <hi>Paul, to remain unmarried.</hi> You complain of this as a grievous burthen, but you consider not that many holy Saints and Servants of God have lived much longer under the same Crosse that you have done, and altogethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some have had their Spouses imprisoned for 30 or 40 years together for conscience sake, as I told you formerly of Mr. <hi>Mole</hi>: some again have had their husbands made slaves by the Turkes, and detained from them as long as they lived: some have been smitten with an incurable disease (presently after Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage) inconsistent with the duties of the marriage-bed: what must they doe in these cases and many more of the same nature? Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently marry again, God forbid! This is a better remedy, that is, by fervent and frequent prayer to begge the guifte of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of God: if we prevail not, it is because we pray amiss.

               <p>For first, that Text (<hi>Mat</hi>: 19.6.) is understood properly of dissolving the bond of marriage, (as you would have it) for eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, there are other causes of divorces, besides fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as when one married person shall seek to poyson or make away the other, or to starve them, it is very lawfull to seperate them out of prudence to prevent murther. Judge whether this be not your case or no? and when the one person is continually inticing the other to Heresy or blaspheming; or soliciting him or her to sinne against God: in such cases also such a temperary Divorce is lawfull, as no man that understands himselfe will deny.</p>
               <p>In the 6 and 7 paragraph, you endeavour to prove your wife
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41073:6"/>
a whore in Scripture-sence, because she is departed from you, but you mistake every way. For first, in all p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose, for this adultery or whoredome fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But to imagine that she who only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts her husband, and she who takes another into his bed, are both alike guilty of the breach of wedlocke, and both to be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished with the same punishment, as you say in the 7 paragraph, is ridiculous.</p>
               <p>In the conclusion of your discourse you plead for liberty to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and urge 4 reasons for your selfe, which if they were all true, signify nothing, as to that purpose for which you urge them. Suppose she have been so long absent; suppose she cut you in the face; suppose she were an occasion that you were imprisoned 25 dayes; suppose you have a Divorce under two Bishops hands, upon a reference from his Majestie; yet there is a great difference between a temporary divorce, and a perpetuall dissolution of marriage. What you plead for your selfe I have seen, what your wife hath to plead for her selfe I do not know; but if every thing be as your selfe say, I cannot give way to your second marriage, whiles your old wife lives, without contradicting the Commands of our Saviour delivered by three Evangelists, and one Apostle: and therefore I must commend you to your proper remedy, that is, prayer, hoping that you will never thinke more of wedding, whilst your old wife lives, but bear your Crosse with patience which Christ hath laid upon you.</p>

                     <p>To this I reply by plain Scripture, and agree with you that the marriage of Infidells is dissolvable, if but the one party be an Infidell, and refuse to co-habit with the husband or wife, as 1 <hi>Cor</hi>: 7.15. and at verses 12, 13. If a husband have an unbelieving wife, or a wife an unbelieving husband: if the unbeliever be pleased to dwell with the believer, the believer ought not to put the unbeliever away. and though my wife be an unbeliever, and is departed, yet I have waited 6 years, &amp;c. for her returning, before I got a Bill of divorce: and the Text saith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>To return to the second Objection, the law of the Land (you say) I mistake: for if the husband be known to be living, if it were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteeen years, the wife may not marry; and you instance Mr. Mole was absent 20 years in the Inquisition.</p>

And if any married persons should be so desperately wicked as to endeavour to kill, or poison or intice to Heresie or Blasphemy, or the like, the Magestrates by Law may take order and secure the innocent party, without making Divorces not warrantable by Scripture, and which oftentimes proves a bane to the innocent party, and binds him to more bondage then the Nocent.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I observe out of <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. and <hi>Romans</hi> 10. that the ordinary means that God hath ordained to worke faith and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in such as shall be saved, is the Ministry of the Word; that is the Word of God preached. <hi>Ro</hi>: 10.14, 15. <hi>How shall they hear without a preacher; and how shall they preach except they be sent.</hi> that is such as God sends, and furnisheth with Guifts rightly to divide the word, and to bring out of Gods treasure things new &amp; old, and to give every one their portions in due season: that is, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to whom comfort belongs, to edify and build them up in their most holy faith: and reproofe and reprehension to whom it belongs, to tell <hi>Israell</hi> his trangressions, and the house of <hi>Iacob</hi> their sinns, that at the day of Judgement when the Bookes of mens Consciences shall be opened, their condemnation may appear to be just; that they were instructed in the truth which they rejected and dehorted from: and were reproved for their sinfull wayes, they walked into their owne destruction. Such faithfull Pastors may say as <hi>Isaiah, Isa</hi>: 8.18. <hi>Behold here an I and the children that thou hast given me</hi>: or that thou hast made me instrumentall by my Ministry to them in the worke of their Conversion: when idle Drones, and dumme Doggs, and covetous Cormorants that seek the fleece mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, I have observed with grief of heart, and I humbly desire it may be seriously considered off by all whom it doth or may concern, that many godly and faithfull Ministers, such as no man can deny but they have been instrumentall by their Ministry to the conversion of many souls, but they are now silenced, and not suffered to preach, for refusing subscription to that which they say is part of it the Ordinances of men, and not agree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:41073:16"/>
and he found <hi>Raphaell</hi> (saith that verse) that was an Angell: and verse the 12. he calls himselfe <hi>Azarias</hi> the son of <hi>Ananias</hi> the great, and of thy Brethren, saith he to <hi>Tobit</hi>: and verse the 13. <hi>Tobit</hi> saith, he knew his father <hi>Ananias,</hi> when they went together to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to worship: and chap: 12. verse 15. He calls himselfe again <hi>Raphaell,</hi> one of the seven Angells which presents the prayers of the saints. Now this is contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all our Protestant Churches, that Angells should present the Saints Prayers, and so become their Mediator or Inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now they say, that the imposing of this and such like, instead of Canonical Scripture, makes them that they cannot subscribe; for God is not worshipped with Mens hands, nor with mens tongues, except it be in a way of his own institution: <hi>He will be sanctified in all that draw near un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For my own particular, I conceive a Litturgy in the Church is very usefull, that ignorant persons that cannot pray, may by often reading and hearing it read, learne to pray in a forme of Prayer: yet I think it should be such as both the Prayers and Lessons to be read, should be suitable to Canonicall Scripture; and not such as is mentioned before: and so composed for matter and manner, as other parts of Gods worship be not hindred.</p>

For by his two Hornes is meant both Civill &amp; Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall power; for by the sword which the Pope doth exercise, he commands obedience to his Ecclesiasticall Decrees as verse 16.17. <hi>He caused all both small and great, rich and poor, bond and free to receive a Marke in their right hand, or in their fore-head. And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the Marke, or the Name of the beast, or the number of his Name.</hi> Now by the Marke of the beast in the fore-head, or right hand some thinke is meant to professe and practise the Lawes, Religion, and Decrees that are commanded; and those that will not submit thereunto, must not buy nor sell.
