            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe <hi>Moors</hi> ('tis ſaid) us'd to caſt their new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Children into the Sea, and only if they Swam would think 'em worth their Care; but mine, with more neglect, I turn into the World; for ſink or ſwim, I have done all I deſign'd for't. I have already, with as much ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as <hi>Aeneas</hi> in a Cloud heard <hi>Dido</hi> praiſe him, heard the <hi>Beaux-Criticks</hi> condemn
<pb facs="tcp:31214:5"/>
this Tranſlation before they ſaw it, and with as much Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as if they had: And after they had Prophetically diſcover'd all the Flaws in the turns of Thought, the cadence of Periods, and had almoſt brought in <hi>Epick</hi> and <hi>Drama,</hi> they ſupt their Coffee, took Snuff, and charitably concluded to ſend <hi>Briſcoe</hi> the Pye-Woman to help off with his Books. Well, I have nothing to ſay, but that theſe brisk Gentlemen that draw without occaſion, muſt put up without ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>After the Injury of <hi>1700</hi> Years or better, and the ſeveral
<pb facs="tcp:31214:5"/>
Editions in <hi>Quarto, Octavo, Duodecimo,</hi> &amp;c. with their reſpective Notes, to little purpoſe; for theſe Annotators upon matters of no difficulty, are ſo tedious, that you can't get rid of their enlargements without ſleeping, but at any real Knot are too Modeſt to interupt any Man's Curioſity in the untying of it. After ſo many Years, I ſay, it happen'd upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Belgrade</hi> this Author was <hi>made</hi> Entire; made ſo becauſe the New is ſuſpected to be Illegitimate: But it has ſo many Features of the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Father, that he was at
<pb facs="tcp:31214:6"/>
leaſt thought of when 'twas got. Now the Story's made out, the Character of <hi>Lycas</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, and <hi>Petronius</hi> freed from the imputation of not making Divine or Humane Juſtice purſue an ill-ſpent Life.</p>
            <p>As to the Tranſlation, the other Hand, I believe, has been very careful; but if my part don't ſatisfie the World, I ſhould be glad to ſee my ſelf reveng'd in a better Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and tho' it may prove no difficult Province to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove what I have done, I ſhall yet have the credit of the firſt Attempt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:31214:6"/>
If any of the Fine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould be angry after they have read it, as ſome, to ſave that trouble, have before; and proteſt I've yet debaucht <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronius,</hi> and robb'd him of his Language, his only Purity, I hope we ſhall ſhortly be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, for I have ſome very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty new Songs ready for the Preſs: If this ſatisfies them, I'll venture to tell others that I have dreſt the meaning of the Original as modeſtly as I could, but to have quite hid the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaenity, I thought, were to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, not Tranſlate.</p>
            <p>As for the Ladies, if any too-diſcerning antiquated Hypocrite
<pb facs="tcp:31214:7"/>
(for only ſuch I fear) ſhou'd be angry with the beaſtly Author; let the Work be my Advocate, where the little li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties I take, as modeſtly betray a broad Meaning, as bluſhing when a Man tells the Story.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who object, that things of this nature ought not to be Tranſlated, muſt arraign the Verſions of <hi>Juvenal, Suetoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> &amp;c. but what <hi>Suetonius</hi> thought excuſable in <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> any ſober Man will think much more allowable in <hi>Satyr:</hi> Nor can this be offenſive to Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manners, ſince the groſs part here is the diſplaying of Vices of that Dye, that there's an abhorrence
<pb facs="tcp:31214:7"/>
even in Nature from 'em; nor is it poſſible that any ill Man can talk a good one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a new Frame or Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nay, perhaps it may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to a good uſe, to ſee our own happineſs, that we know that to be oppoſite to Humanity it ſelf, which ſome of the Ancients were deluded even to practiſe as Wit and Gallantry; thus I'm ſo far from being toucht in expreſſing thoſe Crimes, that I think it makes the more for me, the more they're deteſted.</p>
            <p>If I have alter'd or added to the Author, it was either to render thoſe Cuſtoms of the <hi>Romans</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:31214:8"/>
that were analogous to ours, by what was more familiar to us, or to prevent a Note by enlarging on others where I found 'em.</p>
            <p>The Verſe of both Parts are Mine, and I have taken a great liberty in 'em; and tho' I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there I have not wrong'd the Original, yet all will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to call them <hi>Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Money at firſt I made <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coin, but not the exact worth, becauſe it wou'd have been odd in ſome places to have brought in pence and farthings; as when the thouſand Seſterces are offered to diſcover <hi>Gito,</hi> it would not be conſiſtent with
<pb facs="tcp:31214:8"/>
the haſte they were in to offer ſo many Pounds, ſo many Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and ſo many Pence: I therefore proportion'd a ſumm to the Story without caſting up the Seſterces; thus they went to the Preſs: But advis'd either to give the juſt value or the <hi>Roman</hi> Coin, I reſolv'd on the latter for the Reaſons I have given, and alter'd the Summs as the Proofs came to my hands; but truſting the care of one Sheet to a Friend, the ſumm 2000 Crowns paſt unalter'd.</p>

               <q>I Promis'd you an Account of what befel me, and am now reſolv'd to be as good as my Word, being ſo met to our Deſires; not only to improve our Learning but to be Merry, and put Life in our Diſcourſe with pleaſanter Tales.</q>

                  <hi>Fabricius Vejeuto</hi> has already, and that wittily handled the Juggle of Religion,

and withal diſcover'd with what impudence and ignorance Prieſts pretend to be inſpir'd:</q> But are not our wrangling Pleaders poſſeſt with the ſame Frenzy? who cant it; Theſe Wounds I receiv'd in defence of your Liberty; this Eye was loſt in your Service; lend me a Hand to hand me to my Children, for my faltering Hams are not able to ſupport me.</p>
            <p>Yet even this might paſs for tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, did it put young beginners in the leaſt way to well-ſpeaking. Whereas now, what with the inordinate ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Matter, and the empty ratling of Words, they only gain this, That when they come to appear in Publick, they think themſelves in another World. And therefore I look upon the young fry of Collegiates as likely to make the moſt hopeful Blockheads, becauſe they neither hear nor ſee any thing that is in uſe among Men: But a company of Pirates with their Chains on the ſhoar; Tyrants iſſuing Proclamations to make Children kill their Fathers; the anſwers of Oracles in a Plague-time, that three or more Virgins be ſacrific'd to appeaſe the Gods; dainty fine Honey-Pellets of Words, and every thing ſo ſaid and

done, as if it were all Spice and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that are thus bred can no more underſtand, than thoſe that live in a Kitchin not ſtink of the Greaſe: Give me, with your favour, leave to ſay, 'twas you firſt loſt the good grace of ſpeaking; for with light idle gingles of Words to make ſport ye have brought it to this, That the ſubſtance of Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is become effeminate and ſunk.</p>
            <p>Young Men were not kept to this way of declaiming when <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides</hi> influenc'd the Age. Nor yet had any blind Alley-Profeſſor foil'd their Inclinations, when <hi>Pindar</hi> and the Nine <hi>Lyricks</hi> durſt not attempt <hi>Homer</hi>'s Numbers: And that I may not bring my Authority from Poets, 'tis certain, neither <hi>Plato</hi> nor <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ever made it their Practice: A S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

After this, Who came up to the height of <hi>Thucydides?</hi> Who reach'd the Fame of <hi>Hyperedes?</hi> Nay, there was hardly a Verſe of a right ſtrain: But all, as of the ſame batch, di'd with their Author.

            <p>
               <hi>At this and the like rate my ſelf once declaim'd, when one</hi> Agamemnon <hi>made up to us, and looking ſharply on him, whom the Mob with ſuch diligence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, he would not ſuffer me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim longer in the Portico, than he had ſweated in the School;</hi> But, young Man, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> becauſe your Diſcourſe is beyond the common apprehenſion, and, which is not often ſeen, that you are a lover of Underſtanding, I won't deceive you: The Maſters of theſe Schools are not to blame, who think it neceſſary to be mad with mad Men: For unleſs they teach what their Scholars approve, they might, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, keep School to themſelves: like flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſmell-Feaſts, who when they come to great Mens Tables ſtudy nothing more than what they think may be moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Company (as well knowing they ſhall never obtain what they would,

unleſs they firſt ſpread a Net for their Ears) ſo a Maſter of Eloquence, unleſs, fiſherman like, he bait his Hook with what he knows the Fiſh will bite at, may wait long enough on the Rock without hopes of catching any thing.</p>
            <p>Where lies the Fault then? Parents ought to be ſharply reprehended, who will not have their Children come on by any ſtrict Method; but in this, as in all things, are ſo fond of making a Noiſe in the World; and in ſuch haſte to compaſs their Wiſhes, that they hurry them in publick e'er they have digeſted what they have read, and put Children e'er they are well paſt their Sucking-Bottle, upon the good grace of ſpeaking, than which even themſelves confeſs, nothing is greater: Whereas if they would ſuffer them to come up by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, that their Studies might be temper'd with grave Lectures; their Affections fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion'd by the Dictates of Wiſdom; that they might work themſelves into a Maſtery of Words; and for a long time hear, what they're inclined to imitate, nothing that pleas'd Children, wou'd be admir'd by them. But now Boys trifle in the Schools, young Men are laugh'd at in publick, and, which is worſe than both, what every one fooliſhly takes up in his Youth, no one will

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I knew <hi>Lycas</hi> was jealous, which kept me Tongue-ty'd ſo long, and the love he bore his Wife made him diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to her, his inclination to me: But the firſt opportunity we had of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, ſhe related to me what ſhe had learn'd from him; and I frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſs'd it, but withal told her how abſolutely averſe I had ever been to't:

Well then, quoth the diſcreet Woman, we muſt try our Wits, according to his own Opinion, the permiſſion was one's and the poſſeſſion anothers.</q>

            <p>
               <q>By this time <hi>Gito</hi> had been worn off his Legs, and was gathering new ſtrength, when <hi>Tryphaena</hi> came back to me, but diſappointed of her expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, her Love turn'd to a downright Fury; and, all on fire with following me to no purpoſe, got into my Intrigue both with <hi>Lycas</hi> and his Wife: She made no account of his gameſomneſs with me, as well knowing it wou'd hinder no Griſt to her Mill: But for <hi>Doris,</hi> ſhe never left till ſhe had found out our private Amours, and gave a hint of it to <hi>Lycas;</hi> whoſe Jealouſie having got the upper hand of his Love, ran all to revenge; but <hi>Doris,</hi> adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd by <hi>Tryph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <q>
                  <hi>Gito</hi> and I laid our Heads together, and he was as willing as my ſelf to be gone; for <hi>Tryphaena</hi> having drawn him dry, began now not to be ſo fond of him. Early the next morning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we march'd to Sea-ward, where with the leſs difficulty we got on board the Ship, becauſe we were no ſtrangers to <hi>Lycas</hi>'s Servants then in wait upon her: They ſtill honouring us with their company, it was not a time to filch any thing; but, leaving <hi>Gito</hi> with them, I took an opportunity of getting into the Stern, where the Image of <hi>Iſis</hi> ſtood, and ſtrip'd her of a rich Mantle, and Silver Taber, lifting other good Booty out of the Maſter's Cabin, I ſtole down by a Rope, unſeen of any but <hi>Gito;</hi> who alſo gave them the ſlip and ſculk'd after me.</q>

            <p>

and make him our Friend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers could ſee him;</q> and withal bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſert it, That the trick <hi>Lycas</hi> would have ſerved them, was the only cauſe why they ſtole away ſo haſtily; which when <hi>Lycurgus</hi> came to underſtand, he ſwore he would at all times protect us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Enemies.</p>
            <p>Our flight was unknown till <hi>Tryphaena</hi> and <hi>Doris</hi> were got out of bed; for we daily attended their levy, and waited on them while they were dreſſing; but, when contrary to cuſtom they found us miſſing, <hi>Lycas</hi> ſent after us, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Sea-ſide, for he had heard we made that way, but not a word of the Pillage, for the Ship lay ſomewhat to Sea-ward, and the Maſter had not yet return'd on board.</p>
            <p>But at laſt it being taken for granted, we were run away, and <hi>Lycas</hi> becoming uneaſie for want of us, fell deſperately foul on his Wife, whom he ſuppos'd to be the cauſe of our departure: I'll take no notice of what Words and Blows paſt between them; I know not every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: I'll only ſay, <hi>Tryphaena,</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Miſchief, had put <hi>Lycas</hi> in the head, that it might ſo be, we had taken ſanctuary at <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s, where ſhe perſuaded
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31214:19"/>
him to go in queſt of the Runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, and promis'd to bear him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that ſhe might confound our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence with juſt Reproaches.</p>
            <p>The next day they accordingly ſet forward, and came to his Houſe; but we were out of the way: For <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was gone to a Feſtival in honour of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> held at a neighbouring Village, and had taken us with him, of which when the others were inform'd, they made what haſte they could to us, and met us in the Portico of the Temple. The ſight of them very much diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us: <hi>Lycas</hi> eagerly complained of our flight to <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> but was received with ſuch a bended Brow, and ſo haughty a Look, that I grew valiant upon't, and with an open Throat charg'd him with his beaſtly attempts upon me, as well at <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s as in his own Houſe; and <hi>Tryphaena</hi> endeavouring to ſtop my Mouth, had her ſhare with him, for I ſet out her Harlotry to the Mob, who were got about us to hear the ſcolding: And as a proof of what I ſaid, I ſhew'd them poor ſapleſs <hi>Giton,</hi> and my ſelf al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, whom that itch of the Whore had even brought to our Graves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:31214:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The ſhout of the Mob put our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſo out of Countenance that they went off heavily, but contriving a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; and therefore obſerving how we had put upon <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> they went back to expect him at his Houſe, and ſet him right again. The Solemnity ending la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than was expected, we could not reach <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s that Night, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he brought us to a half-way Houſe, but left us aſleep next Morning, and went home to diſpatch ſome buſineſs, where he found <hi>Lycas</hi> and <hi>Tryphaena</hi> waiting for him, who ſo ordered the matter with him, that they brought him to ſecure us. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> naturally barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and faithleſs, began to contrive which way to betray us, and ſent <hi>Lycas</hi> to get ſome help, whilſt he ſecured us in the Village.</p>
            <p>Thither he came, and at his firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, treated us as <hi>Lycas</hi> had done: After which wringing his Hands together, he upbraided us with the Lye we had made of <hi>Lycas,</hi> and taking <hi>Aſcyltos</hi> from us, lock'd us up in the Room where we were, without ſo much as hearing him ſpeak in our defence; but carrying him to his Houſe, ſet a Guard upon us, till himſelf ſhould return.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:31214:20"/>
On the Road <hi>Aſcyltos</hi> did what he could to mollifie <hi>Lycurgus;</hi> but neither Entreaties, nor Love, nor Tears doing any good on him, it came into our Comerades head to ſet us at liberty, and being all on fire at <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s reſtineſs, refus'd to bed with him that Night, and by that means the more eaſily put in execution what he had been thinking on.</p>
            <p>The Family was in their dead ſleep when <hi>Aſcyltos</hi> took our Fardels on his Shoulders, and getting through a breach in the Wall, which he had formerly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, came to the Village by break of Day, and meeting no one to ſtop him, boldly enter'd it and came up to our Chamber; which the Guard that was upon us, took care to ſecure; but the Bar being of Wood, he eaſily wren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched it with an Iron Crow, and waken'd us; for we ſnor'd, in ſpight of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>Our Guard had ſo over-watched themſelves, that they were fall'n into a dead ſleep, and we only wak'd at the Crack. To be ſhort, <hi>Aſcyltos</hi> came in and briefly told us what he had done for our ſakes: On this we got up; and as we were rigging our ſelves, it came into
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31214:20"/>
my Head to kill the Guard, and rifle the Village; I told <hi>Aſcyltos</hi> my Mind: He liked the rifling well enough, but gave us a wiſh'd delivery without Blood, for being acquainted with every corner of the Houſe, he pick'd the Lock of an Inner-Room where the Movables lay, and bringing us into it, we lifted what was of moſt value, and got off while it was yet early in the Morning; avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the common Road, and not reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till we thought our ſelves out of danger.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Aſcyltos</hi> having gotten heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, began to ampli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ere entring the Inn, we ſaw a great many others that had alſo ſtruck in, to avoid the Storm. The throng kept us from being taken notice of, and gave us the opportunity of prying here and there, what we might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ilch in a Crowd, when <hi>Aſcyltos,</hi> unheeded of any one, took a Purſe from the Ground, in which he found ſeveral pieces of Gold; we leap'd for Joy at ſo fortunate a beginning;

but fearing, leſt ſome or other might ſeek after it, we ſlunk out at a Back-door, where we ſaw a Groom Sadling his Horſes; but, as having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſomewhat, he run into the Houſe, leaving behind him an Embroider'd Mantle, mail'd to one of the Saddles: In his abſence I cut the Straps, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the covert of ſome Out-ſheds, we made off with it to a neighbouring Foreſt.</p>
            <p>Being more out of danger among the Thickets, we caſt about where we ſhould hide the Gold, that we might not be either charg'd with the Felony, or robb'd of it our ſelves: At laſt we concluded to ſow it in the Lining of an old patcht Coat which I threw over my Shoulders, and entruſted the care of the Mantle to <hi>Aſcyltos,</hi> in deſign to get to the City by Croſs-ways: But as we were going out, we heard ſomewhat on our left hand, to this purpoſe: They ſhall not eſcape us; they came into the Wood; let's ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our ſelves and beat about, that we may the better diſcover and take them.

perceiving it, the precious Coat drop'd from my Shoulders: At laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite tir'd, and not able to go any further, I laid me down under the ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Tree, where I firſt miſs'd the Coat: Then grief reſtor'd my ſtrength, and up I got again to try if I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Treaſure; I ran hither and thither, and every where, but to no purpoſe; but ſpent and waſted between toil and heavineſs, I got into a Thicket, where having tarried four hours, and half dead with the horror of the place, I ſought the way out; but going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a Country-man came in ſight of me: Then I had need of all my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, nor did it fail me: I went up roundly to him, and making my moan how I had loſt my ſelf in the Wood, deſir'd him tell me the way to the City: He pittying my Figure (for I was as pale as Death, and all bemir'd) ask'd me if I had ſeen any one in the Wood? I anſwered, not a Soul—on which he courteouſly brought me into the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, where he met two of his Friends, who told him, they had travers'd the Wood thro' and thro', but had light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing but a Coat, which they ſhew'd him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:31214:22"/>
It may eaſily be believed I had not the courage to challenge it, tho' I knew well enough what the value of it was: This ſtruck me more than all the reſt; however, bewailing my Treaſure, the Country-man not heeding me, and feeble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs growing upon me, I ſlacken'd my pace, and jogg'd on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It was longer e're I reach'd the City than I thought of; but coming to the Inn, I found <hi>Aſcyltos</hi> half dead, and ſtretcht on a Straw Pallet, and fell on another my ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

During this, <hi>Giton</hi> ſtood as troubled as my ſelf, and the Boy's
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31214:23"/>
ſadneſs increaſed mine: But the freſh Suit that was after us, diſtracted me moſt. I opened the whole to <hi>Aſcyltos,</hi> who ſeem'd little concern'd at it, as having luckily got off for the preſent, and withal aſſur'd himſelf, that we were paſt danger, in that we were neither known, nor ſeen by any one: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it was thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ht fit to pretend a Sickneſs, that we might have the better pretext to keep where we were: But our Monies falling ſhorter than we thought of, and Neceſſity enforcing us, we found it high time to ſell ſome of our Pillage.</p>
            <p>It was almoſt dark, when going into the Brokers Market, we ſaw abundance of things to be bought and ſold: of no extraordinary value, 'tis true; yet ſuch whoſe Night-walking Trade, the dusk of the Evening might eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal. We alſo had the Mantle with us, and taking the opportunity of a blind Corner, fell a ſhaking the Skirt of it, to try if ſo glittering a Shew would bring us a Purchaſer; nor had we been long there, e're a certain Country-man, whom I thought I had ſeen before, came up to us with a Huſſye that follow'd him, and began to conſider the Mantle more
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31214:23"/>
narrowly, as on the other ſide did <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyltos</hi> our Country Chapman's Shoulders, which preſently ſtartled him, and ſtruck him Dumb, nor could my ſelf behold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>em without being concern'd at it, for he ſeemed to me to be the ſame Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that had found the Coat in the Wood, as in truth he was: But <hi>Aſcyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos</hi> doubting whether he might truſt his Eyes or not, and that he might not do any thing raſhly, firſt came nearer to him as a Buyer, and taking the Coat from his Shoulders, began to cheapen, and turn it more carefully. O the wonderful vagaries of Fortune! for the Country-man had not ſo much as examined a Seam of it, but careleſly expoſed it as Beggars-booty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſcyltos</hi> ſeeing the Coat unript, and the Perſon of the Seller contemptible, took me aſide from the Crowd: And don't you ſee Brother, ſaid he, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I made ſuch moan about is return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? That's the Coat with the Gold in't, all ſafe and untoucht: What therefore do we do, or what courſe ſhall we take to get our own again?</p>
            <p>I now comforted, not ſo much that I had ſeen the Booty, but had clear'd my ſelf of the Suſpicion that lay upon me,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:31214:24"/>
was by no means for going about the Buſh, but down right bringing an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt him, That if the Fellow would not give up the Coat to the right owner, we might recover it by Law;</p>
            <l>Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <l>The Cauſe is bad when e'er the Client's Poor:</l>
            <l>Thoſe ſtrickt liv'd Men that ſeem above our World</l>
            <l>Are oft too modeſt to reſiſt our Gold.</l>
            <l>So Judgment, like our other Wares, is ſold;</l>
            <l>And the grave Knight that nods upon the Laws,</l>
            <l>Wak'd by a Fee, Hems, and approves the Cauſe.</l>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſcyltos</hi> on the other ſide afraid of the Law, who, ſaid he, knows us in this place, or will give any credit to what we ſay? I am clear for buying it, tho' we know it to be our own, and rather recover the Treaſure with a little Money, than embroil our ſelves in an uncertain Suit; but we had not above a couple of Groats ready Money, and that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd ſhould buy us ſomewhat to eat. Leaſt therefore the Coat ſhould be gone in the mean time, we agreed, rather than fail, to ſell the Mantle at a lower price, that the Advantage we got by the one, might make what we loſt by the other more eaſie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:31214:24"/>
Aſſoon therefore as we had ſpread open the Mantle, the Woman that ſtood muffled by the Countryman, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pryingly taken notice of ſome to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens about it, forceably laid both hands on't, and ſetting up her Throat, cryed out, Thieves, Thieves!</p>
            <p>We on t'other part being diſordered at it, leſt yet he might ſeem to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, got hold of the totter'd Coat, and as ſpitefully roar'd, they had robb'd us of it: But our caſe was in no wiſe like theirs, and the Rabble that came in to the out-cry, ridicul'd, as they were wont, the weaker ſide, in that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers made claim to ſo rich a Mantle, and we to a ragged Coat, ſcarce worth a good Patch. At this <hi>Aſcyltos</hi> could hardly keep his Countenance; but the noiſe being over, We ſee, ſaid he, how every one likes his own beſt, Give us our Coat, and let them take the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>The Countryman and the Woman lik'd the exchange well enough, but a ſort of Petty-Foggers, moſt of whoſe buſineſs was ſuch Night Practice, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a mind to get the Mantle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as importunately required, that both Mantle and Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

in their hands, and the Judge would hear their complaints on the Morrow: For it was not the things alone that ſeem'd to be in diſpute, but quite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother matter to be enquir'd into, <hi>to wit,</hi> a ſtrong ſuſpicion of Robbery on both ſides.</p>
            <p>At laſt it was agreed to put both into ſome indifferent hand, till the right were determined; when preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, I know not who, with a bald Pate, and a Face full of Pimples, he had been formerly a kind of Solicitor, ſteps out of the Rout, and laying hold on the Mantle, ſaid he'd be Security it ſhould be forth-coming the next day: when in truth he intended nothing more, but that having gotten it into Huckſters hands, it might be ſmugled among them, as believing we would never come to own it, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken up for it; for our part we were as willing as he; and an Accident befriended both of us: For the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man thinking ſcorn of it, that we demanded to have the patcht Coat gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, threw it at <hi>Aſcyltos</hi>'s Head, and diſcharging us of every thing but the Mantle, required that to be ſecur'd as the only cauſe of the Diſpute. Having

therefore recovered, as we thought, our Treaſure, we made all the haſte we could to the Inn, and having ſhut the Door upon us, made our ſelves Merry, as well with the judgment of the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as of our Detracters, who with ſo much circumſpection had reſtor'd us our Money.</p>
            <p>While we were ripping the Coat and taking out the Gold, we overheard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body asking mine Hoſt, what kind of People thoſe were that had juſt now come in, and being ſtartled at it, I went down to ſee what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and underſtood that a City Serjeant, who according to the duty of his Office, took an account of all Strangers, and had ſeen a couple come into the Inn, whoſe Names he had not yet Regiſtred, and therefore inquired of what Country they were, and what way of living they had.</p>
            <p>But mine Hoſt gave me ſuch a blind Account of it, that I began to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:31214:26"/>
We had reſolv'd to keep out of the Broad Streets, and accordingly took our Walk thro' that quarter of the City where we were likely to meet leaſt Company; when in a narrow winding Lane that had not Paſſage thro', we ſaw ſomewhat before us, two comely Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron-like Women, and followed them at a diſtance to a Chappel, which they entred, whence we heard an odd hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming kind of Noiſe, as if it came from the hollow of a Cave: Curioſity alſo made us go in after them, where we ſaw a number of Women, as mad as they had been, Sacrificing to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and each of them an Amulet (the Enſign of <hi>Priapus)</hi> in her Hand. More than that, we could not get to ſee; for they no ſooner perceived us, than they ſet up ſuch a Shout, that the Roof of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhook agen, and witha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nor had we ſooner ſtuff'd our ſelves with the Supper <hi>Gito</hi> had got for us, when a more than ordinary Bounce at the Door, put us into another fright; and when we, pale as Death, ask'd who who was there, 'twas anſwer'd, Open

the Door and you'll ſee: While we were yet talking, the Bolt drop'd off, and the Door flew open, on which, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with her Head muffl'd came in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, but the ſame who a little before had ſtood by the Country-man in the Market: And what, ſaid ſhe, do you think to put a Trick upon me? I am <hi>Quartilla</hi>'s Maid, whoſe Sacred receſs you ſo lately diſturb'd: She is at the Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and deſires to ſpeak with ye: not that ſhe either taxes your Inadvertency, or has a mind to ſo reſent it, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wonders, what God brought ſuch Civil Gentlemen into her Quarters.</p>
            <p>We were ſilent as yet, and gave her the hearing, but inclin'd to neither part of what ſhe had ſaid, when in came <hi>Quartilla</hi> her ſelf, attended with a young Girl, and ſitting down by me, fell a weeping: nor here alſo did we offer a word, but ſtood expecting what thoſe Tears at command meant. At laſt when the Showre had emptied it ſelf, ſhe diſdainfully turn'd up her Hood, and clinching her Fingers together, till the Joints were ready to crack, what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, ſaid ſhe, is this? or where learnt ye thoſe Shamms, and that ſlight of Hand ye have ſo lately been beholding

            <p>For my part it troubled me all Night, and threw me into ſuch a ſhaking, that I was afraid I had gotten a <hi>Tertian,</hi> on which I took ſomewhat to have made me ſleep; but the God appeared to me, and commanded me to riſe and find ye out, as the likelieſt way to take off the violence of the Fit. But I am not ſo much in pain for a remedy, as that a greater anguiſh ſtrikes me to the heart, and will undoubtedly make an end of me, for fear in one of your Youthful Frolicks, you ſhould diſcloſe what you ſaw in <hi>Priapus</hi>'s Chappel, and utter the Counſels of the Gods among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Low as your Knees, I therefore lift my Hands t'ye, that ye neither make Sport of our Night-worſhip, nor

diſhonour the Myſteries of ſo many Years, which, 'tis not every one, even among our ſelves, that knows.</p>
            <p>After this ſhe fell a crying again, and with many a pittiful groan, fell flat on my Bed: when I at the ſame time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween pity and fear, bid her take cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and aſſure her ſelf of both; for that we would neither divulge thoſe holy Myſteries; nor if the God had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd her any other remedy for her A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, be wanting our ſelves to aſſiſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, even with our own hazard.</p>
            <p>At this Promiſe of mine, becoming more chearful, ſhe fell a kiſſing me thick and threefold, and turning the humour of Tears into Laughing, ſhe comb'd up ſome Hair that hung over my Face with her Fingers, and I come to a Truce with ye, ſaid ſhe, and diſcharge ye of the Proceſs I intended againſt you: but if ye ſhou'd refuſe me the Medicine I intreat of ye for the Ague, I have Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows enough will be ready by to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that ſhall both vindicate my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and revenge the Affront ye put upon me.</p>

            <p>Then clapping her Hands together, ſhe turn'd off to ſo violent a Laughter, that made us apprehenſive of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt us; the ſame alſo did the Woman that came in firſt, and the Girl that came with her; but ſo mimically, that ſeeing no reaſon for ſo ſudden a change, we one while ſtar'd on one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and otherwhile on the Woman.</p>

We were all girt up for the purpoſe, and I had ſo contriv'd the Couples, that if it muſt come to a Rancounter, I was to make my part good with <hi>Quartilla, Aſcyltos</hi> with her Woman, and <hi>Gito</hi> the Girl.</p>
            <p>While I was thus caſting the matter in my Head, <hi>Quartilla</hi> came up to me, to cure her of her Ague, but finding her ſelf diſappointed, flew off in a rage, and returning in a little while, told us, there were certain Perſons unknown, had a deſign upon us, and therefore comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to remove us into a Noble Palace.</p>
            <p>Here all our Courage fail'd us, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but certain Death ſeem'd to appear before us.</p>

did not concern him: In the mean time <hi>Pſyche</hi> took off her Garters, and with the one of them bound my Feet, and with the other my Hands.</p>
            <p>Thus fetter'd as I lay, This, Madam, ſaid I, is not the way to rid you of your Ague: I grant it, anſwer'd <hi>Pſyche,</hi> but I have a Doſe at hand will infallibly do it; and therewith brought me a luſty Bowl of <hi>Satyrion.</hi> (a Love-Potion) and ſo merrily ran over the wonderful effects of it, that I had well-nigh ſuck'd it all off: But becauſe <hi>Aſcyltos</hi> had ſlighted her Courtſhip, ſhe finding his Back to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, threw the bottom of it on him.</p>
            <p>

We would have cry'd out, but there was no one near to help us; and as I was offering to bid 'em keep the Peace, <hi>Pſyche</hi> fell a nipping and pricking me with her Bodkin: On the other ſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Plagu'd with theſe miſchiefs, I hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got the leaſt wink of Sleep, nor was the whole Family, whether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doors or without, in a much better condition; ſome lay up and down at our Feet, others had run their Heads againſt the Walls, and others lay dead aſleep croſs the Threſhold: The Lamps alſo having drunk up their Oil, gave a thin and laſt blaze. At this inſtant got in a couple of pilfering Rogues to have ſtollen our Wine; but while they fell a ſcuffling among ſome Silver Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that ſtood upon the Table, they broke the Earthen Pot that held the Wine, and overthrew the Table, with the Plate on it, and at the ſame time alſo, a Cup falling off the Shelf on <hi>Pſyche</hi>'s Bed, broke her Head as ſhe lay faſt aſleep; on which ſhe cry'd out, and therewith diſcovered the Thieves,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31214:30"/>
and wak'd ſome of the Drunkards: The Thieves on the other hand find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in a Pound, threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on one of the Beds, as ſome of the Gueſts, and fell a ſnoring like the reſt. The Uſher of the Hall being by this time got awake, put more Oil in the dying Lamps; and the Boys, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rubb'd their Eyes, return'd to their charge, when in came a Woman that play'd on the Harp, and ratling its Strings, rous'd all the reſt: On which the Banquet was renew'd, and <hi>Quartil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> gave the Word, to go on where we left (that is, Drinking:) The She Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per alſo added not a little to our Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night Revel.</p>
            <p>At laſt bolted in a ſhameleſs Raſcal, one of no Grace either in Words or Geſture, and truly worthy of the Houſe where he was; he alſo ſet up his noice, 'till apiſhly compoſing himſelf, as if he intended ſomewhat to the Company, he mouth'd out theſe Verſes;</p>
            <l>O Yes! Now Tumblers with your wanton Tricks,</l>

Having done with his Poetry, he ſmear'd my Lips with a naſty Kiſs; then getting on our Bed, tugg'd ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have turn'd up our Night-Gowns: Long and hard he kept goring at me, but all to no purpoſe. Great drops of Paint hung like Gum on his Forehead, and came trickling down the wrinkles of his Cheeks like Rain on a naked Wall. Nor could I forbear Tears any longer, but being brought to the laſt extremity, I beſeech you Madam, quoth I, ſure you have commanded to have us ſtifled with Kiſſes.</p>
            <p>When gently clapping her Hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, O Man of Wit, ſaid ſhe, and very original of pleaſant Railery! what, don't you know a Pathick is ever a dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Kiſſer? And therefore that my Companion might not ſcape better than my ſelf, By your Integrity, Madam, quoth I, does <hi>Aſcyltos</hi> alone keep Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-day among us.</p>
            <p>Is it ſo, ſaid ſhe, even let him have his ſhare too: And therewith the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcal chang'd his Horſe, and turning off to <hi>Aſcyltos,</hi> almoſt bray'd him to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with kiſſing and bobbing him. <hi>Gito</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:31214:31"/>
ſtood laughing all the while, 'till he had well-nigh ſplit himſelf; which <hi>Quartilla</hi> perceiving, diligently enquired whoſe Boy he was, and I telling her he was my Comrade, why then, ſaid ſhe, has he not kiſt me? and ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to her, fell at it roundly; and making a flouriſh with his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Pike, this, quoth ſhe, may do well enough for a Fore-Skirmiſh, and get me an appetite to morrow; but having made ſo full a Meal already, it is not my way to put a Churle upon a Gentleman. With that <hi>Pſyche</hi> came tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering to her, and having whiſpered I know not what in her Ear, Thou art in the right, quoth <hi>Quartilla,</hi> 'twas well thought on; and ſince we have ſo fine an opportunity, why ſhould not our <hi>Pannychis</hi> loſe her Maidenhead? And forthwith was brought in a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty young Girl, that ſeem'd not to be above Seven Years of Age, and was the ſame that firſt came into our Room with <hi>Quartilla:</hi> All approv'd it with a general Clap, and next deſiring it, a Wedding was ſtruck up between the Boy and her. For my part I ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd, and aſſur'd them, That neither <hi>Gito,</hi> a baſhful Lad, was able for the

drudgery, nor the Girl of years to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it. Is that all, quoth <hi>Quartilla?</hi> Is ſhe leſs than I was when I firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred on't? A Pox on my <hi>Nanny</hi> if I remember I ever was a Maid; for when I was yet a little one, I went to Creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mouſe with little Boys; and as I grew in Years, I put forwards to bigger, 'till I came to the age you ſee; and truly I think hence came the Proverb:

            </p>
            <p>Leaſt therefore my Comrade might run a greater hazard, I got up to the Wedding.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Pſyche</hi> put a flame-colour Veil on the Girles Head; the Pathick led before with a Flambo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and a long Train of drunken Women, fell a ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dreſt up the Bride-Chamber; <hi>Quartilla</hi> all a-gog as the reſt, took hold of <hi>Gito,</hi> and dragg'd him in with her: But truly the Boy made no reſiſtance; nor ſeem'd the Girl frighted at the name of Matrimony. When therefore they were lockt up, we ſat without, before the Threſhold of the Chamber; and <hi>Quartilla</hi> having waggiſhly ſlit a Chink thro' the Door, as wantonly laid
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31214:32"/>
an Ape's Eye to it; nor content with that, pluck't me alſo to ſee that Childs play, and when we were not peeping, would turn her Lips to me, and ſteal a Kiſs.</p>
            <p>The Jade's fulſomneſs had ſo tir'd me that I began to deviſe which way to get off. I told <hi>Aſcyltos</hi> my mind, and he was well pleaſed with it, for he was as willing to get rid of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Pſyche:</hi> Nor was it hard to be done, if <hi>Gito</hi> had not been lockt up in the Chamber; for we were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to take him with us, and not leave him to the mercy of a Bawdy-houſe. While we were contriving how to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, it ſo happened that <hi>Pannychis</hi> fell out of Bed, and drew <hi>Gito</hi> after her, without any hurt, though the Girl got a ſmall Knock in the fall, and therewith made ſuch a Cry, that <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilla,</hi> all in a fright, ran headlong in, and gave us the opportunity of getting off, and taking the Boy with us; when without more ado, we flew to our Inn, and getting to Bed, paſt the reſt of the Night without fear.</p>
            <p>But going out the next day, whom ſhould we meet but two of thoſe Fellows that robb'd us of the Mantle, which <hi>Aſcyltos</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:31214:33"/>
perceiving, he briskly attack'd one of them, and having diſarm'd and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now came the third day, that is the expectation of an Entertainment at <hi>Trimalchio</hi>'s, where every one might ſpeak what he would: But having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome Wounds, we thought flight might be of more uſe to us than ſitting ſtill: We got to our Inn therefore, as faſt as we could, and our Wounds not being great, cured them as we lay in Bed, with Wine and Oyl.</p>
            <p>But the Rogue whom <hi>Aſcyltos</hi> had hewn down, lay in the Street, and we were in fear of being diſcovered, while therefore we were penſively conſidering which way to avoid the impending Storm, a Servant of <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted our fears: And do not ye know, ſaid he, with whom we eat to day? <hi>Trimalchio,</hi> a trim finical Humo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt has a Clock in his Dining-Room, and one on purpoſe to let him know how many Minutes of his Life he had
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31214:33"/>
loſt. We therefore dreſt our ſelves care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and <hi>Gito</hi> willingly taking upon him the part of a Servant, as he had hither to done, we bad him put our things together, and follow us to the Bath.</p>
            <p>Being in the mean time got ready, we walk'd we knew not where, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having a mind to divert us, ſtruck into a Tennis-Court, where we ſaw an old Bald-pated Fellow in a Carnation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd Coat, playing at Ball with a company of Boys; nor was it ſo much the Boys, tho' it was worth our while, that engaged us to be lookers on as the Maſter of the Houſe himſelf in Pumps, who altogether toſſed the Ball, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſtruck it after it once came to the Ground, but had a Servant by him with a Bag full of them, and enough for all that play'd.</p>
            <p>We obſerved alſo ſeveral new things; for in the Gallery ſtood two Eunuchs, one of whom held a Silver Chamber-pot, the other counted the Balls, not thoſe they kept toſſing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> but ſuch as fell to the Ground. While we admir'd the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, one <hi>Menelaus</hi> came up to us, and told us we were come where we muſt ſet up for the Night, and that we had

ſeen the beginning of our Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. As he was yet talking, <hi>Trimal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio</hi> ſnapp'd his Fingers, at which ſign the Eunuch held the Chamber-pot to him as he was playing; then calling for Water, be dipped the tips of his Fingers in it, and dry'd them on the Boys Head. 'Twould be too long to recount every thing: We went into the Hot-houſe, and having ſweated a little, into the Cold Bath; and while <hi>Trimalchio</hi> was anointed from Head to Foot with a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Perfume, and rubb'd clean again, not with Linnen but the fineſt Flannen, his Three Chyrurgeons ply'd the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcadine, but brawling over their Cups; <hi>Trimalchio</hi> ſaid it was his turn to drink; then wrapt in a Scarlet Mantle, he was laid on a Litter born by Six Servants, with Four Lacqueys in rich Liveries run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before him, and by his ſide a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, in which was carried his Darling, a ſtale bleer eyed Catamite, more Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favoured than his Maſter <hi>Tremalchio;</hi> who as they went on, kept cloſe to his Ear with a Flagellet, as if he had whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered him, and made him muſick all the way. Wondering, we followed, and, with <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> came to the Gate, on which hung a Tablet with this this Inſcription:</p>

            <p>Under the ſame Title alſo, hung a Lamp of two Lights from the Roof of the Room, and two Tablets on either ſide of the Door; of which one, if I well remember, had this Inſcription,</p>

            <p>Full of this Senſuality we were now entring the Room, where one of his Boys, ſet there for that purpoſe, call'd aloud to us, ADVANCE ORDERLY.

            <p>In the mean time while he was ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring his Heap at Play, and we were yet picking a Reliſh here and there, a Cupboard was brought in with a Basket, in which was a Hen Carved in Wood, her Wings lying round and hollow, as ſitting on Brood; when preſently the Conſort ſtruck up, and two Servants fell a ſearching the Straw under her, and taking out ſome Peahens Eggs, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed them among the Company: At this <hi>Trimalchio</hi> changing Countenance, I commanded my Friends, ſaid he, the Hen to be ſet with Peahens Eggs; and ſo help me <hi>Hercules,</hi> am affraid they may be half Hatcht: however we'll try if they are yet Suppable.</p>

my ſhare; for it ſeemed to me to have a Chick in it; till hearing an old Gueſt of the Tables ſaying, It was ſome good Bit or other, I ſearched further into it, and found a delicate fat Wheatear in the middle of a well-pepper'd Yolk: On this <hi>Trimalchio</hi> ſtopped his Play for a while, and requiring the like for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, proclaim'd, If any of us would have any more Metheglin, he was at liberty to take it; when of a ſudden the Muſick gave the Sign, and the firſt Courſe was ſcrabled away by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Singers and Dancers; but in the Ruſtle it happening that a Diſh fell on the Floor, a Boy took it up, and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malchio</hi> taking notice of it, pluck'd him by the Ears, and commanded him to throw it down again; on which the Groom of the Chamber came with a Broom and ſwept away the Silver Diſh, with whatever elſe had fallen from the Table.</p>
            <p>When preſently came in two long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hair'd Blacks, with ſmall Leather Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, ſuch as with which they ſtrew Sand on the Stage, and gave us Wine to waſh our Hands, but no one offered us Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We all admiring the Finicalneſs of the Entertainment, <hi>Mars,</hi> ſaid he, is a

lover of Juſtice, and therefore let every one have a Table to himſelf, for having more Elbow-room, theſe naſty ſtinking Boys will be leſs troubleſome to us; and thereupon large double-Ear'd Veſſels of Glaſs cloſe Plaiſtered over, were brought up with Labels about their Necks, upon which was this Inſcription:</p>
            <p>OPIMIAN MUSCADINE OF AN HUNDRED YEARS OLD.</p>
            <p>While we were reading the Titles, <hi>Trimalchio</hi> clapped his Hands, and Alas, alas, ſaid he, that Wine ſhould live lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than Man! Wine is Life, and we'll try if it has held good ever ſince the Conſulſhip of <hi>Lucius Opimius,</hi> or not: 'Tis right <hi>Opimian,</hi> and therefore make ready; I brought not out ſo good Yeſterday, yet there were Perſons of better Quality Sup'd with me.</p>
            <p>We drank and admired every thing, when in came a Servant with a Silver Puppet, ſo Jointed and put together, that it turned every way; and being more than once thrown upon the Table, caſt it ſelf into ſeveral Figures; on which <hi>Trimalchio</hi> came out with his Poetry:</p>

            <l>Therefore let's live Merrily while we can.</l>
            <p>The Applauſe we gave him, was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with a Service, but reſpecting the place not ſo conſiderable as might have been expected: However, the Novelty of the thing drew every Man's Eye, upon it; it was a large Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, with the twelve Signs round it; upon every one of which the Maſter Cook had laid ſomewhat or other ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Sign: Upon <hi>Aries,</hi> Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Peaſe, (a Pulſe not unlike a Rams-head) upon <hi>Taurus</hi> a piece of Beef; upon <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> a pair of Pendulums and Kidneys: upon <hi>Cancer</hi> a Coronet; upon <hi>Leo</hi> an <hi>African</hi> Figg; upon <hi>Virgo</hi> a well-grown Boy; upon <hi>Libra</hi> a pair of Scales, in one of which was a Tart, in the other a Cuſtard: upon <hi>Scorpio</hi> a Pilchard; upon <hi>Sagittary</hi> a Grey-hound; upon <hi>Capricorn</hi> a Lobſter; upon <hi>Aquarius</hi> a Gooſe; upon <hi>Piſces</hi> two Mullets, and in the middle a Plat of Herbs, cut out like a green Turf, and over them an Honey-comb. During this, a leſſer
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:31214:39"/>
Black carry'd about Bread in a Silver Oven, and with a hideous Voice, forced a Bawdy Song from a Buffoon that ſtunk like <hi>Aſſa Faetida.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Trimalchio</hi> perceived we look'd ſomewhat awkardly on ſuch courſe Fare, Come, come, ſaid he, fall to and Eat, this is the Cuſtom of the place.</p>
            <p>Nor had he ſooner ſaid it, then the fourth Conſort ſtruck up; at which the Waiters fell a Dancing, and took off the upper part of the Charger, under which was a Diſh of cramm'd Fowl, and the hinder Paps of a Sow that had Farrowed but a day before, well Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and in the middle a Hare, ſtuck in with Finns of Fiſh in his ſide, that he look'd like a Flying Horſe; and on the ſides of the Fiſh four little Images, that ſpouted a reliſhing Sauce on ſome Fiſh that lay near them, all of them brought from the River <hi>Euripus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We alſo ſeconded the Shout begun by the Family, and fell merrily aboard this; and <hi>Trimalchio</hi> no leſs pleas'd than our ſelves, cryed <hi>Cut;</hi> at which the Muſick ſounding again, the Carver hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd it, and cut up the Meat with ſuch Antick Poſtures, you'd have thought him a Car-man fighting to an Organ.</p>

Nevertheleſs <hi>Trimalchio</hi> in a lower Note, cryed out again <hi>Cut:</hi> I hearing the word ſo often repeated, ſuſpecting there might be ſome Joke in it, was not aſhamed to ask him that ſat next above me, what it meant? And he that had been often preſent at the like, You ſee, ſaid he, him that Carves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, his Name is <hi>Cutter;</hi> and as often as he ſays <hi>Cut,</hi> he both Calls and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>The Humour ſpoiled my Stomach for eating; but turning to him that I might learn more, I made ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Diſcourſe to him at a diſtance; and at laſt asked him what that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was that ſo often ſculted up and down the Room.</p>
            <p>It is, ſaid he, <hi>Trimalchio</hi>'s Wife, her Name <hi>Fortunata,</hi> ſhe meaſures Money by the Buſhel; but what was ſhe not long ſince? Pardon me Sir, you would not have touch'd her with a pair of Tongs, but now, no one knows how or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſhe's got into Heaven; and is <hi>Trimalchio</hi>'s <hi>all in all:</hi> In ſhort, if ſhe ſays it is Mid-night at Mid-day, he'll believe her. He's ſo very Wealthy, he knows not what he has; but ſhe has an Eye every where; and when you

O happy Man! but have a care how you put a ſlight on thoſe Freed Men, they are Rich Rogues: See you him that ſits at the lower-end of the Table, he has now the Lord knows what; and 'tis not long ſince he was not worth a Groat, and carried Billets and Faggots at his Back: It is ſaid, but I know nothing of it my ſelf, but as I have heard, either he got in with an old Hog-grubbler, or had to do with an <hi>Incubus,</hi> and found a Treaſure: For my part, I envy no Man, (if God gives any thing it is a Bit and a Blow, and wills no Evil to himſelf) he lately ſet up this Proclamation:</p>

            <p>But what think you of him who ſits in the place of a late Slave? how well was he once? I do not upbraid him: He was once worth a Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Seſterſtias,</hi> but has not now a Hair of his Head that is not Engaged; nor,

And what Trade do you think he drove?

            <p>The Diſh was by this time taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the Gueſts grown merry with Wine, began to talk of what was done abroad, when <hi>Trimalchio</hi> broke the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and leaning on his Elbow, this Wine, ſaid he, is worth drinking, and Fiſh muſt ſwim; but do you think I

ſo that theſe Veſſels are neither this nor that Metal, but made of all of them. Pardon me what I ſay; however others may be of another mind, I had rather have Glaſs Ware; and if it were not ſo ſubject to breaking, I'd reckon it before Gold; but now it is of no eſteem.</p>
            <p>There was a Copper-Smith that made Glaſs Veſſels of that pliant hardneſs, that they were no more to be broken than Gold and Silver ones: It ſo happened, that having made a Drinking-pot, with a wide Mouth of that kind, but the fineſt Glaſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He laughs! what has he to laugh at? what Wooll did his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give for the Bantling? Is he a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Knight? I am the Son of a King. How came I then, you'll ſay, to ſerve another? I did it of my ſelf, and had rather be a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> than a Tributary King, and now hope to live ſo, as to be no Man's Jeaſt.

            <p>We all wondred, as not doubting what he ſaid, and kiſſing the Table in reverence to him, pray'd the privilege of the Night, and that our Places might be kept till we returned.</p>

Thus one while we were Grave, and other while Merry.</p>
            <p>After this came Junkets and made Diſhes, the very remembrance of which, if I may be believed, will not yet down with me; for there were ſeveral cram'd Hens given about under the notion of Thruſhes, and Gooſe Eggs with Caps upon them; which <hi>Trimalchio,</hi> nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Oſtentation, preſs'd us to Eat; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withal, that their Bones were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out.</p>

               <hi>Trimalchio</hi> was pleaſed with the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and calling for a bigger Glaſs, asked him what Entertainment he had whence he came?</p>

            <p>This Drunken Preſumption put us out of order; yet caſting an eye on the Combatants, we ſaw Oiſters and Scallops running from the Pots, and another Boy receiving them in a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which he carried round the Gueſts.</p>
            <p>Nor was the Cook's Ingenuity ſhort of the reſt, for he brought us a Diſh of grill'd Snails on a Silver Gridiron, and with a ſhrill unpleaſant Voice, Sang as he went.

Being weary at length, he ſate down, and provok'd by the noiſineſs of the Bath, ſet up his drunken Throat, and fell a murdering ſome Songs of <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> as they that underſtood him told us.</p>
            <p>Other Gueſts ran round the Ciſtern with their Arms acroſs, and made a clamorous ſlap with their Mouths; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers either try'd to take up a Ring from the Pavement, with their Hands bound behind them, or putting one Knee to the ground, to kiſs their great Toes backward.</p>

Come my Friends, let's ſee how Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ye can be, for in my time I have been no better than your ſelves, but by my own induſtry I am what I am: 'Tis the Heart makes a Man, all the reſt is but ſtuff. I buy cheap and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But as I was ſaying my Frugality brought the fortune I have: I came out of <hi>Aſia</hi> no taller than this Candleſtick, and daily meaſured my ſelf by it: and that I might get a Beard the ſooner, rubb'd my Lips with the Candle-greaſe; yet I kept <hi>Ganymede</hi> to my Maſter four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Years (nor is any thing diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that the Maſter commands) and the ſame time contented my Miſtreſs: Ye know what I mean, I'll ſay no more, for I am no boaſter.

                  </gap>by day-break,</q>to eaſe me of my grief, and thoughts of my injury, I rov'd about every where, till at laſt going into a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Gallery, very wonderful for ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orts of excellent Painting; I ſaw ſome by <hi>Zeuxy</hi>'s hand, that had not yet yielded to the injures of time: And, not without an awful reverence, behold others by <hi>Protogenes,</hi> which tho they were firſt try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, yet diſputed for exactneſs, even with Nature it ſelf: but on the other ſide view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Celebrated Piece drawn by <hi>Apelles;</hi> I even ador'd the Work of ſo Great a Maſter: 'twas ſo correctly finiſht to the life, you'd have ſworn it an Image of the Soul too. One ſide gave the Story of the Eagle Bearing <hi>Jupiter</hi> to Heaven, the other the fair <hi>Hylas</hi> repelling the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of the lew'd <hi>Naiad:</hi> in another part was <hi>Apollo,</hi> angry at himſelf for killing his Boy <hi>Hyacinth;</hi> and, to ſhew his love, crown'd his Harp with the Flower that ſprung form his Blood.</p>
            <p>In this Gallery, as in a Viſion of living Images, I cry'd out; And are not the Gods themſelves ſecure from love? <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> in his Seraglio above, not finding one that can pleaſe his appetite, ſins upon Earth, yet injures no body: the Nymph wou'd have ſtifl'd her paſſion for <hi>Hylas,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:31214:81"/>
had ſhe believ'd the luſty <hi>Hercules</hi> wou'd have been his Rival: <hi>Apollo</hi> turns <hi>Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinth</hi> into a Flower: and every Image enjoy'd its Wiſhes without a Rival: but I have careſs'd, as the deareſt Friend, the greateſt Villian.</p>
            <p>While I was thus talking to my ſelf, there enter'd the Gallery an old Man, with a Face as pale as age had made his Hair; and ſeem'd, I know not how, to bring with him the air of a great ſoul; but viewing his Habit, I was eaſily confirm'd in my opinion, ſince Fortune ſeldom deals favourably with Learned Men. In ſhort, he made up to me, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf, told me he was a Poet; and, as he hop'd, above the common herd: if, added he, my merrit don't ſuffer by Applauſe that's promiſcuouſly given, to the good and bad.</p>
            <p>Why therefore, interrupted I, are you ſo meanly Clad? On this account return'd he, becauſe Learning never made any man rich.</p>
            <l>The Merchant's profit well rewards his toil:</l>
            <l>The Souldier crowns his Labours with the Spoil:</l>
            <l>To ſervile Flattery we Altars raiſe:</l>
            <l>And the kind Wife her Stallion ever pays:</l>

But ſtarving Wit in rags takes barren pain:</l>
            <l>And, dying, ſeeks the Muſes Aid in vain.</l>
            <p>'Tis certain, added he, that a Lover of Virtue, on the account of his ſingularity, meets with contempt; for who can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove what differs from himſelf? And that thoſe who admire Riches, wou'd fain poſſeſs every body, that nothing is more reaſonable than their Opinion; whence they ridicule, as well as they can, the Learned few; that they, like themſelves, might ſeem within the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Money.</p>

               <q>You miſtake me, ſaid I, that's not the occaſion of my ſighs, there's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and much greater Cauſe: And, as all Men are Naturally inclin'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their grief; I laid open my Caſe to him, beginning with <hi>Aſcyltos</hi>'s Treachery,</q> which I aggravated; and, with repeated ſighs, often wiſht his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to me might have deſerv'd pardon: but that now he was a ſtaunch Villain, and in Luſt more ſubtle than the Bawds themſelves.</p>

               <q>The Old Man, ſeeing me ſincere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to comfort me; and the better to effect it, told me what formerly had happen'd to himſelf on the like occaſion</q>

            <p>When I was in <hi>Aſia, began he,</hi> I Lodg'd at the Houſe of one <hi>Pergamus:</hi> where the Entertainment did not tempt me to ſtay ſo much, as a very beautiful Boy I ſaw there, Son to the Maſter of the houſe: my contrivance was to act the Lover, unſuſpected by the Father: and to effect my Wiſhes, I us'd this method: when ever in their mirth they happen'd to mention the uſe of beautiful Boys, I diſſembl'd ſuch a horrour of it, and with that ſevere concern pretended my modeſty ſuffer'd by ſuch diſcourſe, that the Mother, eſpecially, lookt upon me as a Philoſopher, that was above the little pleaſures of the world. Upon this I was deſir'd to be Tutor to the Boy, not only to inſtruct him in a Method of ſtudy, but imform his Mind with Principles of Honour and Honeſty, leſt they ſhould by accident entertain ſome man that might have wicked deſigns on his body.</p>

            <p>Hearing the Reward, he began to ſnore; upon which, I greedily ſeiz'd my wiſhes: ſatisfi'd with this beginning, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the next morning, the Boy expecting it, I perform'd my promiſe.

to morrow, I'll preſent him with a <hi>Turkiſh-Barb,</hi> on this condition that he does not feel me; upon which, he diſſembled the ſecureſt Sleep I ever knew: wild to enjoy, I preſt his ſnowy breaſts, that ſwelling ſeem'd to meet my hands, and, half ſmothering him with Kiſſes, haſten'd to that laſt and greateſt joy that bounded all my wiſhes: The Morning after, he waited as he us'd in the Bed-Chamber, expecting me: You may imagine, the Turtles and Cocks were eaſier to be purchaſt, than ſo fine a Horſe: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Charge, I fear'd ſo great a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, might make my Honourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions for the Boy ſuſpected: on this account, I delay'd my Viſit ſome hours; when going to him, waving the uſual Ceremonies, I only Kiſt him; the Boy, as his Arms were about my neck, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round; I beſeech you, Sir, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> where's the Horſe?</p>
            <p>
               <q>The difficulty of getting a Fine one, <hi>return'd I,</hi> made me defer the Preſent, but in a few days I'll be as good as my word: the Boy well knew the meaning of my delay, and his Countenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd a Reſentment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This breach of my word put a ſtop to the Commerce, but Fortune regain'd it;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31214:84"/>
for not many days after, another Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val gave me the ſame priviledge I had at firſt: tir'd with ſports, when I found his Father aſleep, I began to ask the Boy to be Friends with me, that is, that he wou'd give me the Favours he had kept from me, or any thing impatient Nature ſhou'd inſpire: he, perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He was not diſpleas'd with my vigour, but after a long complaint that he was cheated, laught at and ſhould beabus'd among his Schoolfellows, whom he had poſſeſt with an opinion of my being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich, ſince I had promis'd him a Horſe: To ſhew you, added he, that you ſhan't meet with the ſame ingratitude from me, if you have inclinations to repeat your Wiſhes, do it freely: I, laying aſide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This diſcourſe diverting my grief, I began to queſtion the old Gentleman about the Antiquity of ſome Pieces, the Stories of others I was not acquainted with, the Reaſon why this Age don't come up to the former, and why the moſt excellent Arts are loſt, of which Painting has not left the leaſt ſign of its being?

            <p>The Rage I was in to be ſo abus'd, put me upon Hanging my ſelf; and having ty'd an Apron, I found in the Room, to the Bed-ſtead, committed my Neck to the Nooſe I had made with its Strings: When <hi>Eumolpus</hi> and <hi>Gito</hi> came to the Door, and entering, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my Deſign: <hi>Gito,</hi> his Grief grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Rage, made a great out-cry, and forcing me on the Bed, you're miſtaken, ſaid he, <hi>Eucolpius,</hi> if you fancy it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you to dye before me: I was firſt in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31214:91"/>
an Inſtrument of Death: But had not you come to my Relief in the <hi>Bath,</hi> I had reſolv'd to throw my ſelf out of the Window: And that you may know how ready Death is to wait thoſe that deſire it; ſee—I've got that you ſo lately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd.</p>
            <p>Upon which, having ſnatch'd a Raſor from <hi>Eumolpus</hi>'s Servant, he ſtruck three or four times at his Throat, and fell down before us; frightned at the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I cry'd out, and falling upon him e're he had reach'd the Ground, with the ſame Weapon endeavour'd to follow him: But neither had <hi>Gito</hi> any appearance of a Wound, nor did I feel my ſelf hurt: For it happen'd to be a dull Raiſor, deſign'dly made ſo, to prepare Learners of the Art to handle a ſharper: Which was the reaſon <hi>Eumolpus</hi> did not offer to prevent our Mimick Deaths, nor his Man look concern'd when the Raiſor was ſnatch'd from him.</p>
            <p>While this Scene was Acting, the Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Keeper came in upon us, with the other part of our Supper; and viewing the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene poſture we were in, I beſeech you, Sirs, ſaid he, are ye Drunk, or have fled Juſtice, and are Acting it on your ſelves, or both? ho! who was going to make a

Gibet of the Bed? What private deſigns are here on foot? What—was your going out but now with intent to Bilk me? But you ſhall feel for't: I'll ſoon make ye know who rules here.</p>
            <p>What, you Raſcal, Crys <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> do you threat too? And without more ado flung his Fiſt in his face: The Inn-Keeper took up an Earthen Pitcher we ſo oft had empty'd, and ſending it at <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> broke his Forehead, and immediately ran down Stairs: <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> impatient of Revenge, ſnatching up a great Wooden Candleſtick, made after him; and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his blows very thick on the Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Keeper, repair'd the injury with Intereſt: This alarm'd the whole Houſe, and whilſt the reſt of his Gueſs, that by this time were moſt of 'em Drunk; ran to ſee what was the matter, taking an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to revenge the injury <hi>Eumol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> had offer'd me, I lock'd him out; and turning thus his trick upon himſelf, at once, enjoy'd the Bed and Board with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Rival.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Iſlanders (that came in at the buſtle) and Cooks with all their Kitchin Artillery ſet upon <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molpus:</hi> One throws at his head a hot Spit with the Meat on't; another with

a Pitchfork puts himſelf in a Martial po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture againſt him; but eſpecially a Blear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ey'd Old Woman, who tucking up the dirty Apron ſhe had about her, with one Shoe on, and another off, hall'd a great Maſtiff and ſet him at <hi>Eumolpus:</hi> But with the wooden Candleſtick he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended himſelf againſt all his Enemies.</p>
            <p>We ſaw all through a Hole they had made by wrenching the Latch from the Door: I wiſh'd him well you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; but <hi>Gito</hi> had Compaſſion, and wou'd have ſuccour'd the Diſtreſt <hi>Eumol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus;</hi> upon which, my Rage continuing, I gave his pitying Head two or three blows with my Fiſt; he ſate down on the Bed and cry'd: But I ſo eagerly ply'd the Hole, I made my Eyes relieve each other; and, encouraging the People a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, with great ſatisfaction beheld the conſlict: when the Bailiff of the Iſland, one <hi>Bargates,</hi> whom the Scuffle had rais'd from Supper; was brought into the Room, ſupported by others Legs, for he was ſo troubl'd with the Gout, he cou'd not uſe his own: And having in his Clowniſh manner, with a great deal of heat, made a long Harangue againſt Drunkards and Vagabonds, looking on <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> ha! what is it you, ſays he,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31214:93"/>
the Excellent Poet? What—has theſe Rogues been abuſing you all this while?</p>

            <p>While <hi>Eumolpus</hi> was thus ingag'd with <hi>Bargates,</hi> the Cryer of the Town, and ſome other Officer, attended with a great Concourſe of People, entred the Inn; and, ſhaking a ſmoaky rather than light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Torch he carried, mouths out this; <hi>viz.</hi>

I ſhou'd prevent from juſtly falling upon, others, may light on my own head.</p>
            <p>This ſuperſtitious Harangue, turn'd <hi>Tryphaena</hi> from hindring our puniſhment to haſten its execution. When ſhe began afreſh as highly to reſent the former af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts that was offer'd her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> as <hi>Lycas</hi> did the repute of his modeſty that he had loſt in the peoples eſteem.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When <hi>Lycas</hi> found <hi>Tryphaena</hi> was with himſelf eagerly inclin'd to revenge, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to increaſe our puniſhments, which when <hi>Eumolpus</hi> perceiv'd, he endeavour'd to mitigate after this manner.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I pity the wretches, ſaid he, that lie at your mercy.</q>—<hi>Lycas,</hi> they implore your compaſſion, and chooſing me as a man not altogether unknown to 'em to perform the office, deſire to be reconcil'd to them they once held moſt dear. Can you believe, 'twas by accident they fell into your hands, when all Paſſengers make it their chief buſineſs to enquire to whoſe care they are to truſt themſelves? When you are ſatisfied of their intentions, can you be ſo barbarous to continue your revenge, but ſuffer free born men to go uninjur'd where they have deſign'd. Even barbarous and implacable Maſters allay their cruelty when their Slaves repent;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31214:103"/>
and all give quarter to the Enemy that ſurrenders himſelf. What can you, or will you deſire more? you have at your feet repenting Supplicants; they're Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and men of worth; and what's more prevailing than both, were once careſs'd as your deareſt Friends. Had they rob'd you of your Money, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd your truſt, by <hi>Hercules</hi> the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment they've inflicted on themſelves might have ſatisfied your rage; don't you ſee the marks of Slaves on their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; who, though free, to attone their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries to you, preſcrib'd themſelves.</p>
            <p>To avoid confuſion, interrupted <hi>Lycas,</hi> give me a reaſon for all particulars as I ſhall ask you; and firſt, if they came with deſign to ſurrender themſelves, why did they cut off their hair? for all Diſguiſes are aſſum'd rather to deceive than ſatisfie the injur'd.</p>
            <p>Next, if they expected to ingratiate themſelves by their Embaſſadour, why have you endeavoured in every thing, to conceal them you were to ſpeak for? whence it plainly appears, 'twas by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the offenders were brought to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and that you have us'd this Artifice to divert our ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:31214:104"/>
Sure you thought to raiſe our envy, by ringing in our ears, that they were Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and Men of Worth; but have a care their cauſe don't ſuffer by your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence; what ſhou'd the injur'd do when the guilty come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I am ſencible, ſaid <hi>Eumolpus,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this dreadful Harangue, that nothing cou'd happen to theſe unhappy Young men more unfortunate, than the cutting their hair off at midnight, which is the only argument that may perſwade you to miſtake their voluntary coming here, for accidental; but I ſhall as candidly endeavour to undeceive you, as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently acted: before they imbarkt they had deſigns to eaſe their heads of that, as trouble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:31214:104"/>
What advantage, reply'd <hi>Lycas,</hi> cou'd they propoſe to themſelves by the loſs of their hair? unleſs they thought baldneſs might ſooner raiſe our compaſſion: Or can you believe I wou'd be ſatisfy'd in your relation? when addreſſing himſelf to me, What Poyſon, ſaid he, thou Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain has eat your hair off? To what God have your Sacrilegious hands offer'd it?</p>
            <p>The fear of puniſhment ſtruck me ſpeechleſs; nor cou'd I find any thing to urge in my defence againſt ſo plain an accuſation. Then the confuſion I was in, my disfigur'd face, with the equal bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my Head and Eye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>brows, gave a ridiculous air to every thing I ſaid or did; but when they wip'd us with a wet Spunge, the Letters melting into one, ſpread o're our Faces ſuch a ſooty cloud that turn'd <hi>Lycas</hi>'s rage to a perfect loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Eumolpus</hi> cou'd not endure to ſee free-born men againſt all Law and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſo abus'd, and returning their threats with blows, not only was our advocate but Champion too. He was ſeconded by his Man and two or three ſick Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers appear'd our Friends, that ſerv'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>

Upon which I was ſo far from begging pardon, that without any reſpect I held my Fiſts at <hi>Tryphaena,</hi> and plainly told her ſhe ſhou'd feel me, if her lecherous Ladiſhip, who only in the Ship deſerv'd to be puniſht, was not content to decline her pretentions to <hi>Gito.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Angry <hi>Lycas</hi> was all rage at my impudence; and very impatient of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge when he found, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for my own cauſe, I only ſtood up for anothers.</p>
            <p>Nor was <hi>Tryphaena</hi> leſs diſturb'd at my contempt of her; at what time every one in the Veſſel chooſe his ſide, and put himſelf in a poſture of defence.</p>
            <p>On our ſide <hi>Eumolpus</hi>'s Slave diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Inſtruments of his Trade, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd a Razor to defend his own perſon; on the other, <hi>Tryphaena</hi> and her Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance advanc'd, arm'd with nothing but their Nails and Tongues; which laſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd the want of Drums in their Army; when the Pilot, crying out, threaten'd he wou'd leave the Ship to the mercy of the waves if they continu'd the buſtle rais'd about the luſt of two or three Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds.</p>
            <p>This did not in the leaſt retard the ſight; they preſſing for revenge, we for

our lives: In ſhort, many fell half dead on both ſides; others withdrew, as from greater Armies, to be dreſt of their Wounds; yet this damps not the rage of either ſide.</p>
            <p>Then the bold <hi>Gito</hi> drawing out that part of him, <hi>Tryphaena</hi> moſt admird, clapt a bloody Razor to't, and threaten'd to cut away the cauſe of all our Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. But <hi>Tryphaena</hi> did not ſaintly ſend to prevent ſo cruel an act: I often of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon this, both ſides drew up their ranks, when the Pilot perceiving how Commical a War it was, with much ado was perſwaded to let <hi>Tryphaena</hi> diſpatch an Herauld to capitulate: Articles imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately according to the Cuſtom of Countries being mutually agreed off on both ſides; <hi>Tryphaena</hi> ſnatcht an Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branch, the Enſign of Peace, that ſtuck to the Image of Proſperity pictur'd in the Ship, and holding it in the midſt of us, thus addreſt her ſelf.</p>

            <p>Conditions thus agreed on, we laid down our Arms: And, leaſt my grudge might ſtill remain, wipe off the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all things paſt, in repeated Kiſſes.</p>
            <p>All Quarrels expir'd in univerſal ſhouts, and a ſumptuous Banquet that follow'd, ſpread equal Mirth through the whole Company: The Veſſel rung with Songs, the Enſigns of their Joy: And the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of a ſudden Calm, gave other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions: Here a little Artiſt bob'd for Fiſh, that riſing, ſeem'd with haſte to meet their ruin: There another draws the unwilling Prey, that he had betray'd on the Hook, with an inviting Bait: When looking up, we ſaw Sea-Birds ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the Sail-Yard, about which, one skill'd in that Art, having plac'd LimeTwigs,

            <p>
               <hi>We don't unwillingly obey when we're commanded to eat or live.</hi> The Lady now dry with ſo long faſting, ſuffer'd her ſelf to be o'recome; nor was leſs pleas'd with her Entertainment, than her Maid that firſt ſurrender'd. <hi>You know with what

            <l>E're you conſider in whoſe Tents you are?</l>
            <p>To make ſhort: nor even in this cou'd the Lady deny him any thing: Thus our victorious Souldier ſucceeded in both; ſhe receiv'd his Imbraces; not only that night they ſtruck up the bargain, but the next and third day: Having ſhut the door of the Vault, that if any of her acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or ſtrangers had come out of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to ſee her, they might have believ'd the moſt chaſt of all Women, had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pir'd on the body of her Husband. Our Souldier was ſo taken with his beautiful Miſtreſs, and the privacy of injoying her, that the little Money he was Maſter of, he laid out for her Entertainment, and, as ſoon as 'twas night, convey'd it into the Vault.</p>

In the mean time the Relations of one of the Malefactors, finding the Body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded, drew it from the Croſs and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd it. The Souldier thus rob'd while he was in the Vault, the next day, when he perceiv'd one of the Bodies gone, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the puniſhment, he told the Lady what had happen'd; and, added that with his Sword he wou'd prevent the Judges Sentence; if ſo be ſhe wou'd pleaſe to give him Burial, and make that place at once the fatal Monument of a Lover and a Husband.</p>
            <p>The Lady, not leſs merciful than chaſt; Nor wou'd Heaven allow, ſaid ſhe, that I ſhou'd at once feel the loſs of the only two in the world I held moſt dear; I'd rather hang up the dead Body of the one, than be the wicked inſtrument of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death.

I could not reſtrain my Tears; but, beating my Breaſt, Now where's, ſaid I, your Rage? where your unruly Paſſions? now you're expos'd a prey to Fiſh and Beaſts; and the poor Shipwrackt wretch, with all his boaſted power, now has not one Plank of the great Ship he proudly call'd his own. After this, let Mortals flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves with Golden Dreams; let the weary Miſer heap up ill-got Wealth for many years; 'twas but ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday this lifeleſs thing was priding in its Riches, and had fixt the very day he thought to return. How ſhort, alas! lyes the poor wretch of his deſign! but 'tis not the Sea only we ſhould fear: one the Wars deceive; another by ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental ruin, even at the Altar, meets a Grave; a third by a fall in running an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates his arrival to the Goal; eating oft kills the Greedy; and Abſtinence the Temperate. If we rightly conſider it, in this Sea of Life we may be Shipwrackt every where; but we vainly lament the want of Burial to a wretch that's drown'd; as if it concern'd the periſhing Carcaſs, whether Flames, Worms, or Fiſhes were its <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals.</hi> Whatever way you are conſum'd, the end of all's the ſame. But Fiſh, they object, will tear their Bodies; as if their

            <p>After theſe Reflections, we perform'd the laſt office for the dead, and, tho' his Enemies, honour'd him with a Funeral Pile; but while <hi>Eumolpus</hi> was making an Epitaph, his Eyes roam'd here and there, to find an Image that might raiſe his Fancy.</p>
            <p>When we had willingly acquitted our ſelves of this piece of Humanity to <hi>Lycas,</hi> we purſu'd our deſign'd Journey, and all in a ſweat ſoon reacht the head of a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Hill, from whence we diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Town ſeated on the top of a high Mountain; we did not know it, till a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd inform'd us 'twas <hi>Crotona;</hi> the moſt ancient and once moſt flouriſhing City of <hi>Italy;</hi> when we enquir'd of him what ſort of People inhabited this renown'd place, and what kinds of Commerce they chiefly maintain'd, ſince they were impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh'd by ſo many Wars?</p>

            <p>But even here <hi>Eumolpus</hi> returning to his old humour: Young men, began he, this Poetry deceives many; for not only every one that is able to give a Verſe its numbers, and ſpin out his feeble ſence in a long train of words, has the vanity to think himſelf inſpir'd; but Pleaders at the Bar, when they wou'd give themſelves a looſe from buſineſs, apply themſelves to Poetry, as an Entertainment without trouble; believing it eaſier to compile a Poem than maintain a Controverſie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with a few florid Sentences<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

much troubl'd; but to allay his concern, I told him I was only a little weary, and had a mind for a Nap.

            <p>He was hardly gone, e're <hi>Chryſis</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd my Chamber, and gave me a Billet from her Miſtreſs, in which I found this written:</p>
