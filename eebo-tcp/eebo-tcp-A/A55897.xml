            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Torne in peices and blowne away.</p>
            <p>THe sandg, that is the incohaerent selfe-devid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; selfe-forsakeing speech, that endeavours to show how the same man, might both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne and acquite the same man (the Earle of <hi>Strafforde</hi>) doth not so much call for the stroke of an hammer, to batter it, as a puffe of wind to blow it away, to encounter it with the Votes of the two houses of Parliament, with the Vnited opinion of the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, with the learned Argument in Westminster Hall (before the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mittees of both houses) were to Kill a fly with an Axe, and to honor, rather then to overthrow it. For certainely the strength of it, is onely great in the kindnesse (that I say not the weakenesse) of the Reader, stealeing a way the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, not convincing the Iudgment; if Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be raised from it; they are such as neede an Hospitall, being blinde and lame, if Arguments
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93464:3"/>
be raised against it the speech falls before them, like grasse before the Mower.</p>
            <p>Will you see an Argument of this paper, and indeed a paper Argument?</p>
            <p>If it doth not appeare to him by two Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes, that the Army of Ireland was to bee brought over to reduce this Kingdome then the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> is not guilty of High Treason.</p>
            <p>Now doth he beleeue himselfe in this proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he seeth divers other charges of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son besides laide against him; if three or foure trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons bee obiected and proued, is it a sufficient cause of cleareing if on be not proued to his mind, and as he sayes but by a single Testimony, though the other by more? if the Authour can not bee drawne to a better beleife by the cordes of Reason, I thinke he would certainely be drawne to it, by the cordes of a comparison. If himselfe were tyed with three or foure cordes, and a friend had freed hym from one, would he tell his friend, let me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone for I am free enough, though I am bound by the rest; surely I thinke the other cordes (after some stay at least) would perswade him to change his minde by his inability to change his place.</p>
            <p>But faults in this paper doe not goe alone For is he not willingly blind when he sees not the very clause, Of reducing this Kingdome by an Irish Army manefestly appearing in the former, and as it were looking him in the face? For a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Testimony of two witnesses saith, that his Majestie is absolued from all rules of Gouerment and may doe what power will admitt: certainly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93464:3"/>
most besides himselfe doe see what power will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt the vse of an Irish Army and any other that the same power can purchasc, or command. So that where hee quarrels for want of an Irish Army hee hath gotten now about his eares, <hi>Irish, English, Dutch.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But yet againe he multeplies and is fruitfull in absurdeties. He sayes, that he hath no notion of subuerting Law treasonable but onely by force; certainely this Argument then will neuer subuert the Law, for it hath no force in it, it is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken onely from his owne Ignorance, and runs, or rather haults thus, he knowes no other therefore there is no other: to frame this right it should runn thus.</p>
            <p>There is no way of Subuerting the Law, but that which <hi>I</hi> know, but <hi>I</hi> know no way of subuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Law, but by force. Now in the first of these is to much knowledge, and in the latter to much Ignorance.</p>
            <p>But who sayth this? Is it some auncient Iudge or Father of the Law, that hath swallowed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested the great volumes of that iudicious and weighty profession? Or is it the speech of one that lookes more into the Courte then the Innes off Court? <hi>I</hi> pray behold an Engine strongly framed to lift up and ouerpoyse the trust and beleife of a whole Kingdom in point of Law, <hi>A young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Knowes it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if he be not skilfull in common Law, he may be some what skillfull in common Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and that may tell him; that if nothing but force
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93464:4"/>
can subvert Law, then Iudges can not subvert Law upon the seates of Iustice; For though they willfully pronounce iudgment contrary to Law; stop lawfull defences and rob the Subject of the benefit of Law; aud let loose the prerogatiue upon the Law to destroy it, except they driue the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects away from Courts of iustice by Halberds &amp; <hi>Guns</hi>; they may take the Law from them by false iudgments, denying <hi>Prohibitions Habeas corpus,</hi> &amp; all Legall Remedies and yet not subuert the Law. If this Authors estate should be lost by this way of Iniustice, he may comfort himselfe (and let it be his comfort alone) that it is not lost by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Law. O unhappy <hi>Tresilian</hi> that thou didst not liue in the times, when such Patronages might haue beene giuen thee, for then mightest thou have liued out thy time; since thou couldst not committ Treason by subverting the Iron Lawes, but onely by Iron.</p>
            <p>And now I am fallen upon <hi>Tresilian,</hi> I may not forgett this Authors Argument, to which this <hi>Tresilian</hi> will giue an vnhappy conclusion.</p>
            <p>He argues thus:</p>
            <p>The Earle of Straffords practises have beene as high, as tyrannicall, as ever any. But the practises of <hi>Tresilian</hi> and others haue been as high as high-Treason. Therefore the Earle of Straffords prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises haue beene as high as high Treason.</p>
            <p>Thus you see how this Author with the helpe of <hi>Tresilian</hi> hath pronounced sentence against the E. of Strafford. So that if he had no other Iudge this one thus assisted would condemne him, when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93464:4"/>
he goes about to save him.</p>
            <p>But that is nothing to the purpose, that he is condemned; for though he be condemned; and so condemned, that hee can never be absolved till he be dispatcht into another world, yet this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor will not have a hand in this dispatct.</p>
            <p>A mercifull Inference and most unsutable to the premises, especially if it come out of the mouth of a Iudge. Marke how it soundes in such a mouth, I being a Iudge condemne you as guilty of murher or of as high a treason as ever any, but I will haue no hand in your sentence or dispatch. If Iudges should ride their Circuits and end their Assies in this Logicke, granting the premises, and denying the conclusion, were it not most vaine &amp; a meere mockery of Iustice? For it were only to fi<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d faultes and not to correct them, and to turne iustice into meere wordes. It would shortly make a kingdome a den of Theeues, murderers and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and safe for none to dwell in; no not for those that teach this doctrine; though they may be thought by teaching to deserue it. <hi>Nec enim Lex equiar vlla &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, who can beleeve this mans suspitions ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Henry Vanes</hi> Oath vpon advised Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection? And oath that gets an addition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leife from the speeches going before (joyntly te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifyed by the Truely Noble Earle of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi>) and backt by a memoriall written the same day when the words were spoken: which words cald venemous by this paper, had their venome from the speaker, not the hearer, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93464:5"/>
Recorded the same day wherein they were spoken, did arise thereby to such a pregnance of Testimony, that it became very great, and might in a wise mans eye (be it <hi>M. Pym</hi> or any other) looke very neare as big as two.</p>
            <p>But though the Testimonyes be big, or many, and the charges many also; and the Earle of Strafford as high and Tyrannicall in practises as ever any (by this authors confession) yet he must at once be both condemned, and saved. Though in his saving, the <hi>Votes</hi> of both Houses be condemned, and the Kingdome and law in danger not to be saved.</p>
