            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ADVERTISEMENT FROM THE PUBLISHER.</head>
            <p>THE Author of the following Sheets, being engag'd to no Sect nor Party of Men, nor biaſs'd by any particular Syſtem of Philoſophy, has had no other aim, than to ſerve the Intereſts of Virtue and Truth: but becauſe there are ſo very few that labour the ſame thing with ſo unprejudic'd a Mind, he forgoes all the pleaſing hopes of having his Eſſay generally well accepted, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts me to publiſh a ſhort word to ſave him from the Calumnies of ſome angry Brethren of his, who engage their Faith to any thing rather than plain dry

Reaſon; and being blinded by a jealous Zeal, know not what is ſaid for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Let the Reader take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice then, that our Author has not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted from Scripture, whence it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to prove more than he has here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, not out of any contempt of that Authority which he reverences as he ought, but only becauſe the Perſons with whom he diſputes, dare to call that Authority in queſtion; the Vindication of which the World now expects from the ableſt Hands.</p>

               <salute>Honoured Friend;</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Remember ſome parts of the Diſcourſe which we had laſt Tueſday Night at Mr. <hi>N</hi>'s, and the next Night at your houſe. I am now mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reconſider the ſame. I will ſpeak to Paſſages, as they occur to my Memory, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Order or Method; for I always ſuſpect my Abilities, and fear that what I can offer, will not be thought by any other Perſon worth the while for me to labour to digeſt it regularly: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I have not time to digeſt my Thoughts ſo as to pleaſe my ſelf.</p>
            <p>Among other things which the Ingenious and Learned Mr. <hi>J. A.</hi> was pleas'd to aſſert, the Import of one was this: That no Action could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call'd virtuous, which was done in proſpect of advantage to be had in a future State. In anſwer to this ſtrange Aſſertion, I aim'd to ſpeak to this ſenſe: He that takes an honeſt Care of the Intereſts
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54733:4"/>
of his own Perſon, Family, Friends and Country in this Life, according to his beſt Judgment of the Courſe in which things are likely to run, muſt be acknowledg'd to act rationally and wiſely: So he that takes a diligent Care of his own Intereſts, and the Intereſts of others in a future State (according to his Senſe of that matter after ſerious Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) muſt be acknowledg'd to act rationally and wiſely; and to act rationally and wiſely, is to act virtuouſly. The Proſpect of worldly Advantage to be gain'd by this or that honeſt Action, is ſo far from taking from that Action the praiſe of Wiſdom, that it rather is the chief Reaſon for which the Action may be denominated wiſe: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore why ſhould the proſpect of Advantage in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State, acquirable by wiſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> virtuous Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, take from thoſe Actions the praiſe of Wiſdom and Virtue? Some that are much in Mr. <hi>J. A</hi>'s Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, are wont with Railery, and (as they think) Argument mix'd together, to plead, That to do thoſe Actions which are accounted Virtues, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Advantage to be gain'd by them, is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary and baſe. Let us examine this Objection, which has an air of Wit, and ſee whether there is any ſolid Reaſon underneath. <hi>Mercenary</hi> is an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Word made from a <hi>Latin,</hi> ſignifying Wages, or Hire, payable for Labour or Work to be done. <hi>Militari mercede,</hi> is to fight for Pay: and whoſoever fights for Pay in a good Cauſe, works or labours for Hire, Wages, in an honeſt way, deſerves his Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Hire, Pay; nay farther, ought rather to be commended than reproach'd for doing his Duty.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>J. A.</hi> and ſome others ſeem to think, that becauſe a <hi>mercenary Souldier</hi> happens to be common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteem'd a term of Reproach, that therefore Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Virtue muſt be utterly diſgrac'd by the Epithet <hi>Mercenary.</hi> But we beg leave to examine this matter
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54733:4"/>
thorowly. The Reaſon why a <hi>Mercenary</hi> Souldier hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be commonly eſteem'd a term of Reproach, I take to be this: The <hi>Mercenary Souldier</hi> is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hir'd by an ambitious Prince, to raiſe the Power of the Prince that hires him, above Law, and oppreſs a free People: Whereas a Prince that is contented to be juſt what the Choice of the People, and the Rule of the Law makes him, knows that his People are beſt govern'd, and moſt ſafely defended by the Militia of the Country. In the Caſe ſtated, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia-man is honourable, and the <hi>Mercenary</hi> Souldier baſe. Nay in this Caſe, the more ſtrenuouſly the <hi>Mercenary</hi> Souldier fights, the worſe Man he is: but when the <hi>Mercenary</hi> is engag'd where Honour and Conſcience juſtifies him (which ſometimes, tho but rarely happens) his Valour, is true Virtue; his Pay, a reaſonable Encouragement of his Valour: and it would not be Valour, but Raſhneſs for a martial Man, whether of the <hi>Mercenary</hi> or the <hi>Militia</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to offer himſelf to Dangers, where he had no Advantage to make, nor Intereſt to defend. The <hi>Militia</hi>-Souldier if he does not fight for pay, yet he does to defend the Country whereof he is a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen, and in which he has a private Intereſt. The Security of his private Intereſt in the defence of his Country, is the <hi>Merces,</hi> the Pay, the Hire, the Wages for which he fights: and in the truth and reality of the thing, ſuch a Perſon is as much a Mercenary, as any <hi>Swiſs,</hi> who with his Maſters Conſent is hir'd abroad in a juſt War; or any poor Stroler at home, who having nothing elſe to fight for, fights for Bread.</p>
            <p>The ſhort of this is, He is a baſe Mercenary that does an ill thing for Gain: He is a worthy Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary that does a juſtifiable thing for Gain.</p>
            <p>The proſpect of Advantage in one kind or other, is the Motive of all the deliberate Actions of a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Man: and he that has no ſuch thing in his eye, is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54733:5"/>
an unthinking Perſon; and therefore the proſpect of advantage, whether in this or a future State, cannot take from a moral Action the praiſe of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. A Friend of mine (inclin'd to the Sentiments which I labour to refute) is wont to inſiſt much on the glorious ſaying, That a good Man loves Virtue for its own ſake. When I preſs him to explain clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what he means, he is wont to enlarge elegantly and well upon the agreableneſs and fitneſs of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; for inſtance, of Juſtice, Charity and Mercy: and thus far he is very right; Juſtice, Charity and Mercy are the moſt agreable and fit things in the World for a rational Man to practiſe. But now let me ask, What is it which makes theſe Virtues ſo agreable to human Nature, and ſo fit to be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd by rational Man? or I am ſtrangely miſtaken, or all that can be aſſign'd, is, the natural Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which they have to benefit Mankind, and to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Foundations of Society firm and ſure. If ſo, then I muſt obſerve, that every good Man who loves Virtue for its own ſake, <hi>i. e.</hi> for its agreable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to human Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> for its tendency to benefit Mankind, and eſtabliſh the Foundations of Society; he loves Virtue mercenarily, for he himſelf is a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Society, and his private Benefit is included in that of the publick. But my Friend tells me, and I believe him, that in Acts of Juſtice (which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways) in Acts of Charity and Mercy (which he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently performs) he has no regard to any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, upon thoſe accounts likely to accrue to him either in this preſent or a future State.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, that to a Man in eaſy Circumſtances, the practice of theſe Virtues yields an immediate and a very great Pleaſure; and they may be practis'd by an habitual good Man (ſuch as I reckon my Friend) without any regard had to the future Advantage and farther Pleaſure which may accompany them.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54733:5"/>
An habitual good Man may be ſo taken up with the preſent Satisfaction of virtuous Deeds, as that he ſhall be frequent in the practice of them, without giving himſelf time to conſider, whether he may not reaſonably hope for a future Compenſation. But then it ought to be taken notice of, that a great part, perhaps much the greateſt part of Virtue, conſiſts in doing good at the price of ſuffering Evil: and few, very few (in my poor opinion) would practiſe Virtue under ſevere preſent Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if they had no Hope beyond this Life. I am not ſurpriz'd to read in antient Story that Men of the faireſt Fame, as ſoon as advanc'd under ſome Princes, have chang'd their Manners, and loſt their Reputation: For when there's no keeping an honeſt Reputation, and a gainful Poſt of Honour both, it muſt be Hope in a future State, or nothing that can perſwade them to take care of the former, and let the latter go. I confeſs it is eaſy for a Man to be good in eaſy Circumſtances; to be juſt, when he is not very poor; to be charitable, when he has more than a Competence; to be merciful, when he is likely to gain Friends and Fame by it: but he that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that Virtue ſhould never be practis'd but in ſuch Caſes, is content that the World ſhould be much more wicked than it is, and every good Man more uneaſy and more unable to do the Good to which he is inclin'd.</p>
            <p>In this place I think it proper to tranſcribe ſome Lines from Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> in his <hi>Ductor Dub.</hi> (not that I hope to gain my Point by his Authority, tho I can't but be pleas'd to find ſo wiſe a Man in my Sentiments, yet let the Reader only weigh what is ſaid) <q>It is impoſſible a Man ſhould do great things, or ſuffer nobly, without conſideration of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and ſince much of Virtue conſiſts in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering evil things, Virtue it ſelf is not a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54733:6"/>
but the way to one. He does a thing like a Fool that does it for no end; and if he does not chooſe a good one, he is worſe: and Virtue it ſelf would in many Inſtances be unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, if for no material Conſideration we ſhould undertake her Drudgery.</q> I omit his Quotation from St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and give his next words with ſome little addition: <q>Senſual Pleaſures, thoſe ſenſual Pleaſures which treſpaſs on the Rights of others, are (while they can be made to conſiſt with the ſafety of our Perſons, and the health of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) highly eligible, and all difficult Virtue to be avoided,</q> if in this Life only we have hope. The Author I have quoted, aſſigns two Cauſes of Amability, and ſays there are no more, <hi>viz.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Uſefulneſs. I think there is but one Cauſe of Amability, and that is Uſefulneſs: for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which do not relate to me, I may admire; but nothing can attract my Love, and prompt my Deſires, but that which I know to be uſeful to me at preſent, or hope to find ſo hereafter. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why a thinking Perſon loves and deſires to practiſe Virtue, is, becauſe he taſtes Pleaſure now, or expects it hereafter.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the preſent Pleaſure may effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend ſome eaſier Inſtances of Virtue in happy and bleſſed times to the practice of well-diſpos'd Men: but in moſt Caſes, and to the <hi>Many,</hi> Virtue will ever need to be recommended by the reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hopes of a better Portion in a future State.</p>
            <p>Let me put a Caſe, which I fancy does ſometimes, tho but rarely happen: A married Man loves his Wife; firſt for the ſake of her Friends, or her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or her agreable Features, or his own ſolemn Vow; but afterwards he loves her for her own ſake, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her to be good-natur'd and fruitful, obedient and wiſe. Now meaning no more than that he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54733:6"/>
admires theſe great Perfections, that is not, in ſtrict ſpeaking, loving them, or the Wife becauſe ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes them; then only the Husband may be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to love theſe amiable Perfections, and his Wife who is Miſtreſs of them, when he conſiders that he is delighted and pleaſed with the Perfections of his Wife, and made happy by her. In ſhort, let us ſpeak ſtrictly and properly, and then we muſt affirm that <hi>Love</hi> is <hi>Relative.</hi> I may admire what I am never like to be the better for: but what I love, I love becauſe I find great Satisfaction in it at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or hope to do ſo hereafter. The preſent Pleaſures of Virtue are not ſufficient to recommend it ſo much, as but a tolerable Condition of the World does neceſſarily require: and if we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to diſprove the reaſonableneſs of future Hopes, we open a Flood-gate to a world of Iniquity more than abounds at preſent, and trouble our own En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments and Eaſe, as well as the Welfare of the Publick. I would be glad to be taught how Men may be perſwaded to difficult Virtue; for inſtance, to do their Country Service, to preſerve it, or deliver it from Slavery, when they are like to ruin themſelves and their Families by it. Indeed I read of one <hi>Codrus,</hi> who by his own death purchas'd a happy Victory to his People: But the Hiſtorian ſays, <hi>Athens</hi> never had another King after him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they never expected another <hi>Codrus.</hi> I may ſay of Men, that dare be good whatever it coſt them, as <hi>Virgil</hi> concerning the ſcatter'd <hi>Trojans, Apparent rari nantes in gurgite vaſto;</hi> plainly there's ſo very few of them, that to keep the World in no worſe a condition, than that in which it now ſtands, it is neceſſary to take in their Aid, who may be prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Virtue by future hopes. I will not here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble what has bin ſometimes objected to me by ſome Deiſts (to whom yet I can hardly allow that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54733:7"/>
name) They have aſſerted that the World is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in that tolerable Order which we ſee, by ſenſe of Honour, and fear of the Civil Magiſtrates Vengeance: good Men are mov'd to be ſo by ſenſe of Honour; and the Wicked are reſtrain'd from that Wickedneſs from which they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd, by fear of the Civil Magiſtrates Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: ſo that there's no need of future Hopes, or Fears for one thing or other; but they that pretend to be influenced by them, are either Hypocrites, or deceiv'd by not examining the Cauſes of their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons throughly. This Objection has ſeveral parts, which muſt be anſwer'd one by one.</p>
            <p>Good Men, they ſay, are mov'd to be ſo by ſenſe of Honour. By ſenſe of Honour I ſuppoſe they do not mean ſo low a Motive, as the Eſteem which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies Virtue, the Reputation and Praiſe which good Men gain by the practice; tho this is a very material thing, and not ſo airy as 'tis often repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented: for whom others highly eſteem, to him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion they are ready to be kind and uſeful. But by Senſe of Honour, I rather think they mean a Conſciouſneſs that it is the moſt becoming and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thing in the World, for reaſonable Men to practiſe Virtue, becauſe the Practice of Virtue is beneficial to Mankind in general, and the chief ſupport of Society.</p>
            <p>By the way I take notice, that this very ſenſe of Honour, this being virtuous becauſe Virtue is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to Mankind, and the chief Support of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, does prove that the Expectance of Advantage does not take away from the Worth of a virtuous Action, does not make a moral Action unfit to be call'd virtuous: for every Man knows that by doing good to others, he not only contributes to the eaſe of his own Mind, but alſo lays up a Reputation, that for ought he can promiſe himſelf, he may live
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54733:7"/>
to need; and by contributing to the ſecurity of the Body-politick, he contributes to the ſecurity of his private Intereſt. But this only by the way, tho it ſerves to ſtrengthen ſomething I have before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd: To my purpoſe it ſhall be allow'd, that ſenſe of Honour will carry well-diſpos'd Men a great way many times in the practice of Virtue; but for want of Education, and by means of ill Education, and ill Examples, the bulk of Mankind are always ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd; and even of the well-diſpos'd, but very few are able to maintain their Character in a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and perverſe Generation; and fewer yet would do it, were it not for future Hopes. Further, it is too boldly ſaid, and can never be made out, that the generality of good Men are mov'd to be ſo merely by ſenſe of Honour ſecular, Honour which relates to this World only: and as to future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs (be there any ſuch thing or no) 'tis noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly unreaſonable to conclude, that no Men are powerfully prompted to Virtue by the Deſires and Hopes of it, eſpecially when they ſolemnly proteſt both living and dying, that they are prompted to it by thoſe Motives.</p>
            <p>I would not leave any thing unanſwer'd, which has fall'n under my notice, by Reading or Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and may ſeem to have the face of good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, in favour of the Sentiments of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors; therefore I will here reply to a Reflexion which I lately met with in a private <hi>MS.</hi> The Anonymous Author ſays, That to do good in hopes of Reward hereafter, increaſes the vitious Principle of Selfiſhneſs. Before I anſwer directly, I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſomething concerning this term <hi>Reward,</hi> of which the Adverſary hopes to make ſome advantage.</p>
            <p>There are ſome good Men, who are firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that that thinking Principle, which we call the Soul, ſhall after this Life exiſt again; and yet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54733:8"/>
believe that Rewards and Puniſhments are not the moſt proper Words to expreſs the different Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in that Life. Theſe Men obſerve that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions and Pleaſures of Senſe are not equal to the Satisfactions and Pleaſures of the Mind; the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions and Pleaſures of the Mind are created by Virtue. To have ſober and temperate, juſt, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, merciful and holy Affections, regular Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Love, Deſire and Joy; Diſlike, Hatred, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, fix'd on proper Objects, and exerted in due meaſure, according as beſt befits the ſeveral Degrees of Goodneſs or Badneſs, which may happen to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiate thoſe ſeveral Objects: This is to be vertuous, and this creates in the Mind greater Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions and Pleaſures than the Satisfactions and Pleaſures of Senſe. It were eaſy to demonſtrate and illuſtrate this, but the Men I have to deal with grant it. I haſten: The nobleſt Idea, Imagination, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, which we can frame of future Happineſs, is to have our good Affections improv'd and moſt intenſe, our Paſſions moſt wiſely directed, and moſt exactly regular: for, from this moſt excellent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mind, muſt needs follow the higheſt Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſuch Happineſs (as the Scripture phraſes it) which hath not enter'd into the Heart of Man to conceive; <hi>i. e.</hi> we cannot conceive, as our Paſſions and Affections are now, what will be the happy Conſequences of their Improvements to Perfection hereafter. On the other ſide, the Pains of the Mind which it feels from Reflection, after it hath bin engag'd in Wickedneſs, are far more cruciating, than the Pains which are caus'd by hurting the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of the Body, according to that of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>A wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> To have hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, monſtrous, and unnatural Affections, Paſſions miſplac'd, irregular and extravagant; this is to be very vitious, and this makes the vitious Man miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54733:8"/>
in this Life. The moſt dreadful Idea, Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Conception, which we can frame of future Miſery, is to have our Affections in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree horrid, monſtrous, and unnatural; our Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the higheſt degree miſplac'd, irregular, and extravagant: for from this moſt wicked temper of Mind, muſt needs follow the extremeſt Miſery, which (if the Pains of the Body are leſs cruciating, than the Pains of the Mind) Fire can but faintly emblem. Such Happpineſs and ſuch Miſery which I have now mention'd, ſome good Men, no Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics as to our future Exiſtence, think to be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly denoted by the terms <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> But why ſhould we contend about words? I think they ought to allow us theſe Scripture<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terms, when we do not condemn this their Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heavenly Happineſs, and helliſh Torments.</p>
            <p>I have now made my way to the Anonymous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Reflexion, who oppoſing the belief of a future State, ſays, that to do good in hopes of Reward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the vitious Principle of Selfiſhneſs. My Reply is, 1. That Selfiſhneſs is a Principle which all other living Creatures partake of in common with Man. Every one has it implanted in his Nature, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diveſt himſelf of it. Even they that lay vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands on themſelves, are acted by this Principle of Selfiſhneſs: for they put an end to their own Lives, becauſe they hope that way to retire from the Evils which they have not patience to endure. 2. This Principle of Selfiſhneſs is not in its own nature vitious, but becomes ſo only by being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued irregularly. The Laws that are in all Nations made to determine and aſcertain Property, do plainly declare it to be the common Senſe of Mankind, that it is not only lawful, but natural and neceſſary for a Man to be ſelfiſh, to take care of his own Rights: if ſo, then it can become vitious only by undue
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54733:9"/>
Circumſtances. Man, as he is a Member of Society<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has giv'n up ſeveral of his natural Rights, for the better preſervation and ſecurity of what he has not given up. In this ſtate he is, in many Inſtances by the expreſs Words of poſitive Law, and in more by Reaſon and Conſcience, bound not to be ſelfiſh at the hazard and detriment of the Publick; not to purſue his private Intereſt, when he cannot do ſo without viſible prejudice to the Body-politick, whereof he is but a ſingle Member. Farther, A private Man, who has a Competence for himſelf and Family, is bound in Reaſon and Conſcience, not to purſue his own Intereſt to the prejudice of another Perſon who has not a Competence, but is in ſtraits. No one muſt queſtion this, who approves (which I hope we all do) that excellent Rule which makes a part of Natural as well as Reveal'd Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> Do as you would be done by. To be ſelfiſh far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than this excellent Rule will allow, is a vitious Principle: but to be ſelfiſh as far as this Rule will allow, that is, when neither the Publick, nor any private Perſon is againſt Reaſon damag'd thereby, is natural, neceſſary and honeſt; and he that is not ſelfiſh, that does not purſue his private Intereſt in ſuch a Caſe as this, muſt be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Fool or a Madman.</p>
            <p>The proſpect of Reward, where neither the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick nor any private Perſon is, againſt poſitive Law or right Reaſon, injur'd, is no Circumſtance that can make Selfiſhneſs vitious, but rather commends it: for a Man cannot do himſelf too much good, if in doing himſelf good he does others no injury.</p>
            <p>The next part of the Objection is, That the wicked are reſtrain'd from that Wickedneſs from which they are reſtrain'd, by fear of the Civil Magiſtrates Vengeance. That the fear of the Civil Magiſtrates Vengeance is a great reſtraint of Wickedneſs, is what no Perſon will queſtion; but that it ſhould
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54733:9"/>
be the only Reſtraint, and that Men ill-inclin'd, or dangerouſly tempted, are aw'd by nothing elſe, is a bold Aſſertion, impoſſible to be made out, highly improbable, and particularly unreaſonable for the Objectors to aſſert. It is a bold aſſertion, becauſe it is impoſſible to be made out; it is impoſſible to be made out, becauſe it is impoſſible for the Objectors to know the Hearts of Men, and diſcern by what Principles their Actions are govern'd: it is highly improbable, for the <hi>Many</hi> have either had no Education, or ſo unhappy an one, and have been engag'd ſo much among the worſt Examples, that their Minds are oftner govern'd by weak and falſe Principles, than by ſound and true: not that I think the Apprehenſion of Miſery, which in a future State will be the Conſequence of Wickedneſs with Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence, a weak or falſe Principle, but it is ſo in the Opinion of the Objectors; and I argue, Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that it really were ſo, yet the Apprehenſion we ſpeak of, ſhall ſtill have its Influence on the Minds of the <hi>Many.</hi> It is particularly unreaſonable for the Objectors to aſſert, That Men ill-inclin'd, or dangerouſly tempted, are aw'd only by the Civil Magiſtrates Vengeance, becauſe theſe very Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors do commonly impute many of the fooliſh and wicked Practices of Men to their unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Education, to the ill Company they frequent, and to their ſuperſtitious Principles. Poſſibly the Objectors may be here ready to interpoſe and tell me, that a weak Argument ſhould not be made uſe of to an honeſt and noble Purpoſe. To admit this for the preſent (tho I think there may be many caſes, in which 'tis reaſonable to uſe an Argument likely to prevail, tho in its own nature weak) yet I judg the Miſery which will hereafter fall on the impenitent Wicked, to be a good Argument for the reſtraint of Wickedneſs: but be it good or bad, it has
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54733:10"/>
its Influence, and therefore the fear of the Magiſtrates Vengeance is not the only Reſtraint of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: That it has its Influence, the Objectors ought not to deny, becauſe, as aboveſaid, they know not the Hearts of Men, and can't diſcern by what Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples their Actions are govern'd; and becauſe they do grant, that the <hi>Many</hi> are as often govern'd by weak and falſe Principles, as by ſound and true. 'Tis not my buſineſs in this place to prove the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of Miſery, threatning impenitent Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs in a future State, to be a ſound Principle for the reſtraint of Wickedneſs; but if it does reſtrain, then the Objectors are in the wrong, who would put upon us, that the fear of the Civil Magiſtrates Vengeance is the only Reſtraint. I have bin often ſtudying to find out, what ſhould lead the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors to ſuch a ſtrange Aſſertion, as that, The fear of the Civil Magiſtrates Vengeance is the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of Wickedneſs: the only thing that I can imagine is this; perhaps they obſerve that very many who profeſs to believe a future State, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the impenitent Wicked ſhall exiſt miſerable, are yet, notwithſtanding ſuch their Profeſſion, as much addicted to Wickedneſs as any of the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious Unbelievers, and make as little conſcience at leaſt of ſome Immoralities, as any of them who are either downright Atheiſts, or ſo reputed. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this, perhaps hence they conclude, that none of all them who profeſs the ſame, are aw'd by that their Notion. But may not I as well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That no Men are aw'd by the penal Laws of the Land, becauſe ſo great numbers who have read or bin told, and are firmly perſwaded, that the Law condemns Petty-larcenary to the Whipping-poſt, Pillory, or hot Iron; Felony and Treaſon to the Gallows and the Sled, do yet daily pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, cheat, and break Houſes, rob and murder,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54733:10"/>
deface and counterfeit the King's Coin? It is as plain that wicked men, who ſuffer under this Law, are not aw'd by it, as that wicked Men, who are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the future danger of Immorality, are not aw'd by that; and it is as good a Conſequence, that the Knowledg of the Penaltys annexed to human Laws, reſtrains no Wickedneſs, as that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion of the future danger of Wickedneſs does reſtrain none. So then by the ſame Argument that the Objectors would prove, that the perſuaſion of the future danger of Wickedneſs has no Influence on the Minds of Men, they prove that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Penalties annex'd to human Laws has no Influence on them; and ſo there's an end of all Laws whatſoever. By this Reaſoning the Laws of God wrote in the Hearts of Men, and the Laws of Men wrote in Books, are both made inſignificant and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, good for nothing but to prove a Defect of Wiſdom in their Authors. But among thoſe who queſtion the future State, ſome there are who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly grant that the Fear of the Civil Magiſtrates Vengeance, and the fear of future Miſery, have both of them an influence to reſtrain Men from Sin; but to abſtain from Sin, out of fear of the one or the other, is, they ſay, ſervile and baſe. To this I reply: It muſt be granted that the wiſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, who had form'd their Virtue on the nobleſt Principles, the love of God, and the joys of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience exercis'd in all manner of well-doing, have juſtly condemn'd that abſtinence from Vice, which is enforc'd merely by a dread of the Rods and Axes of the Civil Magiſtrate, as ſervile and baſe: for he that keeps his hands from ſtealing and ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Tongue from ſlandering and bearing falſe Witneſs, merely that he may avoid the Penalty of human Laws, is not advanc'd the leaſt ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Virtue: he has all the love of Iniquity ſtill
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54733:11"/>
about him; and even of that which he does not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally practiſe, muſt be deemed guilty in the accounts of God and wiſe Men, becauſe his deſires are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it. No manner of Praiſe can be juſtly aſcrib'd to him, who would tranſgreſs the Law, but that he is afraid to purchaſe his Tranſgreſſion at the price of a preſent ſevere Penalty. This Man's Nature is wicked, while his Actions are under reſtraint. This drew that ſaying from St. <hi>Paul, The Law</hi> (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law of the Civil Magiſtrate) <hi>is not made for the Righteous but the Wicked.</hi> The Righteous abſtain from Sin becauſe of the baſeneſs thereof, the Wicked only for fear of the Penalty; the fear of the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty keeps their Hands, but not their Hearts from Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, therefore ſtill they are wicked Men.</p>
            <p>But there is another kind of Fear, ſome call it a Fear connate, born with us: but that my Diſcourſe may not lie expos'd to Exceptions, I call it a Fear which the exerciſe of Reaſon in meditating and reflecting begets; a Fear of doing that which is odious in the ſight of God and good Men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of our own greateſt Happineſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to others. This Fear is a powerful reſtraint of Sin, and a good advance in the Ways of Virtue. Human Nature is ſo fram'd by the great God, that every thinking Man not habitually debauch'd, has an averſion againſt all vile Immoralities in his firſt wicked Sallies; his Face is cover'd with Shame, and his Heart ſhook with fear. In his firſt wicked Sallies the Man is fearful for his preſent Reputation, and fearful of what may be the fatal future Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Now to be aſham'd of being ill thought of, and to be afraid of deſerving a miſerable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, theſe are degrees of Virtue; for thus a Man takes an honeſt care of his own Intereſt, every Man owes this honeſt care to himſelf, 'tis no little fault to neglect it: now the doing of that which it were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54733:11"/>
a great fault to neglect, cannot but deſerve the name of Virtue.</p>
            <p>It is true, that Fear which has for its Object only the Sword of the Magiſtrate, is ſervile and baſe; and ſuch a Man when he has the tempting Hopes of concealing his breach of the Law, will be ſure to break it: but a Fear of doing that which is odious in the ſight of the moſt holy Being, and of them who are moſt like him, is mix'd with ſome regard to Virtue in its very firſt Original; a Fear of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which is deſtructive of our own Peace of Mind, future Hopes, and alſo injurious to others, is mix'd with a wiſe Care of our own honeſt Intereſts, and a love of juſt and righteous dealing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot juſtly be reproach'd as ſervile and baſe.</p>
            <p>To return from this Digreſſion: the next part of the Objection is, That there's no need of future Hopes or Fears for one thing or other, <hi>i. e.</hi> to keep Men innocent, or to make them virtuous. It is true, there were no need of them, if they had no Influence on Men; but I think I have prov'd that they have, and I will now eſſay to prove one thing more, <hi>viz.</hi> if a Man believe that after Death he ſhall never more exiſt again, he is not like to become virtuous or innocent either. The Schemes which ſome Chriſtians frame to themſelves of a future State, are as extravagant and improbable as the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Paradiſe. I am far from think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Schemes neceſſary or uſeful to virtuous ends and purpoſes: but I look upon the Doctrine of a future State, wherein it will be well with the virtuous, and ill with vitious Men, as the only ſure Foundation, which can firmly bear the whole Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructure of Morality, and make it appear to be every Man's intereſt to be ſober and chaſte, juſt and merciful, charitable and holy, in the worſt of Times and moſt unhappy Circumſtances. It may ſeem
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54733:12"/>
perhaps to ſome, that my former Diſcourſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts what I here advance: for I have admitted that the Pleaſures of a good Conſcience, the Joys of a Mind reflecting on its own virtuous Diſpoſition and beneficial Actings, are far more pleaſant and joyous than the Joys and Pleaſures of Senſe; and that the Torments of a Mind reflecting on its own criminal Diſorders, irregular and unnatural Paſſions and Affections, are far more puniſhing than the Pains of a wounded or diſeaſed Body. Now judging at firſt ſight this may be miſtaken for a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is moſt probable that the bulk of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhould be virtuous, becauſe in this life there's moſt to be got by Virtue, moſt to be loſt and ſuffer'd by being vitious. But if this matter be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look'd into and conſider'd as it deſerves, it will plainly appear, that the Man who queſtions his Exiſtence in a future State, is ſtill moſt likely to indulge his ſenſual Appetite, and prefer ſuch Pleaſures before thoſe of a good Conſcience: For we are not Maſters of the Power of Reaſoning in our firſt years; we are born indeed with a docility above all other Creatures that we know of, with a Capacity of learning to reaſon; but we learn it by ſlow degrees: a long while we live only the life of Senſe, and then our Choice is govern'd wholly by our ſenſual Appetites; and we have no regard to any but our ſelves, except to them who gratify our Deſires: nay, which is worſe than all this, they that have the moſt careful Education, do not miſs the ſight of many vitious Examples. To prefer our ſelves before all others, and indulge our ſenſual Appetites, can hardly fail of growing ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual to us, before we are Maſters of ſo much Reaſon, as to conſider how much the practice of Virtue in ſome denial of our ſelves and ſenſes, tends to promote the comforts of this life: and when
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54733:12"/>
we come to be able to conſider this, and actually do conſider it, 'tis none of the eaſieſt things imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to overcome an habitual contrary Inclination.</p>
            <p>They are far the leſſer number who are ever won to wiſe Conſideration and virtuous Practice; but if the preſent Advantages of Virtue and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages of Vice were all the Argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, it is mighty probable that the ſenſual Livers would be harder to be reclaim'd than they now are; it is mighty probable they would with ſtrange accord tell their grave Adviſers, they did not know but Virtue might have many Charms, and Vice ſome immediate Troubles and imminent dangers; but they could be content a while with the Pleaſures of Senſe, bear the Troubles and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Dangers; 'twould be ſeaſonable to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and chaſte, when they ſhall be grown impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and old; to be good-natur'd and obliging, when they ſhall want power to bear up their high Minds, and make themſelves rever'd: to be juſt and charitable when they ſhall abound. Will the Oppoſers of a future State tell theſe Men, that if they indulge their ſenſual Appetites till Nature begins to fail, it will be then out of their power to ſhift their Courſe, and experience the Comforts which largely flow from well-doing, becauſe their vitious Inclinations will outlive their vitious Powers? Alas! this will but tempt them to have a greater opinion of their Vice; for they may reaſon thus: The thoughts of that thing can never be puniſhing to them, from which they cannot withdraw their Affections; therefore except a very painful Sickneſs, or a more than ordinary Misfortune befal an immoral Man, I can't ſee how any Argument drawn from the Nature of things in this Life can poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim him: but it is poſſible that ſuch a one may be reclaim'd by the Conſiderations of a future State;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54733:13"/>
for this is an Argument, which if adverted to, muſt needs at leaſt diſturb the Joys, the fooliſh and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Joys of the moſt proſperous Libertine. It is granted, that generally ſpeaking, Virtue is its own Reward, the virtuous Man meets many preſent Advantages by being virtuous: but then there are ſome inſtances of Virtue, that ſometimes happen to engage Men in unwelcome Sufferings; now what ſhall perſuade theſe Perſons to practiſe Virtue in ſuch Circumſtances, if they disbelieve the future State? Again, it is granted, that generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vitious Men are greatly puniſh'd by their own Vices; but then we cannot deny but that with ſome men ſome Vices agree better. Some know how to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage their Vices with a ſort of Diſcretion, and while they ſooth their Senſes, take care of their Health and Fame alſo. Now what ſhall perſwade theſe Men to quit thoſe Vices which agree well enough with them, if they fear no miſerable Event in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State? As I ſaid before, the Doctrine of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State is the only ſure Foundation which can firmly bear the whole Superſtructure of Morality, and make it appear to be every Man's greateſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to be ſober and chaſte, juſt and merciful, charitable and holy, in the worſt of Times and moſt unhappy Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Inquiry concerning Virtue</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advanc'd ſeveral Notions (in my opinion) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary as well to the Intereſts of Virtue, as to the ſhort Diſcourſe of mine concerning the future Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of it, I purpoſe now to write brief Notes on that Book, and hope at one and the ſame time to correct his Miſtakes, and juſtify my own Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. By the way, the <hi>Inquiry concerning Virtue</hi> is the Tract I have refer'd to, having formerly had a ſight of the <hi>MS.</hi> tho yet ignorant of the Author.</p>
            <p>P. 3. <hi>Religion and Virtue are very rarely conſider'd</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:54733:13"/>
               <hi>apart, or diſtinguiſh'd from one another.</hi> I will not diſpute this with our Author; but then ſince he does conſider them apart, I think it an omiſſion that he has not particularly and diſtinctly defin'd them: poſſibly the Definitions of them may be made out from the Courſe of his Reaſonings; but ſure they ought ſome where or other to have bin particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and plainly ſet down, eſpecially becauſe he himſelf profeſſes, that the Subject he enters upon needs a very particular Explanation of things, and more than ordinary clearneſs of Terms.</p>
            <p>P. 4. <hi>We may do well to conſider, what it is that we call Atheiſm, and what Virtue, and afterwards exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Conſiſtency of theſe two together.</hi> This is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry incautiouſly and offenſively worded, but I will wait till he openly declares what he calls Atheiſm, and what Virtue, before I paſs my Cenſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P. 5.</hi> If every thing that exiſts, be according to a good Order, and for the beſt, by being in the wiſeſt and juſt eſt manner, then is there of neceſſity no ſuch thing as <hi>real Ill</hi> in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, nothing <hi>ill</hi> with reſpect to the whole.</p>
            <p>It ſhall be granted that there is nothing <hi>ill</hi> with reſpect to the whole, but ſtill there may be that which is <hi>ill, real ill,</hi> with reſpect to ſome great and noble part of the whole, and no reproach to the wiſe and juſt Diſpoſer of the whole neither; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which is <hi>real ill</hi> with reſpect to ſome great and noble part of the whole, ſhall after ſome Revolutions of time, appear to have contributed to the moſt wiſe and juſt diſpoſal of the whole. Let thus much for the preſent be ſaid in general; when our Author ſpeaks more particularly by inſtance, I will come up more cloſely to him, and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeak my Mind.</p>
            <p>P. 5. <hi>Whatſoever in the order of the World is called</hi> ill, <hi>ſuppoſes a poſſibility in the Nature of the thing, to have bin otherwiſe contriv'd, or order'd by ſome Wiſdom</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:54733:14"/>
               <hi>or other.</hi> The whole might for all that we know have bin otherwiſe contriv'd and order'd than it is, but we do not know how it could have bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd and order'd better; nay indeed we do not know how the whole is contriv'd and order'd, our Knowledg extends but to ſome parts of the whole, and ſees not thro them neither: but that which I admit to be <hi>real ill,</hi> with reſpect to ſome parts of the whole, being only ſo for a time, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſome parts only, is not real <hi>ill</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the whole.</p>
            <p>P. 5. <hi>If the order of all things be ſuch that nothing can be thought of or imagin'd more wiſe, perfect, and juſt, then it is impoſſible but that there muſt be Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Deſign in the whole.</hi> I grant the Order of all things with reſpect to the <hi>whole,</hi> to be moſt wiſe, perfect, and juſt; in the <hi>whole</hi> there is Wiſdom, Underſtanding and Deſign, and that in the perfecteſt and higheſt manner and degree. But then from hence I argue thus: If there be perfect Wiſdom, Deſign, and Underſtanding in the <hi>whole,</hi> then there muſt be a moſt wiſe, deſigning, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Being, in which perfect Wiſdom, Deſign, and Underſtanding exiſts. Our Author's Words ſeem to incline to that old Pagan Doctrine, that the <hi>Whole</hi> is God; that the whole Syſtem of Nature is the only wiſe, underſtanding, and deſigning Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which to me is perfect Nonſenſe: for, the Wiſdom, Underſtanding, and Deſign which our Author ſpeaks of, as exiſting in the <hi>whole,</hi> can be nothing but the Congruity and mutual Serviceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Parts; but the <hi>whole,</hi> the whole Syſtem of Nature cannot be properly ſaid to be the cauſe of the Congruity and mutual Serviceableneſs of the Parts which compoſe the <hi>whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. 6. <hi>If there be any thing</hi> ill <hi>in the</hi> Univerſe <hi>from Deſign, then that which is the Cauſe of, or which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:54733:14"/>
               <hi>all things, is no one good deſigning Principle.</hi> Tho there be nothing <hi>ill</hi> in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> from deſign; yet there may be ſomething temporarily <hi>ill</hi> in the Parts, which after ſome Revolutions of time ſhall appear to have contributed to the Perfection of the Univerſe; and therefore that Being from whom the Deſign came, temporarily ill with reſpect to ſome part, may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs be one good deſigning Principle or Mind. I will give inſtance here, tho our Author ſpeaks only in general. If we conſider only that part of the Univerſe which Mankind makes, and that ſhort time which Men live, it is <hi>ill, real ill,</hi> that the Man who does good ſhould ſuffer evil, and that the Man who does evil ſhould not ſuffer proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to the evil which he does: but if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this with reſpect to that State which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſhall be hereafter, with reſpect to the Advantages which the former ſhall then probably reap, and the loſs which the other ſhall then probably incur, then there appears no ſuch thing as <hi>real Ill</hi> in the Univerſe.</p>
            <p>P. 7. <hi>Whatſoever is ſuperiour in any degree over the World, or that rules in Nature with Diſcernment and a Mind, is that which we call God.</hi> I do not approve of our Author's definition of God; I would rather, keeping as near to his Phraſe as I can, define thus: <hi>Whatſoever does exiſt, having ſupreme Power over us and all things elſe, is that which we call God.</hi> Pagan Philoſophers, the moſt of them, as well as the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, paid religious Worſhip to many ſuppos'd powerful inferiour Gods; but moſt of the Vulgar, and all the Philoſophers almoſt to a Man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd one ſingle ſupreme intelligent Being; for proof of this I refer to Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi>'s Intellec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Syſtem.</p>
            <p>P. 8. <hi>To believe no</hi> one <hi>ſupreme good deſigning Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:54733:15"/>
               <hi>or Mind, but</hi> ſeveral, <hi>is to be a</hi> Polytheiſt. This was not well conſider'd by our Author: for if nothing makes a Man a <hi>Polytheiſt,</hi> but to believe no <hi>one</hi> ſupreme good deſigning Principle or Mind, but ſeveral, then there never was a <hi>Polytheiſt</hi> in the World. He that underſtands the ſenſe of the word <hi>Supreme,</hi> cannot but perceive, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible there ſhould be more than one ſuch. The old <hi>Polytheiſts</hi> believ'd and worſhip'd many ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Powers, but they nor did nor could imagine more than one Supreme.</p>
            <p>Sect. 2. p. 12. <hi>There is in every Creature a certain Intereſt or</hi> Good, <hi>which is an</hi> end <hi>in that Creature; and to which</hi> end, <hi>if any thing either of his Appetites, Paſſions, or Affections be not conducing, but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; this is</hi> ill <hi>to him, and in this manner he is ill,</hi> with reſpect to himſelf, <hi>as he is ſaid to be ill alſo</hi> with reſpect to others, <hi>when any ſuch Appetites or Paſſions make him injurious to them.</hi> Queſtionleſs the chief Good of every Creature, is the chief End of every Creature; the End which he ought, and which he is naturally diſpos'd to purſue; and which when he does not purſue, his natural Conſtitution is viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated. To apply this to the rational Creature: If we allow Free Will to Man (which I ſuppoſe our Author does, becauſe elſe 'tis Nonſenſe to talk of Virtue and Vice) then <hi>that</hi> Man is a good Man, and acts well and wiſely, who imploys his Thoughts, and directs his Practice for the attainment of his own chief good. Farther, ſuch is the Conſtitution and Frame of Man, and ſuch his chief <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Good,</hi> that his purſuing the ſame can never make him injurious to other Men; but on the contrary, his purſuing his own chief <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Good,</hi> tends very much to the promoting the chief <hi>End</hi> or <hi>Good</hi> of his Brethren. What our Author diſcourſes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54733:15"/>
the Animal Syſtem and Animal Nature, whether it be accurate and exact, I ſhall not at preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my ſelf; but the diſtinction I admit, and thus much I grant him, that no part of the Univerſe is of it ſelf compleat, but every part has a relation to the whole, whereof it is a part; and that there is no part but contributes to the Perfection of the whole, tho conſider'd with leſs general Reſpects, it may be for a time <hi>ill</hi> to ſome other part, and alſo to it ſelf.</p>
            <p>P. 17. <hi>Nor do we ſay a Man is a good Man, when his Hands are ty'd, which hinders him from doing the harm that he has a mind to do, or (which is near the ſame) when he abſtains from executing his ill Purpoſe, thro a Fear of ſome impending Puniſhment, or thro an Allurement of ſome private Pleaſure or Advantage, which draws him from his ill Intention.</hi> Our Author here is making his way to the main purpoſe of his Book, which being the introducing of a Doctrine that I take to be not only erroneous, but alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging to Virtue and deſtructive to Society, I ſhall therefore watch his Approaches, and make my Remarks upon his ſpecious artful Inſinuations. To ſpeak exactly, he that nor does nor means harm, ought to be denominated innocent; and only he that does or is ready to do good, virtuous. But by our Author's Favour, not to be able to do the harm which one has a mind to do, and to abſtain from executing an ill purpoſe thro fear of ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Puniſhment, or thro allurement of ſome private Pleaſure or Advantage, is not the ſame, nor near the ſame thing: for in the one caſe, the ill-minded Man is wholly govern'd by his irregular Paſſions and Affections, and reſtrain'd only by Force exterior from the evil Act; but in the other he makes ſome uſe of his Reaſon, and by that uſe which he makes of his Reaſon (tho not the beſt which might be made) he abſtains from the evil Act.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:54733:16"/>
I will grant our Author that the Man who ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains from executing his evil purpoſe, only thro fear of impending Puniſhment, or thro allurement of ſome private Pleaſure or Advantage (meaning by <hi>Puniſhment,</hi> the Puniſhment which human Laws threaten to evil Actions, and by <hi>Pleaſure</hi> or <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> ſenſual Pleaſure and ſecular Advantage) has not well conſider'd things, nor exercis'd his Reaſon ſo far, as to form thoſe true Notions in his mind which are requiſite to ſet a value upon his abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from evil; nor would I call ſuch a Man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. But then there are other Fears, and other Hopes to which Men may owe their abſtinence from ſome Evils, and no diſparagement to their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence neither: For inſtance, I preſume it were an injurious evil thing, for a Phyſician to try an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment upon a poor Patient, without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and Conſent of his Patient, merely to improve his own Knowledg; but this a Phyſician may have many Opportunities of doing, and that with all imaginable ſafety to himſelf, ſo that not ſo much as his Skill ſhall be call'd in queſtion, tho the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment fails, and the Patient miſcarries; for ſo Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients every day do under the ableſt Phyſicians, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding by common Methods: and yet a Phyſician that has no fears from without to reſtrain him from trying an Experiment, may be reſtrain'd by the fears of doing a baſe thing, by the fears of that Uneaſineſs which his conſidering Mind, conſcious to the evil Deed, may create him: and whenever ſuch Fears keep a Man free from the evil Act, his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from it is praiſe-worthy, and he is of right to be deemed innocent. Upon the ſame ſcore, a due regard had to the Pleaſures of a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, has a great Influence to keep a Man, in ſuch like Circumſtances plac'd, innocent, and does not depretiate the Innocence which it preſerves.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54733:16"/>
Our Author ſhould not talk in general of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Advantages, the Objects of our Hopes and Fears, without ſpecifying what kind of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Advantages he means, when he lays down ſuch and ſuch Propoſitions.</p>
            <p>I am of the mind, that when we act rationally, we are always influenc'd by ſome one or other Hope or Fear: Indeed a Man may arrive at a habit of well or ill-doing, and then not advert to the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Motive in every particular Act; but all momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Actions, and the Original of the good or ill Habit proceeds from ſome Hope or Fear. What ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the <hi>Decor facti</hi> ſo much talk'd of, the comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fitneſs of the Action call'd virtuous, but the advantageouſneſs thereof to one's Self, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Neighbourhood, near Relation, Friend, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance? From hence the Action has its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Fitneſs, from hence it is denominated virtuous; and he that does it, does it with this proſpect. What I would conclude hence is, That Hope and Fear, which are the Springs of all Action, render an Action good or ill, according to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that thing which is the Object of our Hope and Fear.</p>
            <p>But our Author ſeems to lay a ſtreſs upon that diſtinguiſhing Epithet <hi>private,</hi> private Pleaſure or Advantage, which otherwhere he calls private Good, Self-good; but in this matter he does not deal diſtinctly enough neither: for I will grant him, that there are ſome kind of private Pleaſure or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, private Good, Self-good, ſuch as Profit, Pleaſure, Honour, all ſecular Satisfactions, which if they are the chief Deſigns and Purpoſes of the Agent, they depreciate that Action which is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advantageous to the Publick, and perhaps to the Doer alſo, farther than he might hope; but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had to the private chief Good of every Man,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54733:17"/>
is that which ſets the high value upon his Actions, and gives them that Excellence, becauſe of which they may fitly be called virtuous. To ſpeak my ſenſe in every thing as plain as I can: A Man's chief good I allow to conſiſt in juſt and equal Affections, whereby he is diſpos'd to take a wiſe care of his Health, a duly proportion'd regard of his ſecular Intereſts, and to imploy a conſtant ſtudy and labour to do good to all Mankind, as far as his Abilities can reach, and in the order as this or that Society or Perſon moſt reaſonably calls for a prior regard. Theſe juſt and equal Affections create to a Man greater Happineſs than can accrue to him from ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Satisfactions. Now if the Mind of man ſhall exiſt again (as we think it moſt probable, and mean to give our Reaſons) it ſhall exiſt with theſe juſt and equal Affections, in beneficent degrees ſtill improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, more uſeful to others, and more happy in it ſelf (for even in this Life as a good Man increaſes in his good Affections, ſo his Fervour and his Joys daily advance) A regard had to this Hope is proper to regulate our Judgment and Affections, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to Virtue more powerfully than the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Happineſs which Virtue creates to us in this Life. Now no Man's chief private Good can be ſeparated from the Good of others, tho his ſecular private Good may: whatſoever is of honeſt advantage to one's Acquaintance, Friend, Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Neighbourhood, Country, Mankind in general, has a tendency to one's own chief Advantage, and many times to ſome inferiour Advantages of one's own alſo; but no Man could at all endeavour the advantage of others, if it tended to his own greateſt loſs. There is implanted in Mankind a ſtrong Principle of Self-love prior to all kind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect towards others: we cannot but love our own honeſt ſecular Intereſt, before the honeſt ſecular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54733:17"/>
of another Man; our private Self-good future, more ardently than the private Self-good future of another Man. We do ill only when we prefer a ſmall ſecular Intereſt of our own before a weighty Intereſt of another, whoſe condition is ſad and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teable, or before a weighty certain Intereſt of the Publick, or before a probability that we may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to have in our hands of promoting the Intereſts of Virtue. And this I think is ſpeaking ſomething more diſtinctly than our Author has done, and more according to verity.</p>
            <p>I ſaid I would aſſign my Reaſons why I thought it moſt probable that the Mind of Man ſhould exiſt again after Death, (at what time, as to me is moſt probable, his regular or irregular Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall create his Happineſs or Miſery) I will not defer the making good that promiſe; only let it be conſider'd 'tis high Probability, not ſenſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration that I pretend to, tho I have a Temptation to pretend even to that, which Temptation I have from the Reaſoning of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Philoſopher Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> I quote it in the words of Mr. <hi>Wynn</hi>'s Abridgment, <hi>p.</hi> 200. <q>The Idea of a Supreme Being, infinite in Power, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Wiſdom, whoſe Workmanſhip we are, and on whom we depend, and the Idea of our ſelves as underſtanding rational Creatures, would, I ſuppoſe, if duly conſider'd, afford ſuch Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of our Duty and Rules of Action, as might place Morality among the Sciences capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Demonſtration; wherein I doubt not but from Principles as inconteſtable as thoſe of the Mathematics, by neceſſary Conſequences, the meaſure of right and wrong might be made out to any one, that will apply himſelf with the ſame Indifferency and Attention to the one, as he does to the other of theſe Sciences.</q> But of what I have to ſay let the Reader judg.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:54733:18"/>
I will uſe the word <hi>Mind</hi> or <hi>Man</hi> promiſcuouſly; for it is the reaſoning Principle which we call <hi>Mind,</hi> that does diſtinguiſh, and conſtitute us what we are.</p>
            <p>If in the Univerſe every thing is according to a good Order, and the moſt agreable to a general Intereſt that is poſſible, ſo that nothing could have bin contriv'd more wiſely, and with more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the general intereſt of Beings, or of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſe (which our Author ſeems to admit, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms to be perfect Theiſm, <hi>p.</hi> 7.) then Man or human Mind muſt exiſt again after this life end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for, that order of things in which Man's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Exiſtence is not ſuppos'd, is not the beſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we can imagin; but we have the Idea in our Minds of a juſter and wiſer Contrivance. In defence of the Doctrine which I now impugn, ſome have bin pleas'd to ſay, that every Sin meets with adequate Puniſhment or Pain in this Life, and every good Deed with adequate Reward or Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. Were this true, I muſt confeſs I could not pretend that any thing is amiſs in that order of things, in which Man's future Exiſtence is not ſuppos'd. But I hope to make the contrary appear to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial deliberate Conſiderer. There are ſome Sins, which, as it often happens, do not meet with Puniſhment, or Pain adequate in this Life; and the moſt difficult Inſtances of Virtue, which ever and anon call for our Practice, do not create preſent Joys equal to the Labours and Dangers thereof.</p>
            <p>I do not expect to carry my point by my bare Aſſertion; nor do I allow any thing to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of my Adverſaries, however in Learning my Superiours: therefore I will offer Inſtance, and reaſon the matter with them as well as I can. What a World of barbarous Injuries has a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain mighty Potentate caus'd to be committed for the enlargement of his Dominions, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54733:18"/>
of his Glory? What wondrous Succeſſes has he ſometimes cunningly bought, ſometimes fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſurpriz'd, and ſometimes by over-powering numbers forc'd? With what odious Inſolence has he treated not only independent States and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, but alſo crown'd Heads, in point of due Honour his Equals? How has he ſlighted his holy Father, and made a mere Property of the <hi>Head,</hi> as they call him, of the Catholick Church? How has he triumph'd in all theſe Iniquities, brib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blaſphemous Panegyricks, and monumental proud Inſcriptions (the wit of hungry Prieſts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of ſervile Courtiers) to his immortal Manſhip? He has bin for a long time flatter'd, if not belov'd, by crouching Slaves and conquer'd Nations, and fear'd by States inferiour in their numbers, or une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual thro their own Diviſions far and wide, which are the two things the moſt agreable to an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul. He has never wanted Women witty, fair, and eaſy to excite and anſwer his Luſt; whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Appetite has coveted, or his Health need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for its ſupport, has bin ready for him upon all occaſions. But where's the adequate Puniſhment or Pain all this while? No ſuch thing has as yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall'n him; not but that he has met with Croſſes and Diſappointments in his well-laid ill Deſigns, which may have giv'n him an hour's vexation in his Cloſet, but no long diſquiet: for he never was long without taking new Meaſures to retrieve the old Game, and thoſe new Meaſures rais'd new Hopes, and thoſe new Hopes brought not more uneaſineſs than an ordinary Patience might well enough undergo. But (it may be ſaid) he has bin often compell'd to re-deliver his Rapine. Indeed much of this is true, and it could not but ſit heavy on a great Heart; but then he never re-deliver'd the whole, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delivering but part, he gain'd ſomething of a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54733:19"/>
Title to what he retain'd: and then too he aſſum'd to himſelf the Glory of that Peace which himſelf moſt wanted, and never <hi>condeſcended</hi> (as he loves to ſpeak) to a Peace, but to get new Breath, and divide his united Enemies; one point of which he was always ſure of, and ſeldom miſs'd the other. Now all this while where's the adequate Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Hitherto all the Misfortunes he has met, have bin no more painful and puniſhing, than juſt to give a better reliſh to his tyrannick Pride and ſucceſsful Depredations; if there be one ſingle Sin of his that has bin adequately puniſh'd, it muſt be his—But I will not ſpeak of lawleſs Love or—for ſome Men, beſide that they count it no Sin, prefer the Pleaſure to the Pain. But it may be by way of Objection reply'd to me, Mark the end of this Man, conclude not that he ſhall not, becauſe he has not as yet, paid the price of his Crimes. Well! I cannot promiſe my ſelf to live ſo long as to mark his end, but I will ſuppoſe it as much as can be to the diſadvantage of my Cauſe, tho no one can preſume, but that it may be ſo honourable and ſo eaſy, as ſtill to mend my Argument. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then that his Armies on all ſides ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd and beaten, his Aſſes grow weary of their Burden, and ſick of their Driver; his Domeſticks that eat of his Bread, forſake him: ſuppoſe that in the midſt of his diſtreſs, wandring, deſpis'd, and hated, no one ſhall love him ſo well, or hate him ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, as to rid him of his wretched Life; but that he muſt be beholden to his own right hand, or to the anguiſh of his diſorder'd Mind: who would call this adequate Pain or Puniſhment, for millions of Murders, and remorſeleſs Villanies; fruitful Countries laid waſte, Temples thrown down, and Sepulchers digg'd up; the bold breach of Faith ſworn, all manner of Laws and Rights, for a long
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54733:19"/>
Courſe of early, young, and of vigorous manly years, inſulted: does all this deſerve no more than that a heavy Misfortune fall upon the guilty Wretch in his old and decaying Age? I wonder how any Man can pretend that this would be ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Puniſhment, and yet 'tis a hundred to one but the mighty Sinner goes off the Stage ſuffering little or nothing of all this.</p>
            <p>It were not hard to give numerous Inſtances of vile Men, that have revell'd long in all abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and cruel Lewdneſs and Injuſtice; who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding have dy'd without notable Misfortune, or tormenting Regret. I have ſelected one that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly has done the moſt Evil of any name, that is to be met in Hiſtory, and hitherto he has come off cheap; and if it appears, tho but in a ſingle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that all Sins are not adequately puniſh'd in this Life, I preſume it muſt follow, That that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things in which Man's future Exiſtence is not ſuppos'd, is not the beſt and wiſeſt order that can be imagin'd.</p>
            <p>But farther to evince that all Sins are not ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quately puniſh'd in this Life, let it be conſider'd, that many times, Perſons whoſe Crimes are hainous, find means to eſcape the Vengeance of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, while they who are leſs guilty, are very ſeverely dealt with: nay and the former, ſo it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens, go on rejoycing in their Crimes, while the latter venture on evil Actions, not without great trouble and anxiety of Mind. Now let my Adverſaries call what they will adequate Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am ſure it is not the wiſeſt order of things imaginable, that the leſs guilty ſuffer moſt, and the moſt guilty leaſt, or not at all.</p>
            <p>I will diſmiſs this Argument with the brief men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an Inſtance or two from antient Story. <hi>Ceſar</hi> was in many a Conſpiracy againſt the Liberty of his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54733:20"/>
Country; at laſt he abſolutely inſlav'd it to his own Arbitrary Will, and three years injoy'd the ſucceſs of his unrighteous Uſurpation: At the end of that term <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius,</hi> &amp;c. diſpatch'd him of a ſudden.</p>
            <p>If this was adequate Puniſhment, then ſubjugating a free People is a light Injury. <hi>Oreſtes</hi> ſlew his Mother, and was all his life-time troubled in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience for it; ſuppoſe this now was adequate Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: But <hi>Nero</hi> ſlew his Mother, by whoſe means he got the Empire, and never was troubled for the matter: He diſpatch'd alſo his Wife <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> and his Maſter <hi>Seneca;</hi> he ſpar'd no Perſon that gave him offence: his end indeed was tragical, but it was ſudden and quick, no way adequate to his horrid Life.</p>
            <p>I preſume I have now made it appear to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial equal Conſiderer, that there are ſome Sins, which (as it often happens) do not meet with Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or Pain adequate in this Life: I hope to make it appear as plainly, that the moſt difficult Inſtances of Virtue, which ever and anon call for our Practice, do not create preſent Joys equal to the Labours and Dangers thereof. Generally ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch is the nature of Virtue, that it is fitted not only to promote the good. (as our Author phraſes it) of the private Syſtem, but alſo of the publick. Virtue naturally tends to the benefit of every particular Man, and alſo of all Mankind uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Societies. Temperance conduces to the health of the temperate Man, to the health of his Body, and to the health of his Mind (from the health of both which ariſes the greateſt good which he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of at preſent) and alſo to the enrichment of the Publick; for, the leſs is conſum'd at home of any thing ſerviceable to Life, the more remains to be exported abroad by way of Trade<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Juſtice and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54733:20"/>
Charity are immediately, viſibly beneficial to Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and they purchaſe to the juſt and charitable Perſon, not only the agreable Comforts of a good Reputation, but great meaſures of Security to be treated with Juſtice again, and reaſonable hopes to find a return of Charity in time of need. Now ſuch being the nature of Virtue, ſo proportion'd and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all the honeſt Deſires and nobler Ends of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in this ſtate, it would become a wiſe Man in ſome caſes to practiſe it, even tho he were ſure there were no Reward, nothing to be got by it hereafter: but then there are other caſes in which Virtue (tho always ſerviceable to Society) may accidentally happen to be unſerviceable to a private Man, and wholly unable to create him preſent Joys equal to the Labours and Dangers thereof. Nay, there are caſes, in which ſome Virtues, aiming at the Service of the Publick, may become effectual to the utter ruin of a Man's Fortunes, Friends, Health, Life.</p>
            <p>Now if it is ever odds againſt a Man, that his Virtue ſhall not be ſucceſsful to the Publick accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his deſire, but on the contrary, prove an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ruin to his Fortunes, Family, Friends, Health, Life; how the Reflexion on his Virtue can create him Joy greater, or but equal to the Pain which theſe Misfortunes will cauſe, while he believes no future State, I cannot divine.</p>
            <p>If it ſhould be objected, that I ſuppoſe a Caſe which ought not to be ſuppos'd; I reply, that this very caſe has, within our memory, befall'n ſeveral worthy Perſons in more than one Country, upon their oppoſing the Arbitrary Deſigns of tyrannizing Princes. Their honeſt Endeavours to preſerve their Country from Poverty by loſs of Trade, from Slavery, and its numerous attendant Miſchiefs, have coſt ſeveral the loſs of high Honours, and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Profits, waſted their Eſtates, reduc'd their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54733:21"/>
to Hardſhips, broke their Health in cloſe Priſons, and ſometimes put an end to their days by ignominious Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>There is not one Inſtance of Virtue more widely beneficial, and more truly glorious, than a wiſe and reſolute uſe of all lawful likely means to preſerve to that Society whereof we are Members, the ſafe and ſecure enjoyment of their Trade and Liberties. The ſatisfaction and pleaſure of Mind in labouring this thing, will not be denied to be as great, if not greater, than that which proceeds from any other inſtance of Virtue: but to be (tho accidentally, and by means of conſulting the publick Good) the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of great Misfortune, not only to ſome Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, Acquaintance, and Friends, but to Wife and Children alſo; to the ruin of ones own Health, and ſhortning ones days; this, in my opinion, cannot but make the moſt virtuouſly diſpos'd Man, who believes no future State, very uneaſy, and hinder him from reliſhing the Satisfactions which otherwiſe his Virtue might create to him. I do now, only for Argument ſake, ſuppoſe a Man, who believes no future State, capable of ſerving his Country at the price of theſe Difficulties and Sufferances; but, that being ſuppos'd, I contend that theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Difficulties and Sufferances can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more painful, than the conſciouſneſs of his Virtue can be joyous. And methinks this may be made out even to a full and fair Demonſtration. Unexpected Diſappointments, and Loſſes, the Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of an intruſted Servant, the Ingratitude of an oblig'd Friend, want of many Neceſſaries, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerv'd Reproach, theſe are heavy Weights, and no little power have they to diſorder the thoughts of the Mind; it muſt yet more ſenſibly touch a Man (eſpecially believing no future State) if his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and Labour to ſerve his Country brings ruin on the Wife of his Boſom, and his Children, the pledges
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54733:21"/>
of their mutual Love; and I queſtion very much, whether ever any Man, who believes no future State, did deſpiſe (the melancholy Proſpect being before him) his dear Wife and Children, and undauntedly practiſe the dangerous Virtue: but a Priſon has ſtill a more afflicting Influence on the Mind of a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpos'd Man; and by that time Reſtraint and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Uſage has broke his Health, his Spirits muſt fail, his Mind muſt needs languiſh together with his Body: and when a Man is in continual Pain, tho he does not utterly loſe the conſciouſneſs of his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, yet what comfort can he take in it, when he ſees that it has undone, not only his deareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, but himſelf alſo; and conſiders that himſelf undone is dying, dying for ever, and never like to be the better for his Virtue hereafter? I think our Preachers do not exact the words of <hi>Paul</hi> literally, when he wiſh'd that Curſe on himſelf for the ſake of his Brethren the <hi>Jews:</hi> and in my Judgment, as no Man can wiſh to be miſerable hereafter, that others may be happy hereafter; ſo no Man who looks upon this Life as the end of all things to him, can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be miſerable in this Life, in hopes to make others happy in this Life. If any Adverſary ſhall oppoſe his denial to what I have here deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, then he muſt be forced to aſſert, that Man is a Creature in whoſe Compoſition there's no ſuch thing as Self-love, or Reaſon; but this is extremely abſurd, and therefore my Determination muſt be allow'd. It may be eaſily underſtood, how it is poſſible for a Man to give up all that is near and dear to him, nay his very Life, for the Service of his Country, or for the ſake of a Friend more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to his Country than himſelf, if he believes that he ſhall exiſt again after Death, and then either receive a Recompence of Reward, or find it in his increaſing virtuous Affections: but to ſacrifice him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54733:22"/>
and his neareſt and deareſt Relations for the Service of his Country, when he believes that both he himſelf, and they whom he ſacrifices, ſhall exiſt no more, is not poſſible to be done, in my judgment, by any but a humorous Man, whoſe Fancy is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated with metaphyſical lofty unaccountable Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies. I remember, I confeſs, that <hi>Tully,</hi> in his Book of Offices, ſays, that to contemn Life for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Publick, <hi>magni &amp; excelſi animi eſt,</hi> is the part of a great and gallant Mind: And I am told by them that have read <hi>Tully</hi> with more care and heedful Obſervation than I pretend to, that <hi>Tully</hi> never made that Notion of a future State an Argument to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the Practice of Virtue: If ſo, then I may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>Tully</hi> did not give any credit to that No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then it will follow, that his Doctrine, <hi>viz. To contemn Life for the Intereſt of the Publick, is the part of a great and gallant Mind,</hi> is contrary to mine: but 'tis Reaſon I require, and not Authority. Yet I do not grant that <hi>Tully</hi> never made the Notion of a future State an Argument to Virtue. I will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to examine that Aſſertion before I finiſh theſe Papers. I am much told alſo by ſome, who differ with me in theſe Speculations, as much as they agree with me in Friendſhip, that it is moſt juſt, fitting, reaſonable, the Publick ſhould be prefer'd before the Private. But I deſire theſe my Friends to tell me, if they can give any reaſon why the Publick ſhould be prefer'd before the Private, beſides this which I now give, <hi>viz.</hi> Every private Member of the Society has agreed to do it, and has an Intereſt in doing it. If they can give me no other reaſon, which I am perſwaded they cannot, then I note, that when a private good Man has no Intereſt in the Publick, he has no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Publick. I word it, that when a private <hi>good Man</hi> has, &amp;c. for I grant that a juſtly condemn'd Traitor, who has no longer an intereſt in the Publick,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54733:22"/>
is yet in Conſcience bound quietly to ſuffer the Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Law by him broken; and not only ſo, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he expreſly or tacitly conſented to the Law by which he dies, he ought for the common good to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his traitorous Accomplices. I reſtrain my note to a <hi>good</hi> Man, whoſe Virtue, through the Iniquity of the times, and the unrighteous Adminiſtration of the Executive Power, might, by accident, fatally endanger him. Such a Man is not bound to ſtrive againſt the ſtream for his Country's good, to his own (in all probability) utter ruin. I take this to be manifeſt, tho 'tis (before I was aware) ſomething more than the Poſition which I undertook to make good, oblig'd me to meddle with; for I was only to prove, that there would be more Pain than Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſuch a virtuous Labour, ſuppoſing it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be attempted, and I think I have prov'd it: and if there be more Pain than Pleaſure in ſome vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Actions, then there's an end of the Excellence of thoſe virtuous Actions; then they have not that Worth, as that they ſhould be lov'd for their own ſakes. Thus upon the ſuppoſition of no future State, it appears that it is not reaſonable to practiſe Virtue, whenever it is likely to rob us of our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, Fame, Health, or Life: and on the contrary, if it be reaſonable to practiſe Virtue in ſuch difficult caſes, then it muſt be ſo on this ground, becauſe it is very probable that we ſhall exiſt again in a future State. Thus have I expatiated upon one Reaſon why I think it moſt probable that the Mind of Man ſhall exiſt again after Death.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now aſſign another, and treat of it more ſuccinctly, becauſe what I have inſiſted on already makes way for it, and helps to illuſtrate it.</p>
            <p>That Belief, which is generally neceſſary for the tolerable well-being of the human Syſtem, muſt needs be a Belief of things certainly true: and on
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54733:23"/>
the contrary, that Belief which is apparently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the tolerable well-being of the human Syſtem, muſt needs be a Belief of things abſolutly falſe. But the belief of a future State, wherein the Virtuous ſhall be happy, the Vicious unhappy, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally neceſſary for the tolerable well-being of the human Syſtem, and therefore it is a Belief of what muſt needs be true; and the Belief, that after this Life ended Men ſhall exiſt no more, is apparently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the tolerable well-being of the human Syſtem, and therefore it is a Belief of what muſt needs be falſe. To do our Author Juſtice, he does grant, <hi>p.</hi> 63, 64. that the Belief of future Reward and Puniſhment is capable of raiſing Men to Virtue, and of ſaving them from falling into a licentious and vicious Practice; tho, I know not how, <hi>p.</hi> 68. he ſays ſomething in abatement, <hi>viz.</hi> the doing any thing on the conſideration and foreſight merely of Reward, is no Virtue; nor can the endeavour after Virtue, the ſetting about to make one's ſelf virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous on that ſcore, be any Virtue. I look upon our Author to be a Man of Virtue and Probity, but I am fully ſatisfied, that this latter Paſſage does not at all ſerve the Cauſe of Virtue, nor the former ſo much as I could wiſh: for I reckon, that I have prov'd, that the taking prudent care of a Man's private Intereſt muſt needs be firſt in his thoughts, and is truly virtuous; not to injure others, is Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence; to do them all good, is the Perfection of Virtue. I am pleas'd that our Author grants, that the belief of future Reward and Puniſhment is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of raiſing Men to Virtue; but I contend far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and now hope to make it appear, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a future State, wherein the Virtuous ſhall be happy, the Vicious unhappy, is generally neceſſary for the tolerable well-being of the human Syſtem. It is to this Belief we owe, that thoſe who are vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54733:23"/>
in difficult times and inſtances (how few or how many ſoever they are) do not run with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to do evil. It is to this Belief we owe, that ſuch Men do not ſit ſtill ſatisfied with their particular unmoleſted Condition; but generouſly venture all their Secular Intereſts to maintain the Cauſe of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to promote the Practice of moral Goodneſs, and to redeem the Liberty and Welfare of their Country: And if there were not a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theſe in all, as yet free Kingdoms, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, long e're this there had been no ſuch thing as Commonwealth or Kingdom free: and if there were not ſome ſuch as theſe in Kingdoms and Commonwealths inſlav'd, the Adminiſtration there would be yet more tyrannic and miſchievous than it is; the People in thoſe Commonwealths and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms much more abus'd and waſted than they are. It is to this Belief we owe the generous Offices of Humanity, of Love, and charitable Supports, which even in our late times we have known dealt to many innocent Perſons, when they were miſerably ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſs'd by a Power that overbore the Law to ruin them. It is to this Belief we owe much, perhaps the greateſt part of the Honeſty which is in Trade; for tho falſe dealing is common, yet honeſt dealing is not ſo hard to be found neither as ſome would perſwade us, who both vilify Human Nature, and deny the future State. By the way, it is not well done of them denying the future State, at one time to ſpeak of noble virtuous Tempers, that are ſuch without regard to what may be hereafter, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time to inſinuate, that all Men would be Rogues and Knaves had they the ſecure opportunity, and agreable temptation. I return. Honeſt dealing, infrequent as it is, would be yet more infrequent, if ſome Men were not influenc'd by future Hopes and Fears. Who would not uſe falſe Arts and ways
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54733:24"/>
in Trade, at leaſt ſo long till he had provided a Competence ſutable to his Deſires, for himſelf and Family, if he believ'd that Death was the end of all things? Indeed Reputation on the one hand, and the danger of Penal Laws on the other, may prevent much fraud; but I now ſpeak only of that Fraud which might be ſecretly and ſecurely practis'd. No ſecure Opportunities of unjuſt Gain would ever be let ſlip, by a Man of a Fortune but moderate, or low, if he had no proſpect of being the better for his Virtue hereafter: For tho we are naturally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to help our Kind, yet I think not till we have firſt provided what we judg we ſhall need for our ſelves. He that fares very hardly, when he might accommodate himſelf better by a Fraud, which may chance to ly both out of the reach of the Law, and out of the danger of diſcovery, can be prompted to deteſt ſuch a tempting Injuſtice, only by his Perſwaſion of future Exiſtence; at what time his patient enduring of Hardſhips, his Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from ſecure lucrous Injuſtice, his inexpugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Virtue ſhall make him inconceiveable amends. In ſhort, if it were not for this belief of a future Exiſtence, we ſhould ſeldom or never have any thing great and good, uſeful and praiſe-worthy ſaid or done: Suſpicions, Jealouſy, and Diffidence, would encreaſe to ſuch a height, as to leave no poſſible room for Friendſhip, one of the greateſt Pleaſures of Life; we ſhould have nothing prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd among Men, but that Honeſty which they did not loſe by, or could not avoid, with a little cheap and eaſy, cold and cautious Civility thrown in upon occaſion. I think I have now made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the belief of a future State, wherein the Virtuous ſhall be happy, the Vicious unhappy, is generally neceſſary for the tolerable well-being of the human Syſtem: Now thence I gather, that it is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54733:24"/>
a Belief which muſt needs be true; and on the other ſide, the Belief, that after this Life ended, Men ſhall exiſt no more, being deſtructive of the tolerable well-being of the human Syſtem, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that it is a falſe Belief: For tho it may often happen in particular Caſes, that the leading a Man into the knowledg, and perſwading him of the truth of a thing, may prove detrimental to him, yet this is but by accident, thro ſome weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition of the Mind, or pravity of the Temper of the Perſon, who is perſwaded and let into the knowledg of Truth: Truth in its own nature has no unhappy detrimental Tendency, or to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Men, or to Mankind in general. Now the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of what I have bin diſcourſing, is of moſt wide, is of univerſal, moſt uſeful, and advantageous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to all and every Man; and therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, it muſt needs be a true Belief: The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Belief is of moſt wide, is of univerſal, moſt pernicious, and deſtructive Influence to all and every Man; and therefore I conclude, it muſt needs be a falſe Belief. I am ſtrongly perſwaded, that hardly any man will dare to ſay, that a Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion univerſally pernicious and deſtructive, may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly prove true; that a Belief univerſally uſeful and advantageous, may poſſibly prove falſe: but I am ſure our Author cannot ſay it, who, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Book, affirms that all things in the Univerſe are according to a good order, and that nothing could have bin contriv'd more wiſely, with more Advantage to the general Intereſt of Beings: for it is no good Order, but diametrically contrary to the general Intereſt of Rational Beings, that Truth ſhould be, of its own nature, miſchievous; Falſhood, of its own nature, uſeful and advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. As I once ſaid before, I look upon our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor as a Man of Virtue and Probity; he grants
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54733:25"/>
much of what I have ſaid concerning the uſefulneſs of the Belief above-mention'd, and of the miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſneſs of the contrary: For by the belief of future Advantages to Virtue, he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 75. <hi>That a Man may keep himſelf virtuous, where an Atheiſt cannot.</hi> I advance farther, and infer, from the Conceſſion, the truth of that Belief, which is able to <hi>keep a Man virtuous, where the Atheiſtical Belief cannot.</hi> And when any Perſon ſhall ſhew me the weakneſs of my Inference, I promiſe to revoke it. In the mean time I cannot but wonder at what has fall'n from our Author's Pen, <hi>p.</hi> 51. <q>Religion (according to the kind it may be of) is capable of doing great good, or great harm, and Atheiſm not any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive good or harm.</q> I grant the former part of this Aſſertion, Religion (according to the kind it may be of) is capable of doing great good or great harm: But then I contend, that Atheiſm is incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of doing poſitive good, and capable of doing nothing but poſitive harm. The Reaſon which our Author brings for his offenſive Doctrine, is, <q>For however it (Atheiſm) may be indirectly an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of Mens loſing a good and ſufficient ſenſe of Right and Wrong; yet it will not, as Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm merely, be the occaſion of ſetting up falſe Right and Wrong, which only fantaſtical Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,</q> ill Cuſtom, or ill Religion can do. To this I reply, that Atheiſm, as <hi>Atheiſm merely,</hi> tho it tends not to any Religion at all, yet it does lead Men to ill Cuſtom, and fantaſtical Reaſoning, which our Author admits likely to be the occaſion of ſetting up falſe Right and Wrong, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of doing no poſitive good, but much poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive harm: For if the Atheiſt is capable of doing any poſitive good, it muſt be only then, when his Circumſtances in the World are eaſy, and to his Hearts content; but at every other time, if he has
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54733:25"/>
an inviting great probability of Succeſs and Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he cannot reſtrain himſelf from making his Circumſtances eaſy, and to his Hearts content, by doing poſitive harm. This I have prov'd in what went before; I only now add, that I am ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the opinion, that were our Author to chooſe a Servant with whom he muſt intruſt a conſiderable Stewardſhip in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where he had no means narrowly to inſpect his Management, or puniſh his Miſmanagement, he would rather chooſe a Servant of good Reputation in the belief of a future State, than a Servant of good Reputation in the Atheiſtick Belief.</p>

               <hi>P.</hi> 53. <q>It is poſſible for a Creature capable of uſing Reflection, to have a liking or diſlike of moral Actions, and conſequently a ſenſe of Right and Wrong, before ſuch time as he may have any Notion or Senſe of God at all: this is what will hardly be queſtion'd.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By ſeveral Paſſages which follow, I cannot but allow, that our Author has no ill meaning in this; but then it has ſo untoward an Air, and is liable to ſo obvious and unhappy Miſconſtruction, that I think fit to deſcant upon it; but this I ſhall do with all candour.</p>
            <p>That a Creature capable of uſing Reflection, may have a <hi>Diſlike</hi> of moral Actions, before he has any Notion or Senſe of God at all; thus much of the Remark is by me wholly granted to our Author: For, nothing can contribute more to a <hi>Diſlike</hi> of moral Actions, than the utter want of all Notion or Senſe of God. But what degree of liking of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Actions, what meaſure of ſenſe concerning right and wrong, a Creature capable of uſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection may have, before he has any Notion or Senſe of God at all, ought to be carefully examin'd and diſtinctly weigh'd, before any deduction be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54733:26"/>
made or intimated from ſuch a Remark as this.</p>
            <p>With our Author's leave thus much I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to determine and make good, <hi>viz.</hi> It will not only be queſtion'd, but abſolutely deny'd by the generality of thinking Men, that a Creature capable of uſing Reflection, can have ſo juſt a liking of moral Actions, and ſo true a ſenſe of Right and Wrong, before he has the notion and ſenſe of God, as he ought to have, and cannot but have, uſing Reflection, when he has once learn'd the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and becomes affected with the ſenſe of a God.</p>
            <p>Indeed moral Actions are altogether agreable to a rational Nature, or (as our Author phraſes it) to a Creature uſing Reflection: but the Exerciſe of his Reaſon, or his uſing Reflection will lead him to the Notion of a God, and that Notion will make his Senſe of right or wrong more correct, and give it a larger Scope, give it a wider field to exerciſe it ſelf in; that Notion heedfully adverted to, will raiſe his liking of moral Actions far above what it could arrive at without it. And this our Author ſeems to grant, <hi>p.</hi> 59. <q>If there be a Being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd All-intelligent and All-ſeeing, of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Power, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs, the Belief of ſuch a Being muſt of neceſſity be highly effectual to the creating or farthering of good Affections, and to the removing of contrary ones, by rendering every thing that is of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue more lovely, ſplendid, and attractive; and every thing that is of Vice, more ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deform'd.</q> But without the Notion of a Being All-intelligent, All-ſeeing, of infinite Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, the rational or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting Creature's liking of moral Actions, will ſhow it ſelf only in ſome cheap and eaſy Inſtances, and be very apt to be diverted or abated by the ſecular Intereſt of the private Syſtem. In few and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54733:26"/>
plain words, this matter may be thus ſum'd up: A Man that has no Notion nor Senſe of a God may poſſibly like and practiſe moral Actions, when he has no beloved Luſt to gratify, nor dreaded Danger to avoid, the one of which may be eaſily gratified, and the other ſecurely avoided by Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons immoral: but when he has a beloved Luſt to gratify, which may be eaſily gratified, or a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Danger to avoid, which may be ſecurely avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and no Notion nor Senſe of God at all to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence him, he will at that time be ſure to gratify his Luſt, and do what he can to avoid his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, tho the means to be us'd for ſuch ends be never ſo immoral: the reaſon of this is, becauſe in all Creatures, eſpecially the rational, Self-love is the predominant Principle. A rational Creature who believes a God, and expects a future Exiſtence, may generouſly prefer the noble Intereſts of Society be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Wealth and Health, and even his Life it ſelf, if the Caſe ſo require, becauſe he expects hereafter to find an inconceivable Advantage in ſo doing: but there is no Argument in Nature, no Reaſon, nor ſhadow of a Reaſon to perſwade a rational Man who knows nothing of God, and expects no future Exiſtence, to venture the loſs of his Life, or but of his Eſtate (without which he cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Neceſſaries for his Wife and Children) for the Service of his Country, when the Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof are in danger either from crafty Prieſts impoſing gainful Doctrines for neceſſary Faith, or arbitrary Princes diſpenſing with the Laws which they ſwore to maintain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 81. <q>It will appear that one who has not the opinion or belief of an intelligent Principle, or God, may, tho very difficultly, and at a great hazard, be capable of Virtue, ſo as to have an Honeſty, a Faith, a Juſtice, perhaps of great
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54733:27"/>
Note and Worth; may have many generous and good Paſſions, and poſſibly that of love to Virtue for its own ſake, as well as for being believ'd advantageous.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am not willing to quit the reſpect which I have, and think I ought to have for our Author; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but declare that he has here made a very erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and pernicious Concluſion, which neither does appear from the Reaſons by him offer'd, nor can it be made to appear from any thing which the Wit of Man can offer: indeed he has cautiouſly worded his Concluſion, and wiſely guarded himſelf. He has wiſely guarded himſelf in this Prefatory Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—<q>If the Reaſons I have offer'd be found of any weight.</q> I am glad that he is not confident of having prov'd ſo erroneous and pernicious a Doctrine. He has worded it very cautiouſly, <hi>viz.</hi> in theſe Phraſes and Terms of abatement, <q>may, tho with great difficulty, and at a great hazard,—may perhaps,</q>—may poſſibly. But contrary to what he has thus concluded, I have already prov'd, and ſhall now eſſay farther to confirm it, that one who has not the Opinion or Belief of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Principle or God, can by no means be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch a Virtue, as to have an Honeſty, a Faith, a Juſtice of great weight and worth. I take my riſe for what I have now in my thoughts, from a Paſſage of our Author, according to him, <hi>p.</hi> 59. The word God imports no leſs than a Being all-intelligent, all-ſeeing, of infinite Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs. <q>The Belief of ſuch a Being (he ſays) muſt of neceſſity be highly effectual to the creating or farthering of good Affections, and to the removing of contrary ones, by rendring every thing that is of Virtue more lovely, ſplendid and attractive; and every thing that is of Vice, more ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and deform'd.</q> Now the Lovelineſs of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54733:27"/>
conſiſts wholly in its Advantageouſneſs, Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſneſs of one ſort or other, or elſe 'tis an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Phraſe, mere inſignificant Cant. Such as the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſneſs of Virtue is, ſuch, and no other, is its Lovelineſs: and on the other ſide, anſwerable to the Diſadvantageouſneſs of Vice, is its Ignominy and Deformity. By the belief of a Being all-intelligent, all-ſeeing, of infinite Power, Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a rational Creature becomes perſwaded of a greater Advantageouſneſs in Virtue, Diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geouſneſs in Vice, than he could poſſibly be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of without it. The belief of a Being with the abovementioned Perfections makes Man's future Exiſtence credible; for, I have already prov'd that all things are not according to a good order, if Man ſhall not exiſt again. I add now, if Man's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Exiſtence be neceſſary to juſtify God's Wiſdom, it is not hard to be conceiv'd how the ſame is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to juſtify his Goodneſs: For, the worldly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of free Agents, who make the worſt uſe of their free Will, and the worldly Adverſity of free Agents, who make right uſe of it, are as unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Arguments againſt the Goodneſs, as againſt the Wiſdom of God, if free Agents muſt not exiſt again. I need not make words to ſhow, how the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and Omniſcience of God join with his infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs to aſcertain us of our future Exiſtence. Now if there be a God, who is (as our Author allows the word to ſignify) a Being all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligent, all-ſeeing, of infinite Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs; then we ſhall exiſt again, and after this Life receive <hi>Rewards,</hi> or (to ſpeak with them whoſe nicer Philoſophy excepts againſt that term <hi>Rewards)</hi> we ſhall become inconceivably happy by our Virtue, and unexpreſſible Loſers by our Vice. And this Perſwaſion is evidently powerful to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Men to the practice of the moſt difficult Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54733:28"/>
and to reſtrain them from the moſt pleaſing, ſecret, and ſecure Vice. Such a Man as this may have, nay, uſing Reflection, cannot but have Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, Faith, and Juſtice of the greateſt note and worth, cannot but have many generous and good Paſſions, not without a love to Virtue for its own ſake: But he that has not the Opinion or Belief of an intelligent Principle or God, may perhaps be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſome cheap and eaſy Virtue, ſuch as ſutes beſt with his natural Temper, and does not much trouble the Condition of his Affairs; but is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly incapable of that more noble, and more difficult Virtue, which threatens ruin to his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, or an untimely end to his Life.</p>
            <p>I determine thus, becauſe there is in every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (to uſe our Author's Phraſe) a certain Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or Good, which is as an end in that Creature, to which God or Nature deſign'd him. That certain Intereſt or Good, to which God or Nature deſign'd his rational Creature Man, Man is bound in duty to purſue: to this end, if his Paſſions and Affections are wiſely, primarily directed, it is his duty, it is that which he ought to do, and for which he ought to be commended.</p>
            <p>If there be any ſuch thing as God, or Virtue, then there muſt be a future State: this Conſequence I have in ſome meaſure already prov'd, and mean to confirm it further, but I will take no advantage of it now.</p>
            <p>If there be any ſuch thing as a future State, then it is the Duty and Virtue of a rational Man prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to direct his Paſſions and Affections for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his Intereſt in that State, becauſe his Intereſt in that State (ſuppoſing ſuch a thing) is immenſly more conſiderable than his Intereſt in this: but if there be no future State, then the certain Intereſt, or Good, or chief End of Man, is ſuch as his Nature is capable of in this Life; and his purſuing that is
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54733:28"/>
what he ought to do, is his Virtue, or elſe Virtue is but a Name, of which no body knows what to make.</p>
            <p>If Man's chief Intereſt, Good, or End be in a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State, then he ought not, cannot diſpenſe with his Care to purchaſe <hi>that,</hi> for the ſake of any Intereſt of any others. If Man's chief Intereſt, Good or End, be in this preſent Life, then he ought not, cannot diſpenſe with his preferring <hi>that</hi> before any Intereſt of any others; and thence it will undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly follow, that he is utterly incapable of practiſing any inſtance of noble and difficult Virtue, which happens to threaten ruin to his Fortunes, and an untimely end to his Life. But I will ſearch into this matter yet more nicely, that I may take from my Adverſaries all ſubtil ſpecious pretence of Reply.</p>
            <p>The chief Intereſt, Good or End of Man in this Life is either corporeal, or mental; if the Mind be a Principle diſtinct from Body, then this diſtinction is juſt, and ought to be admitted, and may be thus deſin'd, or deſcrib'd: Mental Intereſt is the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which the Mind receives by reflecting on its Virtue; Corporeal Intereſt is the Pleaſure which the Mind taſts by mediation of the Senſes. If the Mind is not a Principle diſtinct from Body, then all our Intereſt in this Life is only Corporeal, and all Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure no other than bodily Pleaſure; and then a Man ought to prefer his bodily Pleaſure before any Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of any others, becauſe if there be no future Exiſtence, bodily Pleaſure is his chief Intereſt, Good or End.</p>
            <p>But perhaps ſome Friends of our Author, tho they admit nothing but Body in Nature, and eſteem Thinking, and Arguing to be the effects only of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Motion, may yet diſtinguiſh as I have done, and make the Pleaſure which Human Nature is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, twofold; the Pleaſure which is taſted by
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54733:29"/>
means of the Senſes, and the Pleaſure which is taſted by Reflection. Hereupon perhaps they may ſay, that the Pleaſure which is taſted by Reflection (which they will call too, the Pleaſure of the Mind) is the chief Intereſt, Good, or End of Man; and then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that tho the Pleaſure of the Mind, which is taſted by Reflection, cannot but be prefer'd by a reaſonable Man before all other Conſiderations whatſoever, that may happen to come in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it; yet Corporeal Pleaſure, the Pleaſure which is taſted by mediation of the Senſes, is a meaner Intereſt and End, which a reaſonable Man ought not to purſue before the Intereſts of Society, tho there be no Life after this. Theſe Gentlemen (and I think our Author accords with them thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his ſecond Book) determine that the preſent mental Satisfaction, which good Men receive by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on their virtuous Actions, is ſufficient to perſwade all conſidering Perſons to the practice of Virtue, tho there be no Life after this. I reply, it may be ſufficient to perſwade the moſt conſidering Perſons in moſt caſes, but in all caſes it is not ſo. I have given ſome inſtances, I am able to give many more, and ſhall if that be ſtood upon; but, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it may not by impartial Readers, I chuſe to argue cloſely, and carry on my Reply: That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration which is not ſufficient to prompt think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſons to Virtue in all caſes, does in effect, if there be no other to be offer'd, betray the Cauſe of Virtue; for if the neceſſity of Virtue be not in all caſes as well as in ſome, in the moſt difficult caſes as well as in the moſt common and eaſy, provided for, the Cauſe of Virtue is as good as given up: For, who ſhall draw the Line, and meaſure Diſtances, ſet out the exact Bounds, and nicely determine, that if Circumſtances be ſo and ſo diſcouraging, Dangers ſo and ſo preſſing, a good
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54733:29"/>
Man need not hazard his Fortunes or his Life, to ſerve his Friend, the ſtarving Mobility, or the Liberty and Property of the Freeholders of his Country; but in all caſes one moment leſs diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging, leſs preſſing and hazardous, it becomes him to be reſolutely virtuous, honeſt and good. 'Tis precarious Impertinence for any Man to pretend any thing of this nature; for, the reaſonableneſs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true to one's Friend, juſt to all Perſons, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Neceſſitous, and bold in the defence of Liberty and Property, is not at all alter'd by the different Circumſtances of Times, Things or Places, but remains always one and the ſame, be they more or leſs diſcouraging, preſſing and hazardous, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any alteration, unleſs that it greatly becomes a virtuous, honeſt and good Man, when his Duty hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be more difficult and dangerous, to exert himſelf ſo much the more. And to do this, he ſhall never want Motive ſufficiently powerful, if he be throly convinc'd of the certainty of a future State: but if he be not, a cheaper, eaſier Virtue ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him. Now to prevent an Objection which I ſuſpect, and to take away all <hi>anſa</hi> of Cavil, I own, that now and then an eminent Perſon may in an odd humour, and in an unthinking heat, venture on a glorious Action, that not only looks well, but is alſo highly uſeful, and beneficial to the Publick, which may coſt him his honourable Station in the Commonwealth, the loſs of his Fortunes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of his Life, tho he believes no future State: but I poſitively affirm, that this can be done by no Man who disbelieves a future State, when he acts deliberately; and I defy all my Adverſaries round, together with the Author of the Inquiry, and his Favourers, to aſſign a Reaſon ſufficient to prompt a deliberate thinking Man to do it. I have diſcours'd with ſome of them, Men of as ſingular Learning,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54733:30"/>
and of as acute Parts perhaps as any that now live; and nothing could I ever hear from them as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for Virtue, the future State not being ſuppos'd, but that Virtue was its own preſent ſufficient Reward, which, as I have ſhewn, holds but in common caſes. I have alſo ſhown to how little purpoſe they affect the uſe of that fam'd ſaying, Virtue is its own Reward, and to be lov'd for its own ſake. To love Virtue for its own ſake, as the brave Heathen Philoſophers us'd to ſpeak, and to love God for his own ſake, as we now commonly word it, ſignifies nothing but to love God without low ſecular Regards: to love Virtue, when it is diſcountenanc'd, when it is the Enemy of a Man's temporal Ends and Proſperities; this he only can conſtantly do who believes a future State. But I am amaz'd to hear our Author expoſe his own Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as he does in the cloſe of the Paſſage by me laſt cited. <q>A Man (ſays he) who has not the Belief of a God, may poſſibly love Virtue for its own ſake, as well as for being believ'd ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Can any thing deſerve to be lov'd for its own ſake which is not advantageous? If ſo, then our Author will incur this groſs Abſurdity, that a thing may deſerve to be lov'd for its own ſake, which is not at all lovely. Certainly this is the oddeſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction that ever was coin'd by a Man of Letters and good Senſe, which every one that reads our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's <hi>Inquiry concerning Virtue,</hi> muſt grant him to be. If Advantageouſneſs be not that which makes Virtue deſerve to be lov'd for its own ſake, then, for ought I know, Vice may deſerve to be lov'd for its own ſake, in which there is nothing truly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous. But I leave it to our Author's ſecond thoughts, whether he will forgo this Diſtinction, or
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54733:30"/>
explain it; for my part, I know not what to make of it as it lies. Juſt at this moment, a Gentleman, that knows what Subject I am writing upon, and has ſeen ſome of my Papers, is pleas'd to tell me, that I have imitated an abſurd Practice of the Papiſts, proving one Doctrine by another that needs proof. The Papiſts (ſays this Gentleman) having a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Intereſt in the Doctrine of praying to Saints, and thereupon a great inclination to believe it, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the ſame, when the Proteſtants objected that the Saints could not hear Prayers, by this Invention. The Saints underſtood all things, viewing them in the mirror of Divinity; or as others are pleas'd to phraſe it, <hi>in ſpeculo Trinitatis,</hi> in the Looking-glaſs of the Trinity: So I having an inclination to believe a future State, and not being able to demonſtrate it by direct proof, endeavour to make it good by this fetch, There muſt be a future State, or there can be no ſuch thing as Virtue. Now by the favour of this Gentleman, whoſe ſingular Learning I high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour, I ſhall ſhow that there is no manner of ſimilitude between the Practice of the Papiſts in the Inſtance before us, and mine in managing the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument I have attempted. There might be a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude perhaps, if he would put it thus: The Papiſts prove that Saints ought to be pray'd to, becauſe elſe there's no ſuch thing as a Mirror of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or Looking-glaſs of the Trinity, wherein all things are viſible to them: And I prove the truth of a future State, becauſe elſe there's no neceſſity of Virtue. But then I deſire this Gentleman to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that both he and I laugh at the Mirror of the Divinity, or <hi>Speculum Trinitatis,</hi> as much as at the Doctrine of praying to Saints; whereas tho he queſtions the future State, yet we both admit the neceſſity of Virtue: therefore if I ſhow that there is no Argument ſufficient to prompt Men to Virtue,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54733:31"/>
and reſtrain them from Vice in the moſt difficult Times and Places, but the Belief of a future State, I appeal to all impartial Judges, whether I don't gain my point.</p>
            <p>One of my Friends, who is, as I am, fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that we ſhall exiſt again in a more bleſſed or ſad State, according as we frame our Spirits, and demean our ſelves in this Life, did once let me know that he had ſome Meditations in hand, whereby he thinks he ſhall demonſtrate the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul: But what he has farther than ſuch moral Demonſtration as I have offer'd, Demonſtration from the generally receiv'd Idea of God, and from the Conceſſions of all Men of Senſe, who are not ſuch Enemies to Virtue, as in ſome Caſes to free Mankind from the Obligation; alſo what he has farther than high Probabilities from Topics Philoſophical, with regard to which Men of Senſe are in Prudence bound to act, I cannot conceive: and to ſpeak ingenuouſly, I do not think it agreable to the infinite Wiſdom, which we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg in God, to have made the Notions of a future State, and the Immortality of the Soul, ſo clear, obvious, and certain, as to put them beyond diſpute. For where Notions are but high Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, or ſuch moral Demonſtrations as require Thought and Labour to make out; Attention and quitting all Prejudices before they can be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there is room for the exerciſe of Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Prudence, and Induſtry: But were all bright Demonſtration concerning the Notions of future State, and the Soul's Immortality, the matter is ſo vaſtly, ſo immenſly momentous, that we ſhould be irreſiſtibly carried to ſecure our chief Intereſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſoning and conſidering upon it; and then our Happineſs would be our Fate, not the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Reward of our wiſe Meditation, and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54733:31"/>
rational Choices. If it be agreeable to the infinite Wiſdom of God to create a Creature with the Powers of conſidering, thinking, and reflecting, and to leave him much in the hands of his own Free Will, ſo that he may conſider, think, reflect, and act wiſely, or let it alone; then to me it ſeems neceſſary, that the Notions of future State and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, ſhould be no clearer, nor more obvious, nor more certain than they are, <hi>i. e.</hi> but demonſtrably certain upon the ſuppoſition that all Men are oblig'd to be morally honeſt in all Times, Circumſtances, and Places; and alſo but highly probable from Philoſophical Arguments. The Uſe that I make of this, is, That I hope my Adverſaries will not deny, but that all Men are oblig'd to be morally honeſt in all Times, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and Places; and that it becomes wiſe Men to conſider, think, and reflect; and that where they are not govern'd by the greateſt Probabilities, there they are not wiſe: and if they can give me a cogent Argument, which ſhall oblige Men to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and reſtrain them from Vice, in all Times, Circumſtances, and Places, a future State not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppos'd, I promiſe to diſcard it.</p>
            <p>Our Author in the 2<hi>d</hi> part of his Book profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly propoſes to ſhow what Obligation there is to Virtue, and how any one may have reaſon to embrace Virtue, and ſhun Vice. In this part he ingenuouſly and appoſitely to this Deſign expatiates upon many uſeful Notices, which have no ſmall Influence to perſwade to Virtue, and reſtrain from Vice, but offers at no Reaſon which comes up ſo high; as to perſwade Men to the one, and reſtrain them from the other, in thoſe difficult Caſes which I have ſtated. Now tho I think that I have ſufficiently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd my Diſcourſe already, from what might be objected out of this Author (for his 2<hi>d</hi> Book has
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54733:32"/>
no new Notions in abatement of what I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd concerning a future State) yet I purpoſe to look into this ſecond part, that I may not ſeem knowingly to have overlook'd any Obligation to Virtue, which might perhaps be thought powerful enough to influence conſidering Perſons in all Times, Circumſtances, and Places, without the interventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a future State.</p>
            <p>P. <hi>83. His Preface, in ſhort, runs thus:</hi> To be virtuous, is for a rational Creature, in the uſe of good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding and Judgment, to have the diſpoſition and temper of his Mind ſutable and agreeing with the good of his Kind. A rational Creature, whoſe Affections are ſutable and agreeing to the good of his Kind, has alſo other Affections towards the private Nature or Self-ſyſtem; and in following the firſt of theſe, the Creature muſt often contradict and go againſt the latter: it may ſeem there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the purſuing the common Intereſt or good of his Kind, is a hindrance to the attainment of private Good. <hi>I do here, and ſhall abridg, keeping very cloſe to his Phraſe, not in the leaſt varying his Senſe.</hi> P. <hi>85.</hi> Affections to the good of the Publick do often expoſe to Hardſhips and Hazards, by over-ruling their Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, the Self-preſervative Paſſions, and by neceſſitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creature to Self-denial, and, <hi>as it were,</hi> Self-deſertion. <hi>Well! the Truth of this we ſubſcribe to, but now we want to know what that is, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide the Notion of a future State, which has a force of ſound Reaſon powerful enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade conſidering Men to cheriſh their good Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the Publick, when the doing ſo expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them to Hardſhips and Hazards, and forces them to deny themſelves, and quit their ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative Paſſions (which, by the way, is Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion with a witneſs, Self-deſertion, without the abatement in that Phraſe,</hi> As it were.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:54733:32"/>
To ſolve this Difficulty, after ſome Amuſements, our Author addreſſes himſelf thus: <hi>P.</hi> 90, 91. <hi>The natural Affections towards the private Syſtem, or Self, may be in a too great, and therefore vitious degree; they may alſo be too weak, in a degree too low and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious that way.</hi> He makes this out by ſeveral Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but I need not trouble my ſelf with his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, for I admit the Notion: Natural Affections to the private or Self-ſyſtem, may be too ſtrong, or too weak, and then are vitious. This being laid down, I was expecting how he would manage it, in proof of this difficult Propoſition which lies upon his hands, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Man was oblig'd to cheriſh good Affections towards the Publick, when the doing ſo would expoſe him to Hardſhips and Hazards, force him to deny himſelf, and quit his ſelf-preſervative Paſſions; but inſtead of this, all that our Author propoſes to himſelf to prove, is, <hi>p.</hi> 101. That to have excellent Affections (ſuch as have bin mention'd, juſt Affections both to publick and private) is to have the chief enjoyment of life. 2. To have the Self-paſſions exceſſive, and beyond a juſt degree, is injurious to the Creature, and of Self-ill. 3. To have no Affections towards the Kind, nor ſelf-ones, is prejudicial to the Creature.</p>
            <p>Now let all theſe Propoſitions be granted him, I do not ſee that he has made the leaſt ſtep towards ſolving the Difficulty which he had rais'd: he offers not one word to prove, that a Man ought to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh good Affections to the publick, when the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo will expoſe him to Hardſhips and Hazards, and make him quit his ſelf-preſervative Paſſions: All that I can collect from the whole courſe of his Reaſonings in what follows, is, That a Man's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to private good, is too high, or too low, and thereby irregular and vitious, when his ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and taking care of himſelf takes off his Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54733:33"/>
from the Publick; <hi>i. e.</hi> in ſhort, according to our Author, whenever publick and private Good come in competition with one another, a Man is in Duty bound to undergo Hardſhips and Hazards, to deny, to deſert himſelf, to quit his ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative Paſſions, and labour the good of the publick. Now I may take up the words of the rich Man in the Goſpel to our Lord Chriſt, who had recommended to him a Doctrine of ſelf-denial, tho not of quitting his ſelf-preſervative Paſſions: <hi>This is a hard ſaying, and who can bear it?</hi> Wiſe Lawgivers uſe to enforce their Precepts with Promiſes and Threats; ſo our Lord: and in the Old Teſtament this is the Language of the Law, <hi>Do this and live:</hi> But who ever heard of ſuch a Law-giving Language as this, <hi>Do this and die?</hi> Quit your ſelf-preſervative Paſſions, and conſult the good of the Publick, tho you loſe your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, Health, and Life by it; when the good of the Publick is in danger, let the private Syſtem be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crific'd; 'tis a Man's duty then to dy, and there's an end of him.</p>
            <p>As the Apoſtle ſpake of himſelf and Fellow Chriſtians, ſo I of ſuch as cheriſh good Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Publick, <hi>If in this Life only they have hope, they are of all Men the moſt miſerable.</hi> But who ſhall perſwade Men to ſubmit to the Miſeries of which we have ſpake, if there be no hope beyond this Life? Our Author muſt not undertake it, for I find he is furniſh'd with no Arguments to that purpoſe. His Arguments prompt to Virtue only in common Caſes. One that has no other nor better, can have (to uſe our Author's Phraſe and Reaſoning, <hi>p.</hi> 116.) <hi>only a partial Affection to Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, an Affection only to ſome Particulars, which is an Inconſiſtency and Contradiction; this partial Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:54733:33"/>
               <hi>has no Foundation or Eſtabliſhment in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but depends ſolely on Capriciouſneſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might diſmiſs our Author now, and think of concluding this (ſuch as it is) defence of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a future State. But I muſt confeſs I am perſwaded that ſeveral of the moſt ſpeciouſly ſaid things which are behind, are ſo unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worded and diſpos'd, that they tempt, or at leaſt leave room for Opinions inconſiſtent with the univerſal neceſſity of Virtue; I therefore think it meet not to paſs them over altogether without animadverſion: it looks well what he ſays, P. 106. <hi>To have the natural Affections, ſuch as are founded in Love, Complacency, good Will, and in a ſympathy with the Kind or Species, is to have the chief En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Life.</hi> But as far as I can perceive, he takes it for granted, that a Man who disbelieves a future State, may yet have the natural Affections, ſuch as are founded in Love, Complacency, good Will, and in a ſympathy with the Kind or Species, in as high a degree as any one elſe, and by that means be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the chief Enjoyment of Life. Now this I find fault with: for tho I grant, that a Man who queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the future State, and has his natural Affections beneficently diſpos'd to the good of his Kind, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes largely of the chief Enjoyments of life; yet I have already prov'd that ſuch a one cannot in all difficult Circumſtances ſo effectually exert his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Affections, as he that believes a future State: and now I farther add, that the Man who cannot in all difficult Circumſtances ſo effectually exert his beneficent Affections, cannot have that high degree of inward Satisfaction and Joy as the other: for, the wider the Extent, and the higher the Degree of Virtue is, the more ſatisfying and joyous are the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54733:34"/>
reflexive Thoughts in the Mind of a virtuous Man; and what is ſtill more, the bare conſciouſneſs of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting and poſſeſſing the Eſteem and Love of others, cannot poſſibly be ſo ſatisfying and joyous, as when it is join'd with the comfortable aſſurance of having done that which is well-pleaſing to God, and with the expectance of being the better for it, not in this Life only, but alſo in the Life to come.</p>
            <p>It looks very well what he ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 139. <hi>That to want the natural Affections (the above-mention'd benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Affections) is to be chiefly miſerable.</hi> And upon this Head he very truly and pathetically deſcribes the Diſorders and Miſchiefs of exceſſive, irregular, ſelfiſh Paſſions, the Torments of unnatural and horrid Affections; the Pain, Anxiety, Miſery which are conſequent to vain Fear, fierce Anger, Luxury and Luſt, Pride and Ambition; Envy, Hatred and Malice, Revenge, Cruelty, and Tyranny: but all this while he forgets to take notice of what I have already mention'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that tho generally ſpeaking vitious Men are greatly puniſh'd by their own Vices, yet ſome Vices at ſome Opportunities agree better with them; ſome vitious Men know how to manage their Vices with a ſort of Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and while they ſooth their Senſes, and wrong their Neighbour, take care of their Health and Fame. Now nothing can make this ſort of Men uneaſy, but the Conſideration of what may be hereafter. Now this Topick our Author has not inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I cannot ſay he has not touch'd it, but he has touch'd it at ſuch a rate, that without doing him injury, I may venture to ſay he does not ſeem over-earneſtly concern'd to have it believ'd that the Man whoſe Affections are vitious, ought to fear what may befal him in a future State. Let the Reader judg. <hi>P.</hi> 193. <hi>What enjoyment, or what reſt is there for him, who is not conſcious of the merited Affection or</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:54733:34"/>
               <hi>Love of any human Soul, but on the contrary is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of merited Hatred, not only from every Fellow-Creature, but from every thing in the univerſal Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? What ground of Horrour and Deſpair? What foundation of Fear, and continual Apprehenſion from Mankind, and from ſuperiour Powers, whenever any ſuch are credited, or but ſuſpected?</hi> Upon this Paſſage I ſhall make no worſe reflection than this: Tho the thoughts of an ill Man reflecting on his criminal Actions, do naturally create him much Miſery; yet that Diſcourſer, who treating upon this Argument, leaves him room to doubt of a future State, does, againſt the Intereſts of Society and Government, eaſe him of too much of the Burden: For, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever cauſe he has to be troubled in Mind, it is a great abatement to think, that when he dies there's an end of it. Fear and Shame are the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of an evil Inclination; but ſet aſide the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a future State, and from ſome Perſons in ſome Caſes you remove theſe reſtraints: For, ſome Perſons are too big for Laws, and no Man, at leaſt no Infidel to that Notion, bluſhes in the dark. A <hi>Standing Army</hi> and the <hi>Inquiry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Virtue,</hi> will compleat a Tyrant by freeing him from the fear of God and Man; the latter alone will finiſh a Libertine. This may ſeem too ſeverely ſaid, becauſe I have acknowledg'd, that the <hi>Inquiry</hi> offers many excellent Arguments for Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and againſt Vice. But ſince thoſe excellent Arguments are partial, of force only in particular, and not ſerving in all difficult Caſes; ſince no turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, no dangers are mention'd, cauſing Fear or Shame to the Vitious, but what are of no longer duration than this ſhort Life; the mighty and the wary Sinner are really tempted to indulge their irregular Paſſions and Affections.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:54733:35"/>
I diſmiſs our Author; and now it comes into my mind to talk, as I promis'd, with that very learned Acquaintance, who would bear me down that <hi>Tully</hi> never made the Notion of a future State an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Virtue. My reading has been narrow, and my Memory ſuch, as to have little of what I have read at command; but examining it at leiſure, I remember ſomething in <hi>Tully</hi>'s Tract wrote to <hi>Pomponius Atticus,</hi> titled <hi>Cato Major, de Senectute,</hi> which, if I am not greatly miſtaken, diſproves his Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>The Diſcourſe is Dialogue; but what is ſaid under the Perſon of <hi>Cato</hi> was the ſenſe of <hi>Tully,</hi> as is plain from theſe words of his: <hi>Ipſius Catonis ſermo expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabit noſtram omnem de ſenectute ſententiam; Cato</hi>'s Diſcourſe will declare my whole ſenſe concerning old Age. Now not to take advantage of the dying Speech put into the mouth of <hi>Cyrus</hi> by <hi>Xenophon,</hi> which <hi>Tully</hi> under the perſon of <hi>Cato</hi> recites with approbation, let the Reader judg of this Paſſage, ſo remarkable, that it has been almoſt as much cited as any Text in the Bible. <hi>O praeclarum diem, cùm ad illud divinum animorum concilium, coetúm<expan>

Now that which gave <hi>Tully</hi> the confidence of expecting to be happy after Death in the company of thoſe gallant Men, who, as he, had deſerv'd well of the Age they liv'd in, was this: he was not aſham'd of the Life he had led, but was
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54733:35"/>
conſcious to his own Merit. <hi>Non me vixiſſe poenitet, quoniam ita vixi, ut non me fruſtra natum exiſtimem.</hi> Towards the end of this Book he adds, <hi>Quod ſi in hoc erro, quòd animos hominum immortales eſſe credam, lubenter erro: nec mihi hunc errorem, quo delector, dum vivo, extorqueri volo.</hi> If I miſtake in thinking the Souls of Men to be immortal, I miſtake with delight; nor would I have this Miſtake, with which I am pleas'd, torn from me as long as I live.</p>
            <p>I had almoſt overſeen the ſmart Reflection which follows: <hi>Sin mortuus (ut quidam minuti Philoſophi cenſent) nihil ſentiam, non vereor ne hunc errorem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um mortui Philoſophi irrideant.</hi> But if, when I am dead, I become nothing but ſenſleſs Matter (as ſome ſilly Philoſophers think) thoſe ſilly Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers will become ſenſleſs Matter too, and ſo there will be no danger of their hitting me in the teeth with this my Miſtake.</p>
            <p>By this it appears to me, that this Prince of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and true Father of his Country, this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Maſter of righteous Morals, now with his dear <hi>Cato,</hi> the noble <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, his friendly <hi>Fannius, Laelius,</hi> and <hi>Scaevola,</hi> ſuſtain'd his honeſt Mind under all the Labours and Difficulties of Virtue, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the infinite Advantages he ſhould reap in a future State: And ſurely while he acquaints others with what Expectations he was influenc'd, he may juſtly be look'd upon as one that ſeriouſly endeavour'd to influence them by the ſame. It is true, he does not ſpeak of the Immortality of the Soul, and the Bleſſedneſs which waits the Virtuous, with that confidence which is peculiar to Chriſtians; but he ſpeaks of it as of a thing ſo very probable, that he thought it highly became him to expreſs his regard to it, by a Virtue ſo ſettled and firm, as no Adverſity could ſhake.</p>
            <p>

One thing more I deſire of my Acquaintance (whoſe ſingular Parts and Learning make me that I cannot argue againſt him, without fear and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of my ſelf; tho let me do what I can, I am not able to complement him with ſubmitting my Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) <hi>i. e.</hi> that he would a little conſider the Deſign and Purpoſe of <hi>Tully</hi> in that Golden Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſixth Book, <hi>Somnium Scipionis,</hi> the only valuable Remain of ſix Books <hi>de Republicâ;</hi> the loſs of which I ſhould infinitely regret now, as Men of Senſe and Probity have done formerly, were it not for the incomparable Diſcourſes concerning Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which that Wiſe, Learned and truly No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Gentleman <hi>Algernon Sidney</hi> hath left us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tully</hi>'s Dream in the Perſon of <hi>Scipio</hi> is ſo fine a Piece, I can hardly forbear tranſlating the whole: The Reader I hope will forgive me, if I take it from the beginning, and go as far as the Paſſage I ſhall chiefly inſiſt on.</p>
            <p>
               <q>When I came into <hi>Afric,</hi> Colonel (as you know) of the fourth Legion under <hi>Marcus Manilius,</hi> I made it my buſineſs to meet <hi>Maſaniſſa,</hi> a King, who for very good reaſons was much a friend to our Family: I no ſooner came to him, but the aged Prince took me in his Arms, and wept; a while after recovering from his Tranſport, he lifts up his Eyes to Heaven, and breaks out into this Exclamation: O thou great God, the Sun! and you the reſt Inhabitants Celeſtial! I bleſs and praiſe you all, that once before I dy, I have the happineſs to behold within my own Dominions, and under this Roof, <hi>P. Cornelius Scipio,</hi> whoſe very Name I love to hear; ſo dear, and ſo well fix'd in my Mind is the memory of that moſt excellent and invincible Man. Then I ask'd him ſome Queſtions concerning his Kingdom; he me ſome concerning our Commonwealth. This kind of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:54733:36"/>
Diſcourſe took up the whole day; in the Evening we were royally entertain'd, and continued our Diſcourſe till midnight. He dwelt upon the name of <hi>Africanus,</hi> and talk'd much of the great things done and ſaid by him: After this we withdrew to Reſt. Travelling and ſitting up late laid me in a profound ſleep. And here (for it often comes to paſs, that the Thoughts and Diſcourſe of the Day produce in ſleep ſomething like that which <hi>Ennius</hi> writes of <hi>Homer,</hi> whom he read and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died ſo long till he dream'd that himſelf was <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) Africanus</hi> appear'd to me in that form, with which, not the remembrance of his Perſon, but the Idea of his Statue made me acquainted. I knew 'twas he, and ſtood amaz'd: but he bid me quit my fear, and, with a preſence of Mind, heed what he ſhould ſay to me. See you that City (ſhowing me <hi>Carthage</hi> from a high ſtarry radiant place) which I taught to obey the <hi>Romans;</hi> ſhe the old War renews, and has not the wit to be quiet. You come now to fight againſt this City, tho hardly of Age to command; two years hence you ſhall be Conſul, and take it, and ſo deſerve the honourable Sirname, which by Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you inherit: but when you have ras'd <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> and triumph'd; when you have diſcharg'd the high Office of Cenſor, and gone Embaſſador over <hi>Egypt, Syria, Aſia, Greece,</hi> you ſhall be again, tho abſent, choſen Conſul, finiſh a long War, and deſtroy <hi>Numantia.</hi> But when in your triumphal Chariot you ſhall be carried up to the Capitol, you'll find the State in Confuſion by the ſeditious management of my Nephew <hi>Tiberius.</hi> And now <hi>Africanus,</hi> Inheritor of my Name and Virtue, you muſt ſtand by your Country with all your Wiſdom and Courage: and doubtful at this juncture will your own Fate ſeem; for, when your
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54733:37"/>
Age hath meaſur'd eight times ſeven annual courſes of the Sun (both which numbers are full and myſterious) a momentous critical Period to you, the Eyes of the Senate, and all good Men of our Confederates, and all that own the <hi>Latin</hi> Name will be ſet on you alone, their Hearts all turn'd towards you; you are the Man on whom the Safety of the City then relies, and you being Dictator (if ſo be you luckily eſcape the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of your impious Kinſmen) ſhall preſerve and ſettle it ſafe. Here <hi>Laelius</hi> and the reſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, ſhow'd their Concern; but <hi>Scipio</hi> gently ſmiling ſaid, Let me dream on, and all will be well; liſten then to what follows. <hi>That you,</hi> Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus, <hi>may be more vigorous in defence of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, know of a certain, that for all them, who have ſav'd their Country from ruin, ſignally ſerv'd its Intereſts, amplified and better'd the condition thereof, there is a determinate Seat in Heaven allotted, where they ſhall enjoy an everlaſting Age of Bliſs.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Without going any farther, I can't but conclude, that this waking Dream of <hi>Tully</hi> under the Perſon of <hi>Scipio,</hi> ſpeaks the ſenſe which <hi>Tully</hi> had of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture State, as plainly as it ſhows his Wit and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is to me an amazement, that any Men ſhould think, as I am told ſome do, that <hi>Tully</hi> is in jeſt here, and devis'd this ingenious Dream, not to give the <hi>Romans</hi> a true account of the real ſenſe of his Mind, but only to cozen them into a Zeal for their Country, whenever it ſhould be dangerous to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in defence of its Intereſts; into a love of Juſtice, and moral Honeſty, when the Practice was like to be detrimental to a Man's Affairs in the World. Indeed this great Man had not the very ſame ſenſe of a future State, with reſpect to all Circumſtances, as perhaps the <hi>Jews</hi> of old had, or ſome Chriſtians
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54733:37"/>
ſince his time: tho by the way, it is not very plain in the Old Teſtament, that the <hi>Jews</hi> had any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all of a future State; I deny not but that they did believe it, for they might gather it from the ſame Principles of Reaſon which we do: but it does not appear to me in thoſe Books, that their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets plainly taught it them. The moſt learned among Chriſtian Doctors freely grant that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and Threatnings in the Old Teſtament look not beyond this Life, tho (they ſay) relatively conſider'd, they denote more, and ſerve as Types of Goſpel-Revelations. As for ſome Chriſtians, they have drawn a Scheme of future State, not only without, but directly contrary to the lines of the Goſpel: What the Goſpel ſays of this matter, if rightly underſtood, is not contrary to Reaſon: But <hi>Tully</hi> had not that Light, yet his Reaſon led him to the knowledg of a future State, wherein good and bad Men meet with duly proportion'd Fruits of their good and bad way of living, tho he incumbers the Notion with Philoſophical Fables. But if it could be made out that <hi>Tully</hi> did not believe this Notion, which in his Dream he makes an Argument for the moſt difficult Virtue, <hi>viz.</hi> that of ſerving one's Country in a time of imminent danger; yet thus much I ſhall inconteſtably gain, <hi>viz.</hi> that in <hi>Tully</hi>'s opinion there was no Argument but this of force to perſwade Men in that caſe: And then he is with me thus far, that a general reception of this Notion is neceſſary for the tolerable well-being of Society.</p>
            <p>But I will not yet diſmiſs this fictitious Dream, dream'd by a wiſe Man, when his Eyes were open, his Mind preſent with it ſelf, ſtudious and ſerious; it may be worth our while to tranſlate a little of <hi>Macrobius</hi>'s elegant Expoſition upon it. <q>Between the Books of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi> concerning Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this difference appears at firſt ſight: <hi>Plato</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:54733:38"/>
deſcribes that Form which was moſt neceſſary for the Ends of Government; <hi>Tully</hi> that which was antiently inſtituted among the <hi>Romans. Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> by means of a quick and piercing Genius, ſeeing thro the nature and reaſon of things, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that all his Diſcourſe concerning Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to no purpoſe, unleſs the Minds of Men were poſſeſs'd with a love of Virtue; without which, not only a great Commonwealth, but every leſſer Society, and indeed every private Houſe is obnoxious to the moſt deſtructive Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. To poſſeſs Men with the love of Virtue, ſo neceſſary to the well-being of all Societies in general, he ſaw that nothing would conduce ſo much, as the making it appear that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Virtue were not terminated with the ſhort Life of Man: this prompted him to eſſay the proof of the Immortality of the Soul. Having prov'd that</q> (by ſuch Arguments as in thoſe days went for Apodictic) <q>he look'd upon it as a neceſſary Conſequence, to aſſign to Souls, freed from the Priſon of the Body, divers Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, with reſpect to their good or ill deſerving, in the future State: this he has done in his <hi>Phaedo,</hi> and in his <hi>Gorgias,</hi> ſweetning his graver Morals with the pleaſantry of the wiſe <hi>Socrates;</hi> but this he has done more eſpecially in thoſe Volumes in which he form'd his Scheme of a Commonwealth: and this order and method, ſo wiſely deſign'd by <hi>Plato,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Tully</hi> with no leſs Judgment has imitated. To this purpoſe <hi>Macrobius</hi> in his firſt Chapter. The Title of the fourth is, What may be the purpoſe and ſcope of this Dream, where he ſpeaks thus: <q>Towards the end of the ſixth Book, when <hi>Laelius</hi> wonder'd that no Statues were erected to <hi>Scipio Naſica,</hi> as a Reward of his publick Service in ſlaying one of the ſeditious <hi>Gracchi; Scipio</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:54733:38"/>
Tho the Conſciouſneſs of their worthy Deeds be the higheſt Reward of Virtue, yet that divine Virtue</q> 
               <hi>(viz.</hi> of ſlaying <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> who troubled the Peace of the State, and affected Tyrannick Power) <q>covets no erected Statues, nor Triumphs with fading Lawrel crown'd, but ſome more ſtable and flouriſhing Rewards. <hi>Laelius</hi> asks, What are thoſe? <hi>Scipio</hi> replies, Suffer me to purſue what I have to ſay farther, and ſo falls into the Story of his Dream, ſhowing that thoſe were more ſtable, and flouriſhing Rewards which were laid up in Heaven for the Defenders of their Country; as appears from theſe words, <hi>Quo ſis, Africane, alaerior,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That you,</hi> Africanus, <hi>may be more vigorous in defence of the Government, know of a certain, that for all them who have ſav'd their Country from ruin, ſignally ſerv'd its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, amplified and better'd the condition thereof, there is a determinate Seat in Heaven allotted, where they ſhall enjoy an everlaſting Age of Bliſs.</hi> And a little after, declaring what ſort of Seat that was, he ſays: <hi>And ſo,</hi> Scipio, <hi>after the example of your Grandfather, and of me who begat you, live juſtly and piouſly. It is a piece of Juſtice and Piety to be uſeful to Parents and Relations: but to be uſeful to one's Country, that's the greateſt Juſtice and Piety, that's the way to Heaven, and the company of thoſe Worthies who have finiſh'd their courſe, and now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit that place which you ſee,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>pointing to the Gallery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is another beautiful place in the Dream, which confirms me, both that <hi>Tully</hi> did really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a future State, and thought it the only Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for difficult Virtue. <q>
                  <hi>Igitur altè ſpectare ſi voles,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore if you will lift up your Eyes and Thoughts towards this eternal Seat, ſeek not the Applauſe of the Vulgar, nor place all your hope on thoſe Rewards which Men beſtow on
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54733:39"/>
Men. You muſt be won by the Charms of Virtue alone; as to what others talk of you, let them look to that, but talk of you they will. The Opinion of the World concerning us is bounded within the compaſs of theſe Countries which we know: no one's Fame can be everlaſting, it leſſens by the death of ſucceeding Generations, till with late Poſterity 'tis buried. He had no ſooner fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd this Admonition, but I replied: Well <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus!</hi> if Heaven is open to thoſe who deſerve well of their Country, I ſhall now, tho I always trod in my Father's and your ſteps, and never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated; I ſhall now, having an Eye to the Reward before me, contend more earneſtly to obtain it. Upon this he urg'd: Be ſure you do ſo, and reckon that it is not you who are mortal, but only your Body; for, it is not the Form and Figure that appears, which conſtitutes a Man what he is, but it is the Mind which is the Man: know then that thou art a God, at leaſt, if that be a God which lives, and has ſenſe, which remembers, and takes care of things to come, which rules, commands, and moves the Body over which it is ſet, as the great God moves, commands and rules the World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Juſt at this period I am told, that from this very Dream it may be made appear, that <hi>Tully</hi> did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the future State: I have now read it over again and again, and am amaz'd at the ſtrangeneſs of the aſſertion. Indeed <hi>Tully</hi> ſays, that Souls do move themſelves by an interior motion of their own; and thence he concludes that they had no beginning, but ever did exiſt, and ever ſhall. But then it is plain he holds, that they have exiſted in another ſtate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, and ſhall exiſt in another after this. And that the State after this, was a State wherein all Souls were not like to be in the ſame condition, he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54733:39"/>
ſufficiently intimates, by putting thoſe words into <hi>Africanus</hi>'s Mouth: <hi>Hanc tu exerce,</hi> &amp;c. exerciſe this your immortal Soul in the beſt Works: the beſt are, an endeavour to ſerve your Country, with which your Soul is exercis'd, and thereby ſhall ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er aſcend to this happy Dwelling. I ſhall move no more words concerning <hi>Tully</hi>'s Senſe of this matter, which might be farther confirm'd from Multitudes of Paſſages in his Works. Yet let me refer my Reader to what the Author of the <hi>Letter to the Deiſt, p.</hi> 105. has taken notice of as quoted by my Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> of <hi>Cherbury,</hi> in his Treatiſe <hi>de Religione Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I mean now to caſt my Eye on thoſe places in <hi>Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> wherein ſome have told me, he directly denies the future State.</p>
            <p>Let the Reader allow me to introduce the firſt Paſſage objected againſt me, with a ſhort prefatory Account of the Occaſion and Subject of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where it is to be found. <hi>Clodius</hi> a wild young noble <hi>Roman</hi> in love with <hi>Pompeia</hi> the Wife of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> found means to get into <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s Houſe in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Habit, on a ſolemn Feſtival, when the Ladies were celebrating a ſecret Service (at which Men were never preſent) to the Goddeſs <hi>Ceres.</hi> He carried his Diſguiſe ſo aukwardly, that it was diſcover'd: the Story taking air, he was accus'd by one of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes for profaning the Lady's Religion. He pleaded for himſelf, that he was abſent from <hi>Rome</hi> on the Day the Fact was charg'd: <hi>Tully</hi> ſtrengthened the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt him, depoſing that on that very day <hi>Clodius</hi> had bin at his Houſe. This notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Clodius,</hi> bribing his Judges, was acquitted, but never forgave <hi>Cicero</hi> his Depoſition. By the ſame means he gain'd his Abſolution, he ſoon after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd himſelf to be choſe Tribune, and by the help of the Conſuls <hi>Gabinius</hi> and <hi>Piſo,</hi> he perſwaded the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54733:40"/>
People to baniſh <hi>Cicero,</hi> then demoliſh'd his Country ſeats, burn'd his Houſe in the City, and on the ground built a Temple to Liberty. But <hi>Clodius</hi> his inſolence increaſing, <hi>Pompey</hi> found it his Intereſt to have <hi>Cicero</hi> recall'd; the People unanimouſly voted it, and order'd his Houſes to be rebuilt at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Charge. When <hi>Clodius</hi> could not ſtem this Tide by bold force, he labour'd to give his prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Adverſary what trouble he could under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Religion; it was impoſſible, he pleaded, for <hi>Cicero</hi> to be reinſtated in his City Dwelling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe on the very ground, on which the ſame ſtood, a Temple had bin built to Liberty. <hi>Cicero</hi> pleads his right, and overthrows the cheating Pretence of Religion, in his Oration <hi>pro domo ſua ad Pontifices.</hi> He lays open the Craft of the Miniſters of Religion, and expoſes <hi>Clodius</hi> farther, in his Oration <hi>de Haruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picum Reſponſis;</hi> and there having recounted the many Villanies, and odious Lewdneſs of his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, he proves him to be miſerable, tho his corrupt Judges had abſolv'd him: for he ſtood condemn'd in his own Mind, and in the opinion of all good Men, the Conſciouſneſs of which was the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere of Puniſhments. He flouriſhes upon this Topick thus: <hi>Tu cùm furiales in concionibus voces mittis, cùm domos Civium evertis, cùm lapidibus optimos viros foro pellis, cùm ardentes faces in vicinorum tecta jactas, cùm aedes ſacras inflammas, cùm ſervos concitas, cùm ſacra ludoſ<expan>

               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:54733:40"/>
               <hi>of religious Ordinances; when you know no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between your Wife and your Siſter, and matter not whoſe Bed you defile; when you lewdly revel, and outragiouſly deboſh, then you ſuffer thoſe Pains, which are the only that the Gods have ordain'd to puniſh the Wickedneſs of Men.</hi> Now this is one of the places repreſented to me, as a plain Declaration of <hi>Tully</hi>'s Opinion againſt a future State; and the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is in doubt whether he ſhall look upon me as dull of underſtanding, becauſe I do not conceive it to be ſo, or obſtinate for not acknowledging it. Well! I cannot help what any Man thinks of me: nay, tho I am really deſirous to be well thought of, and would give ſomething for the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's good word; yet in this caſe I cannot think, as he would have me, becauſe in truth the matter appears otherwiſe to me than it does to him. I am indeed convinc'd from this place, that <hi>Tully</hi> believ'd none of the Snakes and burning Torches of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Furies, ſo much talk'd of by the Poets; none of the material Fire, ſcorching Flame, and ſtifling Smoke, which ſome of the more ignorant Chriſtians take into their Deſcription of Hell: but as I conceive, he might for all that he has here ſaid, really believe a future State, where the Puniſhment of evil deeds ſhall be the ſame in ſubſtance, tho not in degree, as it is here. <hi>Tully</hi>'s buſineſs in this Oration was to paint out <hi>Clodius</hi> in his true Colours, to let People ſee into the hands of what an ill Man they had giv'n the Power of a Tribune, to let his Judges ſee what a guilty wretch they had abſolv'd; to convince his whole Audience, that a Villain ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd by corrupt Judges could not yet but be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, thro the irregularity of his Paſſions and Affections, and the conſciouſneſs of his Miſdeeds: purſuant to this purpoſe it was proper for him to diſtinguiſh between the Puniſhments exacted by Men,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54733:41"/>
which were ſometimes bought off, and thoſe inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Gods, which were never to be avoided; the one reaching Body and Goods, the other the Mind. The Gods interpoſe not in what concerns the former, their Inflictions are laid on the Mind.</p>
            <p>Self-conſciouſneſs and Reflection are the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of their Vengeance, they make uſe of no other to puniſh Wickedneſs. This is all that <hi>Tully</hi> ſays; and many good Men, as well Chriſtians as De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, who believe the future State, will ſay upon the matter the ſame thing. But tho according to <hi>Tully</hi> the Gods have ordain'd only Self-conſciouſneſs and Reflection to puniſh Wickedneſs in this Life; may they not have ordain'd this alſo, tho this only, to puniſh it hereafter? I ſay not everlaſtingly, for <hi>Tully</hi> had other Notions of the Gods than that comes to; but ſo long at leaſt, till the Puniſhment ſhall work a change of Mind in the Sufferer, and then the Puniſhment cannot but ceaſe. I intereſt not my ſelf in the caſe, but take it for granted that <hi>Tully</hi> could not make the Gods Authors of no Puniſhments, but what were deſign'd for the amendment of the Sufferer, and the inſtruction of the Beholder.</p>
            <p>But farther, <hi>Tully</hi> was a Man that knew how to praiſe and diſpraiſe, none better; when he pleads for <hi>Archias</hi> the Poet, <hi>Ligarius,</hi> or <hi>Milo,</hi> his Decorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have all the Life and Force that Wit and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip can give them; and when he accuſes <hi>Catiline</hi> or <hi>Clodius, Piſo</hi> and <hi>Gabinius,</hi> his Accuſations have all the Weight and bitter Vehemence that Wit and Anger can give them. His Talent was to move the Affections of his Hearers, in order to which he did not ſo much conſider what was nicely true, as what was proper to be ſaid for the end he aim'd at. Now if he had not believ'd a word of a future State, he would not yet in this Oration have denied it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54733:41"/>
it was improper, and very contrary to the end which he aim'd at to do ſo. When the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor with flowing mercileſs Eloquence was exaggerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Torments which <hi>Clodius</hi> could not but ſuffer, tho his Judges had abſolv'd him, through his ſenſe of the Odium which he had incurr'd from all true Lovers of their Country, and conſcious Reflection on his Demerits; was it not, I appeal to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, was it not very improper for him to tell his Auditors that the vile Man would be tormented by his evil Conſcience while he liv'd, and no longer? Could <hi>Tully</hi> be ſo weak, when he labour'd to perſwade the Citizens that <hi>Clodius</hi> was very miſerable, tho not condemn'd and puniſh'd according to the Laws of his Country, as to profeſs that after a little while he muſt paſs into the ſame State of eternal Forgetfulneſs, as the worthieſt Senator of 'em all? They muſt have a mean Conceit of the Orator that put this upon him; but however, I am ſure his words will not bear it.</p>
            <p>Yet one Remark farther: <hi>Tully</hi> was not like to deny the future State in his Invective againſt <hi>Clodius,</hi> becauſe whatever his Rhetorick might be able to perſwade the People, that <hi>Clodius</hi> ſuffer'd by his conſciouſneſs of his Villanies, yet it did not appear that <hi>Clodius</hi> had ſuffer'd more vexation of Spirit than <hi>Tully</hi> who declaim'd againſt him. <hi>Tully</hi> was witneſs againſt <hi>Clodius</hi> in the matter of his treſpaſs on the Lady's Religion, mov'd to do it by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Wife <hi>Terentia,</hi> who hated <hi>Clodius,</hi> becauſe her Husband was to have married his Siſter: hence began the difference between them, for before they had bin Friends. By Bribery and popular Arts <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> became a Tribune; <hi>Cicero</hi> fear'd his Power, was cheated by his ſeeming Reconciliation, forſook his advantage of commanding under <hi>Ceſar,</hi> meanly ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited his own Cauſe in mourning Habit with long
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54733:42"/>
neglected Hair, attended by 20000 Gentlemen, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have defended him, had not the Mind of their Leader bin full of Confuſion and Fear. <hi>Clodius</hi> inſulted him till he fled, purſued him with the Votes of the People, oppos'd his return with armed Force, and after that boldly ſtood his ground, till he fell by the hands of <hi>Milo,</hi> a Tribune of as great Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution as himſelf. Now an equal Conſiderer of this Story will be apt to ſuſpect that the honeſt Man had more trouble and vexation of Spirit, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Contention, than the violent, leud and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt Tribune. Indeed when the ſtream was turn'd, and the Favour of the People again came about to <hi>Tully,</hi> he bore hard upon <hi>Clodius</hi> with the beſt Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon he had, his eloquent Tongue; but he could not get his publick Acts reſcinded, even <hi>Cato</hi> oppos'd that, nor his Perſon condemn'd; this diſturb'd his Thoughts, and heated him into that ſatyrical Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue which labours to prove the Man to be miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, tho he had ſcap'd his revenge. But when all is done, <hi>Cicero</hi> that was concern'd to have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd that <hi>Clodius</hi> was ſeverely puniſh'd by his guilty Conſcience, was not ſo weak as to add, he was not like to be puniſh'd by the ſame hereafter. I will add but one note by the way, and I have done with my Reply to this Objection: Diſorders and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Mind are commonly conſequent to thoſe vile Deeds which <hi>Clodius</hi> committed, but they are not always ſo, nor does it plainly appear that <hi>Clodius</hi> ſuffer'd thoſe Torments; more likely it is, that his Mind was lifted up with the thoughts of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pretty well weather'd the Storm: but if wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men are to ſuffer nothing after this life, a great many will go off, as <hi>Clodius</hi> did, with ſuffering little or nothing at all.</p>
            <p>Another Paſſage objected againſt me, to prove that <hi>Tully</hi> was an abſolute Infidel to a future State,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54733:42"/>
is this, in his Oration againſt <hi>Calpurnius Piſo:</hi> I will briefly recite, and reply.</p>

            </q>
            <p>I did not conſider, that theſe <hi>(ſpeaking of the torments of a guilty Mind)</hi> were the certain Puniſhments award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Gods againſt vile and profligate Men: For I would not have you think, O Conſcript Fathers, that wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Men, as ſometimes on a Stage, are by the impulſe of the Gods, terrified with the burning Torches of the Furies; every ones own Fraud, his own Wickedneſs, his own Villany, his own deſperate Boldneſs, puts him beſide himſelf, and diſorders his Thoughts; theſe are the Furies that torment the wicked, theſe the Flames, and theſe the Torches.</p>
            <p>A very like Paſſage to this occurs in his Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for <hi>Ruſcius;</hi> and if this had not bin objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, I might have bin apt to have quoted it in proof of <hi>Tully</hi>'s Belief of a future State: For Furies, flaming Torches, and all that, were in thoſe days part of the deſcription of future Puniſhments. Now <hi>Tully</hi> here ſeems to admit the Notion of future Puniſhments, only he corrects a popular Miſtake concerning the nature of them. Furies and Flames are Metaphors of real Evils; and Devils are no ſuch idle Stories, unleſs Fools and Knaves have the paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. They now range up and down the World (for ours is not the Age in which any of them are to be chain'd up) ſeeking whom they may devour. There's the Devil of Pride, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of Cruelty, the Devil of Bigotry, and that grand Devil the Father of theſe, the Devil of ill
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54733:43"/>
nature, Noon-day Devils moſt an end, ſo far are they from flying when the early Dawn breaks: but there's the Devil of Envy, the Devil of Treachery, the Devil of Fraud, and the Devil of Luſt, ſneek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Devils, that chooſe rather to walk in Darkneſs; Legion may well be their common name, for there's no counting their number; and vaſt havock do they make, both in Church and State, perhaps they know not that diſtinction; but 'tis certain they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mind it: nay they purſue all vile Wretches into the other World alſo, ſuch is their implacable Malice; and all they who carry irregular Paſſion, and baſe Affections with them out of this life, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry theſe Devils with them into the next; and till they recover an honeſt mind, by them they are like to be tormented. I know nothing that <hi>Tully</hi> has advanc'd againſt theſe Notions, but I am much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken if right Reaſon does not favour them: Yes, and Revelation alſo; elſe what mean thoſe words of the Apoſtle St. <hi>James, God tempts no Man, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own Heart's Luſt and entic'd.</hi> All Temptations come from ſome Devil or other, who takes up his ſeat in the Heart of a vile Man; but whatever De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils there are in the Heart, this is a Comfort, it is poſſible they may be exorcis'd, ſometimes by the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Diſcourſes of a virtuous Monitor, ſometimes by the woful experience of the poſſeſs'd; and he muſt have a very unreaſonable Prejudice againſt Scripture, that thinks none of them can be ejected nor by Prayer, nor by Faſting.</p>

            <p>I am very glad of this Objection, 1.

            <p>By this it plainly appears that <hi>Tully</hi> believ'd a future State, ſuch a future State in which there was a good and a bad, that to be enjoy'd, this to be ſuffer'd by Men, according to what they do in the Body: ſo little is the difference between this honeſt Pagan Theiſt, and a ſober Chriſtian; and perhaps if things were equally weigh'd, it might appear much one and the ſame thing to all the Purpoſes of Virtue, whether wicked Men ſhall hereafter find a Hell to puniſh their Miſdeeds, or carry it with them. But if I ſhould leave my laſt Citation thus, and paſs on to ſomething elſe, I doubt not but one or other of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries (who are now and then kindly viſiting, and freely objecting againſt me) would tax me of diſingenuity, and diſſembling, of deſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over-looking that which makes againſt me, and I know nothing is got to a good Cauſe by ſuch a Conduct; therefore I will read on, and conſider what may be made of thoſe words, which ſeem not of a piece with the reſt.</p>

            <p>I muſt confeſs, that from this Paſſage one might be apt to imagine, that <hi>Tully,</hi> even in the moſt ſerious matter, was a little addicted to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54733:48"/>
the Academic wanton Rhetorical Way of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that came into his thoughts, what ſide ſoever of the Queſtion was ſerv'd or prejudic'd by it: he had giv'n occaſion to be ſuſpected of this Vanity once before. N. 49. <q>Praeclarum autem neſcio quid adepti ſunt, qui didicerunt, ſe, cum tempus mortis veniſſet, totos eſſe perituros; quod ut ita ſit <hi>(nihil enim pugno)</hi> quid habet iſta res aut laetabile aut glorioſum?</q>

               <q>They have diſcover'd a worthy Secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, who have learn'd, that when they die, they muſt wholly periſh and be no more; which to ſuppoſe it true <hi>(for I diſpute not againſt it)</hi> what have they rejoice at, and be proud of?</q>
            </p>
            <p>But now I anſwer; 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That perhaps there is more of a Rhetorical <hi>Apophaſis,</hi> than Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic Scepticiſm in both theſe Paſſages. <hi>Tully</hi> delights much in this Figure <hi>Apophaſis,</hi> which promiſes not to mention thoſe things which are moſt induſtriouſly mention'd and offer'd to the Hearers conſideration. In the latter of theſe Paſſages he ſays, that he would not diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them who pretended to have diſcover'd that Death was the end of all things, and yet in the very next words he does diſpute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and that ſufficiently to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his own Opinion upon the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, if not to the conviction of his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

            <p>2<hi>dly,</hi> As to that Reflection which <hi>Tully</hi> makes, after the account which he had given of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, viz.</hi> 
               <q>That his Diſcourſe was like a float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Veſſel toſs'd to and fro in the wide Sea:</q> I anſwer, That notwithſtanding this Compariſon, ſuppos'd to ſavour ſo much of the old academic Uncertainty, he continues his Diſcourſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading to the practice of Virtue, and to the contempt of Death, becauſe of the Advantages which good Men ſhould find thereby hereafter. And 3<hi>dly,</hi> What is ſtill more, He always brings in <hi>Atticus,</hi> the other Perſon in the Dialogue, as convinc'd by what he offers, and fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied concerning the Truth of the Immortality of the Soul: by which the Orator enforces what he ſays concerning the Contempt of Death, and the Practice of Virtue. 4<hi>ly.</hi> To put this matter out of controverſy, and make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtably manifeſt, that <hi>Tully</hi> was not ſuch a Sceptic in the Queſtion concerning the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, as one or two of my Acquaintance contend; at the latter end of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54733:49"/>
a ſet Speech which <hi>Plato</hi> puts into the Mouth of dying <hi>Socrates.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But 'tis now time that I go hence and die, do you my Friends live on: but which of the two is beſt, that only the Gods know; I am of the mind that no Man living does.</q> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe words the Orator has this Reflection. <q>
                  <hi>Etſi, quod praeter Deos negat ſcire quenquam, id ſcit ipſe, utrum melius; nam dixit ante; ſed ſuum illud, nihil ut affirmet, tenet ad extremum.</hi> Tho, that which he ſays none but the Gods know, he himſelf knows well, he knows which is better; he had before declar'd which is better; but that way of his (that way afterwards call'd Academic) of determining nothing,</q> he holds to the end. Here <hi>Tully</hi> plainly reproves that fooliſh Philoſophical Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which obtain'd ſo much, of talking off and on, in matters of moment; and declares it as his opinion, that however <hi>Socrates</hi> in his laſt words did ſeem to play faſt and looſe, yet he was in his own mind ſufficiently convinc'd of the Immortality of the Soul, and the future State, on which account it was better for injur'd good Men to die than to live.</p>
            <p>I hope this labour, to prove that <hi>Tully</hi> did not disbelieve the Immortality of the Soul, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently nor a future State, may not ſeem to the Reader tedious, or impertinent: for if it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54733:50"/>
could be made out, that the wiſeſt of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens rejected theſe Notions, and never us'd them as Arguments to encourage Virtue, and reſtrain Vice, it would be a prejudice againſt my Diſcourſe, who have endeavour'd to gain ſome Credibility to theſe Notions from the Principles of natural Reaſon. It would be a prejudice, I ſay, againſt, not an utter ſubverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Diſcourſe; for my Adverſaries muſt ſhow where I have argued wrong, and not tell me of great Authorities againſt me, if they mean utterly to ſubvert it. But if, when they object great Authorities againſt me (which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg to be a Prejudice, for how can I hope to ſee farther than ſuch a Man as <hi>Tully?)</hi> I give a fair Anſwer, and make it appear, that the Citations which are objected againſt me are by my Adverſaries miſtaken, and miſapplied; and that the ſame, if rightly conſider'd, are ſo far from contradicting, that they favour the Doctrines which I defend, by the acknowledg'd Principles of natural Reaſon; then, I think, I have been all this while ſtrengthning thoſe Doctrines, not ſpending my time in an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Labour. I have this to ſay further for my ſelf, I have not only anſwer'd the Objections which have been offer'd by my learned Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, but I have alſo accounted for thoſe Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which I my ſelf chanc'd to meet with while I read thoſe Tracts of the great Orator, whence their Objections were taken. For, I will never contend for any Opinion, againſt which I know of an Objection, which appears ſo conſiderable, that it is the intereſt of the Opinion to have the Objection paſs'd over,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54733:50"/>
without any notice taken of it. If I could not have ſolv'd thoſe Difficulties, which I my ſelf chanc'd to meet with, I would have given up the Authority of <hi>Tully,</hi> tho the Objections of my Adverſaries were not of ſtrength ſufficient to oblige me to it. In pleading a Cauſe at the Bar in our Courts of Judicature, the Lawyer will anſwer what he can, but to be ſure ſtart no Objection againſt his Client, which is not eaſily anſwer'd; and poſſibly ſometimes he may win the day by taking no notice of ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which the Adverſary overſees: but in our Diſputes concerning Philoſophical Truths, a Man muſt leave no Objection without Reply; for theſe Cauſes are try'd over and over again every day, and he that takes no notice of a conſiderable Objection, will be found out by one or other, and ſuppos'd to have ſilently paſs'd it by, as being conſcious of the weakneſs of his Cauſe, and unable to anſwer it.</p>
            <p>Again, in anſwering I have anſwer'd fairly; I have not by a cheating Tranſlation or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, miſrepreſented the Author to ſerve the ends of my Diſcourſe, which is a method but too frequent with them who diſpute for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Opinions, but thereby they do their Cauſe, be it good or bad, a great diſſervice: for a bad Cauſe by diſſembling Artifices is render'd more odious in the eyes of all prudent Men who ſearch diligently into the nature of things; and a good Cauſe by ſuch poor methods is brought under deſerv'd ſuſpicion. I will give one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this, which ſhall not be an invidious one, from a Writer now living, nor ſhall it be off from our purpoſe. Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> in his Life
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54733:51"/>
of <hi>Socrates,</hi> repreſents that renowned Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher (very truly in my opinion) as a Man perſwaded of the Immortality of the Soul, and of a future State: but he overdoes the thing by diſſembling Artifice, in a prevaricat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tranſlation of a Paſſage from <hi>Plato,</hi> as if the truth of the Immortality of the Soul, and the future State were in danger of finding no acceptance among thinking Men, unleſs <hi>Socrates</hi> ſpake up to theſe Notions with as full Aſſurance, and in as plain and poſitive words, as any Chriſtian whatſoever. The Paſſage in <hi>Plato</hi> is this:</p>
            <p>Pla. Phaed. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>For a Tranſlation of this Paragraph Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> was pleas'd to give his Readers theſe words:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Truly did I not believe I ſhould go to juſt Gods, and to Men better than any liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I were inexcuſable for contemning Death; but I am ſure to go to the Gods, very good Maſters, and hope to meet with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54733:51"/>
good Men, and am of good Courage, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſomething of Man ſubſiſts after Death, and that it is then much better with the good than the bad.</q> But this is not a fair rendring of this Paſſage which <hi>Plato</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to <hi>Socrates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If there be nothing alter'd nor left out, this Speech (which <hi>Plato</hi> relates as the Speech of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> or makes for him, agreable to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents he ſuppos'd <hi>Socrates</hi> to entertain) in plain Engliſh ſounds thus:</p>
            <p>
               <q>For did I not think to go, O <hi>Simmias</hi> and <hi>Cebes,</hi> firſt to other Gods wiſe and good, in the next place to Men deceas'd better than thoſe here among the living, I ſhould offend in being ſo willing to die. But now well you know that I <hi>hope</hi> to go to good Men, tho of this I have <hi>not all the Confidence imaginable:</hi> but that I ſhall go to the Gods very good Maſters, of this you well know that I have as ſtrong a confidence, as of any ſuch like thing; ſo that for this cauſe I am not ſo much troubled to die, but I have hope concerning the Dead; and as it was ſaid of old, it ſhall go better with the good than the bad.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Picture which <hi>Plato</hi> draws of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates;</hi> the bolder ſtrokes which Mr. <hi>Stanley</hi> gives to it, may perhaps grace it, but then they miſrepreſent it. According to <hi>Plato, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> did think the Soul was immortal, <hi>Socrates</hi> was perſwaded that there was a future State. He hop'd it ſhould go well with him after Death, nay he had a Confidence of theſe things; not indeed all the Confidence imaginable, not ſuch a Confidence as Men have of a mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54733:52"/>
demonſtration; but yet ſuch a Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as was ſufficient to make him content to dy rather than do a baſe or a mean thing to ſave his Life.</p>
            <p>After all that I have now ſaid and anſwer'd, both to the Author of the <hi>Inquiry concerning Virtue,</hi> and to the occaſional Objections of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in juſtification of that grand Motive to Virtue, the Hopes of future Advantage, and in proof of the immortality of the Soul, and the certainty of a future State, I do freely confeſs that if any Perſon has thrown off a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Senſe of the neceſſary Obligation which lies upon all rational Men to be virtuous in private, as well as publick; in the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, as well as the moſt eaſy Circumſtances, then have I ſaid nothing which can much affect him: but then I pleaſe my ſelf to think, that if a Man does not look upon himſelf as freed from ſuch Obligation, if he does not own himſelf a dangerous Member of Society, unworthy to be lov'd as a Friend, unfit to be truſted in any matter of moment, where he may be tempted to be falſe, with probable hopes of concealing the Crime, he will hardly be able to get rid of the moral Demonſtrations which I have made out, evincing the Immortality of the Soul, the certainty of a future State, and the Wiſdom of living ſo in this World, as Men that expect to receive hereafter endleſs advantage by their Virtue.</p>
            <p>But what, it may be ſaid, if a Man poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denies the Immortality of the Soul, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteems the future State as a Fable; if he looks upon Virtue as obligatory, only while it ſerves
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54733:52"/>
the Neceſſities and Comforts of this Life preſent, have we no Arguments to evince the erroneouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that miſchievous Opinion? Yes ſurely; but in order to do it, we muſt conſider what particular Syſtem of univerſal Nature thoſe Men frame to themſelves againſt whom we diſpute. The very learned Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> in his Intellectual Syſtem, for a fuller Confutation of Atheiſm, pretends to examine, and refute all the various forms thereof: Now tho I would not ſubſcribe to all which that moſt highly deſerving Author urges againſt the ſeveral Forms of Atheiſm; yet I am perſuaded moſt of his Materials are proper and ſerviceable, only I am inclin'd to think, they are capable of ſtill farther Improvement.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Democritic</hi> and <hi>Epicurean</hi> Atomic Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes; alſo the <hi>Anaximandrian</hi> or <hi>Hylopathian,</hi> and that wild fancy of corrupted Stoiciſm, which ſuppoſes the World to be one huge Plant or Vegetable, having a plaſtic Nature, orderly diſpoſing the whole without Mind or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; theſe the Doctor thinks are by ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Moderns laid aſide as indefenſible: but the boldeſt and moſt dangerous Hypotheſis which is now reviv'd, is that of <hi>Strato Lampſacenus,</hi> which he calls the <hi>Hylozoic</hi> Hypotheſis, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to Matter, Life and Perception. The Moderns who take up with this Scheme, aſſert that the whole Maſs of boundleſs Mattter hath exiſted from all Eternity, mov'd, as now, from all Eternity, and by its various, natural, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Motions has produc'd and will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all that ever has bin, and that ever ſhall be produc'd; that human Cogitation is nothing but
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54733:53"/>
local Motion, yet all Motion not Cogitation, but only Motion ſo circumſtanc'd, in Bodies ſo modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Againſt this bold and precarious Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, the Doctor diſputes in the cloſe of his 3<hi>d</hi> Chap. and partly in the 5<hi>th.</hi> But without wrong to him, I may venture to affirm that he has not ſaid all which may be ſaid; and one thing I wiſh unſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Hylozoic Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers are not fit to be diſputed with any more than a Machine is, <hi>p.</hi> 846. <hi>l.</hi> 5. For, this has the face of an ingenious Reflection; but then it is alſo liable to be ſuſpected, as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of a Diſputant that is at a nonplus, and has no convincing Argument to offer againſt his ſubtle Adverſary. Yet this may be pleaded for the learned Doctor, that he did not turn the Hylozoics off ſo, whatever he contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and angrily replied, when he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd with the thoughts of their ſtrange and precarious Aſſertion, which makes Cogitation to be nothing but local Motion: for in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited place, and elſewhere, he diſputes againſt this Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>One thing he obſerves very well, <hi>viz.</hi> That which inclines the Hylozoics to their Hylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoiciſm, is, <q>Becauſe they are ſenſible, that if there were any other Action beſide local Motion, there muſt needs be ſome other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance beſide Body,</q> 
               <hi>p.</hi> 845. It is one good ſtep towards the cure of a Diſeaſe, rightly to underſtand the Nature of it, the Cauſes whence it ſprang, and the Fuel with which 'tis fed; but after that, a particular Skill is neceſſary to work the Cure. The learned Doctor in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, where he gives an account of his Book,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54733:53"/>
affirms that it is as certain to him as any thing in all Geometry, that Cogitation and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding can never poſſibly reſult out of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes, Figures, Sights, and local Motions. I am as much perſwaded as he, that Cogitation and Underſtanding cannot reſult from theſe Principles; but I wiſh he had pointed his Finger to the place where he has made this as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as any thing in all Geometry. But yet I will not ſay that a Geometrical Certainty of this Truth is not to be had; what one Man has not demonſtrated, another may. Mr. <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badie</hi> among a great deal of Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Abbadie</hi> of the Truth of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note>has ſome excellent Materials; I will ſelect what I judg moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, and not ſcruple to alter what I hope to diſpoſe to better advantage. Matter acquires not Thought by Motion, becauſe in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there are but three things which can be conſider'd: the Thing mov'd; the Place from whence 'tis mov'd; the Place to which it comes. Now Thought is none of all this. If it be ſaid that Thought is the effect of ſome particular Motion, then it will follow, that that Effect is nobler than its Cauſe; and not only ſo, but likewiſe that it is an Effect quite of another nature than its Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Bare Motion does not produce Thought, becauſe all Matter does not think. Different kinds of Motion do not produce Thought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which makes Motion different is only ſlowneſs or ſwiftneſs, directneſs and obliquity, with which Thought has no more affinity, than with Motion conſider'd abſtractly.</p>
            <p>

It is not barely Matter which acts when we think, becauſe the parts of Matter may act, and be reflected on upon another; but 'tis impoſſible that any of them ſhould act or be reflected on themſelves; whereas that thinking Principle which is in us reflects on it ſelf, on its own Actions, Thoughts; and on the manner of its actings and thinking.</p>
            <p>Matter and Motion act only on Objects pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and contiguous: but Thought flies over the wide Ocean, pervades the Earth, and reaches the Stars; reviews paſt things, and makes uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conjectures at Futurities; reflects, provides againſt Accidents that may or may not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
            <p>By Diſeaſes Men ſometimes have their Heads ſo diſorder'd, that their Imaginations are confus'd, and things appear to them otherwiſe than they really are, while their Underſtandings remain clear, and they argue juſtly upon thoſe falſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, being very ſenſible that their Diſeaſes occaſion thoſe falſe appearances of things; thence it ſeems natural to conclude that their Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principle, which is not ſo eaſily hindred in its Office by Diſeaſes, is ſomething diſtinct from Matter.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the moſt conſiderable Philoſophic Arguments, which I remember to have read againſt the Hylozoics: I hope I have not ſpoil'd them in my recital; but the Reader may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the French Author tranſlated by <hi>Luſſan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have nor Health, nor Time, nor yet Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough to make the moſt of a philoſophic Argument drawn from the acknowledg'd Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Laws, and Powers of Matter againſt theſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54733:54"/>
Hylozoics: but I beg leave to offer one or two Thoughts, ſuch as they are, againſt theſe bold and precarious Philoſophers.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſhall be Argument <hi>ad hominem:</hi> If I ſhould aſſert, that the Table on which I now write, does underſtand and think, the Hylozo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics could no more demonſtrate the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, than I can demonſtrate that Matter, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mov'd, is incapable of thinking. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. This ſeems to me Demonſtration: If Thought be nothing but Matter mov'd, it is impoſſible for us to conceive a thought of a thing which is not Matter. Again, if Matter of itſelf does not think but as 'tis mov'd, then 'tis Motion, not Matter, which is Thought, or the Cauſe of Thought: but how extravagant and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is it to affirm, that an Accident which relates to Matter is a real thing, or the cauſe of a real Effect, which is of another nature, and more noble than Matter?</p>
            <p n="3">3. There can be no ſuch thing as Free Will in Man, if there be nothing but Matter in the World: For, the Laws of Matter are conſtant, one and the ſame without variation; and if there be no ſuch thing as Free Will in Man, then there's no ſuch thing as Virtue or Vice. Now I am of the Mind, that he who without prejudice ſeriouſly conſiders this Argument, will be abundantly ſatisfied that Matter, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mov'd, is incapable of thinking, tho he has not a Geometrical Certainty, or intuitive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the ſame.</p>
            <p>If I had a good Benefice inſtead of a lean Vicarage, I could be content with a Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Right to the Tithes of my Pariſh, and let
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54733:55"/>
the <hi>Jure Divino</hi> Right go: So I think, an honeſt good Man may be ſatisfied, ſafely ſatisfied, that Matter, however mov'd, cannot think; becauſe if there be no free Mind able to alter the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and neceſſary motions of Matter, then there's no ſuch thing as right and wrong; and to talk of regular and irregular Paſſions and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is a Jeſt. But I leave the proſecution of this Subject to the abler Pen of a worthy Friend, whoſe Meditations I long to ſee. But I hope the Reader will allow me to have ſufficiently prov'd what I firſt undertook, <hi>viz.</hi> That the proſpect of future Advantage does not take off from the praiſe of Virtue: alſo that he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves there is no God, or who calls the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe Body of univerſal Matter, God; that he who denies the Immortality of the Soul, and expects no future State, does thereby diſown the moſt powerful Obligations to Virtue, makes himſelf unfit to be lov'd intirely, or truſted confidently: for Men of common Senſe will ever chooſe to love and truſt him, who looks upon himſelf under the higheſt Obligations and moſt forcible Motives to be grateful and faithful; and be apt to neglect him, whatever Virtue he profeſſes, or is by Nature and Education inclin'd to, who owns no Obligations nor Motives to Virtue, beſides preſent uſefulneſs, which in ſome Caſes it has not, and no reſtraint of pleaſing Vice but human Laws, which reach not a world of Caſes.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU are pleas'd to allow the Strength of my Argument thro this whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but you would not have me publiſh my Papers, becauſe you can ſee little in them, beſide what you met with ſome years ſince in a judicious and ſolid ſmall Tract, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, <hi>A Letter to the Deiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is very friendly, and I own the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; but I were unworthy of your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, if I ſhould ſubſcribe to your Judgment, becauſe you are my Friend: and I were ſtill unworthy, if denying to be govern'd by you, I ſhould refuſe to give my Reaſons.</p>
            <p>I am not of the Comic Poet's mind, from whom we have the Proverb, <hi>Nullum eſt jam dictum, quod non dictum fuit prius.</hi> I rather fancy, ſince the Univerſe has no bounds, that there may be eternal Progreſſions in Reaſonings, eternal advances in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg: ſo that if perhaps I have wrote no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what has bin wrote before, yet there's no cauſe to imagin the Subject to have bin ſo copiouſly and clearly handled already, that nothing of moment can be added by the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54733:56"/>
ſtudy of them who come after. Upon which account I had reaſon on my ſide, thus far at leaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That I endeavour'd to give ſome new acceſſion of ſtrength to thoſe Foundations of natural Religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which I don't ſee how difficult Virtue can ſubſiſt. Let me digreſs ſo far as here to call in a few words, which ſhould have bin inſerted in my Diſſertation, being part of a Letter wrote to me, by one that uſes me kindly as you do. <q>It ſeems plain, that no Man loves Miſery, no nor Labour to no purpoſe; and he that thinks he ſhall ceaſe to be after this Life, muſt think he ſhall ceaſe to exerciſe Virtue, his chief Delight, or his All: ſo he has no Motive to dy for the ſake of his Country, or on any noble account whatſoever; and at laſt will come to this Reſult, that Self-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is the trueſt Virtue, tho on the meaneſt Terms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But to return, that I have troubled the Preſs with nothing but what the <hi>Letter to the Deiſt</hi> made publick ſome years paſt: This I think I may, without departing from the Rules of Modeſty, poſitively deny. But not to offend the Reader with a <hi>Crambe bis coctâ,</hi> I ſhall only note, that it muſt be granted me, I did not borrow from that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all which I have offer'd in defence of this Doctrin, that the hope of future Reward is not
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54733:56"/>
a baſe mercenary, but a reaſonable and juſt Motive to Virtue. 2. Nor thence have I bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row'd what I have anſwer'd to the Objections of nominal Deiſts drawn from the Writings of moral Heathens: for I met thoſe Objections in Converſation, not Books. 3. What I have oppos'd to the Author of <hi>the Inquiry concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Virtue,</hi> could not be borrow'd from <hi>the Letter to the Deiſt,</hi> which was wrote before it, but muſt needs be as new as the <hi>Inquiry:</hi> And if the <hi>Inquiry</hi> be an ingenious, ſubtle, erroneous, and dangerous Book, then it will be farther granted, that a ſolid good anſwer comes ſeaſonably and uſefully: whether my Anſwer be ſuch, the Reader muſt judg; but for your part, Sir, you have approv'd it, and therefore if you agree with your ſelf, you muſt not blame my printing.</p>
            <p>Now as to thoſe particular Arguments, the Subſtance of which I confeſs my ſelf to have in common with the <hi>Letter to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt;</hi> I will not ſay as <hi>Hierom</hi>'s Maſter <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> commenting on the above-cited Verſe from <hi>Terence, Pereant qui ante nos noſtra dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt;</hi> Confounded be all they who ſaid the things which I have ſaid, before I ſaid them: no, I had rather go into that better natur'd Defence; <hi>Non quicquid cum antiquis convenit, ex antiquis ſumptum:</hi> Upon which <hi>Lemma, Paſchaſius</hi> has this witty Epigram, tho he points it with a little of <hi>Donatus</hi>'s aſſuming waggiſh Self-love.</p>

               <l>Antiquos, mea qui praeripuere mihi.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I gave theſe Lines to be tranſlated to my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Son, the Boy you took ſuch a fancy to.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Often on antient Fancies have I hit,</l>
               <l>And for this Luck muſt I be call'd a Cheat?</l>
               <l>They err who ſay I ſteal the Antients Fame;</l>
               <l>For I no more than what's my own do claim:</l>
               <l>In mine, and theirs, if you no difference ſee,</l>
               <l>Blame th' Antients for their ſtealing mine from me.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Now my hand is in to you, it comes into my mind, that you once acquainted me, that ſome of my learned Acquaintance diſlik'd this Eſſay: But this I am far from putting off with that old hypocritical Saw, <hi>No Man can have a meaner Opinion of my performance than I have my ſelf;</hi> becauſe their diſlike, whereof I have bin all along conſcious, prompted me to conſider the matter again and again; and that repeated Conſideration has confirm'd me in my Sentiments, and made me in love
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:54733:57"/>
with them: ſo that if theſe Acquaintances can ſtill be my Friends notwithſtanding their Diſlike, I will thank them for their Diſlike, as well as for their Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>This notwithſtanding, I am not ſo vain as to reckon that I have, borrowing or not borrowing, exhauſted the Argument; or ſaid half which their ſingular Parts and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments might have help'd me to have ſaid: no, for even my preſent mediocrity could and would have added ſome method, and farther ſtrength to it; but my much Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and many Infirmities made me wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to put ſuch an end to it as you ſee.</p>
            <p>I have now one Favour to beg of you, and I take leave: pray thank my Adverſaries in my Name for their oppoſing the Sentiments in this Diſſertation defended; thank them heartily. I really hold it a very ſingular good Office to have my Sentiments ſeriouſly and ſtrenuouſly oppos'd: for, no longer than I can defend, will I retain them. Old as I am, I am not ſo afraid of altering my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as not to liſten to Reaſon whoever offers it: he that convinces my Underſtanding, ſhall, while I live, lead my Affections; but if what is offer'd has not evidence enough to convince me, they uſe me very hardly who will not admit me into their Friendſhip, becauſe I am not their Proſelyte. I am pleas'd to be ſeriouſly and ſtrenuouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54733:58"/>
by them who beſt can do't, even tho they go for Hereticks, that ſo I may go up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſurer ground.</p>
            <p>And for this cauſe I much wonder, that the beſt Reformed Church ſhould have any of her Sons deſirous to put a Reſtraint on the Preſs: for all Truths, the more they are impugn'd, the ſurer they are eſtabliſh'd; and the more the Preſs is reſtrain'd, the more our Articles will be ſuſpected, whether there be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſt cauſe of ſuſpicion or no. There's ten thouſand to one againſt a Man who takes Doctrines upon truſt, and aſſents to this or that Scheme with Faith implicit; but that which he ſuffers to be examin'd, to be ſift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which he himſelf conſiders over and over again, in that it is impoſſible he ſhould be deceiv'd, unleſs it be a matter wherein he may be miſtaken innocently, and without prejudice to his future hopes.</p>
            <p>I thought I had done, but one thing more comes in my way. You once let me know that I was ſuſpected to favour heretical Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. To this I anſwer, I hope it is no fault not to run from the converſe of Men of Learning and Probity; but from the Perſons you nam'd I do aſſure you I differ, and that in all points that can be inſimulated of Hereſy: particularly I think the <hi>Socinians</hi> in the wrong, and never was of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; I do not know the names of three
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54733:58"/>
               <hi>Socinians,</hi> nor the Perſons of any two ſuch; but I confeſs I look upon them as Men of Learning and Probity. Allow me but to have Charity for all honeſt Men however differently perſwaded, and you will have no cauſe to deny me being a not unworthy Member of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And pray obſerve one thing more, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is very narrow, who are perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed altogether as the Men they converſe with. I take it, that a free Converſation is the moſt uſeful thing in the World, and that their Company is worth nothing who will not endure Contradiction. They whom I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with, know, and are not angry with my Church-Sentiments; I know, and will never perſecute their diſſent: For,
