         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in this common cauſe of Religion, Liberty and peace of the
Kingdoms, aſſiſt and defend all thoſe that enter into this
League and Covenant, in the maintaining and purſuing
thereof, and</hi> ſhall not ſuffer our ſelves directly or indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by whatſoever combination, perſwaſion, or terror, to
be divided, and withdrawn from this bleſſed union and
conjunction, whether to make defection to the contrary
part, or to give our ſelves to a deteſtable indifferency or
neutrality in this cauſe, which ſo much concexneth the
glory of God, the good of the Kingdoms, and the honour of

                        <p>And becauſe theſe Kingdoms are guilty of many ſins and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
againſt God, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, as is too manifeſt

<hi>An Oath for confirmation is to men an end of all strife: wherfore God

Pſ. 89. 3. 34. <hi>I have made a Covenant with my choſen, I

If you can break my Covenant of the day, and my Covenant of

in the Royal Throne of Iudah,</hi> was hereditary, ſucceſſive, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

inviolable, and not be abrogated by their tranſgreſſions.</p>
            <p>3ly. Becauſe <hi>the Oath, which</hi> Joſeph <hi>took of his Brethren, the

<hi>when God ſhould bring them out of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 24, 25. though
not made preciſely for them and their Poſterity, was reputed
by <hi>Moſes</hi> and them, to be obligatorie to their ſeed, as if made
by them, even in point of Conſcience: as is evident by <hi>Exod.
13. 19. And Moſes took the Bones of Ioſeph with him,</hi> (though driven

Hoſt, their forty years wandring in the wilderneſſe, their

their publick ſafety, no wayes concerned in it. Then much

Oaths in preciſe terms to our Kings, their Heirs and Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
which ſo much concern our publick Government, Peace,
Settlement, Safety, Proſperity, engage our whole Kingdom
and three Nations to a conſciencious obſervation of them to
the uttermoſt of their power.</p>
            <p>4ly. Becauſe <hi>Davids</hi> Oath to <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> extended
to their <hi>ſeed, 1 Sam.</hi> 24. 21, 22. <q>Swear now therefore unto

               </q> How

            <p>Here we have an Oath and Covenant binding the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
their Governours. Heirs and poſterity in perpetuitie to the

Kings, their heirs and ſucceſſors, to prove them more
obliging to us and our poſterities, than this Oath &amp; League
of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> in regard of theſe obſervable
circumſtances &amp; particulars, not hitherto inſiſted on by any;
which I beſeech God in mercie to ſet home effectually upon
all our hearts, ſpirits, conſciences, both for our informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
reformation, ſettlement, and avoiding Gods avenging
juſtice on us and our poſterities, for our tranſcendent perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
breach of Oathes and Covenants to our Soveraigns.</p>
            <p>1. This Oath and Covenant with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
was procured by meer fraud, circumvention, miſinfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
and apparent falſhood, ariſing meerly from thoſe to
whom it was made and ſworn: yet it obliged the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
and their poſteritie, to the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> and their progenie in
perpetuitie: But the forementioned <hi>Oathes,</hi> together with
the Proteſtation, and Solemn League and Covenant, were
made without any fraud, circumvention, miſinformation,
or falſe ſuggeſtion, upon grounds of loyaltie, dutie, juſtice,
prudence, chriſtianitie, Religion, and State-policie, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
propounded by the makers, takers of them, and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in full Parliaments: Therefore they muſt needs be farre
more valid, obligatory to the whole Engliſh Nation and
their poſterities, than this Oath, Covenant to the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This League and Oath was made very ſodenly, raſhly,
unadviſedly, without any advice with God and the whole
Congregation, or examining, debating the truth of the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>
ſuggeſtion; yet it bound them when once made: But
our Oathes, Proteſtation, League, Covenant, were all made
enacted, enjoyned upon long and ſerious debate, mature
deliberation in ſeveral ſucceſſive Parliaments: Therefore
ours muſt be much more obliging than theirs.</p>

<hi>Iſrael,</hi> without the Congregations privitie, aſſent or advice,
who were diſcontented with and murmured againſt them
for it, yet it obliged both the Princes, people, and their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities:
But our Oathes, Proteſtation, League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
were made not only by all our Princes, Nobles, Peers,

to encourage them to commit perjurie, and violate all
lawfull Oaths, Covenants, in ſucceeding Ages, to the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal

Oath, League, though againſt theſe judicial Precepts, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
firmly bound the Princes who made them, and all the
Congregation in that Age, but King <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf, and all
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in ſucceſſion four hundred years after. Of which
we have another Preſident of <hi>Joſhuaes</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> care
to perform their Spies Oaths made to <hi>Rahab,</hi> and <hi>ſworn unto

all made not to, or with <hi>Amorites</hi> or <hi>Canaanites</hi> particularly
deuoted by God to the Sword, Slaughter, and utter extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
without any Truce or League of Peace; but to and
with our own hereditary lawfull Chriſtian Kings, their
Heirs, Poſterities, and Succeſſors, whoſe Perſons, Lives,
Crowns, Rights, and Royal Authoritie we are all expreſly
obliged, commanded by God himſelf, to <hi>defend, protect with

all Attempts, Treaſons, Conſpiracies, Traytors, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions

much more obliging, and conſcienciouſlie to be obſerved
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60301:16"/>
by us, and our Poſterities for ever, than theirs to the <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites,</hi>
as the only ready way to our peace and ſettlement.</p>
            <p>10ly. This League of theirs to the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> was ratified
only with one ſingle <hi>Oath,</hi> yet it bound both them and their
Poſterity; but ours to our <hi>Kings, their Heirs and Succeſſors,</hi>
is ratified with ſeven ſucceſſive <hi>Oaths, Proteſtations, Covenants,</hi>
here recited, beſides ſundry others of like nature taken <hi>by
our Anceſtors in former Ages,</hi> which I pretermit. Therefore
much more ſtrong, indiſſoluble, obliging to us and our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtericies
than theirs. If <hi>a threefold cord be not eaſily broken,</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.

to all poſteritie.</p>
            <p>11. The violation of this Oath League to the <hi>Gibeonites</hi>
by <hi>Saul,</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> near 400 years after its firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
when perchance quite forgotten by them, or concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be unbinding to them as gotten by ſurpriſe, as not
made or taken by themſelves, perſonal to the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> and
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> then living when firſt made, or at leaſt expired and

by God himſelf a great <hi>ſinne, perjury in them,</hi> and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarie
puniſhed by God with three years famine on the
whole Land, though <hi>Saul</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> then living never
took this Oath, nor made that League themſelves, but onlie
their Anceſtors, ſo long time before their births. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our violations of the forecited Oaths, Proteſtation,
League, Covenant, ſo freſhlie made, taken, ſworn, ſubſcribed
with hands lifted up to Heaven, ſucceſſivelie one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
by whole Parliaments, the generalitie of our Nation;
and not onlie by our deceaſed Anceſtors, but by our ſelves
in perſon, and ſo oft reiterated, yet infringed by us time after
time in the higheſt degree, moſt needs be a more deteſtable
damnable Perjurie, crime, in the eyes of God than theirs,
and draw a more long-laſting famine, and other ſorer judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God upon our particular Perſons,<note n="*" place="margin">Vaſtat ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pemque, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mumque, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus, lib. 11.</note> Families, Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than that breach of their Oath and League with the <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites,</hi>
brought down on them.</p>
            <p>12ly. That Oath, League, continued in force to bind
the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> both to obſervation and puniſhment, when
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60301:17"/>
violated by King <hi>Saul</hi> and them, after the whole frame of
their Government was quite changed from a Principality or
Common-wealth (as moſt of our preſent Grandees would
have it) into a <hi>Kingſhip and Kingdom,</hi> by the earneſt unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
deſire, conſent of all the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

by the 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> c. 8, to c. 13. Joſh. 9. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
together. Therefore our Oath, Proteſtation, League,
Covanant forecited, muſt by like reaſon, conſequence, much
more oblige our whole Nation in preſent and future to our
Kings, their Heirs and Succeſſors, notwithſtanding all
late violent forcible illegal Alterations, Revolutions of our

more perjurious, ſinfull, and exemplarily puniſhable, than
theirs.</p>
            <p>13. This Oath, League with the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> was violated
by King <hi>Saul,</hi> only out of <hi>zaeel to the Children of Iſrael,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudah,</hi>
who (it ſeems) ſolicited him thereunto for their own ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends
or advantage: yet this was no ſufficient excuſe, nor ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
thereof in Gods eſteem, being puniſhed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarie
juſtice on his poſterity, and a three years famine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the Land. Therefore the violation of all our precedent
Oaths, Proteſtations, Covenants, by the Army-Officers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
Members, and their Adherents (againſt the Votes
of both Houſes, the dehortations of our Miniſters, and deſires
of our three whole Kingdoms) muſt needs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> a far more
deteſtable crime, and be avenged with a more heavy puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both on them and us, than theirs was heretofore.</p>
            <p>14. This breach of Oath, Covenant, notwithſtanding all
circumſtances which might extenuate it, was moſt exemplary
puniſhed, though not on <hi>Saul</hi> the chief Offendor during his
life, yet upon ſeven of his Sons, and Family after his death,
in King <hi>Davids</hi> Reign, 35 years after this Offence commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and upon the whole Nation by a three years famine,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60301:17"/>
though it was never infringed but only by one ſingle Act, in
ſlaying ſome of the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> poſterity, and not re-violated
by any other ſubſequent ſlaughter of them. Therfore though
many of the grand Infringers of the precedent Oaths, Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation,
Covenant, may perchance ſcape ſcot-free for a time in
their own perſons, and die without exemplary juſtice inflicted
on them for it, yet let them from this memorable Preſident
conclude for certain, that God will ſooner or later avenge it
upon their <hi>Children and Posterity</hi> to their utter extirpation,
(and on the whole Nation too, as he hath done in a great
meaſure already,) it may be 35 years after the Perjuries,
