            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nor expect heere an Encomium or praise of any such thing as the world ordinarily takes Poësy for; That same thing beeing (as I conceiue) a superficiall meere outside of Sence, or gaye barke only (without the body) of Reason; Witnesse so many excellent witts that haue taken so much paines in these times to defend her; which sure they would not haue done, if what is generally receiued now a dayes for Poë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, were not meerely a faculty, or occupation of so little consequence, as by the louers thereof ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be (in their owne fauour) excused, then for any good in the thing it selfe, to be commended. Nor must thou heere expect thy solution, if thy curiosity inuite thee to a satisfaction in any the vnder-Accidents, but in meerely the Essentiall Forme, of true Poësy: Such I call the Accidents or appendixes thereto, as conduce somewhat to the Matter, and End, nothing to the reall Forme
<pb facs="tcp:11101:4"/>
and Essence thereof. And these accidents (as I call them) our commenders &amp; defenders of Poësy haue chiefely, and indeed sufficiently insisted, and dilated vpon; and are first, those floures (as they are called) of Rhetorick, consisting of their <hi>Anaphoras, Epist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accidents of Poesy, and that are the greater part of the appurtenances thereof, in the accoumpt of our Poëts of these times, are also heere vtterly vnmencioned, such as are, what sort of Poëme may admit the blanke verse, what requires exacte rime; where the strong line (as they call it) where the gentle, sortes best; what subject must haue the verse of so many feete, what of other; where the masculine rime, where the feminine, and where the threesillabled (which the Italians call their <hi>rime sdrucciole)</hi> are to be vsed. These (I say) and the like Adjuncts of Poësy, (elsewhere amply discoursed of by many curious witts) are

not heere mencioned. Only what I conceiued fit to speake (and with what breuity I could) of the Auncient Poëts in generall, and of the Forme and reall Essence of true Poësy, considered meerely in it owne worth and validity, without extrinsick and suppeditatiue ornament at all, together with the paralell of their foyle (our Moderne Poëts and Poësyes,) I haue, (to the end to redeeme in some parte, and vindicate that excellent Art from the iniury it suffers in the worlds generall misprizion and misconstruction thereof,) heere touched, and but touched; the rather to awake some abler vnderstanding then my owne, to the pursute (if they please) of a theame (I conceiue) well worthy a greater industry, and happyer lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures then I my selfe possesse.</p>

            <p>The before-written Treatise of the dignity of the ould Poets and their Poesies, falling into the view of some not iniudicious eyes; Among them, there arose question, how it could be, that <hi>Plato,</hi> so great a louer and honorer of the Auncient.

Wherein I am not vnwilling to render (withall) what, as I am taught a little by my owne <hi>Genius,</hi> and more by better vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings then my own, the Fable was by the first deuizers therof made to meane. And first, for the Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphick parte; the Sence thereof is <note place="margin">the Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick sence.</note> (I conceiue) obuious enough: The Tale tells vs, the god <hi>Cephissus,</hi> a great Riuer in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> that running through the <hi>ager Atticus</hi> or <hi>Attick</hi> field (as the place was aunciently called meetes, and mingles his streames with the Water-nymphe <hi>Liriope,</hi> a narrow brooke so named; and hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them compassed a flat low ground almost Iland-wise, before

their falling together into the <hi>Phale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> gulphe, they were fitly called the Parents of this <hi>Narcissus</hi> or <hi>Daffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dill,</hi> beeing a floure which, (besides the specificall nature it hath to grow, and thriue best in waterish places,) the medowy groundes those waters encompassed, did chiefely yeeld and abound in. This <hi>Narcissus</hi> is fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to eschew and flye the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie <note place="margin">the Physick sence.</note> of all women, no lesse then of the Nymphe <hi>Ecco</hi> that is enamour'd and doates vpon him; denoting by this auuersion of his, the nature of the floure that beares his name; for the <hi>daffadill</hi> or <hi>water-lilly,</hi> the seedes thereof especially (as the applyers of them in medcine haue obserued) do powerfully extinguish the ability and desire of carnall copulation, by ouercooling of the Animall seed; no lesse then does Porcelane, Lettuce, <hi>Agnus castus,</hi> Calamint, White vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letts,

From this his before mencioned quality, and the ill effect it workes in mans body, his name <hi>Narcissus</hi> (which is <hi>torpedo, languor, segnities-</hi>slothe, stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, lazinesse) was by the Anncients not vnfitly giuen to this vegitable.
