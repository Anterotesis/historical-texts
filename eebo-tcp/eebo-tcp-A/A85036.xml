            <title>Truth maintained, or Positions delivered in a sermon at the Savoy: since traduced for dangerous: now asserted for sound and safe. By Thomas Fuller, B.D. late of Sidney Colledge in Cambridge. The particulars are these. I That the doctrine of the impossibility of a churches perfection, in this world, being wel understood, begets not lazinesse but the more industry in wise reformers. II That the Church of England cannot justly be taxed with superstitious innovations. III How farre private Christians, ministers, and subordinate magistrates, are to concurre to the advancing of a publique reformation. IIII What parts therein are only to be acted by the Supreme power. V Of the progresse, and praise of passive obedience. VI That no extraordinary excitations, incitations, or inspirations are bestowed from God, on men in these dayes. VII That it is utterly unlawfull to give any just offence to the papist, or to any men whatsoever. VIII What advantage the Fathers had of us, in learning and religion, and what we have of them. IX That no new light, or new essentiall truths, are, or can be revealed in this age. X That the doctrine of the Churches imperfection, may safely be preached, and cannot honestly be concealed.

                  <note>A partial reprinting and defense of his "Sermon of reformation" and a partial reprinting of and reply to John Saltmarsh's "Examinations", including a reprinting of the preface to that work on leaf A2.</note>

                  <note>A reissue with cancel title page of the edition with London in imprint (Wing F2475). However, this reissue lacks the full reprinting of Fuller's "A sermon of reformation" ([2], 5-24 p.; A⁴-C⁴(-A1)) found in Wing F2475. Statements made by the author in "To my deare parish Saint Mary Savoy" (C1r) and "To the reader" (C4r) in the preliminaries indicate that the sermon was intended to be included as part of this work, and it may be that copies without the sermon are simply imperfect reissues. The sermon was also apparently issued separately in the same year.</note>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Indeed I examined his Examinations of my
Sermon with the ſame pace that I read them.
But I could not confute his Errors ſo ſpeedily as
I could diſcover them, nor could I ſo ſoon make
them appeare to others, as they appeared to
me; and the Evidencing of his Faults did coſt
me ſome Paines, whereof I hope I ſhall never
have juſt Cauſe to Repent.</p>
            <p>I am altogether out of hope that my Truth
ſhould quickly overtake his Error, which had
the Advantage of me both at the Starting and
in the Speed; And yet I beleeve what I want in
the ſwiftneſſe of my Feet, I ſhall have in the
Firmeneſſe of my footing. And when I overtake
it at laſt, as I am ſure I ſhall, ſeeing untruths will
Tire (as being better at hand then at length) I

I muſt confeſſe it troubled me not a little, ſuſpecting
either my Eyes or my Underſtanding, that either I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>read
<hi>your Name,</hi> or had miſ-written ſomething in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
Wherefore fearing Partiality might blind me in
mine Owne Book (knowing that <hi>Eli</hi> was not the onely
Indulgent Father to his owne Off-ſpring) I imparted my
Sermon to ſome whom you reſpect, and they reſpect
you: Men of ſingular Learning and Piety, to Examine
it. Theſe likewiſe could diſcover no dangerous Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in it, except ſuch as were dangerous for a Preacher
to deliver, but ſafe for People to Receive in theſe
Troubleſome Times. And I am Confident that their
Iudgement was ſuch, They would not be deceived with
my Falſehoods: and their Honeſty ſuch, They would
not deceive me by their Flattery.</p>
            <p>And now Sir (Love cannot Hate, but it may juſtly be
Angry) Conſider how your accuſing of me, to maintaine
dangerous Poſitions, might, as the Times ſtand, have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
me and mine, and at leaſt have intituled mee to a
Priſon, now adayes the Grave of men alive. Times are
not as formerly, when Schollers might ſafely Traverſe
a Controverſie in diſputation. Honourable Tilting is
left off, ſince men fell to down-right killing; and in vaine
ſhould I diſpute my Innocence againſt Souldiers vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
who would interpret the Accuſation of a man
of your Credit to be my ſufficient Conviction.</p>
            <p>I have in this <hi>my Defence,</hi> ſo well as God did Enable
me, more clearely expreſſed, and ſtrongly confirmed
the Poſitions I formerly delivered, and requeſt you to
tell mee, which are the dangerous Points that here I
maintaine. By the Lawes of our Land, the Creditor
hath his Choice, whether he will ſue the Principall, or
<pb facs="tcp:155016:6"/>
the Surety, and diſcretion will adviſe him, to ſue him
which is moſt ſolveable. Your Ability is ſufficiently
knowne, and ſeeing you have beene pleaſed to be bound
for Maſter <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> his Booke, in your Approving it:
blame me not Sir, if I (I will not ſay ſue you) but Sue to
you for my Reparation.</p>
            <p>If you can Convince me of my Faults herein (and I
will bring great deſire, and ſome capacity to Learne
from you) I ſhall owne my ſelfe your Proſelyte, thanke
God for you, and you for my Converſion. Yea in a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſheet I will doe publique Penance to the open view
of the World, to ſhew men, that although I had ſo much
Ignorance as to Erre, I have not ſo much Impudence as
to Perſiſt in an Errour, and ſhall remaine,</p>

Had it beene true, I want a word bad enough to expreſſe

till the Apoſtle had rectified their miſtake. This added
alſo to my trouble, that I can privately enjoy my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

publikly declare it with ſafety to others. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
therefore, all that I will returne, is this.</p>
            <p>Here is an Accuſation without a witneſſe, or a witneſſe
without a name, and both without truth. Would
the Inke of this reverend Divine (whoſoever he was)
only hold out to blot my name, and not to ſubſcribe his
owne? We know what Court was complayned of, as a
great grievance, becauſe Men therein might not know
their Accuſers. If it cannot conſiſt with our mutuall

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOu have almoſt converted me, to be of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that ſome <hi>extraordinary Light</hi> is peculiarly
conferred on men in this age. Seeing what coſt me
many dayes to make, you in fewer houres, could make
void and confute. You <hi>examined</hi> (you ſay) <hi>the ſame pace,
you read,</hi> and (as is intimated) wrote as faſt, as you exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and all <hi>in one ofternoon.</hi> This if it were falſe, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
you would ſay it; and if it were true, I wonder you
could doe it. However I commend your policy herein:
for beſides that you have given the world notice of the
Pregnancie of your parts, (and it is no fault of yours,
if you be rather heard then beleeved) hereby you have
done me a great diſadvantage. For if I at leiſure diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſome notable errors in your examinations, you have
a preſent Plea, that you wrote them ſuddenly, and I ſhall
only be repaired for the wrong that you have done me,
with your <hi>raptim ſcripta,</hi> whereas you had done <hi>God as
much Glory,</hi> the cauſe as much good, more right to your
ſelfe, and credit to me, if you had tooke more time, and
more truely.</p>
            <p>And now conſider, you only endeavour to confute
ſome diſmembred ſentences of my Sermon, of which
<pb facs="tcp:155016:8"/>
ſome are falſely, and more of them imperfectly alleged.
You know, how in a continued ſpeech, one part receives
and returnes ſtrength and luſtre unto another. And how
eaſie is it, to overthrow the ſtrongeſt ſentence, when it
is cut off from the Aſſiſtance of the Coherence, before
and after it? Alas, this diſiointing of things, undoeth
kingdomes as well as ſermons, whileſt even weake mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are preſerved by their owne unity and entireneſſe. I
have dealt more fairely with you, and ſet downe your
whole Examinations, thereby not expecting any praiſe,
but preventing juſt cenſure, if I had done otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>If you demand why my anſwer comes ſo late, ſeeing
ſo long ſilence may be interpreted a conſent. Know Sir,
it was the tenth of September, before either friend in
love, would doe me the favour: or foe in anger, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteſie,
to convey your booke unto me.</p>
            <p>Whether this proceeded from the intercepting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
betwixt the City and the Country, or that your
Booke was loath to come out of London: as ſenſible, that
the ſtrength of your poſitions, conſiſted in the fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof.</p>
            <p>When I had received one of your bookes, I had not
your preſent parts to anſwer it. Men muſt doe, as they
may doe: I hope, though my credit may, Gods cauſe ſhall
not ſuffer by my delay; ſeeing Truth doth not abate with
time. Here I ſpeake not of thoſe many afflictions, that
have befalne me, as not being ſo unreaſonable, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
any pitty from others, in theſe dolefull dayes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
none are at leiſure to bemoane the miſery of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
men, whilſt the generall Calamity ingroſſeth all
greife to it ſelfe; and yet, I may ſay, ſuch loſſes could not
but diſturbe my ſtudies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:155016:9"/>
When I had finiſhed my anſwer, I could not ſo ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
provide to have it printed. And to ſpeake plainely,
I was adviſed by my beſt friends, to paſſe by your
pamphlet altogether with ſilence and neglect, and apply
my ſelfe onely to enlarge my Sermon, for the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of others.</p>
            <p>However, that you may ſee I will not decline any
thing: I have anſwered every operative paſſage in your
Examination.</p>
            <p>Here I might take juſt exception at the ſentence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
in the title page of your booke, 2 Tim. 3. 5. <hi>Having
a forme of Godlineſſe, but denying the power thereof.</hi> Out of
the whole quiver of the Bible, could you chooſe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Arrow to ſhoot, and make me your marke? whom
if you taxe for a <hi>meere formaliſt;</hi> God grant I may make a
good uſe of your bad ſuſpition of me, endeavouring to
acquit my ſelfe in Heaven, whom you have accuſed on
Earth: I muſt <hi>ſtand or fall to my owne Maſter,</hi> to whom I
hope I ſhall <hi>ſtand,</hi> being held up by my Saviour. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
remember, we muſt all appeare before <hi>Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Seat,</hi> when thoſe things which <hi>have been done in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi>
ſhall bebrought to light. Meane time goe you on, a

free, willfully to daſh your fellow travellers, with foule
aſperſions: for if dirt may paſſe for coine, debts in this

SAINT
MARY SAVOY.</head>
            <p>MY deare Pariſh, for ſo I dare call you, as concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
that although my calamities have divorced
me from your bed and board, the matrimoniall
knot betwixt us is not yet reſcinded. No not although
you have admitted another, (for feare I hope rather then
affection) into my place. I remember how <hi>David</hi> when
forced to fly from his wife,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 3. 14.</note> yet ſtill cals her, <hi>My wife Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall:</hi>
even when at that time, ſhe was in the poſſeſſion of
<hi>Phaltiel</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Laiſh,</hi> who had rather bedded then
wedded her.</p>
            <p>This Sermon I firſt made for your ſake, as providing
it, not as a feaſt to entertaine ſtrangers, but a meale to
feed my family. And now having againe inlarged and
confirmed it, I preſent it to you, as having therein a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
intereſt, being confident, that nothing but good and
profitable truth is therein contain'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:155016:10"/>
Some perchance will obiect, that if my Sermon were
ſo true, why then did I preſently leave the pariſh when
I had preached it? My anſwer is legible in the Capital
letters of other miniſters miſerie, who remaine in the
City.<note place="margin">1 Cor 7. 26.</note> I went away, <hi>for the preſent diſtreſſe,</hi> thereby reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
my ſelfe to doe you longer and better ſervice? if
Gods providence ſhall ever reſtore me unto you againe.
And if any tax mee as <hi>Laban</hi> taxed <hi>Iacob.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore didſt
thou flee away ſecretly,</hi> without taking ſolemne leave? I ſay

               <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 31.</note> 
               <hi>becauſe I was afraid.</hi> And that plaine

a ſhooe latchet of other mens goods, confeſſeth
himſelfe guilty of that lawfull felony, that hee <hi>ſtole away</hi>
for his owne ſafety: ſeeing truth it ſelfe may ſometimes
ſeeke corners, not as fearing her cauſe, but as ſuſpecting
her judge.</p>
            <p>And now all that I have to ſay to you,<note place="margin">Luk. 8. 18.</note> is this, <hi>Take heed
how you heare:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17. 11.</note> imitate the wiſe and noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the Doctor, or doctrine bee which teacheth, or is
taught unto you. <hi>Search the Scripture dayly whether theſe
things be ſo.</hi> Hanſell this my counſell, on this my booke:
and here beginning, hence proceed to examine all Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
by the ſame rule of Gods word.</p>
            <p>Only this I adde alſo, Pray daily to God, to ſend us a
good and happy Peace; before we be all brought to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
confuſion. You know, how I in all my Sermons unto
you, by leave of my Text, would have a paſſage in the
praiſe of Peace. Still I am of the ſame opinion. The lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
I ſee this warre, the leſſe I like it, and the more I loath
it. Not ſo much becauſe it threatens temporall ruine to
our Kingdome, as becauſe it will bring a generall ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb facs="tcp:155016:10"/>
hardneſſe of hearts. And if this warre long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
we may be affected for the departure of <hi>charity,</hi> as
the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were at the going away of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>

               <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing

Strive therefore in your prayers that, that happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which our ſinnes made us unworthy to hold, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
may, through Gods acceptance thereof, make

            <p>To acquaint you with my intentions in this Book (that
ſo you may proportion your expectation accordingly)
Herein I have to my Power vindicated the truth: conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with my conſcience, not outward ſafety; Inſomuch
that I care not whom I diſpleaſed, to pleaſe <hi>the Bird in
my Breaſt.</hi> Yea when the actions of other men, have by
the Examiner beene laid to my charge, I have tooke the
boldneſſe to leave them to their Authors to defend. For
though Honeſtie commands me to pay my owne debts,
yet diſcretion adviſeth me from <hi>Solomons</hi> mouth, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
<hi>Sureti-ſhip,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 11. 15.</note> and not to Breake my ſelfe with being
bound for the Errors of others.</p>
            <p>I cannot but expect to procure the Ill-will of many,
becauſe I have gone in a middle and moderate way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
all extremities. I remember a ſtory too truely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable
to me. Once a Jayler demanded of a Priſoner,
newly committed unto him: whether or no he were a
Roman Catholick. No, anſwered he: what then ſaid
he <hi>are you an Anabaptiſt?</hi> Neither replied the Priſoner,
What, (ſaid the other) <hi>are you a Browniſt. Nor ſo</hi> ſaid the
<pb facs="tcp:155016:11"/>
man, <hi>I am a Proteſtant.</hi> Then ſaid the Jayler, get you into
the dungeon: I will afford no favor to you, who ſhall get
no profit by you: Had you beene of any of the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions,
ſome hope I had to gaine by the viſits of ſuch as
are of your owne profeſſion. I am likely to finde no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
uſage, in this age, who profeſſe my ſelfe to be a plaine
Proteſtant, without wealt or garde, or any Addi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion:
equally oppoſite to all <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Sectaries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me mate this with another obſervation. By the
Law <hi>of the twelve Tables,</hi> if a man were indebted but
to one creditor,<note place="margin">Bodin de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub. lib. 1. p 50.</note> he had no Power over his body: but
if he owed mony to many, and was not ſolvable, all his
creditors together might ſhare his body betwixt them,
and by joynt conſent pluck him in peeces. Me thinks, a
good Morall lurkes in this cruell Law: namely, that men
who oppoſe one adverſary alone, may come off and ſhift
pretty well, whilſt he who provokes many enemies, muſt
expect to bee torne aſunder: and thus the poore <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite,</hi>
will bee rent into as many pieces,<note place="margin">Iudg. 19. 29.</note> as the <hi>Levites
wife</hi> was.</p>
            <p>Yet I take not my ſelfe to bee of ſo deſolate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne
a Religion, as to have no fellow profeſſors with
me. If I thought ſo, I ſhould not only ſuſpect, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
my judgement: having ever as much loved ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſſe
of heart, as I have hated ſingularity of opinion.
I conceive not my ſelfe like <hi>Eliah to be left alone:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King. 19. 14.</note> having,
as I am confident, in England, more then ſeventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,
juſt of the ſame Religion with me. And amongſt
theſe, there is one in price and value, eminently <hi>worth
tenne thouſand,</hi> even our gratious Soveraigne, whom God
in ſafety and honour long preſerve amongſt us.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt waſh away an aſperſion, generally,
<pb facs="tcp:155016:12"/>
but falſely caſt on men of my profeſſion and temper: for
all <hi>moderate</hi> men, are commonly condemned for <hi>Luke-warme</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As it is true,</hi> Saepe latet vitium proximitate boni.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is as true,</hi> Saepelatet virtus proximitate mali.</p>
            <p>And as Lukewarmneſſe hath often fared the better (the
more mens ignorance) for pretending neighbourhood
to moderation: ſo Moderation (the more her wrong)
hath many times ſuffered for having ſome ſuppoſed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity
with lukewarmneſſe. However they are at a grand
diſtance, Moderation being an wholeſome Cordiall to
the ſoule: whilſt lukewarmneſſe (a temper which ſeekes
to reconcile hot and cold) is ſo diſtaſtefull, that <hi>health it
ſelfe</hi> ſeemes ſick of it,<note place="margin">Rev. 3 16.</note> and vomits it out. And we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
theſe differences betwixt them.</p>
            <p>Firſt the Lukewarme man (though it be hard to tell
what he is; who knowes not what he is himſelfe) is fix't
to no one opinion, and hath no certain creed to beleeve;
Whereas the Moderate man, ſticks to his principles, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Truth whereſoever he findes it, in the opinions of
friend, or foe; gathering an herb, though in a ditch: and
throwing away a weed, though in a Garden.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Lukewarme man, is both the archer and
marke himſelfe; aiming only at his owne outward ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.
The Moderate man, levels at the glory of God,
the quiet of the Church, the chooſing of the Truth, and

               <p>B. <hi>But it ſo moderates and modificates.</hi>) The moſt Civill
Actions will turne wild, if not warily moderated. But if
my Sermon clogges Reformation with falſe or needleſſe
Qualifications (till the ſtrength of the matter leakes out at
them) my guilt is great. I am confident of my Innocence,
let the Evidence be produced and the Reader judge.</p>
               <p>C. <hi>That Reformation can advance but little in this way.</hi>)
Know that <hi>Zoar a little one</hi> that is laſting, is better then a
great Babel of Confuſion. That Reformation which begins
ſlowly and ſurely, will proceed cheerfully and comfortably,
and continue conſtantly and durably. Builders are content

               <p>D. <hi>They put the Sunne into an heavenly Labyrinth and

ſtrong line more perplexeth me to underſtand it: Onely
this I know, that you might have inſtanced more properly
in any other Planet which is more loaden with Cycles, and
Epicycles, whilſt the Sunne hath found from Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers

Motion.</p>

               <p>N. <hi>For firſt, he that conceits there can be no perfection in

the <hi>He</hi> you ſpake of be a meere carnall man, this nor any

<hi>Quod fere fit, non fit, quod vix fit, fit.</hi> One <hi>ſcarce</hi> is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then ten thouſand <hi>almosts.</hi> Yet I perceive by the ſcant
meaſure in your expreſsion, that you conceive this Doctrine
of the impoſsibility of a Churches perfection on earth, to
be but a backe friend to Reformation. Heare therefore
what I anſwer for my ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1 The Doctrine of the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſibility o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> a Churches per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this world, being well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, begets not lazineſſe but the more induſtry in wiſe reformers</note> hereby you furniſh the papiſts with a Cavill, and
with a Colour to enforce the ſame againſt the Proteſtants.
For we teach and maintaine, that the beſt workes of men
are ſtained with ſome imperfections. Hence the papiſts
may inferre, <hi>That he that conceits there can be no perfection
in a good deed, will ſcarce labour to doe one.</hi> And thus our
Doctrine ſhall be condemned for diſheartning of holineſſe.
See Sir how you meet popery in your undiſcreet ſhunning
of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though there can be no abſolute perfection in
a Church, yet <hi>quo ad gradum,</hi> in ſome good degree it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable,
and all good men will endeavour it. Mariners
which make forth for the Northerne Diſcoveries, goe out
with this aſſurance, that it is impoſſible to come to the pole.
Yet have they ſought and found out very farre, almoſt to
the eightieth degree of latitude. What covetouſneſſe or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
did in them, ſure Grace is as active to doe in Gods
Children who will labour <hi>to draw neere</hi> to a perfect Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
in obedience to Gods command, though they know
they ſhall never fully attaine unto it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Doctrine of the impoſſibility of a perfect
Reformation in this world well underſtood, begets not idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
but the more induſtry in mens endeavours. For thoſe
that beleeve that the perfection of a Church may be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:155016:16"/>
in this life, are ſubject to this miſtake (one errour is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creative
of another) to thinke that ſometimes they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
have attained it, and ſo ending in the midſt of their
journey, may ſit downe and take up their reſt: Whereas
thoſe who conceive the impoſſibility of perfection are
kept in conſtant doing, having ſtill <hi>plus ultra.</hi> with Saint
<hi>Paul, forgetting thoſe things that are behind, they reach
forth to thoſe things which are before,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>and preſſe towards the
marke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, if it be objected that the impoſſibility of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
diſcourageth men to endeavour it, ſeeing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
rationally deſire it, <hi>non eſt voluntas impoſſibilium,</hi> it is
no levell wiſh aimed at a marke, but a Velleity ſhot at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
which deſires an impoſſibility. It is anſwered, that
Gods ſervants endeavouring a perfect Reformation, doe not
light on a labour in vaine, that which is wanting in them
being ſupplyed in Gods acceptance: If they doe their beſt,
their deſire is taken for the deed: The deformities of their
imperfect Reformation being pardoned by God in Chriſt,
in which reſpect, <hi>their labours are not in vaine in the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſeeing this point of the impoſſibility of a Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
perfection is moſt true (as hereafter we ſhall make ſo
appeare) if hereupon any grow remiſſe and large in Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
it is not the fault of Gods ſtraight Doctrine, but of
mens crooked practice: For if men inferre helliſh Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
from heavenly premiſes, ſuch bad conſequences are
not the lawfull Children of Gods Truth, but the Baſtards of
mans corruption, where they are juſtly to be fathered for
their maintenance. And now I ſuppoſe that your excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in thoſe your words <hi>will ſcarce labour,</hi> is abundantly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               <p>O. <hi>Nor will we care for any new light, whilſt the old is in
beſt reputation with him.</hi>) This is grounded on what I never
ſaid, but if by the <hi>old light</hi> be meant that which ſhined from
the Ancient of dayes into the Scriptures and thence through
the Fathers to us, I preferre it before any new light whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:155016:16"/>
P. <hi>A good policy to ſtay the Reformation till His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
returne.</hi>) It need not have ſtayed till His Majeſties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
which might have been done before His going away;
who ſo often and ſo earneſtly offered to reforme whatſoever
could juſtly be convinced to be amiſſe in our Church;
which proffers had they been as thankfully accepted, as they
were graciouſly tendered, long ſince it had been done what
we now diſpute of, though it matters not for the ſpilling of
our inke, if other mens blood had beene ſpared. And I
doubt not when opportunity is offered His Majeſty will
make good his word, whom no Vollyes of diſcurteſies
though diſcharged never ſo thicke againſt him, ſhall drive
him from His Princely Promiſe, whilſt he lookes not
downewards on mens behaviour to him, but upwards to his
Proteſtations to God, learning from Him whom he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
to be <hi>Unchangeable.</hi> But if (which God foreſend, and
yet all earthly things are caſuall) it ſhould come to paſſe,
that in point of Reformation, what formerly was proffered
by the Sovereigne, and refuſed by the Subject, ſhould here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
be requeſted by the Subject, and denied by the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne;
we ſhall have leiſure enough to admire Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
bemoane our owne condition, and inſtruct our Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
not to outſtand good offers, leaſt for want of ſeeing
their happineſſe they feele their owne miſery. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to your mentioning of His Majeſties return; when all
is done for ought I can ſee, Reformation muſt ſtay till His
Majeſties returne. As for the time and manner thereof
when and how it ſhall be done. God in his wiſdome and
goodneſſe ſo order it, that it may be moſt for his glory, the
Kings honour, the good of the Church and State. But this
I ſay againe, that till this his returning, the generall enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and peaceable practiſing of any Reformation cannot
be performed.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>And then there is hope it may coole in their hands.</hi>)
If by their hands you meane his Majeſties (and what elſe
can your words import) it is as diſloyall a ſuſpition, as his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155016:17"/>
would be an unfitting expreſſion that ſhould ſay, that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
would boyle over in the hands of the Parliament.
But Sir, thus farre you have excepted againſt my Sermon in

produced ſome droſſe in our Articles, inſtancing in ſome
falſe place or point contained in them, and then I muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have yeelded to you with diſgrace, or oppoſed you
with diſadvantage. But inſtead of this, you only tell us how
ſome have ſeene Arminianiſme and Popery in them. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer:
So the Papiſts doe read every point of Popery where
you will ſay it was never written in the Scripture. Thoſe
who bring the jaundies in their eyes doe find yellowneſſe in
every object they behold; and nothing can be ſo cautiouſly
pen'd, but ingaged perſons will conſtrue it to favour their
opinions.</p>
               <p>V. <hi>As to attempt a reconciliation of their Articles and

ours together.</hi>) Thus many <hi>Egyptian</hi> K<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. attempted to let the

to ſuch as meaſured their neerneſſe by the eye and at laſt
found impoſſible by thoſe who ſurveyed their diſtance by
their judgement; ſeeing art &amp; induſtry can never marry thoſe
things whoſe bands Nature doth forbid. And I am confident
that with the ſame ſucces, any ſhal undertak the Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating
of Engliſh and Romiſh Articles. Nor can the wiſeſt
Church in ſuch a Caſe provide againſt the boldneſſe of
mens attempting, though they may prevent their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
from taking effect. For my owne Opinion, as on the
one ſide, I ſhould be loath that the Bels ſhould be taken
downe out of the ſteeple and new-caſt every time that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
people tune them to their <hi>Thinke:</hi> So on the other
ſide, I would not have any juſt advantage given in our Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to our Adverſaries. However, what you ſay confutes
not, but confirmes my words in my Sermon, that the 39.
Articles need <hi>declaring, explaining and aſſerting from falſe
gloſſes.</hi> And ſeeing it is the peculiar Priviledge of Gods
Word to be perfect at once and for ever, on Gods bleſſing
let the darke words in our Articles be expounded by cleerer,
doubtfull expreſſed in plainer, improper exchanged for fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

of <hi>Malignity,</hi> this is a truth to be confided in: Namely,
That no Church in this world can be ſo compleat, but it
will have faults. For the Church being a body conſiſting of
imperfect men the Members thereof, the body muſt needs
be imperfect alſo. This appeares by the conſtant neceſſity
of Preaching, which otherwiſe might well be ſpared, and

               <p>Firſt, they may better be tearmed Renovations then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations,
as lately not new forged, but new furbiſhed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:155016:19"/>
Jealouſie hath her hyperboles as well as her flattery. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſome of theſe Innovations may eaſier be rayled on then
juſtly reproved; namely, ſuch as concerned the adorning
of Churches, and the comlineſſe of mens behaviour in Gods
ſervice, where outward decency (if not gariſh, coſtly above
the Eſtates of the pariſh, mimicall affected or ſuperſtitious)
is the Harbinger to provide the lodging for inward holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
For ſome bodily diſtance brings our ſouls the neerer
to God, with whom ſome have ſuch clowniſh familiarity,
they have the leſſe friendſhip. Fourthly, if theſe gave of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
it was not for any thing in themſelves but either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe;</p>
               <p>Firſt, they were challenged to be brought in without law.
This often makes good matters to be ill reliſhed, honeſt
men if wiſe withall, being loath to pay their obedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it becomes legally due.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe they ſeemed new and unuſuall, and
we know how in dangerous times every well-meaning
ſtranger may be ſuſpected for a ſpy till he hath given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of himſelfe. Now few daughter-Churches had ſeen
ſuch Ceremonies, though ſome of their Mother-Cathedrals
could well remember them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe they were multiplied without any ſet
number; and thoſe Ceremonies which men ſaw were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definit,
they feared would be infinit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe they were preſſed in ſome places with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
moderation. And herein ſome young men (I will not
ſay ran without ſending, but) ran further then they were
ſent, outſtripping them who firſt taught them to goe.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, becauſe they were preſſed by men, ſome of whoſe
perſons were otherwiſe much diſtaſted; how juſtly? let
them ſeek who are concerned.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, becauſe men complained that painfull Preaching
and pious living, the life of Gods ſervice were not preſſed
and practiſed with equall earneſtneſſe, as outward decency
the luſtre thereof; whence their feares inferred, that the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:155016:20"/>
ſhaddowes would devoure the Subſtance.</p>
               <p>Now whereas you ſay that theſe Innovations have been
made by <hi>our moſt learned,</hi> herein I muſt confeſſe that the
ſcales of my skill are too little in them to weigh the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of great Schollers, and to conclude who have the <hi>moſt.</hi>
But this I know, that alwayes a diſtinction hath been made
and admitted betwixt the opinions and practiſe of the moſt
eminent particular Doctors (how great ſoever in place pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or parts) and the Reſolutions and Commands of the
Church in generall. In which reſpect, what hitherto you
alleadge to the contrary, doth no whit diſprove my words,
that ſuch Innovations are rather <hi>in the Church then of the
Church,</hi> by which they were never abſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>utely enjoyned nor
generally received, as alwayes diſclaimed by many, and late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſeſed by moſt.</p>
               <p>Such indeed as uſed them out of Conſcience (I ſhould
have no Conſcience to think otherwiſe of ſome) are not to
be blamed if they privately practiſe them ſtill, at their own
perill, till their judgements are otherwiſe informed. Such
as took them up for faſhion ſake, for faſhion ſake have ſince
laid them downe. Such as were frighted into them deſiſt,
now their feare is removed. Laſtly, thoſe who uſed them
in hope of preferment, now diſuſe them in deſpaire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
not to ſay ſome of them are as violent on the contrary
ſide, and perchanee onely wait <hi>the Word of command</hi> from
the prevalent party to turne <hi>Faces about</hi> againe. In briefe,
ſeeing generally theſe Ceremonies are left off, it ſeems nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Manners nor Charity, alwayes to lay that in mens di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,
which the Voider ſome pretty while ſince hath cleane
taken away.</p>
               <p>Say not that theſe Innovations are now rather in a ſwound
then dead &amp; likly to revive, when cheriſhed with the warmth
of Authority ſeeing His Majeſty hath often and fully prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
that whatſoever is juſtly offenſive in them ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and pitty it is but that the reſt ſhould by the ſame
lawfull power be re-enforced. But enough hereof, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:155016:20"/>
more perchance then will pleaſe the Reader, though leſſe
could not have ſatisfied the Writer; if I have contented any,
well; If I have diſpleaſed all, I am contented.</p>
               <p>B. <hi>Therefore goe not on to perſwade ſuch a Fundamentall
Integrity and Eſſentiall purity.</hi>) Indeed the pains may well
be ſpared, for all wiſe men are ſufficiently perſwaded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
already. For if hereby you meane (and I would faine
learne what other ſence your words are capable of) that the
Cſturch of <hi>England</hi> hath not as yet been <hi>Entire</hi> in the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,
and <hi>Pure</hi> in the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> to Salvation. We all
are in a wofull Condition. Have we lived thus long in our
Church, now to dye eternally therein? Seeing none can be
ſaved therein if it be unſound in the Fundamentals of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
muſt the thouſand ſix hundred forty third yeer from
Chriſt's birth, be the firſt yeer of the nativity of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> from which ſhe may date her Eſſentiall purity?
Sir, I could at the ſame time childe you with anger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moane
you with pitty, bluſh for you with ſhame, were it
not that I conceive this paſſage fell unawares from your
pen, and that you intend to gather it up againe.</p>
               <p>C. <hi>You know in what a caſe that Church was, when ſhee
thought her ſelfe rich, and full, and glorious.</hi>) Good Sir, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
of my ſervice to ſtay you, or elſe run on till you be

thus her ſelfe, nor any other for her; whoſe faults we have

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:155016:25"/>
we betwixt thoſe Times, when the Church
liveth under Pagan or perſecuting Princes, and when
God bleſſeth her with a Chriſtian King, defender of
the Faith: In the former caſe the Church may and
muſt make an hard ſhift to reforme her ſelfe ſo well as
ſhe can (for many things will be wanting, and more
will be but meanly ſupplyed) without any relating to
a ſupreame Power, whoſe leave therein will be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to deſire and impoſſible to obtaine. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
they muſt provide themſelves to ſuffer, offering no
violence, except it be to drowne a Tyrant in their
teares, or to burne him with coales of kindneſſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
on his head. In the latter caſe, when the ſupreame
Power is a nurſing Father to the Church, ſuckling
it, not ſucking blood from it, the Church muſt have
recourſe to it before ſhee may reforme. Reforming of
a Church muſt neither ſtay behind for <hi>Nero</hi> his leave,
nor runne before without the conſent of <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>
Religion it ſelfe muſt not be deckt with thoſe flowers
which are violently pluck'd from the Crownes of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Princes.</p>
               <p>Come we now then to ſhew, how in a Chriſtian ſtate,
all are to contribute their joynt endeavours to promote a
Reformation.</p>
               <p>In a Church,<note place="margin">3 How far pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Miniſters and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are to concur to the advancing of a publike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> and ſuch a State I conſider three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees

mixture of a publike Relation. Secondly, perſons pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in a middle poſture with the Centurian in publike
imployment over ſome, yet <hi>under Authority</hi> themſelves.
Thirdly, the abſolute ſupreame Power, who depends of
God alone.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, meere private men; they have
nothing to doe in publike reforming but to advance it
by their hearty prayers to God, and to facilitate the
generall Reformation, by labouring to amend their
owne and their Families lives according to the Word;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:155016:25"/>
this is all God requireth of them and more I feare then moſt
of them will performe.</p>
               <p>Next, ſucceed thoſe perſons in a middle poſture, and
theſe are either Miniſters or Magiſtrates. Miniſters even
the meaneſt of them have thus far their part in publike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming,
that they are to <hi>lift</hi> up their <hi>voice like a Trumpet</hi>
(though not like <hi>Sheba</hi> his Trumpet to ſound ſedition)
both to reprove vitiouſneſſe in Manners,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 20. 1.</note> and to confute er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
in Doctrine. And if men of power and imminent place
in the Church, then as their ingagement is greater, ſo
their endeavours muſt be ſtronger, to preſſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
a publike Reformation to ſuch whom it doth
concerne.</p>
               <p>Magiſtrates may have more to doe in publike Reforming
having a calling from God, who therefore hath ſet them in
a middle place betwixt Prince and people, to doe good
offices under the one, over the other, betwixt both. And
having a calling from the King, eſpecially if they be his
Counſellours, whoſe good they are to advance by all lawfull
meanes, and rather to diſpleaſe him with their ſpeech, then
to diſhonour him with their ſilence; and having a calling
from their Country, whoſe ſafety they muſt be tender and
carefull of.</p>
               <p>Firſt, therefore they are with all induſtry (both from the
Miniſters mouth and by their owne inquiry) to take true
notice of ſuch defects and deformities in the Church or
State as are really to be reformed. Secondly, they are
with all ſincerity to repreſent the ſame to the ſupreame
Power. Thirdly, with all humility to requeſt the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſuch Enromities. Fourthly, with all gravity
to improve their requeſt with arguments from Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the Princes honour, the peoples profit, and the like.
Laſtly, with their beſt judgement to propound and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the faireſt way whereby a Reformation may as ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
as ſafely be effected. And if they meet with difficulties
in the ſupreame Power delaying their requeſt, they are not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:155016:26"/>
to be diſheartned, but after their ſervent prayers to God,
who alone hath the hearts of Kings in his hands, they are
conſtantly to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in places more proper, with expreſſions more patheticall, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their words as full of earneſtneſſe, as their deeds farre
from violence.</p>
               <p>As laſt comes the ſupreame Power,<note place="margin">4. What parts therein are onely to be acted by the <hi>ſupreame Power.</hi>
                  </note> who alone is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
by its own Authority, though not by its owne adviſe
alone. For becauſe it is rationally to be preſumed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
have beſt skill in matters of Divinity, they are to be
conſulted with; and here comes in the neceſſity and uſe of
<hi>Councels, Convocations, Synods</hi> and Aſſemblyes. And becauſe
there is not onely a conſtant correſpondency but alſo an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperable
complication betwixt the Church &amp; State; Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
are therefore to be adviſed with in a Reformation, ſo to
ſettle it as may beſt comply with the Common-wealth. For
God in that generall warrant, <hi>Let all things be done decently
and in order;</hi> p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the hands of the Church and Chriſtian Princes, to cut out
and faſhion each particular decency and order, ſo as may
ſhape and ſuit beſt with the preſent Time and Place wherein
ſuch a Reformation is to be made.</p>
               <p>Theſe parts therefore are to be acted in a Reformation
by the ſupreame Power. Firſt, he is (either by his owne
Motion, or at the inſtance and intreaties of others) to call
and congregate ſuch Aſſemblyes. Secondly, to give them
leave and liberty to conſult and debate of matters needing
to be reformed. Thirdly, to accept the reſults of their
conſultations, and to weigh them in the ballance of his
Princely diſcretion. Fourthly, to confirme ſo much with
his <hi>Royall Aſſent</hi> as his judgement ſhall reſolve to be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
or convenient. Laſtly, to ſtamp the Character of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
upon it, that Recuſants to obey it may be ſubject to
civill puniſhments.</p>
               <p>But now all the queſtion will be what is to be done if the
endeavours of Subjects be finally returned with deafneſſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:155016:26"/>
or deniall in the ſupreame Power. In this caſe a pulike Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
neither ought nor can be performed without the
conſent of the ſupreame Power: It ought not,</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe God will not have a Church reformed by the
deforming of his Commandement. He hath ſaid <hi>Honour
thy Father and thy Mother</hi> and requireth that all Superiours
ſhould be reſpected in their places. Secondly, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
rich in Preſidents for our inſtruction in all caſes of
importance affords us not one ſingle example, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
people attempted publiquely to reforme, without or
againſt the conſent of the ſupreame Power; and in this
particular, I conceive a negative Argument followeth
undeniably: wherefore ſeeing the Kings in <hi>Judah</hi> (there
the ſupreame Power) were alwayes called upon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
commended for doing ſo much, or condemned
for doing no more; and the people neither commanded
to remove, nor reproved for not removing publique I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,
without the conſent of the ſupreame Power; it
plainly appeareth, that a publique Reformation belongeth
to the ſupreame Power, ſo that without it, it ought not to
be done.</p>
               <p>As it ought not, ſo it cannot be done without the
conſent thereof; for admit that the higheſt ſubordinate
Power ſhould long debate, and at laſt conclude, the moſt
wholſome Rules for Reformation; yet as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, that
amongſt the many good Lawes that were made one ſtill
was wanting, namely, a Law to command and oblige men
to the due obſerving of thoſe Lawes which were made. So
when the beſt Reſolutions are determined on by any infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Power, there ſtill remaines an abſolute neceſſity
that the ſupreame Power ſhould bind and enforce to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
thereof.</p>
               <p>For inſtance: Some Offenders are poſſeſſed with ſuch
uncleane Spirits of prophaneneſſe,<note place="margin">Mar. 5. 3. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>that none can bind
them, no not with</hi> Chaines of Eccleſiaſticall Cenſures,
onely outward Mulcts in purſe or perſon can hold
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:155016:27"/>
and hamper them. <hi>Scythian</hi> ſlaves muſt be ordered
with whips, and a preſent priſon more affrights im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
perſons, then Hel-fire to come. In the Writs
<hi>De Excommunicato capiendo, &amp; de Haeritico comburendo,</hi>
ſuch as flout at the <hi>Excommunicato</hi> and the <hi>Haeretico,</hi> are
notwithſtanding heartily afraid of the <hi>Capiendo</hi> and the
<hi>Comburendo.</hi> Wherefore in ſuch caſes the Church when
it is moſt perfectly reformed is fame to crave the aid of the
State by civill and ſecular penalties, to reduce ſuch as are
Rebels to Church-Cenſures (ſometimes inflicting death
it ſelfe on blaſphemous Heretickes) and this cannot be
performed by any ſubordinate Power, in the State, but
onely by the ſupreame Power. Otherwiſe, Offenders, if
preſſed by any inferiour Power would have a free Appeale
and no doubt find full redreſſe from the ſupreame Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
without whoſe conſent ſuch penalties were impoſed
on them.</p>
               <p>Now if it be demanded, what at laſt remaines for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to doe, in caſe the ſupreame Power finally refuſeth
to reforme: Thus they are to imploy themſelves. Firſt,
to comfort themſelves in this, that they have uſed the
meanes, though it was Gods pleaſure to with-hold the
bleſſing. Secondly-they are to reflect on themſelves, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
to bemoane their own ſinnes which have cauſed Gods
juſtice to puniſh them in this kind. If a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an ill affected ſtomacke firſt ſent up the vapours which

if God ſuffer Princes to perſiſt in dangerous errours, this
diſtemper of the head came originally from the ſtomack,
from the ſinnes of the people, who deſerved this afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Thirdly, they are to reforme their ſelves and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and if the ſupreame Power be offended thereat, to
prepare themſelves patiently to ſuffer, whatſoever it ſhall
impoſe upon them, having the ſame cauſe though not the

               <p>Thirdly, it is a Doctrine ſpirituall in it ſelfe. It muſt
needs be good, it is ſo contrary to our bad natures and
corrupt inclinations, who will affirme any thing rather
then we will deny our ſelves, and our owne revengefull
diſpoſitions. And ſurely the Martyrs were no leſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
for their willing ſubmitting to, then for their
conſtant enduring of their perſecutors cruelty. And it was
as much (if not more) for them to conquer their owne

               <p>Fourthly, it is a doctrine comfortable to the Practiſers,
bitter, but wholſome. Yet it is ſweetned with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
conſolation of a cleere conſcience, which is Food in

in death.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it is glorious in the eyes of the beholders, who
muſt needs like and love that Religion, whoſe profeſſors
(where they cannot lawfully dearly ſell) doe frankly give
their lives in the defence thereof.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is a Doctrine fortunate in ſucceſſe. By prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

Hereby the wiſdome of the Eaſt was ſubdued to
the folly of Preaching. The Sunne of the Goſpell aroſe in

the heat of Religion: But ſince the Doctrine of reſiſting
the ſupreame Power came into faſhion, the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
hath runne up to a high top, but ſpread nothing
in breadth; few Papiſts have beene reclaimed, and no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
have beene converted. Alas! that ſo good a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
ſhould be now in ſo great diſgrace; yet will we
praiſe ſuch <hi>ſuffering,</hi> though we ſuffer for praiſing it. If
we cannot keepe this Doctrine alive, we will grieve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is dying; being confident, that though now it
be buried in ſo deepe diſhonour, God in due time will
give it a glorious reſurrection. And though I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
it is farre eaſier to praiſe <hi>paſſive Obedience</hi> then to
practice it, yet to commend a vertue is one degree to the
imitation of it, and to convince our judgements: Firſt,
of the goodneſſe of the deede, is by Gods bleſſing one
way to worke our wils to embrace it: In a word, if this

               <p>Y The inward call is a ſpeciall excitation from the ſpirit

I am not of ſo froward a ſpirit, as to quarrell at a word.
Otherwiſe I could tell you, that <hi>to meddle</hi> generally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:155016:28"/>
an over-buſineſſe in ſome Pragmaticall perſon,

farre they may be active therein? Therein I report the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to what I have largely expreſſed.</p>
               <p>A <hi>In ordinary tranſactions, I know the ordinary diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is to be reſorted to, but the buſineſſe of Reformation
as it is extraordinary, ſo God giveth extraordinary conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of Times and circumstances, and extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences,
and extraordinary incitations.</hi>) Now you ſoare
high, give us leave to follow you as we can. Firſt, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that a publique Reformation is an <hi>extraordinary
worke</hi> in this ſenſe, as not common or uſually done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day (as private amendment of particular perſons is
or ought to be.) But it is a rare worke, which commeth
to paſſe but ſeldome, and the doing of it is out of the
road of ordinary mens imployment. But I deny a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Reformation to be extraordinary in this acception;
as if it were to be ordered or managed by any other rules
or preſidents, then ſuch as are ordinary and uſuall in the
Bible, where many patterns of publique Reformations are
preſented; in which reſpect the ordinary diſpenſation is
to be reſorted to in the performance thereof. Whereas
you ſay, that in publique Reformations, <hi>God giveth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
conjunctures of Times and circumſtance, and
extraordinary concurrences.</hi> It is true in this ſenſe, that
the great Clock-keeper of Time ſo orders the coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of all things, that when his houre is come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſuch a Reformation ſhall be made, every officious cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
will joyfully contribute his utmoſt aſſiſtance
to the advancing thereof. Whetefore if men cannot make
a Reformation without roving from their calling, or break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:155016:29"/>
Gods Commandement (according to which it cannot
be done without the conſent of the ſupreame Power.)
Hereby it plainly appeares, that the hand of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
doth not as yet point at that happy minute of
Reformation, there being as yet times diſtracted with
jarres and disjunctures, not onely in circumſtances, but
even in ſubſtantiall matters requiſite thereunto. And
therefore ſeeing Gods good time may not be prevented,
but muſt be expected, men are ſtill patiently to wait and
pray for that <hi>conjnncture of Times</hi> and <hi>concurrency of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,</hi>
whereof you ſpeake.</p>
               <p>But whereas you ſpeake of <hi>Extraordinary Incitations</hi>
(paralell to what you ſaid before, of <hi>ſpeciall excitations</hi>
and <hi>christianly inſpired.</hi>) In theſe your expreſſions you
open a dangerous Pit,<note place="margin">Exo. 21. 33. 34</note> and neither cover it againe nor
raile it about with any cautions, ſo that Paſſengers may
unawares fall into it.</p>
               <p>For everyman who hath done an unwarrantable act,<note place="margin">6. That no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary excitations, incitations or inſpirations are beſtowed from God on men in theſe dayes.</note> which
he can neither juſtifie by the law of God or man, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
preſently that he had an extraordinary Incitation for
it; a fine tricke to plead Gods leave to breake his law. Nor
can we diſprove the impudence of ſuch people, except we
may uſe ſome touch-ſtones, thereby to try their counterfeit
incitations; my opinion herein ſhall be contrived into three
Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, no ſuch extraordinary incitations are extant now
a dayes from God, as ſtirre men up to doe any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to his Commandements. Indeed, ſome ſuch we
meet with in the Scripture, where the Law-giver diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with his owne law, incited <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his ſon,
<hi>Sampſon</hi> to kill himſelfe,<note place="margin">Gen. 22. 2. Judg. 16. 30. Exod. 12. 36.</note> and the Iſralites to rob the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians.
In ſuch caſes it was no diſobedience to Gods
publique command, but obedience to his private coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand;
if the ſervant varied his practice according to
his abſolute Maſters peculiar direction. But ſuch incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
come not now a dayes but from the ſpirit of deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:155016:29"/>
Secondly, no extraordinary excitations are extant now
a dayes from God, ſeizing on men (as anciently) in
<hi>Enthuſiaſmes,</hi> or any ſuch raptives, as make ſenſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
on them. For theſe are within the virge of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
which are now ceaſed, and our age produceth things
rather monſtrous then miraculous.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, extraordinary incitations are ſtill beſtowed
by God in theſe dayes; namely, ſuch that he giveth to
ſome of his ſervants; a more then uſuall and common
proportion of his grace, whereby they are enabled for
and incited to his ſervice with greater rigour and activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
then ordinary Chriſtians. My judgement herein ſhall
nto be niggardly to reſtraine Gods bountifull dealing,
but I verily beleeve that he who was ſo exceedingly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall
in former ages, is not ſo cloſe handed in our
times, but that in this ſence he beſtoweth extraordinary
motions, eſpecially on ſuch whom his Providence doth
call to eminent Places, either in Church or State. But
ſuch motions quicken them to <hi>runne the way of Gods
Commandements,</hi> not to ſtart without or beſide it. And
as hereby they are heightned to an Heroicall degree of
Piety, ſo though ſometimes we may ſay of them in a
Rhetoricall expreſſion, that <hi>they goe beyond themſelves,</hi> yet
they never goe beyond their calling, nor never goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
Gods Commandements.</p>
               <p>Now if any ſhall pretend that they have an extraordinary
excitation to make a publique Reformation without the
conſent of the ſupreame Power, to whom by Gods law
it belongs, ſuch an excitation cannot come from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt: For if the ſpirit of the Prophets be ſubject to
the Prophets. much more is it ſubject to the God of the
Prophets, and to the law of that God. And truly Sir,
this paſſage of <hi>extraordinary incitations,</hi> as it is by you
rawly laid downe and ſo left, containeth in it ſeed enough if
well (or rather ill) husbanded, to ſow all the Kingdome with
ſedition, eſpecially in an age wherein the Anabaptiſt in their
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:155016:30"/>
actions, beaten out of the field by Gods Word, doe daily
ſlye to this their Fort of extraordinary excitations.</p>
               <p>And you may obſerve when God gave <hi>extraordinary
excitations, quo ad regulam</hi> (ſtirring up men to doe things
contrary to the received rule of his Commandements)
then ſuch excitations were alwayes attended with extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
operations. <hi>Phinehas,</hi> who killed <hi>Cosby</hi> and <hi>Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>Firſt, the grand and generall grant from <hi>Cyrus, Ezra</hi> 1. 3.
which ſtill ſtood in full force, as confirmed by <hi>Darius. Ezra</hi>

Temple, were alſo by the ſame enabled to ſettle Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
in the beſt manner, by what wholſome lawes they

peeces in my Sermon, ſeeing the Scripture it ſelfe finds as
little favour from your hand; for had you compared on place
thereof with another you could not but have ſeen the Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Kings conſent to this Reformation. Yea ſo obſervant were
the Jewes of the Perſian Kings, that at the firſt iſſuing forth

for the conſent of the Roman Magistrate.</hi>) I anſwer.
Firſt, Chriſt and his Apoſtles; were Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
I meane extraordinary perſons, immediately inſpired. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
the Reformation they brought was mainly materiall
indeed, being the Goſpell, without which there was no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thirdly, becauſe they had not the Emperours conſent
to their Reformation they pacified his diſpleaſed ſword by
preferring their necks unto it, not repining at the dearneſſe
of the purchaſe to buy the ſafety of their ſoules with the
loſſe of their lives; all the Jury of the Apoſtles (<hi>John</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

had his ſhare in reforming, ſo farre as to propagate the truth
and confute falſhoods by his pen, preaching and diſputations.
What he did more then this was done by the flat command,
at leſt free conſent of <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> under whom
<hi>Luther</hi> lived. This Duke owing homage, but not ſubjection
to the Emperour; counted himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was reputed of others,
abſolute in his owne Dominions, as inveſted with the power
of life and death to coine money, make offenſive and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
leagues and the like. And although this wary Prince long
poiſed himſelf betwixt feare of the Emperor and love of the
truth, yet he always either publikely defended <hi>Luther,</hi> or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
concealed him, till at laſt having outgrowne his fears,
he fell boldly to publike reforming. As for the ſtates of <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich</hi>
and <hi>Baſil,</hi> wherein <hi>Zuniglius</hi> and <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> lived,
as thoſe Cities in one Relation are but members of the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetian

bodies of themſelves, and in theſe ſtates the Magiſtrates
did ſtamp the Character of civill authority on that Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which theſe Miniſters did firſt ſet on foot by their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.
But if any extravagant action of worthy men be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

the Divell, as ſeaſonable and neceſſary in theſe times to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of. Satan puts many meere private men on to be
fierce and eager upon publike reforming thereby purpoſely to
decline and avert them from their own ſelfe-amendment. For
publike reforming hath ſome pleaſure in it, as a Magiſteriall
act and work of authority, conſiſting moſt in commanding and
ordering of others; whereas private amendment is a worke all
of paine, therein a man, as he is himſelfe the judge, ſo he is

<hi>Europe</hi> over, with whom the Parliament hath not as yet, any

The eye of all Chriſtendome is upon us, the Sea ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds,
but doth not conceale us: Preſent Papiſts read the

bind men in a <hi>martiall way</hi> to kill all Papiſts; yet I pray take

caſe we may juſtly offend. Though a malefactor be condemned
by the Judge to be executed, yet the Sheriffe is a murderer if
he torment him to death, contrary to the ſentence of law. Now
giving unjuſt ſcandall to the Papiſts, is torturing of them, and
tyranny to their ſouls which may eternally deſtroy them; and
you are the firſt Divine, and I hope ſhall be the laſt, which ever

               <p>Whereas you ſay, <hi>I much mistake the Divinity of Chriſt in
matter of offence.</hi> I ſhould be very thankfull to you, if you be
pleaſed to rectifie my erroneous judgement to which end I
will crave the Readers leave, the more largely to expreſſe my
opinion in this point.</p>
               <p>I hold that we ought not to give juſt offence to any man
whatſoever: Indeed there is no danger of giving offence to the
divell. He who fears to offend Satan, offends God with his foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:155016:37"/>
fear: Becauſe the divels very nature is all miſchief and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
nothing being good in him ſave his being which he hath of
God and he is utterly incapable of ſalvation. But ſeeing in the
very worſt of men there is ſome goodneſſe, or at leſt a capabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of grace here, and glory hereafter, through repentance and
faith in Chriſt, we may not give any man juſt offence, as being
againſt the rules of Piety, Charity and Chriſtian Prudence.</p>
               <p>Againſt the rule of Piety:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 32.</note> Becauſe God hath ſaid, <hi>give no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
to any.</hi> Againſt the rule of Charity; becauſe thereby we are
cruell to them which are our Brethren by nature,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6. 3.</note> and may be
by grace. Againſt the rule of Chriſtian Prudence becauſe we
cannot give any juſt offence, but alſo thereby we doe give them
a juſt advantage againſt us. I beleeve Sir, were you to diſpute in
an Univerſity againſt Popiſh Opponents you would ſo warily
ſtate the queſtion which you defend, as that you would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
give any <hi>upper ground</hi> to your Adverſaries, more then
what they could get for themſelves. Wherfore as the wreſtlers
in the Olimpian games uſed to annoint themſelves with oyle,
not only thereby to ſupple their joynts, but alſo to make their
naked bodies the more ſlick and ſlippery, that ſo thoſe who
wreſtled with them might catch no hold upon them, ſo ought
we, who are like to have conſtant oppoſition with the Papiſts,
to give them no more advantage then what they can earn &amp; if
we give them more, they will be more ready to jeere us for
our folly, then thank us for our bounty unto them.</p>
               <p>Yea, in this reſpect it is more dangerous to give juſt offence,
and therby juſt advantage (for the one cannot be done without
the other) to the Papiſts then to any meer Pagans: For Pagans
being rude, dull and ignorant, though an advantage be given
them, cannot in point of learning husband and improve it to
the utmoſt. But the Papiſts whom we doe know and muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
cunning fencers in the School of wit and learning,
are ſo well skild, as ever to keep and inforce the advantage we
once beſtowed on them. And though we need never feare
them and all their art ſo long as we have God and a good cauſe
on our ſide, ſo if we betray our cauſe by giving them juſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
it is juſt with God to deliver us over into their hands,
to beat us with our owne weapons.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:155016:37"/>
And heare let the Reader be pleaſed to take notice, as
much materiall to our purpoſe, that there is a grand diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
betwixt the Removing of things, bad in their owne
nature, and betwixt the manner of removing them. If any
thing be bad in it ſelfe, it may not be continued, it muſt be
removed. None can diſpence with the retaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
though never ſo many or great Perſons take offence at
the taking of it away. If Friers bee offended thereat, let
them turne their girdles, with all their knots in them behind
them, whilſt wee neede not care for their cauſeleſſe anger.
They who were ſo quick ſighted that they could ſee an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
where it was never given them; Let them looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
in the ſame place, and their quick eyes will behold
there, the amends which were never tendered them.</p>
               <p>But now, as for the manner of removing of things badd
in themſelves, when there is a liberty and latitude left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us after what faſhion we will doe it, either this way or
that way, we muſt doe it ſo as to give none any juſt offence.
For where it is at our choice and pleaſure to uſe variety of
waies, our diſcretion muſt pitch on the beſt, whereby God
may receive the moſt glory, the action the moſt luſter, wee
our ſelves the greateſt comfort, and all others no juſt cauſe
of offence. And here once againe let mee requeſt the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to obſerve, that in my Sermon, I never mentioned any
tendernes, to give the Papiſts offence, in removing of thinges
bad in themſelves, but this caution of not giving the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
juſt offence, was inferted in the proper place, when
we came to ſhew how diſcretion is to appeare in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a reformation.</p>
               <p>Yea the ſame thing for ſubſtance may be done and juſt
offence either may or may not be given according to the
different manner of doing it. For inſtance, ſuch Pictures
which are in the ſuburbs of ſuperſtition, becauſe the gate of
that City is alwaies open, may without any giving of juſt
offence be fairely taken away. But to ſhoot off the head of
the ſtatue of Chriſt, either to ſpite the Papiſts, or ſport our
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:155016:38"/>
ſelves giveth juſt offence. Though the Image be nothing,
yet ſuch uſage thereof is ſomething, the bullet ſhott at the
picture, wounds pietie: For to do ſerious worke in a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
way, is inconſiſtent with Chriſtian gravities, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth
not light of knowledge but lightneſſe, not to ſay
lewdneſſe of behaviour.</p>
               <p>Another inſtance. Suppoſe that ſome ceremonies anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for time, uſed by the fathers, (though abuſed by the
Papiſts (reduced by the Proteſtants, defended by our
Engliſh, not oppoſed by forraigne Devines, be practiſed
in our Church. And withall ſuppoſe, that ſuch ceremonies
as they are harmeleſſe ſo to be uſeleſſe, and not without the
ſuſpition of danger, as the preſent times ſtand. In this caſe
it will give no juſt offence to the Papiſts to take them away
under the Nation, of things unneceſſary, and unſuting with
our preſent condition. But to remove them as things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
Idolatrous, or ſuperſtitious, giveth juſt offence and
great advantage to our Romiſh adverſaries, by the diſgrace
we put on Antiquity. Beſides, hereby we betray our freinds
which have don good ſervice for our Religion, namely ſuch
Engliſh Devines who with their penns have Learnedly and
truly aſſerted the lawfulneſſe of ſuch ceremonies, and this
our retreating from them and leaving them ingaged, (as
<hi>Ioas</hi> ſerved <hi>Vriah</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">2. Sam. 11. 15.</note> at the ſiege of <hi>Rahab</hi> treacherouſly)
ſhews much baſeneſſe in us and, in ſuch a caſe, the diſho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nouring
of good men is the diſhonoring of God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But if I ſhould in Courticie yeeld ſo much unto you
(which I never will) that it were lawfull to give juſt offence
to &amp; grounded dedicated Papiſts, yet know there be ſome,
who in their opnions, &amp; affections, the borderers betwixt us
&amp; the Papiſts, <hi>almoſt</hi> Proteſtants <hi>not far from</hi> our Religion,
having one foote in it, and the other likely to follow, ſuch
People when they ſee, that we take no care, and make no
conſcience, to give juſt offence to the Papiſts, will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to retract their reſolutions, and call back their forward
affections, ſay not that ſuch men are better loſt then found.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:155016:38"/>
Is this the bowels of Chriſtian compaſſion, which ought
to be in us, If we wilfully blaſt ſuch bloſſomes, we are not
worthy of any ripe fruite, and it is both cruelty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſſe
to caſt ſuch <hi>doe bakt cakes</hi> to the Doggs, which by
ſtanding a while longer in the Oven, would make good
and wholſome bread. Nor herein do I write only by
gueſſe, but too much by knowledge, ſuch as I can, neither
well conceale nor comfortably, relate. For when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
paines of ſome reverend Devines whom I know,
have brought ſome Papiſts to the doore of our Church,
the juſt offence given them, by the moderne extravagances
of ſome undiſcreet Proteſtants, cauſed them to fale backe
againe to Popery. And now to returne to your Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
All things contained therein, are eaſily to be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by that which we have promiſed.</p>
               <p>B. <hi>Saint Paule was of another Spirit, who forbore not a

                  <note place="margin">Gall. 2. 11</note> Saint <hi>Paule</hi> perceiving a dangerous
error, in <hi>Peter,</hi> reproved him, both preſently while the

be as broad as the fore. But in thus doing he gave no juſt
offence to <hi>Peter</hi> but blamed <hi>Peter</hi> for giving juſt offence
to other Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>C. <hi>He goeth on and perſueth the offence till they left him</hi>)
This inſtance of Chriſts his cariage herein nothing advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageth
you. Give me leave to repeate what I ſaid before,
If things be bad in themſelves, they muſt be removed,
though they give never ſo many offence or rather though
never ſo many or great men, take offence thereat ſo alſo if
a neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tru<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h bee to be introduced, it muſt be preached
and brought into the Church, though never ſo many be
offended thereat. And if there be but one way, and no
more allowed us, how and in what manner to do it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that one way, it muſt be don, not valluing the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of any. But if verity of way be permitted unto us,
God expects that we ſhould give the leaſt, and if poſſible
no offence to any. Now to apply the truth which our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:155016:39"/>
Saviour heare preached, and preſſed, was of abſolute and
neceſſary concernment. Namely that he was the true <hi>Manna
Meſsiah and bread from heaven.</hi> Such truths muſt bee
preached, and if any burne with anger threat, let not their
fire be quenched, till it goe out for want of fuell. The caſe is
farre otherwiſe in this Reformation, betwixt us and the
Papiſts. We had all eſſentiall truths before, and if any orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,
or additionall truths be now to be brought in, they
muſt be ſo done as to give no juſt offence to the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>D. <hi>Thoſe truths, which are eſſentially, univerſally, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
and at all times holy ought not to be meaſured, by the
umbrage and ſcandall of the adverſaries.</hi>) If hereby you
meane, that neceſſary truths muſt not bee forborne to bee
preached, for feare of giving any offence, I clearely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
with you. Onely I ſay that all ſuch truths are in our
Church already, and not now to bee newly brough in, (as
you intimate) by the Reformation.</p>
               <p>E. <hi>And yet the Apoſtle Preacheth, and layes thoſe
blockes and this rock of offence in the way too.</hi>) The Apoſtle
preached Chriſt, and intended him to be a <hi>rock of defence</hi> to
all, As for thoſe who perverted him to bee a <hi>rock of offence</hi>
to themſelves, this ſcandall was not juſtly given to them,
but unjuſtly taken by them. If Papiſt take offence at
any ſuch truth, it ſhall affect us no more then the cryes of
<hi>Baals</hi> Prophets<note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 18. 29.</note> affected any of whom it is ſaid, <hi>there was
none to anſwer them, nor any that regarged them.</hi> But as
for the manner of removing away any errors, or bringing in
any Truths, we ought to bee wary and circumſpect, for our
own ſakes, as well as theirs, to give them no juſt offence.</p>
               <p>To conclude. For mine owne part Sir I pittie the Perſons
of all Papiſts, &amp; heartily deſire their convertion, but hate
theirs, and all other errors, <hi>with a perfect hatred.</hi> And this my
enmity to all Popiſh Tenents, doth the more plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
to be grounded on my Judgement not on my paſſion,
Becauſe I would have al men ſo cautious, as not to give them
juſt advantage, leaſt our actions fight for them, whilſt our
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:155016:39"/>
affections fight againſt them. What Frier will not laugh
in his Coule at this your opinion, that it is lawfull to give
Papiſts juſt offence? Well, you never ſhall have my conſent,
to combate as our Churches Champion, againſt Rome for
the Proteſtant cauſe, untill you have learnt more skill in
fencing, and not to lye at ſo open a guard. And if you hold
it lawfull to give Papiſts juſt offence, by the next returne
you will hold it lawfull to give juſt offence to all, which are
termed <hi>Popiſhly affected,</hi> the Gangrean of which expreſſion,
is by ſome extended to taint as ſound and hearty Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,

                  <hi>of Iſraell ſerved the Lord all the dayes of
Iehoſſuah and all the dayes of the Elders, who outlived Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſſuah,
who had ſeene all the great workes of the Lord
which he did for Iſraell,</hi> in like manner wee may conclude,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:155016:42"/>
that the greateſt puritie and the cleareſt light of the
Church, laſted ſo long as any, within ſight, hearing, or
memory of Chriſt or his Apoſtles preaching, or miracles,
did ſurvive.</p>
               <p>Now to hold the ſcales even, we in like manner have
a three fold advantage over the Fathers. Firſt a degree of
experimentall light more then they had or could have, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſeene the whole conduct, Mannaging and Progreſſe
of Religion ſince their times, whereby (with a litle helpe
of hiſtory) a Devine who is under ſixtie in age, may be a
bove ſixteene hundred in experience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we have the benefits of the Fathers bookes,
a mightie advantage if we were as carefull to uſe it to
Gods Glory, as we are ready to bragg of it for our owne
credit. And here I muſt complaine of many mens lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
Indeed a learned man<note n="*" place="margin">Nos nani ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ſtantes ſuper humeros Gygantum. Hol. cott.</note> compareth ſuch as live in
the latter times in reſpect of the Fathers to <hi>Dwarffes ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on Giants Shoulders.</hi> But then if we will have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt
by the fathers learning, we muſt take paines to mount
to the tope of their Shoulders. But if like idle <hi>Dwarfes,</hi>
we ſtill do but ſtand on the ground, our heads will not
teach to their girdles, it is not enough to through the
bookes of the fathers, togeather on an heape, and then
making their workes our footeſtoolle to ſtand on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
and Covers of them, as if it were no more, but VP
and RIDE, boaſting how far we behold beyond them.
No, if we expect to gett advantage by their writings, we
muſt open their bookes, read, underſtand, compare, digeſt
and meditate on them. And I am affraid many that leaſt
looke into the Fathers, boaſt moſt that they looke beyond
them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly. Wee have the advantage of a darkneſſe remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by Gods goodneſſe from our eyes, which in ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
did dimme the ſight of the Fathers. Namely the miſtery
of Iniquity which wrought in their times, &amp; now is taken
away in the Proteſtant Church. That Bramble of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:155016:43"/>
(ſoone will it prick, which will be a thorne,) which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Lorded it over the <hi>Vine, Olive,</hi> and figtree, beganne
very timely to play his parte, And the <hi>Man of ſin,</hi> then
but an infant (and every thing is pretty when it is yonge,)
was unawares dandled on the knees of many a devout
Monke, and rockt in the cell of many an holy hermit, who
litle ſuſpected that then voluntary ſequeſtring themſelves to
enjoy heavenly thoughts, would by degrees degenerate to
be in after ages the cover of Pride, luſt and lazineſſe. Now
ſeing this man of ſinne, is <hi>dead already</hi> in the Proteſtant
Church, and hath a conſumption attended with the Heck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Fever in all other places, the taking away of Popiſh
ſuperſtition, may juſtly be accounted the third advantage
which our age hath.</p>
               <p>By the way we muſt take heed of a fault whereof many
are guilty. For ſome are ready to challenge every thing in
the practiſe of the Fathers which doth not pleaſe them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to be Popiſh, and pretend they taſt ſuperſtition in
whatſoever themſelves diſtaſt. O ſay they, the Fathers lived
when the <hi>myſtery of iniquity did worke,</hi> and hence they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
that it is evidence enough without further tryall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
any cerimonies uſed by them, becauſe they were
uſed by them. The way indeede to make Short Aſſiſes, but
Perjur'd Iudges, whereas it is not enough to ſay, but to
ſhew that they are ſuperſtitious, to anotomize, and diſſect
the Popery conteined in them, demonſtrating where it
croſſeth the word of God, wheras on the contrary all wiſe
and charitable men ought to eſteeme the practiſes of the
primitive Church not only to be innocent, but uſefull and
honourable till they be legally convicted to be otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>If any object that the Fathers had another diſadvantage,
that beſides the ſpreading of Popery, other Hereſies did
alſo ſpring and ſprout apace in that time, to the darkening
of the light of the truth, let them know that ſuch oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
only gave truth the opportunity to tryumph, and the
teeth of Error filled it the brighter Hereſies, <hi>In eodem ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,

all their dredgs in our dayes.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee how the Fathers were both before and
behind us, for knowledge, and wee therein both above
and beneath them in ſeverall reſpects. See the wiſdome
and goodneſſe of God, how he hath ſweely <hi>tempered</hi>

theſe were not Revelations of new truthes, but repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations

of new eſſentiall truths doe a three fold miſcheife
therein. Firſt they lay an aſpertion of ignorance and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection

               <p>Thirdly, they fixe on the Scripture an imputation of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
