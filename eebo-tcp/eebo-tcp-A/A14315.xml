         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in hande (righte honourable
and my singular good Lorde)
the translation of this worthy
and famous writer Flauiꝰ Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getius,
at the request of the
right worshipfull sir Edmo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
Brudenell knight: I thought I should haue had no
further labour, but that the sayd translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beinge
so diligently and plainlye handled according to the
authors meaning, as my simple wit and knowledge
could do it, should haue contented and satisfyed the
sayde sir Edmonde onelye for his owne priuate vse
and readinge. But he beinge a man alwayes studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
not so muche to pleasure himselfe, as to benefite
his countrye, and also desyrous to make all men par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of such commoditye, as he himselfe alone, or
a fewe besides him, mighte take by readinge of the
same: did afterwarde purpose to cause the sayde
<pb facs="tcp:19659:3"/>
worke to be printed. And althoughe the rude and
simple translation thereof, mighte worthelye haue
withdrawen him from his sayde intente: yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
consideringe what profitable thinges are
therein contayned: how wyse and prudent counsels
for all gouernours and Captaynes are there decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
how expedient and necessary the knowledge of
these thinges may be for all times and seasons, and
especially for this our time wherein we now do liue:
he thoughte it better to cause the sayde worke to be
openlye set forth and published, although in a very
base and homelye stile, then that this worthye au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
whom not onlye the Italians, Almaines and
Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but also many other Nations, haue most
diligentlye translated in their owne peculiar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,
should any longer be hidde and kepte from
all his natiue countrye men: Geuinge thereby occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to such as shall thinke the sayd worke to home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
and baselye handled, being yet, as it were, but he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
out of the rough, to plane and polishe the same,
if they will be disposed more curiouslye, and to set it
forth with finer and purer eloquence. VVhiche
thinge so much the better may be done, that the Ise
is now cut vp before, and the way made open, which
at the first might seeme more harde and dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous
to passe. The weaker that any thing doth appeare,
the more expedient and necessarye it is to seeke for
<pb facs="tcp:19659:3"/>
helpe and succour for the same: the more simple
that this translation is, the more neede it hath of
sure protection and defence. VVherefore when
as sir Edmonde Brudenell, the chiefe causer and
doer in settinge forth of this worke, had conferred
together with me as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the publishing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and had not yet determined to whom chiefelye it
might most conueniently be dedicated: your honour
amongest al others came to our remembraunce, for
manye and sundry causes, as most worthye of so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and passinge knowledge therein contained:
Not that these thinges maye seeme vnknowen to
your honour, but beinge ouerseene perused and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of the same, might more safely come abroade
and therby deserue the better fauour and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the Readers thereof: as allowed of him,
whose noble actes as wel within the Realme as with
out on euerye syde, haue alwayes from time to time
so well appeared. Pleaseth it your honour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to accept in good parte this homelye and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
worke, offered by vs of verye true and hartye
loue: on sir Edmondes behalfe, as a declaration of
the inwarde and vnfayned good will that he doth
beare towardes your honour: and on my behalfe as
a testimoniall both of like good will, and also of my
verye bounden dutye: which nowe manye yeares
latelye passed, haue receiued a liberall annuitye or
<pb facs="tcp:19659:4"/>
stipende of your honoure, whereby I haue bene the
better able to expresse suche poore knowledge as
I had, or at least my good will, not onelye in setting
forth of this present worke, but also in that trade,
which I haue professed a long time, as I trust to the
honour of Almightye God, and also to the benefite
and profit of my country. And wheras here I haue
communicated the settinge forth of this treatyse w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
him that hath beene the only and chiefe occasion of
first takinge the same in hand, I thinke he maye of
verye righte chalenge the greatest commendation
thereof (if anye be) who ayded mee not onlye wyth
his good aduyce, but also wyth Bookes, which els
where I could not haue had for the accomplishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

I could, the true sense and meaning of the Author.
Wherefore if this my endeuour maye be accepted

but if the same be ones violate and broken, then commonly do warres
ensue: whiche althoughe they seeme neuer so troublesome and full of

euen so when after longe continual peace, greuous warres do fortune,
then do valiante Captaynes shewe their worthye manhoode, not with

<pb facs="tcp:19659:6"/>
thinke it not vnmeete to shewe briefelye what is chiefelye intreated in
euery one of the same.</p>
            <p>In the first booke he setteth forth two thinges principallye.<note place="margin">The. 1. booke</note> First
the musteringe, chosinge, and appointinge of yonge souldiours: wher
in he requireth of the choosers, most faythfull and painfull dilligence,
that they do cyrcumspectly consider and vewe, not onlye the countryes
and places where they were bred and brought vp, their age, their sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,
their behauiour, the good making &amp; proportion of their bodyes,
the quickenes of their eyes and countenaunce: but also the trades and
sciences wherein they haue beene most occupyed &amp; vsed, their strength,
swiftnes, nimblenes &amp; actiuitye: by which likelyhoodes and tokens it
might well appeare which would be most meete for so greate a worke.
And in the well choosing of these doth consist the chiefest hope, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
for the strength of the armye, but also for acchieuing the victorye.</p>
            <p>Secondly he setteth forth the trayninge vppe of the yonge souldiours
well chosen,<note place="margin">An armye in latine called <hi>Exercitus ab Exercitio.</hi>
               </note> with dailye vse and exercise: wherevpon it came to passe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
an armye in latine was called <hi>Exercitus,</hi> to the intent it should be euer
in labour &amp; practise, and neuer forget to what ende it was so named.</p>
            <p>Wherein he first sheweth that they must learne and exercise to march
in battell raye, to runne, to leape, to swimme, to strike hansomely, cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninglye
to vse al kinde of weapons, to shoote, to cast dartes, to cast sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
with slinges, or with hande, to mount on horses, to carrye weight,
to fortefye the Campe, to caste and scoure trenches, with other kindes
of exercises to long here at this time to be recyted.</p>
            <p>In the seconde booke he deuideth the feates of warre into certaine
kindes,<note place="margin">The .2. booke</note> he describeth the partes of an army, which amonge diuers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were diuerslye named: but the <hi>Romaines</hi> called them Legions,
<hi>Ab eligendo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Legio ab eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendo.</note> which word he sayth requyreth their fayth and diligence,
by whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> souldiours are to be allowed or refused. He sheweth how
many cohortes or bandes of souldiours should be in one Legion, how
manye or how fewe Legions the <hi>Romaines</hi> vsed to leade in one army,
he setteth forth the names and degrees of the principall men of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> host,
he declareth the offices of all the Captaynes and gouernours, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunt,
the Martiall, the Centurions, peticaptaines, and all other
rulers and officers of the whole armye: he describeth the troupes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
horsemen, and as well the names, as the offices of the Captaines of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye
bande. Manye other thinges also hee toucheth concerninge the
Standerds, banners, ensignes and flagges, yea and the offices of the
Trumpetters, by whose sound it is knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> souldiours should
set forward to anye worke, when they should fighte or staye, when they
should followe the chase, or when they should retyre. Thus with many
other notable thinges to be knowen, and partlye with a vehement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
<pb facs="tcp:19659:7"/>
to the diligent exercise of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feates of warre, and partly with
a briefe rehersal of certaine tooles and engines, vsed to be caryed with
the armye, he concludeth the seconde booke.</p>
            <p>In the thirde hee teacheth howe an armye well appointed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,<note place="margin">The 3. booke</note>
as is aforesayd, maye nowe be brought to the fielde and ioyne
wyth the aduersaryes. But first hee sheeweth howe the health of the
hoast should be preserued: what regarde should be had that graine fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and victualles should be prouided for and kepte: howe the chiefe
Captaines should keepe the souldiours in quiet from sedition and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore:
howe warelye and cyrcumspectlye the armye shoulde be ledde,
when at any time it remoueth: howe to passe ryuers, and other daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
places. How greate consideration oughte to be whether they
should fight in skirmishe, or set battel? y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe Captaynes great care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse

order and araye that they be not easelye ouercome. Which thinges for
that they cannot be comprehended in fewe wordes, and the Author dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseth
of them at large in many Chapters, I referre the Readers to
the selfe same Author, who doth so perfectlye set forth such notable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uises
and pollicyes, such skilfulnes and knowledge, such prouidence &amp;
warenes, as ought to be in such a man, to whom the worthye honours
of so greate power and authoritie are ascribed, that vnto his fidelitye,
vertue, and manhoode (that I maye here vse the very wordes of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getius</hi>)
the defence of Cittyes, the lyues of the souldiours, the renowne
of the common wealth, may safely be committed. After these, he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
certaine generall rules of warre, and so endeth his third booke.</p>
            <p>In the fourth booke he treateth of the besieginge and defendinge of
Cittyes:<note place="margin">The 4. booke</note> wherein he first speaketh of the buildinge and fortefyinge of
the same: and what foresight should be if a Cittye be besieged, that it
suffer not famyne: what pollicy may be vsed, if water, salt, strings, or
cordes and suche like shoulde fayle in the Cittye. He reherseth also a
nomber of engines and much ordinaunce vsed in those dayes in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieginge
of Cittyes: the description whereof who so list to know more
at large, let him reade the tenth and eleuenth booke of <hi>Robertus Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turius.</hi>
Also he geueth certaine preceptes and rules of warres vppon
the sea: in which he sheweth what kinde of shippes were most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
and commodious for the purpose: and how dilligentlye the same
were made: in what monethes and seasons of the yeare timber should
be felled: he nameth and nombreth the windes: he sheweth when it is
good to sayle, &amp; when not: he speaketh of certayne signes and tokens,
whereby mariners maye foreknowe fayre weather or foule, calme or
<pb facs="tcp:19659:7"/>
tempest: then describing certaine armour and ordinaunce for shippes,
he briefelye teacheth howe to lye in waite, and also howe to ioyne open
battell on the sea: and thus endeth he his fourth and last booke of the
institutions of warre. In all whiche worke briefelye and plainlye is
contained, not onlye (as I saide before) a methode or compendious
waye, but also a perfect knowledge and arte of warre: to the which if
painefull dilligence and experience be ioyned,<note place="margin">Experience ioyned with knowledge, bri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth great thinges to passe.</note> what let shoulde be, but

recyted, but passing ouer all the residue for shortnes of time, two of the
chiefest may suffice.<note place="margin">

               <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who in short space subdued
the greatest part of the world, had alwayes the Poet <hi>Homer</hi> layd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <note place="margin">C. Iulius Caesar.</note> howe greatlye he was geeuen to this kinde of studye, it
doth most euidentlye appeare by such notable bookes as he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

a farre better and shorter waye to attaine to the name of a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye

to get knowledge by experience. For mans life being short and subiect
to manye casualtyes, oftentimees is cutte of before it can come to anye
such perfection as is requyred in an excellent man of warre: whereas
small experience with diligente readinge and perfecte learninge
of feates of ware, maye frame and make manye polliticke Captaynes
in a shorter space. I do not meane that knowledge withoute experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
can do anye great thinge at all: but beinge ioyned both together,
doubtles they maye be as able to bringe to passe as great and maruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

iuste and euen one with another. For a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fused and disordred

vse to runne, that with greater violence they may set vppon
their enemies, that with more haste when nede is, they may
take the more commodious places, or preuent their enemies
if they would doe the lyke: that, being made out for scowtes,
thei may more cherefully go forward, more redily retourne
&amp; more easely ouertake their enemies whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they flie. To lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
also the souldiour must be vsed, for iumping of ditches,
for passing depe places, whiche els might hinder them: that

vnarmed. For after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie of Rome was builded, vnto wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie

euen to the destructions of so mightie and great cities. No
man hath regarde as yet to restore againe to the footemen,
either their coarselettes or headpieces: whereby it comes to
passe that naked men in the forewarde in daunger euer of
wounding, haue greater mynde of flying then they haue of
fighting. What can an archer on foote do without harneis?
without head piece? which can not holde his bowe and buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keler
both together? What shall the standerd bearers doe
in battayle, aduauncing the ensigne with their lefte hande, &amp;
haue nothing to saue their heades or their brestes? Mary a
footeman perchaunce, whiche seldome doth exercise &amp; hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le

Howebeit, by dayly vse he might well enough away withal,
whiche, though it beare heauy thinges, yet neuer complay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.
But they, whiche wyll not take payne to carie auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t armoure
for their furniture, shall vnfurnyshed beare the
blowes awaye, and catche their deathes wounde. And that
whiche is a greater griefe, and more shamefull to be spoken
of, either become captiue, or betraye their common wealthe
by running away. So that eschewing exercise and laboure,
with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatest shame that can be, thei are slaine like beastes.
Wherefore was an hoste of footemen of our auncestours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foretyme
called a wall? but because the legions, besides
their tergettes armed with dartes or other shotte, made a

certaine it is that these often haue gotten the victory, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the spearemen before them called <hi>Hastati,</hi> haue bene slaine,
The auncient warriours had also amonge their footemen,
such as were called lighte harnessed men, as Slingers and
other with lighte Armoure, which chiefelye were placed in

were they very manye, because in retyring if necessitye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned,
they were succoured and receyued of those in the

There hath a custome continued almost to this oure tyme,

of the which kinde there be verye fewe weapons nowe

haue Shieldes or Tergettes, do chiefelye vse these Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
whiche they call <hi>Bebras:</hi> and of them they haue two or
three a peece. Moreouer we must know, that when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is tryed with Dartes, the souldiours must set their lefte
feete before, for so in throwing theyr dartes when they step
in with their right legge, the stroke is much more veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
But when the matter is come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pintch (as they terme it)

other cause there is why legions may be lessened: A souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
takes muche paine in a Legion, armoure is heauye and
burdenous, rewardes come sloulye, punishementes ryfe &amp;
sharpe, which thinges the most part to auoyde, if it mighte

These mens ordinaunces, these mens instructions, as

               <p>BUt for as muche, as in armies there bee many scholes
and exercises of cheualrie, whiche doe require cunning

which doe admitte and allowe the young souldiours, should
searche out diligently, and knowe in euery one the bignes of
the stature, the strengthe of the body, and the promptnes of

For the accompte of all the whole legion, whether it

Also the warding on the daye tyme, and the charges or offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in carying from place to place: amongest all the centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

none be charged or burdened more then is due and right, or
if any haue libertie graunted and are exempted. The names

When any man hath receiued a pasporte, and for how many

rounde about, one after an other, so that from the first bande
going forwarde in order by little and little hee came to the
tenth bande, and againe from thence he came backe agayne
through the reste to the firste bande: hauing better prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rement,
and his wages stil augmented. Therefore the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion
or chief captaine of the forewarde, after that he ruled
and gouerned all the bandes rounde about in course, by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
exercises and feates of armes: in the first bande he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
that rewarde, whereof redounded innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
to him out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole armie. Like as <hi>Primicerius,</hi>
or he that hath the chiefe authoritie in the principall office of
the ouerseers or other rulers, doth come to some honest and
gainefull preferrement in warfare: euen so the horsemen of
euery bande, doe courteously vse their owne companie with
good fellowe shippe: because the horsemen and footemen do
naturally vary &amp; disagree one with an other. Therefore by
this ioyning, and as it were linking together of the armie,
good agreement was kept and continued throughout al the
bandes, both of horsemen and footemen.</p>

               <p>MOreouer, an armie hath trumpettes, cornettes, and
shawmes. The trompetters doe call the souldiours
to battayle: and againe doe call them backe blowing
the retraite. The cornettes were an ornament to set foorthe
the whole armie, bothe in the marching forewarde toward
to the battaile, and also in the retiring from the fighte. As
often as these do blowe, not onely souldiours, but also stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdes,
are ready at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ounding of them to remoue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the souldiours marche forward alone to any
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:19659:33"/>
busines or skirmishes, the trumpetters doe blowe, and the
souldiours only do come together at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sound of the tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pets.
As often as the standerdes must be remoued, the blowers of
cornettes do sounde. But when they do fighte, both y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pettes
and the cornettes doe sounde together. Also <hi>Classicu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
is called that noyce whiche the trumpetters doe make with
the sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of a cornet. This is a notable signe of great power
and authoritie royal, because this is sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded when the prince,
chieftayne, or generall captaine is present, or els when a
souldiour for some hainous offence is put to death. For this
must nedes bee done by the statutes and lawes of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall:
but if the souldiours goe forth to kepe the watches, to
carie thinges from place to place, or to doe any woorke, or to
make a rode, at the sounde of the trumpettes they doe it, and
by the sounde of the same doe retire to the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe agayne. But
when the standerdes doe marche, or in marching when they
should staye, the blowers of the cornettes sounde to bothe
these. The whiche thing in dede for this cause is obserued &amp;
kept in all maner of exercises, skirmishes, rodes, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge
forwarde of the armie, that in the fighte the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
might more easely obeye: if the captaines should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
them, either to fight or to staye, to pursue, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire.
For this proofe is plaine that such things must be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised
at vacant time and leasure, whiche of necessite must bee

               <head>¶Of the exercise of souldiours. Chapiter .xxiij.</head>
               <p>THe appointing and administration of an armie, being
orderlye descrided, let vs returne to exercise againe:
whereof (as it is sayde already) <hi>Exercitus,</hi> that is
an hoste hathe deriued the name. The younge and newe
souldiours were exercised with al kinde of weapons &amp; feates
of chiualry, both in the morning and after noone. But the
olde beaten and expert souldiours, once a daye were exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in armes. For neither longe age, nor number of yeares,
doth teache the feates of armes, but the continuall vse &amp; stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb facs="tcp:19659:34"/>
of exercise: and a souldiour not exercised and trainde vp
in feates of warre, although hee hath beene neuer so longe
in wages, yet hee is alwayes but a younge begynner, and
altogether ignoraunt in handling his weapon, whiche on
the holye dayes is set abroade for to behoulde in the exercise.
Therefore not onely they, which were vnder the chiefe mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
did learne by daylye exercise the handlyng of armoure
and weapons, and the swiftenes and nimblenes of the body,
but also all the souldiours a lyke did exercise the same. For
swiftenes and agilitie of the bodye, and also the cunning
bothe to stryke the enemie and defende hym selfe, is chieflye
gotten by exercise and practise, especially if they fight neere
at hande with swordes. But this is more weightie and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
that they learne in their playing exercise to keape theyr
orders, and that in so great sturres and thronges, beinge
vsed to the lyke in these exercises, wherin they are firste trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and entered, they doe wayte vppon their owne banners
and ensignes, and that among the well trayned and experte
souldiours, there bee no erroure or disordre committed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in the common sorte there may bee very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
It is also very good that the younge souldiours bee
exercised with some poste or stake, where they maye learne
to stryke at the sydes, the legges, and heades, eyther with
the thruste, or with ryght downe strokes. Let them also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome
to leape and strike together: to vawte against their
shielde, as if they were dauncynge, and skypppe downe
againe: sometyme to runne forwarde skipping and leaping,
and fetchynge of gamboldes, sometyme to steppe awaye
quickelye, and leape backe agayne. Let them exercise also
to throwe dartes a farre of at the postes or stakes, that they
bothe maye bee more cunninge in castinge straighte, and
more nimble and quicke with the right hande. But the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and slyngers, dyd set vp some broome for a marke, or
bundels of shrubbes, or strawe, that standing sixe hundred
foote from the marke, oftentymes they might hitte it with
their arrowes, or with their stoones leuelled out of a slynge
staffe. Therefore, more boldely they did that in the battell
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19659:34"/>
whiche before they had exercised in sporte in the fielde. They
muste also at all tymes accustome them selues, that they
swynge the slynge, but once about the head onelye, when a
stone is caste out of it. And all the souldiours did vse with
one hande to caste stones of a pounde weighte, whiche exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
is thought more readie, because it needeth not a slinge.
They were also compelled alwaye and with continuall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
to caste dartes or leaden plummettes: in so muche that
for the horsemen in wynter season, large galeries were
couered with tyles or shingles, whiche are cliftes of woode:
or if they did fayle, with readde, flagges or stubble, or els
strawe: and also certayne large places made for the foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and couered in lyke maner: in the whiche in the tyme
of stormes, wyndes, or foule weather, the armie was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed
and exercised with armoure and weapons vnder
couert. But the other dayes in wynter, if snowe and rayne
dyd ceasse, they were compelled to exercise them abroade in
the fielde: leaste if this custome should be lefte of, the mindes
and also the bodyes of the souldiours myght bee weakened.
At is good also that they vse often to cutte downe woode,
to carye burdens, to leape ouer ditches, to swymme in the
Sea, or Ryuers, to walke a good rounde pace, or to runne
yea, although they bee loden with the weyght of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moure
&amp; other burthens: that daily labour in time of peace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
mighte not seeme harde, or paynefull in tyme of warre.
Therefore, lyke as the whole legion is exercised, euen so the
aydes oughte to bee exercised daylye. For lyke as a well
tryaned and exercised souldiour desires the battayle, euen
so the vnexperte and ignoraunt, dothe feare the same. Laste
of all wee muste knowe that in fyghte, vse and experience,
dothe auayle more then force. For if the teachynge to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
weapons doe ceasse, and cunnyng in feates of armes be
not regarded, then a countrey clowne is as good as the best
souldiour.</p>

thinges, and beleueth that he knoweth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which hee doth
not know. But the chiefest point of this warenes and heede
taking is: that it be kepte close vnto what places &amp; by what
wayes the armye should passe forth. For it is thought y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in al
vyages the thinge which muste be done, shoulde be not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen.
For this cause the olde men of warre haue had in their
Legions the badge or signe of <hi>Minotaurus,</hi> that as he was
sayd to be hidde in the innermost and most secrete place of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
maze or intricate place called <hi>Labyrinthus:</hi> euen so the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of the Captayne should be kept secrete and hidde. That
iourneye is taken in hand without feare, which the ennemye
doth not so much as once suspect: but because spyes sent out
on the other parte, do eyther see or suspecte which waye the
armye goeth, and manye times there wanteth not runnaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and traytours: it must be declared howe these beinge at
hande, may be preuented and resisted. The Captayne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
to marche forth with his armye, must sende most trustye
and fine witted men with the best tryed horses: which maye
searche the places throughe which they must take their ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neye,
before and behinde, on the righte hand and left hande,
least the ennemyes go about to set an ambushmente, and lye
in waite to deceiue them. But y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> searchers or spyes do worke
more safelye by night then by daye. For he, after a certaine
maner is a traytour to himselfe, whose spye or scoutewatch
maye be taken of his ennemyes. Therefore let the horseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
go first: after them the footemen, carriages, Archers, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and in the middest the waggons must be placed: so that
part of the light armed footemen, and light harnessed horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
do followe. For seldome as they do marche on, they are
inuaded before, but more often behinde. Also on the sydes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
carriages ought to be garded with a good company of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours.
For they that lye in waite, oftentimes with a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
course rushe into some other place of the armye, then
where they are suspected. This also is specially to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> part, to the which the ennemye is lykest to come,
may be fortifyed with the most choise horsemen, with lighte
<pb facs="tcp:19659:42"/>
armed men, and also with archers on foote set purposely to
withstand them. If so be that the ennemyes do assayle on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerye
syde, then euerye syde must be defended. But least so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
trouble should excedingly hurte them, the souldiours
are to be warned aforehande, that they be ready with mind
and courage, and that they haue theyr weapons in theyr ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
For sodaine chaunces which amase men most whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
are put to theyr pintche, are nothing fearefull, if they be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
for aforehande. The olde men of warre did most dilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlye
take heede least the souldiours in theyr fight should
be troubled by the pages sometime beinge hurt, sometimes
being in feare, and least archers throughe theyr crye should
be made afrayde: leaste that eyther beinge scattered farre
a sunder, or gathered togethered on heapes, they might let
their owne partye more then profite them, &amp; by reason ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
further the ennemyes. And therefore euen as the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
marche forth, so they also leade the carryages well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
vnder certaine ensignes. Finallye they did choise of
the verye pages (which they cal headpeece bearers) such as
were fit and cunninge by experience: whom they make as it
were Captaynes, ouer two hundred fletchers &amp; other yong
fellowes, and not aboue. Unto these they gaue banners or
flagges, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they might know to which ensignes they oughte
to gather their carryages together. But the fightinge men
are deuided from the carriages a preatye space, least beinge
thrust thicke together while the armye is in marchinge for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde,
they may be hurt in fight. As the places do differ, so
the maner of defence should be altered. For in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> open fieldes
horseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vse to assault the armye, rather then footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But
in places full of woods, hilles, or fennes, footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are more
to be dreade. This also muste be auoyded, least y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> while one
sort make to much hast another sort through negligence go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

make their inuasion there, where the armye is slender.</p>
               <p>Therefore the most expert Captaynes of the field, the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
or the Tribunes must be set before, whiche maye staye
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19659:42"/>
them that go to faste, and constrayne them to make hast that
go to slowlye: for they that go a greate waye before, if a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
inuasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come, do not so much couet to retyre, as to flie.
But they that be last, being left behinde of their owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye,
what with the violence of the ennemyes and theyr
owne dispayring, are straight waye ouercome. We must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
know, that the ennemyes do priuilye laye ambushmentes
in such places as they perceyue meete for them: or els do as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle
them with open battaile. But least anye priuye places
may do hurte, that the dilligence of the Captayne prouideth
for, whose dutye it is to searche euery thing before hand. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the ambushe beinge perceyued, if it be compassed aboute
pollitikelye, it doth suffer more perill and daunger, then it
went about to do. But if an open power be prepared in the
mountaines, the higher places must be taken vp with aydes
sent before: to the entent that when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ennemyes shal come,
he maye be on the lower grounde, and then he dare not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
to withstande, when he seeth armed men as wel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, as aboue his head. If so be that the wayes be nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,
and not safe enoughe, yet it is better that souldiours
go before, with hatchets and axes, and with labour to make
the wayes open and plaine, then in neuer so good a waye to
suffer perill and daunger. Moreouer we ought to know the
vsuall trade of oure ennemyes, whether by nighte, or in the
dawning of the daye, or in the time of repaste, their custome
is to assayle theyr wearyed ennemyes: and to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THus hauing described the maner how an armie should
be ordred in the iourney, it seemeth good next to come
vnto the orderinge of the tentes, wherein wee muste
remayne. For in tyme of warre, a fortified or walled citie is
<pb facs="tcp:19659:44"/>
not alwayes ready in the waye to abyde at, and it is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse
poincte aud very daungerous, that they shoulde staye
or abyde euery where without any munition or forte: when
as the souldiours being busied to take their meate, or scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
abroade to doe anye thinge pertayning to their charge:
it is an easie matter to fynde out wyles to entrappe them
or euer they bee aware. Finally, the darkenes of nyghte, the
necessitie of sleape, the scatteringe of the horses when they
feede, doe minister occasion to sodayne inuasions. In pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
a campe, it is not inough to chose a good place: except
it be suche one that an other better then it can not be founde,
least wee, forsakyng the better place, &amp; our enemies takyng
it to their vse, wee may chaunce to smarte for it. Wee muste
also take heede in Sommer, least either corrupte water be
nyghe the armie, or holsome water be farre of: In Wynter
least wee lacke store of forage, or plentie of woode nowe and
then: leaste the fielde wherein wee muste abyde nowe and
then bee ouerflowed with sodayne stormes, leaste it bee pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in steepe downe and roughe places, and suche as if the
enemies shoulde besiege vs, wee myghte hardely get forth:
leaste it bee within the reache of oure ennemies arrowes,
when they caste them from hyghe places ouer oure heades.
The whiche thinges being foreseene warely and dilygently
as they ought to be, thou shalt make the campe, either foure
square, or rounde, or three cornered, or els longewayes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the necessitie of the place. For the fashion or forme
is not preiudiciall to any commoditie. Neuerthelesse, those
campes are thought fayrest, whiche are longer by the thirde
parte, then they are broade. But they that vewe and suruay
the fielde, ought so to measure euery foote thereof, that the
armie maye bee compacted accordinge to the numbre of the
same. For if the campe be narrowe, they in the forefronte
hemme it in to straightly. And if it be to broade, they scatter
farther then they should doe. There be three wayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they saye a campe may be fortified. The first they saye, is
some what sleight, seruing them one night onely whyle they
are in their iourney, that is to digge vp turues and to laye
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19659:44"/>
them in order rounde about the campe vppon heapes, and
aboue them in good order to make a pale. I meane to sette
stakes there, or briers and brembles. A turfe it cut of earth,
that conteineth both the grasse, the rootes &amp; the earth also,
and is cut out of the ground with an Iron spade or such like,
it is made halfe a foote deepe, a foote broade, a foote and a
halfe long. If it be so that the grounde be so sandy that after
the fashion of a bricke, a turfe can not be cut vp, then euerye
man must set to his helping hand to the making of a ditche,
whiche must be fiue foote broade and three foote deepe, in the
inner side whereof a ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pire must be raised: so that the armie
may take their rest without feare. But if the campe remaine
in one place, then whether it be sommer, or winter, if so be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
enemie be at hande, it must with greater care and labour be
fortified: for euery hundred haue their stations appointed out
by the captaines and generals of the field, whiche they take

captaine and his companie. Other tentes are pitched for
the tribunes, vnto whome water, woode, forage, are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
by certayne companies assigned to those charges.
Then accordinge to their degree, are places appointed in
the campe for the legions, aides, horsemen, and footemen,
wherein they may pitche their pauilio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: and there be chosen
of euery hundred foure horsemen and foure footemen, which
doe keape the watches by nighte. And for as muche as it
semed vnpossible, or a very harde thing, in the watche tower
for euery one to continewe watching all the whole nighte:
therefore the watches are deuided by an howre glasse into
foure partes, that it shoulde bee neede for noone to watche
more then three howres in the night. The watches are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonne
by a trompetter, and after the howres be ended, they
are called awaye agayne by a blower of a horne. But for all
this, the tribunes doe choose and pyke out fitte and tried
men, whiche maye goe aboute the watches, and shewe if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
faulte maye appeare, whome they call <hi>Circuitores,</hi>
that is to say searchers of the watche. Nowe are these made
a certayne degree in the warres, and are called <hi>Circitores,</hi>
that is to saye, officers going aboute to see good rule in the
nyghte. Yet we muste knowe that the horsemen ought to
watche without the trenche and bulwarke. But euery daye
tyme, after the campe bee pitchte, they doe vse to take order
for warding and posthorses, some in the morninge, some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
noone, for weareing of the men and horses. Among the
chiefe and speciall pointes, it behoueth the captayne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hee remayne in the campe or in a citie, to prouide that
feeding for the cattell, conueying of grayne &amp; other kindes,
the cariage of water, woode, and forage bee made assured
and without daunger, from the inuasion of their ennemies.
Whiche thynge otherwyse can not come to passe, excepte in
meete and conuenient places, by whiche the prouision of
oure victualles muste passe, there bee sette and disposed
places of refuge and succoure: whether they bee cities or

is oftentimes to debate &amp; entreate of his owne power,
and also if his enemies power, taking vnto him throughout
all his armie experte and cunninge men of warre, and also
wyse and discrete men, that (all flatterie set a part) which is
very hurtefull, hee maye knowe whether hee or his enemies
haue the greater number of fighting men: whether his men
or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies be better armed, &amp; furnished with artillerie,
whiche are moste exercised, and which in greatest daungers
<pb facs="tcp:19659:46"/>
are more valiaunt. He must also enquire whether part haue
better horsemen, and whether better footeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He must also
knowe that the strengthe of the armie doth chiefly consiste in
the footemen: and among the horsemen hee must see whiche
were beste with the launce, and whiche with the bowe, who
haue the best armoure, the best horses: last of al, whether the
places in whiche they must fighte, be more commodious for
the enemies then for them selues. For if we delite in an hoste
of horsemen, we must desire the playne fieldes: if in an hoste
of footemen, we must chose suche places, as be narrowe and
streight, enuironed and stopped with ditches, marisses, and
fennes: or w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> trees, &amp; sometime hillie places: for the whiche
armie, store of victuall must be had, rather to muche then to
little. For hunger (as men say) dothe pinche inwardly, and
oftentimes doth ouer comme without di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>te of swoorde. But
chiefly he must consulte and deliberate, whether it bee more
profitable to prolong the vrgent necessitie of battaile, or to
fight it out of hande. For sometime the aduersarie doth hope
that the voiage may soone be ended: and if it may be delayed
and lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, either the armie is famished for lacke of victuals,
or is called away to their owne, through the loue and desire
that they haue thereof: or els hauing done nothing worthy of
prayse, is compelled to departe through dispaire Then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
discouraged with paines and wearines doe forsake him:
some betraye him, and some yelde them selues to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
For in aduersitie faithfulnes is rare, and he that came
welthie, nowe beginnes to be bare and neady. It is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
also to knowe what maner of man the aduersary is, what
his companions are and leaders, whether they be rashe and
hastie, or ware and circumspect, whether they bee hardy or
feareful: cunning in the feates of warre, or such as are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te
to fight at all aduenture: what valiaunt people haue foughte
with them, what cowardly and fearefull: of what trustines
our aydes be, and of what force: what courage his armie is
of, and what also our hoste hath: and whiche parte doth more
hope for the victorie, for by suche cogitations manhoode is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19659:46"/>
either encreased or diminished. By the encouraging of the
captaine, euen those whiche despaire are muche boldened, &amp;
if hee bee not feareful, they waxe couragious, if he hath done
any valiaunt acte, either by laying wayte, or by other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
offered: if thinges goe not well, but fall out vnluckelye
with their enemies: if he can vanquishe any of his enemies,
either suche as bee weaker, or not so well armed. But you
must take diligent hede that you bring not foorth the armie
to fight at any tyme, if it be doubtfull or fearefull. It is very
necessary to knowe whether you haue newe souldiours or
olde. Whether they haue bene some little time in warres, or
haue continued a good whyle in peace and quietnes: for they
are to bee esteamed as younge souldiours whiche haue not
fought a long season. But when the legions, aides or horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
doe come from sundrie places to vs, a noble and worthy
captaine oughte to exercise euery company seuerally in all
kinde of weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and artillerie by the tribunes or marishals
thereto appointed, whose diligence hee hathe tried before:
and after warde shall exercise them gathered together into
one place, as though they should fighte in open battaile. Hee
him selfe shall often trie and proue what cunning they haue,
what force, howe they agree together, whether they can be
readie at the sound or blowing of the trumpettes, at the she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
of the ensignes, yea, &amp; at euery becke and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
If they doe amisse in any poinct, they must be exercised
and enstructed, vntil they be cunning and experte. Although
they maye bee fully enstructed in runninge in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

other exercise: in shootinge, in throwyng dartes, in settinge
the armye in ordre: yet they muste not rashely bee broughte
to the open or sette battayle vppon euerye lyght occasion,
but they muste fyrste bee entered and acquainted with litle
encounters. Therefore the paynefull, discrete and wyse

perceiue his enemie to bee the better, let hym auoyde the ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

firste, whiche if they haue ill successe, it doth small harme:
if they prosper well, it doth muche auayle. It is the pointe
of a good captayne to minister and breede causes of discorde
amongest th ennemies. For no nation though it bee very
little, can quickely be destroyed of the enemies, except it bee
consumed with priuate dissensions and hatred within it self.
For ciuile discorde and hatred is to hastie and rashe in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the destruction of the enemies, and to careles and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heedy
of foreseing of their owne defence and safetie. And in
this enterpryse, this one thinge muste bee foretolde, that no
man shoulde dispayre of the perfourminge of those thinges
whiche haue bene done before. But some man may saye that
no man in many yeares space doth enuironne an army which
is pitched, in a place compassed about with a ditche, a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
or trenche. I aunsweare hym thus, that if this heede
were taken the sodaine inuasion of enemies, neither by night
nor daye, coulde doe any hurte at al. The <hi>Persians</hi> following
the example of the Romaines, doe pitche their campes with
diches drawen about: and for as muche as all places in a
manner be sandie, they fill sackes, whiche they caried empty
with earth very dustie and drie (which in those places is dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged)
and with an heape of them they doe make a rampire. Al
the barbarous people hauing their cartes ioyned together
in a rounde compasse, after the manner of a rampire, do passe
ouer the nightes quietly, and out of daunger of them that do
inuade them. And doe we feare that we can not learne those
thinges whiche others haue learned of vs? These thinges
must be learned by experience, and also by reading of suche
thinges as before tyme were obserued: but being left of for
a great whyle, no man hath sought them out, because that
as long as peace flourished, the necessitie of warre was far
out of mynde. But least it may seeme impossible to renewe
and restore the knowledge of marshall affayres, being long
intermitted and decayed for lacke of exercise, examples may

the higher part doth driue them back that withstande, with

may be behinde vs: and (if it may be possible) that they maye

profite very much. If they be ordred vnskilfully, if they were
neuer so good warriours, yet with ill setting in araye, they

come to fight with dinte of swoordes, and shorte dartes, that
is (as they saye commonly) to hande strokes they endure and
heare of, the brunte of all the battaile. In the fifthe raye or
battayle, sometyme were planted field peeces, and shooters
in crossebowes, slingers both with the slyngestaffe, and with
the hande. They be called <hi>Fundibulatores,</hi> whiche caste sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

long: to the whiche through the myddes is bounde a slinge

be suche as caste stones with slynges made of flaxe, threede,

throwe stones, fetching their arme rounde about their head.
They that had no shieldes, did fight in this order, whether

and a foure cornered armye: as now a dayes alwayes
almost they vse to fight: but this kinde of fight, they that be
skilfull and expert in armes, do not iudge to be best: because
that when the battell is stretched forthe in lengthe, an euen
plaine grounde is not alwayes in the waye nighe hand and
readye, and if sometime there be anye emptye or hollowe
place, or bowing or crouking in the middle part, in that part
oftentimes the foreranke is broken. Moreouer if the enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye
do passe you in multitude, hee doth compasse eyther the
righte or the lefte winge on the sydes: in the which there is
great daunger, except you haue aboue your ordinarye nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which maye staye and put backe the ennemye. He onlye
ought to ioyne battell after this sort, which hath both mo in
nomber, and more valiant fighting men: that he maye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
his ennemye of both the winges, and enclose him as it
were within his owne armye. The seconde kinde of fighte is
common, which is better then anye other. In which if you
wyll appointe a fewe stoute and couragious men in a place
conueniente, although you be troubled with multitude and
manhoode of your ennemyes: yet maye you easelye winne
the victorye. The maner of this fight is that when the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telles
set in araye do ioyne together, then shall you seperate
the lefte winge a good waye of, from the righte winge of
your aduersarye, that no dartes or arrowes maye come as
farre as it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:19659:55"/>But you shall ioyne your right wing to his left winge: and
there first beginne you the battaile: so that you do assaulte &amp;
compasse about the left syde of it, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which you shall ioyne
your selfe, with the best footemen and most tryed horsemen:
and that you maye come to the backes of the ennemyes, by
thrusting them out of place an ouerrunning them. If so be
that you once beginne to make your ennemyes to recoile:

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
you shal obtaine most certaine victorye: and that part of
your armye which you remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your ennemye, shal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
in safety. But in this kinde of fighting the battel is
ordered after the similitude of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> letter <hi>A.</hi> or els the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters
squyre. If so be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the aduersary do the same before

souldiours, as well horseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as footemen: which
before I sayde must be set behinde the battaile: and so shall
you withstand your aduersarye with great force &amp; strength,
that you be not driuen backe with crafte and pollicye. The
thirde kind of fight is like vnto the seconde, but in this point
it is the worser: because you beginne with your left winge,
to fight with your ennemyes right winge. For the inuasion
is very weake, &amp; they that fight in the left winge with much
difficultye do assault their ennemyes openlye. The which I
will more plainelye declare. If you shall at anye time haue
your left winge a good deale the stronger, then ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the most valiant horsemen and footemen: and in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicte
bende y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same first to the right winge of the ennemyes,
and as much as is possible, make hast to driue backe and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe
the right syde of your aduersarye. But seperate the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parte of your armye in which you knowe that you haue
the worst fighting men, a good waye of from his left wing,
that it maye not be inuaded with swordes, or that the dartes
come vnto it. In this kinde of fight you must take heede least
your crosse battel be beaten throughe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wedge or sharpe
battell of your ennemyes. But by this way in one case ye shal
fight profitablye, if your aduersaryes righte winge be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
and your lefte winge a great deale the stronger. The
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19659:55"/>
fourth kinde of fight is such: when as you haue set your bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
in arraye, foure or fyue hundred pases before they come
to the ennemye, sodenly when he lookes for no suche thinge,
you must couragiouslye set forward both your winges: that
you maye on both his winges put the ennemye to flight, and
so soner attaine y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victorye. But this kinde of fight although
it do quickely ouercome, if it shall set forth verye expert and
valiant souldiours, yet it is full of daunger, because hee that
fighteth in such wyse is constrayned to leaue his middle bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
naked, and to deuide his armye into two partes. And if
the ennemye be not ouercome at the first brunte, he hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde
occasion, whereby he may both set vppon the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
deuided, and the middle battel also left withoute ayde &amp;
succour. The fifte kinde of fight is like to the fourth. But
it hath this one thinge more, for because it doth set lighte ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
men and archers before the first battell: that they may
resist the inuasion of ennemyes, and let them for breaking in:
for so doth hee set vppon the left winge of the ennemye wyth
his right wing, and with his owne left wing the right wing
of the ennemye. If so be that he canne put the ennemyes to
flight, he doth straight way winne the fielde: if not, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
battaile is in no ieopardie, because it is defended of the
light armed men and archers. The sixt kinde of fight is the
best of all, and in a maner like the second: which they do vse
that dispayre or mistrust of the nomber of theyr owne souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
and also of their manhoode. And if they do sette them
well in araye and good order, althoughe it be with a small
nomber, they do alwayes get the victorye. For when as the
battell set in araye doth approche and come to thennemyes,
ioyne you your righte winge vnto the lefte winge of thenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes,
and with the most tryed horsemen and swiftest foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
there begin to fight. But remoue and take awaye the
other syde of the armye, a great waye from the right syde of
your ennemye, and stretch it out a length as it were a spitte
or a darte. For if you shall beginne to beate the lefte part of
his armye, both of the sydes and behind, without doubt you
shall put them to flighte. But thaduersarye cannot succour
<pb facs="tcp:19659:56"/>
his y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> be in daunger, neither with his right winge, nor w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his
middle battell: because your battell is stretched forth &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
it selfe al in length, after the fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; similitude of the
letter .I. &amp; goeth a great way of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nemyes: w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the which
kinde many times they bicker in their vyages. The .7. kinde
of fight is, which through y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> helpe &amp; benefit of the place, doth
helpe him y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> doth fight. In this kinde also you may w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>stand &amp;
match wyth your aduersary, both wyth a small nomber, &amp;
also with lesse valiant souldiours, if you haue on one syde an
hill, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sea, or a ryuer, or a lake, or a Cittye, or fennes, or
rockes &amp; stiepe downe places: by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which the ennemyes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come vnto, &amp; set y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> residue of your armie in straight battel
raye. But in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> winge which hath no defence, you must set al
your horsemen &amp; Gu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners. Then with more safetye you shal
encounter w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ennemye, after your owne will &amp; pleasure:
because of one part y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of the place doth defende you, of
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> other part almost a double stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of horseme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is set. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding
this thing ought to be obserued, which is most
necessary: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whether you would fight, you right winge w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
his left wing, there set the valiant men: or whether your left
with his right wing, there place y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stoutest men: or whether
you would make a wedge or sharpe battell in the middest, by
the which you might breake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> battel rayes of your enemies:
in the same wedge you must ordaine &amp; set the most experte &amp;
cunning souldiours. For the victory is wont to be atchieued
by a few. The matter doth altogether rest in this, that by a
wyse and discreete Captaine, chosen men be set in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which by skill are thought most fit and commmodious.</p>

is to be auoyded, that the ennemyes in no wyse perceyue of

more daungerous, then if they whiche lye in the ambushe
should meete them that pursue them, vnaduisedly or before
they haue prepared themselues. This is the time wherein
ambushmentes or trappes conuenientlye are layed, because
there is greater boldnes and lesse care against them that are
in flying. For of necessity, of greater securitye and lesse care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
ensueth greater perill and daunger. Ennemies are
wont to come sodainlye vppon such as are vnprepared, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge
their meate, wearye in theyr iourneye, feedinge their
horses, and suspectinge no suche thing at all. Which thinge
both we our selues must avoyde, and in such maner of occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we must annoye our ennemye. For neyther manhoode,

for the purpose. Whensoeuer any armye or companye doth
retyre, this subtiltye is commonlye vsed. A fewe horsemen
do followe after with a straight iourney: a stronge power is

partyes, as well the one as the other to lye in waite. For he
that goeth before, doth leaue ambushmentes as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
him in valleys meete for the purpose, or mountaynes

               <p>For in such like case, he is thought to be more valiaunt, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
aduersitye doth not discourage. Therefore let him first take
the spoyles of the ennemyes slaine, and as they do terme it,

let him gather the field, let him first reioyce and triumph w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
a shoute and the trumpettes. By this boldnes and confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
he shall make the ennemyes afrayde: so shall he encrease the
courage of his owne men, and go away as though he were a
conqueroure. If so be that by any chaunce all the armye be
discomfited in the battell with great losse of men, yet manye
haue had good lucke in recouering and rescuing that which
was lost, and therfore such remedye in the like distresse must
be soughte. Therefore a wyse and cyrcumspect Captayne,
ought in open or set battel, to fight so aduisedly and warely,
that if any thing should happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwyse then wel, through
mutability of warres, and mans fraile condition, he might
deliuer him &amp; his ouercome souldiours without greate losse
or displeasure. For if hilles be nighe, if anye defence be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
their backes: if, althoughe the other go away, all the
most valiant stande stoutely to it, they shall saue themselues
and theyr owne companye. Oftentimes and armye now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited,
if it can recouer strength againe, doth slea them y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
pursue, dispersed &amp; scattered abroad out of order. For they
which reioyce and aduaunce themselues, are neuer in more
daunger, then when from sodaine fiercenes &amp; boldnes they
are chaunged into sodaine feare. But what successe soeuer
follow, they must be gathered together that remayne aliue,
and must be encouraged with meete exhortations, and cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
&amp; comforted by repayring of their armour. Then must
there be newe choice had of freshe souldiours, and new aydes
must be sought for: and then a freshe assault &amp; inuasion must
be made vpon the conquerours if occasion serue, by some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uye
lying in waite: for this is verye good &amp; profitable: and so
boldnes may be recouered againe. Neyther ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> opportunity
