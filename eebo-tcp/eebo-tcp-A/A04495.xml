            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OVr lawes disable those, that are vnder <hi>Couert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baron,</hi> from dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing by Will and Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any temporall estate. But no law prohibiteth any possessor of morall and spirituall riches, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part them vnto others, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in life by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or in death by bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<pb facs="tcp:5883:3"/>
The reason is, for that corruptible riches, euen to those who haue capacity of alienating them, bring onely a ciuill propriety, but no morall &amp; vertous influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the wel dispensing, or bestowing them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as vertue and grace haue power beyond all empeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of sex or other debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to enable and instruct the possessor to employ the same vnquestionably for the inward inriching of others.</p>
            <p>This truly rich bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, taking that care for the prouiding an euerlasting portion for her hoped issue,
<pb facs="tcp:5883:3"/>
which too many parents bend wholly vpon earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inheritance, by her death already hath giuen vnto her Testament that life and strength, whereof the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaketh, <hi>A Testament is of force after death</hi>:<note place="margin">Heb. 9, 17.</note> Now remained the other validitie &amp; priuilege of a Testament, that it be enacted in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and inuiolable <hi>Record.</hi> Which in this was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not so much for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of the chiefe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Legatary, as for the benefit of all those, who, by the common kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of Christianity, may
<pb facs="tcp:5883:4"/>
claime their portion in this Legacy, left <hi>in pios vsus</hi>; whereout, whosoeuer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, yet leaueth no whit the lesse for others in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder.</p>
            <p>Wherefore vpon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry first view, I willingly not onely subscribed my <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probat</hi> for the registering this <hi>Will,</hi> among the most publique Monuments, (the rather worthy, because pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the weaker sex) but also, as bound to do right vnto knowne vertue, vndertooke the care of the publication thereof, my selfe hauing heretofore bin
<pb facs="tcp:5883:4"/>
no stranger to the Testators education and eminent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Whereof, I here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held reflection cleere e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, though perhaps not so particularly euident to those that take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them onely by this Abstract.</p>
            <p>In her zealous affection to the holy Ministry, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dedicating, (if by sex ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable) her yet scarce bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding first fruits, I saw the lineaments of her owne parentage: She being the onely off-spring deriued from a reuerend Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, Doctor <hi>Chaderton,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:5883:5"/>
sometime Master of <hi>Queens Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and publique <hi>Professor</hi> of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity</hi> in that <hi>Vniuersitie,</hi> afterward Lord <hi>Bishop,</hi> first of <hi>Chester,</hi> and thence of <hi>Lincolne:</hi> by and vnder whom shee was from her tender yeeres care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully nurtured, as in those accomplishments of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Languages, Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and some Arts, so prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in studies of piety. And thus <hi>hauing from a</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.15, 16</note> 
               <hi>childe knowne the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which made her wife vnto saluation through faith in Christ,</hi> how well she <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb facs="tcp:5883:5"/>
in those things, which shee had learned,</hi> appeareth, as otherwise to those that knew her, so here to all by the frequent and pertinent application of them in these instructions.</p>
            <p>In her prosecution of the duty of obedience vnto Parents I view the deepe impression, long since, when shee was not aboue six yeeres old, made in her minde by the last words of her owne Mother, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her vpon her blessing to shew all obedience and reuerence to her Father (Sir <hi>Richard Brooke)</hi> and to her
<pb facs="tcp:5883:6"/>
reuerend Grandfather.</p>
            <p>In the whole course of her pen, I obserue her piety and humility: these her lines scarce shewing one sparke of the elementary fire of her secular learning: this her candle being rather lighted from the lampe of the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>In her commission of the office of an <hi>Ouerseer</hi> to her husband, what eies cannot behold the flames of her true and vnspotted loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her dearest, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed her about the space of six yeeres and a halfe, being all that while both an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall
<pb facs="tcp:5883:6"/>
witnesse of her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and an happy partner of those blessings both transitory and spirituall, wherewith shee was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed.</p>
            <p>Beside the domestique cares pertaining to a wife, the former part of those yeeres were imployed by her in the studies of mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and history, the better by the helpe of forraine languages, not without a taste and faculty in Poetry: Wherein some essay shee hath left, ingenious, but chaste and modest like the Author. Of all which
<pb facs="tcp:5883:7"/>
knowledge shee was very sparing in her discourses, as possessing it rather to hide, than to boast of.</p>
            <p>Among those her emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies deseruing our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, was her owne most ready memory, enabling her vpon the first rehearsall to repeat aboue forty lines in English or Latine: a gift the more happy by her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of it in carrying away an entire Sermon, so that shee could (almost fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the steps of the words, or phrase) write it downe in her Chamber.</p>
            <p>The latter yeeres of her
<pb facs="tcp:5883:7"/>
life shee addicted to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther studies than Diuinity, whereof some imperfect notes remaine, but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally this small Treatise found in her Deske vnfini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, by reason either of some troubles befalling her about a moneth before her end, or of preuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by mis-reckoning the time of her going with this her first (now also last) Childe: which Treatise, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for her childe, shee so leaving, recommended the same to her husband by her letter to him, written and subscribed by her owne
<pb facs="tcp:5883:8"/>
hand, as hereafter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
            <p>The many blessings, shee enioyed, were not without some seasoning of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which, by the good vse shee made of them, bred in her a constant temper of patience, and more than womanly fortitude: especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in her latter time, when as the course of her life was a perpetuall meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of death, amounting al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to a propheticall sense of her dissolution, euen then when she had not fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the 27. yeere of her age, nor was oppressed by
<pb facs="tcp:5883:8"/>
any disease, or danger, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the common lot of child-birth, within some moneths approaching. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly when she first felt her selfe quicke with childe (as then trauelling with death it selfe) shee secretly tooke order for the buying a new winding sheet: thus preparing and consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her selfe to him, who rested in <hi>a new Sepulcher wherein was neuer man yet layd.</hi> And about that time, vndauntedly looking death in the face, priuatly in her Closet betweene God and her, shee wrote these pious
<pb facs="tcp:5883:9"/>
Meditations; whereof her selfe strangely speaketh to her owne bowels in this manner, <hi>It may seeme strange to thee to receiue these lines from a mother, that died when thou wert borne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> 12. 1622. In Cambridge-shire shee was made a mother of a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whom shortly after, being baptized and brought vnto her, shee blessed, and gaue God thankes that her selfe had liued to see it a Christian: and then instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called for her winding sheet to bee brought forth and laied vpon her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5883:9"/>
So hauing patiently borne for some nine daies a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent feuer, &amp; giuing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable testimony of her godly resolution, she ended her prayers, speech, and life together, rendring her soule into the hand of her Redeemer, and leauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde her vnto the world a sweet perfume of good name, and to her onely childe (besides a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent inheritance) this Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuell, being a deputed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for instruction, and for solace a twinne-like sister, issuing from the same Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and seeing the light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

the same time.</p>
            <p>Which composure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it commeth forth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect from the pen, doth the more expect to bee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and made vp by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise and execution.</p>

            <opener>TO MY TRVLY louing, and most dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loued Husband, <hi>Tourell Iocelin.</hi>
            </opener>
            <p>MINE owne deare loue, I no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued an hope, that I should bee made a mother by thee, but with it entred the consideration of a
<pb facs="tcp:5883:11"/>
mothers duty, and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after followed the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of danger that might preuent mee from executing that care I so exceedingly desired, I meane in religious trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our Childe. And in truth death appearing in this shape, was doubly terrible vnto mee. First, in respect of the painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of that kinde of death, and next of the losse my little one should have in wanting me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5883:11"/>
But I thanke God, these feares were cured with the remembrance that all things worke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the best to those that loue God, and a certaine assurance that hee will giue me pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence according to my paine.</p>
            <p>Yet still I thought there was some good office I might doe for my Childe more than only to bring it forth (though it should please God to take mee)
<pb facs="tcp:5883:12"/>
when I considered our frailty, our apt inclination to sin, the Deuils subtiltie, and the worlds deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, against these how much desired I to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it? But still it came into my minde that death might depriue me of time if I should neglect the present. I knew not what to doe: I thought of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but then mine owne weaknes appeared so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly, that I was asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and durst not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb facs="tcp:5883:12"/>
it. But when I could find no other means to expresse my motherly zeale, I encouraged my selfe with these reasons.</p>
            <p>First, that I wrote to a Childe, and though I were but a woman, yet to a childs iudgement, what I vnderstood might serue for a foundation to a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter learning.</p>
            <p>Againe, I considered it was to my owne, and in priuate sort, and my loue to my owne might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
<pb facs="tcp:5883:13"/>
my errours.</p>
            <p>And lastly, but chiefly, I comforted my selfe, that my intent was good, and that I was well assured God is the prosperer of good purposes.</p>
            <p>Thus resolued, I writ this ensuing Letter to our little one, to whom I could not finde a fitter hand to conuey it than thine owne, which maist with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity see the performance of this my little legacy, of which my Childe is Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor.</p>

And (deare loue) as thou must be the ouerseer, for Gods sake, when it shal faile in duty to God, or to the world, let not thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence winke at such folly, but seuerely correct it: and that thy trouble may bee little when it comes to yeeres, take the more care when it is young. First, in prouiding it a nurse: O make choise, not so much for her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, as for her milde and honest disposition:
<pb facs="tcp:5883:14"/>
Likewise if the child be to remain long abroad after waining, as neere as may be, chuse a house where it may not learne to sweare, or speak scurrilous words.</p>
            <p>I know I may be thought too scrupulous in this: but I am sure thou shalt finde it a hard matter to breake a childe of that it learnes so young. It will be a great while ere it will bee thought old enough to bee beaten for euill words, and by that time it will bee so
<pb facs="tcp:5883:14"/>
perfect in imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that blowes will not mend it. And when some charitable body reproues or corrects it for these faults, let no body pitty it with the losse of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Next, good sweet heart, keepe it not from schoole, but let it learne betimes: if it be a son, I doubt not but thou wilt dedicate it to the Lord as his Minister, if he wil please of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to giue him grace and
<pb facs="tcp:5883:15"/>
capacity for that great work. If it be a daughter, I hope my mother <hi>Brook</hi> (if thou desirest her) will take it among hers, and let them all learne one lesson.</p>
            <p>I desire her bringing vp may bee learning the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as my sisters doe, good houswifery, writing, and good workes: other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a woman needs not: though I admire it in those whom God hath blest with discretion, yet I desired not much in
<pb facs="tcp:5883:15"/>
my owne, hauing seene that sometimes women haue greater portions of learning, than wisdome, which is of no better vse to them than a maine saile to a flye-boat, which runs in vnder water. But where learning and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome meet in a vertuous disposed woman, she is the fittest closet for all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Shee is like a well-ballanced ship that may beare all her saile. Shee is-Indeed, I should but shame
<pb facs="tcp:5883:16"/>
my selfe, if I should goe about to praise her more.</p>
            <p>But, my deare, though she have all this in her, she will hardly make a poore mans wife: Yet I leave it to thy will. If thou desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest a learned daughter, I pray God giue her a wife and religious heart, that she may vse it to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thy comfort, and her owne saluation.</p>
            <p>But how soeuer thou dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posest of her education, I pray thee labour by all
<pb facs="tcp:5883:16"/>
meanes to teach her true humility, though I much desire it may be as humble if it bee a son as a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet in a daughter I more feare that vice; Pride being now rather accounted a vertue in our sex worthy praise, than a vice fit for reproofe.</p>
            <p>Many Parents reade lectures of it to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren how necessary it is, and they haue principles that must not bee disputed against. As first, looke how
<pb facs="tcp:5883:17"/>
much you esteeme your selfe, others wil esteeme of you. Again, what you giue to others, you derogate from your selfe. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more of these kinds. I haue heard men accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wise that haue main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this kinde of pride vnder the name of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous knowing or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing themselues: But I am sure that hee that truly knowes himself shall know so much euill by himselfe, that hee shall
<pb facs="tcp:5883:17"/>
haue small reason to think himselfe better than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man.</p>
            <p>Dearest, I am so feareful to bring thee a proud high minded child, that, though I know thy care will need no spur, yet I cannot but desire thee to double thy watchfulnesse ouer this vice, it is such a crafty insinuating deuill, it will enter little children in the likenesse of wit, with which their parents are delighted, and that is
<pb facs="tcp:5883:18"/>
sweet nourishment to it.</p>
            <p>I pray thee deare heart, delight not to haue a bold childe: modesty &amp; humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie are the sweetest ground-works of all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Let not thy seruants giue it any other title than the Christen-name, till it haue discretion to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how to respect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>And I pray thee be not profuse in the expence of clothes vpon it. Mee thinkes it is a vaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb facs="tcp:5883:18"/>
in parents to bestow that cost vpon one childe which would serue two or three. If they haue not children enow of their owne to imploy so much cost vpon, <hi>Pauper vbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queiacet.</hi>

            <p>Thus, Deare, thou seest my beleefe, if thou canst teach thy little one humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it must needs make thee a glad father.</p>
            <p>But I know thou won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest by this time what the cause should bee that
<pb facs="tcp:5883:19"/>
we two continually vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clasping our hearts one to the other, I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue this to writing. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou thinkest thus, deare, remember how grieuous it was to thee but to heare mee say, I may die, and thou wilt confesse this would haue beene an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant discourse to thee, and thou knowest I neuer durst displease thee willingly, so much I loue thee. All I now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire is, that the vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctednesse
<pb facs="tcp:5883:19"/>
of it make it not more grieuous to thee. But I know thou art a Christian, and therefore will not doubt of thy pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>And though I thus write to thee, as heartily desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be religiously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to die, yet, my deare, I despaire not of life, nay, I hope and dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pray for it, if so God will be pleased.</p>
            <p>Nor shall I thinke this labour lost, though I doe
<pb facs="tcp:5883:20"/>
liue: for I will make it my owne looking-glasse, wherein to see when I am too seuere, when too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, and in my childes fault through this glasse to discerne mine owne er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. And I hope God will so giue me his grace, that I shall more skilfully act than apprehend a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers duty.</p>
            <p>My deare, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est me so well, I shall not need to tell thee, I haue written honest thoughts
<pb facs="tcp:5883:20"/>
in a disordered fashion, not obseruing method. For thou knowest how short I am of learning and naturall endowments to take such a course in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Or if that strong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of thine have hid my weaknesse from thy sight, I now professe seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously my owne ignorance: and though I did not, this following Treatise would bewray it: But I send it onely to the eies of a most louing Husband, and of a

drawing on, which I hope hee hath appointed to giue thee vnto mee: It drew mee into a consideration both wherefore I so earnestly desired thee, and (hauing found that the true cause was to make thee happy) how I might compasse this happinesse for thee.</p>
            <p>I knew it consisted not in honour, wealth, strength of body or friends (though all these are great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings) therefore it had beene a weake request to desire thee onely for an heire to my fortune. No, I neuer aimed at so poore an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:5883:22"/>
for thee, as the whole world: Neither would I haue begged of God so much paine, as I know I must endure, to haue only possest thee with earthly riches, of which to day thou maist bee a great man, tomorrow a poore begger. Nor did an hope to dandle thy infancy moue mee to desire thee. For I know all the delight a Parent can take in a childe is hony mingled with gall.</p>
            <p>But the true reason that I haue so often kneeled to God for thee, is, that thou
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:5883:23"/>
mightest bee an inheritour of the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. To which end I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseech Almightie God thou maiest bend all thy actions, and (if it bee his blessed will) giue thee so plentifull a measure of his grace, that thou maiesty serue him as his Minister, if he make thee a man.</p>
            <p>It is true that this age holds it a most contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble office, fit only for poore mens children, younger brothers, and such as haue no other meanes to liue. But for Gods sake bee not discouraged with these
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:5883:23"/>
vaine speeches; but fortifie your selfe with remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of how great worth the winning of one soule is in Gods sight, and you shall quickly finde how great a place it is to be a Priest vnto the liuing God. If it will please him to moue your heart with his holy Spirit, it will glow and burne with zeale to doe him seruice. The Lord open thy lips, that thy mouth may shew forth his praise.</p>
            <p>If I had skill to write, I would write all I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend of the happy estate of true labouring Ministers:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:5883:24"/>
but I may plainly say that of all men they by their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling are the most truly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; they are familiar with God, they labour in his Vineyard, and they are so beloued of him, that hee giues them abundance of knowledge. Oh bee one of them, let not the scorne of euill men hinderthee. Look how GOD hath prouided for thee sufficient meanes; thou needest not hinder thy study to looke out for liuing, as the Israelites hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred their worke to looke for straw: If thou beest not content with this, thou wilt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:5883:24"/>
not bee with more; GOD deliuer thee from couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
            <p>I desire thee that though thou takest a spirituall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, thou wilt not seeke after the liuings of the Church, nor promotions, though I honour them as I haue great cause, but I would haue thee so truly an humble and zealous Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, that thy onely end should bee to doe God ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, without desire of any thing to thy selfe, saue the Kingdome of Heauen. Yet as I would not haue thee seeke these things, so I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:5883:25"/>
would haue thee as carefull not to neglect Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, but with all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse to receiue what hee bestowes, and to bee a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full steward, distributing it to those that haue need.</p>
            <p>I could not chuse but manifest this desire in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, lest it should please God to depriue mee of time to speake.</p>
            <p>And if thou beest a daughter, thou maist per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps thinke I haue lost my labour; but reade on, and thou shalt see my loue and care of thee and thy saluation is as great, as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:5883:25"/>
if thou wert a sonne, and my feare greater.</p>
            <p>It may peraduenture when thou comest to some discretion, appeare strange to thee to receiue these lines from a Mother that died when thou wert borne, but when thou seest men purchase land, and store vp treasure for their vnborne babes, wonder not at mee that I am carefull for thy saluation, being such an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall portion: and not knowing whether I shall liue to instruct thee when thou art borne, let mee not bee blamed though I write
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:5883:26"/>
to thee before. Who would not condemne mee if I should bee carelesse of thy body while it is within me? Sure a farre greater care belongs to thy soule, to both these cares I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour my selfe so long as I liue.</p>
            <p>Againe, I may perhaps bee wondred at for writing in this kinde, considering there are so many excellent bookes, whose least note is worth all my meditations. I confesse it, and thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse my selfe. I write not to the world, but to mine own childe, who it may be, will

more profit by a few weake instructions comming from a dead mother (who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not euery day praise or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue it as it deserues) than by farre better from much more learned. These things considered, neither the true knowledge of mine owne weaknesse, nor the feare this may come to the worlds eie, and bring scorne vpon my graue, can stay my hand from expressing how much I couet thy salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Therefore, deare childe, reade here my loue, and if God take mee from thee,

               <p>To moue thy heart to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy Creator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, meditate vpon the benefits thou continually receiuest: First, how hee hath created thee when thou wert nothing, redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thee being worse than nought, and now of meere grace he hath giuen thee his holy Spirit, sanctifying

And though I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue there are diuers sorts of pride more pestilent to the soule than this of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, yet this is enough dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and I am sure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traies a mans folly more than any other. Is it not a monstrous thing to see a man, whom God hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated of an excellent forme, each part answering the due proportion of another, should by a fantasticall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit make himselfe so vgly, that one cannot finde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all Gods creatures any thing like him? One man, though not resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling

I desire thee for Gods sake shunne this vanitie, whether thou bee sonne or daughter. If a daughter, I confesse thy taske is harder because thou art weaker, and thy temptations to this vice greater, for thou shalt see those whom perhaps thou wilt thinke lesse able, exalted farre aboue thee in this kinde, and it may bee thou wilt desire to bee like them, if not to out-goe them. But beleeue and remember that I tell thee, the end of all these vanities is bitter as gall.</p>

Oh the remembrance of mis-spent time, when thou shalt grow in yeeres, and haue attained no other knowledge, than to dresse thy selfe. When thou shalt see halfe, perhaps all, thy time spent, and that of all thou hast sowed, thou hast nothing to reape but repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, late repentance, how wilt thou grieue? How wilt thou accuse one folly for bringing in another? and in thy memory cast ouer the cause of each misfortune which hath befallen thee, till passing from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at last thou findest thy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:5883:38"/>
corrupt will to bee the first cause, and then thou wilt with griefe enough per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that if thou hadst ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued God when thou ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedst thy fond desires, thou hadst now had peace of heart. The God of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy giue thee grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him in the dayes of thy youth.</p>
               <p>Mistake me not, nor giue your selfe leaue to take too much liberty with saying, My mother was too strict. No, I am not, for I giue you leaue to follow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest fashions, but not to be a beginner of fashions: nor
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:5883:39"/>
would I haue you follow it till it bee generall; so that in not doing as others doe, you might appeare more singular than wise: but in one word, this is all I desire, that you will not set your heart on such fooleries, and you shall see that this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest carriage will win you reputation and loue with the wise and vertuous sort.</p>
               <p>And once againe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how many houres maist thou giue to God, which if thou spendest in these vanities, thou shalt neuer bee able to make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of. If thou dost but

endeuour to doe well, God will accept the will for the deed, but if thou wilfully spend the morning of thy time in these vanities, God will not bee put off with such reckonings, but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments will follow, such as I pray God thou maist not pull vpon thee.</p>
               <p>Yet alas, this is but one sort of pride, and so farre from being accounted a vice, that, if the time mends not before you come to vnderstanding, you will heare a well drest woman, (for that is the stile of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour) more commended

               <p>But if you will desire praise, follow the example of those religious women, whose vertuous fames time hath not power to raze out: as deuout <hi>Anna,</hi> who ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

               <p>I am so fearefull that thou shouldst fall into this sinne, that I could spend my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time of life in exhorting thee from it.

It is true of pride, that though it bee changed into

that Angell of light, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, yet thou maist know it by selfe-loue; if thou fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest that within thee, be sure pride is not farre off. For humility will make thee seeme vile in thine owne eyes, it will make thee see thine owne faults, and confesse them to bee greater than other mens; so that thou wilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect euery man aboue thy selfe. But the rules of selfe-conceit are iust contrary, they stand on tiptoes, reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their vertues like the proud Pharisie, scorning to be like other men.</p>

But most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially take heed that neither heedlesnesse nor earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in thy discourse, cause
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:5883:47"/>
thee to take Gods holy Name in vaine, but alwaies speake of him with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and vnderstanding.</p>
               <p>Next, let not thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour suffer in thy speech, but bee rather silent than speake ill of any man, though hee deserue it. And that thou maist doe thus, obserue this rule; whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou hearest one ill spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, before thou second it, examine thine owne heart, and it is ods but thou maist finde in thy selfe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the same fault, or a worse than that hee is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for.

not hee that depriued thee of thy hope to try thee, will (if thou beare it well) giue thee as great or a greater blessing than thou hopest for.

the Deuill. What doe they lesse that seeke after Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for lost goods, cure for themselues, their children, or cattell? I hope there are but few of these: but I know where God is once forsaken, man is apt to fall into the depth of sinne. It is grace, meere grace, that preserues Gods children from these dangerous fals, of which grace I beseech Almighty God make vs all partakers.</p>
               <p>And to conclude, how I would haue thee square thine actions, whatsoeuer thou doest, remember that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:5883:54"/>
thou art in the presence of God, (who will expect an account from thee) so thou wilt not dare to doe euill, and thou wilt doe well cheerefully, because thou art sure it pleases the Lord, who fees thy willingnesse, and will not leaue thee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rewarded.</p>
               <p>The vices most reigning in these times I must parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly aduise thee to shun: first, swearing. For Gods sake, let your communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation be yea, yea, and nay, nay, for what is more (saith Christ) commeth of euill. Keepe not company with
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:5883:55"/>
a swearer, lest custome make thee forget how great the sin is, and so by little and little thou maist get thy selfe a habit of it. Reproue it in thy friend, if hee will brooke reproofe: but it is to no end to reproue a scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Rebuke not a scorner lest hee hate thee, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke a wife man, and he will loue thee, <hi>Prou. 9.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Alwayes keepe a watch before thine owne lips, and remember that thou nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest not sweare if thou doest not accustome thy selfe to lie. For if thou vsest to tell truths, thy word
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:5883:55"/>
will bee as currant as thy oath. I hope thy calling (if God hath made thee a man) will bee of authority to reproue this vice in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and not to delight in it thy selfe. If thou beest a Daughter, remember thou art a Maid, and such ought thy modesty to bee, that thou shouldest scarce speak, but when thou answerest: thou art young, speake if need bee, and yet scarcely when thou art twice asked, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 32. 8. Whatsoeuer thou bee, thou hast a calling, which thou must not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour: thou art a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:5883:56"/>
and Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds thou shalt not sweare at all, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 34.</p>
               <p>The next vice too too common in this age is Drunkennesse, which is the high way to hell: a man may trauell in it from sinne to sinne, till the Deuill shew him hee can goe no further, as a Traueller from Inne to Inne, till hee come to his iourneyes end. Oh thinke how filthy is that sinne that makes a man a beast all his life, and a Deuill at his death. <hi>Solomon</hi> askes, To whom is woe? to whom is sorrow? to whom is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:5883:56"/>
strife? to wbom is murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring? to whom are wounds without cause? and to whom is rednesse of the eies? And in the next verse answers, Euen to them that tarry long at the Wine, and to the end of the Chapter, sets forth the miseries occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by this vice, <hi>Prou.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>That thou maist auoid this sinne, be carefull in the choise of thy friends, for it is they that will betray thee to this sinne. Neuer make choice of a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard to thy companion, much lesse thy friend. For our Kingdome hath of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:5883:57"/>
late afforded more exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of those who haue beene slaine by their friends in a drunken quarrell, than those that haue fallen by the enemies sword: and how vnfit is hee to bee a friend, that when thou shalt haue need of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, will haue his head, in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stead of wisdome, fild with wine, and adde rather griefe than comfort to thy neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities? And againe, what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thou shalt trust him with, thou maist bee sure shall be vomited forth, and all thy comfort must bee, He did it vnwillingly, when
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:5883:57"/>
hee knew not what hee did. Thus thou seest to bee a Drunkard, is to bee a man vnfit for Gods seruice, or good mens company. I beseech God giue thee grace to detest it.</p>
               <p>Next, I must exhort thee from a sinne, that I cannot name, thou must search thine owne heart for it. It is thy darling sin, that which to enioy, thou couldst resist all others, at least thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest so. But doe not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour it, search diligently for it in thine owne nature, and when thou hast found it, cast it headlong from thee.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:5883:58"/>
It is thy soules subtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traier, and all thy other sins depend vpon it. There is not so much danger in all the rest that thou contendest with, as in this one, that thou art loth to call a sinne. Thy other sinnes are like a rebellious multitude in a common wealth, which wanting a head, doe little harme. This is their head, cut it off, and thou shalt see all thy other sins dispersed, as an army of fearfull Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, when they heare their great leaders head hath kist the blocke.</p>

               <p>Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day. This duty so often and earnestly commanded by GOD himselfe in the old Testament, so confirmed

to vs in the new, by the Resurrection of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, in memory whereof it is called the Lords day, and perpetually celebrated by the Church, yet in these dayes, as if wee neither had part in the creation, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the world, too many keepe no Sabbath, or at the most but a shadow of a Sabbath.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:5883:61"/>
maid-seruant, nor thy cattle that is within thy gates: For in six dayes the Lord made Heauen and Earth, the Sea, and all that is therein, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the seuenth day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord blessed the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth day and hallowed it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thou wilt bee won to the due obseruation of this day as an obedient seruant, see God commands, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou keepe holy the Sabbath day.</hi> If as a louing and dutifull sonne, see how GOD perswades thee, by equity, grounded vpon his owne bounty to thee: Hee hath giuen thee

six dayes to doe thine owne workes, and hee requires but one of thee. What canst thou say for thy selfe, why thou shouldest not wholly that day giue thy selfe to his seruice? Lastly, if thou wilt learne how to serue him as a good Scholler, he teaches thee an admirable way, both by rule and example. First, by rule, Thou shalt doe no manner of worke in it: then by example, He made the whole world in six dayes, and hee rested the seuenth, wherefore hee bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it.</p>
               <p>Seeing God thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:5883:62"/>
thee by his power, perswades thee in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and teaches thee both by rule, and his owne most gratious example, how canst thou bee so deuoid of grace, nay of reason, as not to obey so iust a Master? so mercifull a Father? so gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious a Teacher? If thou make not a conscience of keeping this day, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a dull security may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse thee to flatter thy selfe, thou indeed makest conscience of nothing. For I am perswaded, if thou canst dispence with thy selfe to prophane this day,

either for thy profit or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, thou wilt not sticke vpon the like occasion to breake all the rest of the Commandements one after another.</p>
               <p>Therefore for Christs sake bee watchfull that the Deuill deceiue you not, nor none of his instruments draw thee away from this dayes duty, Hee is alwaies busie and ready at hand to draw thee away from God, but this day without doubt hee doubles all his forces, hee will prouoke thine eies to sleepe, hee will send hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse and dulnesse to thy
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:5883:63"/>
heart, and perhaps paine to thy body, if he can so much preuaile: any sleight, any tricke to stay thee from Gods house, and from the Congregation of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hee will surely vse, nay hee will sometimes doe it with religious pretences, as to pray at home, reade a Sermon, study the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to spend the time in such Christian exercises, as are infinitely good at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times. But I once heard a religious Preacher affirme (and I beleeued him) that those who had ability of body to goe to
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:5883:63"/>
Church, and yet out of any euill disposition (for good it can hardly bee) absented themselues, though they prayed, they were not heard.</p>
               <p>It behoues thee by how much greater his practises are against thee that day, so much the more to fortifie thy selfe against him: at no hand let him stay thee from the Church, there GOD hath promised to bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and there hee is. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest thou then, silly wretch, absent thy selfe from him? I know, thou darest not. Goe then with a heart pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:5883:64"/>
to pray by prayer, and going meditate on Gods great mercies in the creation of the world, his greater mercy in redeeming it, and mingle with thy meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prayers, that may apply these great blessings to thy selfe.</p>
               <p>So approach and enter, with reuerent and feruent zeale, the house of GOD, and throwing away all thoughts, but such as may further the good worke thou art about, bend thy knees and heart to God, desiring of him his holy Spirit, that thou maist ioine
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:5883:64"/>
with the Congregation in zealous prayer, and earnest attention to his word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. And though perhaps thou hearest a Minister preach, as thou thinkest, weakly, yet giue him thine attention, and thou shalt finde that hee will deliuer something profitable to thy soule, either that thou hast not heard before, or not marked, or forgotten, or not well put in practise. And it is fit thou shouldest bee often put in minde of those things concerning thy saluation.</p>
               <p>Thus if thou spend thy
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:5883:65"/>
time at Church, thou wilt bee ready to giue thy selfe to meditate of the holy Word thou hast heard, without which truly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring profiteth little. For it is with the soule as with the body, though meat bee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so wholsome, and the appetite neuer so great, yet if any ill disposition in the stomacke hinder digestion, it turnes not to nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but rather proues more dangerous. So the Word if after hearing it bee not digested by meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is not nourishing to the soule. Therefore let the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:5883:65"/>
time thou hast to bee absent from Church, bee spent in praising God, praying to God, and applying to thy selfe what thou hast heard. If thou hast heard a sinne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued that thou art guilty of, take it for a warning, doe it no more. If thou hearest of a good action which thou hast ouerslipt, striue to recouer time, and resolue to put it in act. Thus by practising what thou hearest, thou shalt binde it to thy memory, and by making it thine owne, make thy selfe most happy.</p>
               <p>Learne of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> the true
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:5883:66"/>
obseruation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: If thou turne away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy will on my holy day, and call the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath a delight to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate it as glorious to the Lord, and shalt honour him, not doing thy owne wayes, nor seeking thine owne will, nor speaking a vaine word: Then shalt thou delight in the Lord, and I will cause thee to mount vpon the high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of <hi>Iacob</hi> thy father, for the mouth of the Lord hath
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:5883:66"/>
spoken it, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 58.13.</p>
               <p>It is a wonder to see how often God hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this one Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and yet how slacke we are to keepe it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. from the 12. verse, is all commanding this: againe in the 34.21. and diuers places more.</p>
               <p>Learne then to prepare thy heart early for this day, which if thou obseruest well, God will blesse thee and thy labours all the weeke. Thus farre I haue endeuoured to exhort thee to thy duty towards God.</p>

               <p>Of which the honour due to thy Parents is such a part as cannot bee separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for God commands it, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother,</hi> it is the first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the second table, as, <hi>Thou shal haue none other Gods but mee,</hi> is of the first: Idolatry being the greatest sin against God, and disobedience to parents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ring-leader in sinnes against man, wee are first warned of them, as if in case we should fall into them, it were too late to auoid the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:5883:67"/>
other. For if wee once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in heart Idolaters, it will be no hard matter to be a bower down to an Image, to abuse Gods holy Name, and to prophane his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: So if wee dare diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey good Parents, at that breach, theft, murther, adultery, falsenesse, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse easily enter.</p>
               <p>Nay, I dare say, if thou breakest either of these Commandements, thou breakest all of the first and second Table: for as thou canst not bee idolatrous without breaking all the rest, so thou canst not bee
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:5883:68"/>
a disobedient childe, but thou art a murderer, a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one: first of nature in thy selfe, which if thy wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked purposes doe not smother, will of her selfe breake forth into that duty. For an example, the story of <hi>AEneas</hi> Ihewes how much it was obserued by them that receiued not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement from Gods owne mouth, as did the Iewes, yet he exposed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to all dangers rather than hee would forsake his father. Secondly, thou art a murtherer of thy father, who hauing stored vp all
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:5883:68"/>
his ioy in thee, hath by thy disobedience his gray head brought with sorrow to the graue; which God forbid.</p>
               <p>And what difference, shall I say, is there betweene a disobedient childe, and an adulterer? the one forsakes her, by whom he giueth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto others; the other despiseth those from whom hee had his owne being. Truly this is a fearefull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, and sinne is a crafty strumpet, she will allure thee and delude thee.</p>
               <p>Againe, in being disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient thou art a theefe, an
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:5883:69"/>
impudent theefe, for thou doest not onely secretly steale, but openly detaine the honour, reuerence and obedient duty, which all the world can witnesse is thy fathers.</p>
               <p>And how wilt thou a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid being a false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse? will not one sinne draw on another? Wilt not thou bee ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse thy vnnaturall obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, by throwing calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious aspersions on thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, giuing thy tongue leaue to lie against thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science?</p>
               <p>And lastly (Oh horrible)
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:5883:69"/>
how easie a step is it to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uet what thou thinkest thy parents life too long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines from thee?</p>
               <p>Thus thou seeft in being disobedient thou breakest six Commandements, from which outrage, I beseech Almighty GOD preserue thee, and giue thee grace to bee obedient to him, and to thy parents. I am sure thou hast a father, who will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer command thee any thing contrary to the Commandements of God. Therefore I haue no need to speake to thee, how farre a father ought to bee obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:5883:70"/>

sinkes ere hee thinkes of it; so fares it with a negligent Christian. Thirdly, hee may pawne it, like a foolish vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift, who pawnes that which should keepe him all his life, to purchase a gay toy, which shall serue him a day or two: so doth hee that pawnes that rich iewell his soule, to the griping vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the Deuill, for pleasure; haply hee meanes one day to redeeme it, but runnes on his selfe-pleasing course till the vse hath deuoured the principall, and his vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Creditor hales him to a dungeon, where he has time

gets nothing (no not in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) but torment, fretting and vexation: he is not the fatter for his meat, nor doth hee rest though hee sleepe, yet he for whom, or against whom hee thus toiles his spirit, haply eats, sleepes, and laughes at his enuiers folly, or peraduenture pitties him.</p>
               <p>The more easily to auoid this sinne, consider well the disprofits of it. Reade in the first Epistle of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. Chap. 14. and 15. Verses, and in the 4. chap. the 8. and the 20. verses: reade the 13. of the first to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>; there Saint <hi>Paul</hi> shewes
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:5883:74"/>
that without charitie euen spirituall graces are of no worth. As the want of it brings infinite miserie, so the posession infinite ioy. By Charitie wee performe our Sauiour Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, who often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires this of vs, as if hee should say, I haue satisfied my father for all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements that you haue broke. Now your taske is easie, I leaue you nothing to doe, but to loue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; doe this and you doe all. By it we fulfill the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8. and 10. verses. By it wee abide in the light, 1 <hi>Iob.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:5883:74"/>
Is it possible, when these are well weighed, that any man should bee so mad to beare an vncharitable heart about him, or so foole hardy to harbour a spleene that shall hazard his saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Can wee be so cruell to our selues, as to deny Christ one commandement? For all his loue to vs, he requires but this testimony of our loue to him, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not choose but performe if we doe loue him. Therefore take heed if thou feele any malice towards thy brother, bee sure thy heart is not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right toward God. So root
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:5883:75"/>
it out from thy heart, that no sting of it bee left, for it will grow faster than <hi>Ionahs</hi> Gourd.</p>
               <p>Answer mee not with Flesh and bloud cannot doe this: I know it. But if thou desire God to giue thee his holy Spirit, thou shalt bee strong to suffer, and ready to forgiue. Thou must not in any thing bee subiect to the flesh, for the wisdome of the flesh is death. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes make thy spirit thy guide, for there is life and peace.</p>
               <p>The deuill would desire no greater aduantage than
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:5883:75"/>
that thou wouldst trust thy soule to the discretion of thy corrupt flesh, he would soone inueigle that to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray thee. But when thou hast put thy selfe vnder the spirit, submitting thy will to the will of God, he is no more able to hurt thee.</p>
               <p>The next excuse I would take from thee, is a very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish one, but so common, that I feare you may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen on it, and that is this; If I should suffer wrongs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, what will become of my reputation? what will the world say? Truly if you remember, Christ hath suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:5883:76"/>
more for you, than it is possible for you to suffer: yet hee neuer reuiled any of his enemies, nor strake his persecutors, but prayed for them. And his example teaches all that loue him to doe the like. He wils you to turne the left cheeke to him that smote the right, to giue to him that takes from you, and to goe with him that compels you.</p>
               <p>But these are strange rules for a generous spirit in these times, nay sure if I be strucke I must strike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, else I am a coward. Indeed as for giuing, if it
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:5883:76"/>
were to one that would desire it at my hands, I had rather giue a fragment of my right than goe to law, but if hee will not sue to mee, Ile spend all I am worth ere I yeeld: Or I would goe out of my doore to shew a man his way, but I would faine see who could compell mee. I ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this is of the right straine; but now looke with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate eye vpon this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the world, and the former Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ, and thou shalt finde them iust oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:5883:77"/>
Therefore take heed, and let it bee thy chiefe care ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to prize thy reputation with men equall to the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of thine owne soule. But if thou desirest to keepe thy credit vnblemished, serue God with an vpright heart, and doe nothing to any man, that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest not bee content hee should doe vnto thee. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen thy hand to the poore according to thy abilitie, meddle not with other mens occasions, but where thou maist doe good, and hast a calling to it. And if it bee in thy power to hurt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:5883:77"/>
thine enemy, let it passe, doe him good if thou canst, and boast not of it: he that sees thee in priuate, will openly reward thee.</p>
               <p>Lastly, let thy heart bee kept alwayes in awe of this want of charity, by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall remembring that thou hast of thy Sauiour no other forme of praier to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire forgiuenesse for thy selfe, than that wherein thou couenantest to forgiue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. All the other petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wee present vnto God absolutely: onely this is conditionall, hee forgiue vs as wee forgiue others. Our
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:5883:78"/>
Sauiour hath taught vs no other way to desire it, and in the 18. of <hi>Matthew</hi> hee shewes God will no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise grant it.</p>
